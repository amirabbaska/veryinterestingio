		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is pretty much impossible to melt wood. The reason is that as you start heading the wood up, its constituent building blocks tend to break up before the material can melt. This behavior is due to the fact that wood is made up of a strong network of cellulose fibers connected by a lignin mesh. You would need to add <em>a lot</em> of energy to allow the cellulose fibers to be able to easily slide past each other in order to create a molten state. On the other hand, there are plenty of other reactions that can kick in first as you transfer heat to the material.</p>
<p>If you have oxygen around you one key reactions is of course combustion. But even in the absence of oxygen there are plenty of reactions that will break up the material at the molecular level. The umbrella term for all of these messy reactions driven by heat is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis" target="_blank">pyrolysis.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Charcoal is usually produced by slow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis" target="_blank">pyrolysis</a> — the heating of wood or other substances in the absence of oxygen&quot;</p>
<p>Water and other volatile organic compounds (such as methanol) are basically boiled off and what remains is a large lump of carbon- a.k.a charcoal.</p>
<p>Can you melt carbon? No- not at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon#Characteristics" target="_blank">atmospheric pressure</a></p>
<p>&quot;At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2 MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330 °C or 7,820 °F), so it sublimes at about 3,900 K.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The ones I use at work now is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>optical. (Think LED in one end of chamber and a photo-resistor in the other end. Mesures the amount of light that get through.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>double optical and thermal. (Uses two different angels on the chamber for the optical part to guesstimate the difference in smoke and steam based on different reflections.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optical / thermal / gas. (Reads Co2. Works like a champ in theaters, clubs etc. that uses theatrical smoke on stage.)</p>
</li>
<li>only thermal. (Works on the principle of fire is hot. Heat rises and sets of the detector at a set temperature or if the temperature is rising very fast.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Double optical is very good at separating steam and smoke. (Use it in kitchens and locker rooms close too the showers. No problem with false alarms.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The smoke detector works by having a small tube open to the air. At one end of the tube is a radioactive material, at the other is a radiation detector. Smoke gets into the tube and absorbs the radiation, causing the alarm to go off. Steam can certainly do the same thing, but it may be less effective as the steam could absorb less radiation or condense before entering the tube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear warheads fitted to ICBM's and SLBM's are not really warheads in the same sense as an artillery round. They are in fact a small and complex machine fitted inside a heat resistant and aerodynamic shell. It might be easier to think of them as miniature spacecraft. One nuclear missile will carry several warheads and they will seperate to attack different targets or the same target multiple times. These are called MIRV or Multiple Independent Re-Entry Vehicle.</p>
<p>Because they are basically machines, they are designed to be taken apart and maintained. The pit or the nuclear element of the warhead is just one component. It can be removed and in fact very often is removed from the warhead for things like testing (Where it is replaced by an inert device) and routine maintenance.</p>
<p>The decommissioning process varies depending on the terms of the treaty. In some cases it is simply a case of reducing the number of MIRV's the missile carries say from 12 to 8. If physical removal is required it is a case of removing the nuclear element of the warhead and putting it into storage or use as a fuel, while recycling or destroying the components of the MIRV. The missiles themselves are rarely destroyed in entirety, they or their components often have useful secondary peaceful applications.</p>
<p>There are a number of common misconceptions about ICBM's, SLBM's and nuclear warheads and their MIRV delivery system. One is that their guidance components use GPS to guide them into their targets. This is in fact not true. These missiles must reach their target and relying on GPS might harm their chances of that happening if the GPS system where to be attacked. So the majority of ICBM/SLBM use celestial navigation (The positions of the stars) to guide them into their targets. They don't have to be super accurate. A circular error of probability of half a mile is acceptable. Russian missiles used to have massive payloads to make up for their less accurate guidance systems. It really doesn't matter if your off target by 3 miles if you ramp up the explosive power by 10 megatons! For this reason you will often see US missiles use smaller warheads than their russian counterparts.</p>
<p>Another common misconception is that the warheads have some communication component that offers an ability to communicate with it after launch and give a recall or cancellation ability, so if a missile is fired in some sort of accidental launch scenario it can be communicated with and made inert or to blow itself up without going nuclear. This is also not true and is a myth perpetrated by Hollywood. The risks of an enemy finding out how to communicate with the missile and destroy it would be too great. These weapons are designed to be the ultimate and last deterrent. The missile, once fired, communicates with nothing and no-one. It is a self contained system that once the button has been pressed, will carry out it's mission to it's final horrifying end unless it is somehow intercepted externally.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: Clarified decommissioning process and celestial navigation and the fact I may not have mentioned inertial guidance clearly enough. To clarify the correct term is astro-inertial guidance in that the &quot;majority&quot; of ICBM's and SLBM's (Lest we not forget the US developed versions are not the only types of these horrific weapons) use both, with inertial guidance being responsible for initial and re-entry guidance and celestial for mid course correction. </p>
<p>So celestial navigation is the tracking of your position by looking at where you are in relation to the stars, because where you are and the time of day defines what you can see and where they should be in the night sky. It's not an overly complex skill and we have been doing it for a very long time. It's kind of fallen out of use in these days of GPS. Ships at sea would use a sextant to help them plot their position relative to the time of the day and the position of the stars which was why getting accurate clocks on board ships was such a big deal many years ago. In fact the earliest Boeing 747 aircraft had a porthole in their cockpit roofs to allow the crew to use celestial navigation should the need arise!</p>
<p>Obviously celestial navigation is of more use at night and in good weather if your on the ground, but ICBM's and SLBM's don't need to worry about this as within the space of about 30 seconds they are high enough to begin using it without either of these concerns as they use inertial guidance in their initial launch. The missile and MIRV's basically have a digital version of a sextant on board. If you would like to see a vaguely similar approximation of how they work, I suggest you download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Sky app (Formerly Google Sky)</a>, which allows you to use your phone to plot the stars in the sky (Though Google augments this with GPS data so they cheat a little bit).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are really two issues here. One is the dismantling — taking things apart. The other is verification — proving to the other party or parties that you did really take things apart, and aren't just lying about it. The latter is just as important for treaties as the former.</p>
<p>As for taking them apart, it is neither as easy nor as hard as one might imagine. Nuclear warheads, and nuclear missiles, and nuclear silos, are all just complex machines. They have many parts. They were not built with the intention of making it easy to take them apart (it isn't just a matter of using a screwdriver), but you can take them apart. Nuclear warheads are disassembled in &quot;<a href="http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gravel-gertie.jpg" target="_blank">gravel gertie</a>&quot; containment bays that make it so that if something goes seriously wrong — e.g., their high explosives detonate — contamination will be limited (gravel will collapse onto it, holding in any scattered plutonium, etc.). The missiles themselves can be de-fueled and then disassembled in pieces. It isn't significantly different than deconstructing any other device that contains some dangerous or toxic parts. The warhead is probably the most difficult thing to take apart because it contains toxic, radioactive, and volatile (explosive) components, but they develop procedures for doing it and have been doing it for years.</p>
<p>OK, so how do you verify that you've done it? Most treaties focus only on the disassembly of delivery vehicles, e.g., the planes, missiles, or submarines. Proving you took those apart is relatively straightforward: they are large enough to be seen by satellites so you can just destroy the thing in question in a relatively &quot;public way.&quot; For airplanes this is particularly striking: the <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01583/planes-big_1583925a.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;boneyards&quot;</a> of retired planes, which are just rusting outside, some of which have been &quot;guillotined&quot; with massive blades. Submarines can be taken apart in dry dock, silos can be decommissioned and destroyed, etc. Each &quot;side&quot; has people whose job it is to count up such activities, and so you can get a pretty good tally of what each side has or hasn't. In a world of ubiquitous satellite coverage, you just don't have states being able to field large numbers of ICBMs or even submarines without it being noticed.</p>
<p>None of the treaties currently limit the number of total warheads in a stockpile (they limit the number of <em>deployed</em> warheads which is more a question of delivery vehicles than actual warheads). The question of &quot;counting warheads&quot; actually presents really tricky technical aspects that have been recognized for some time. The US and Russia are not willing to share information on how their warheads work with one another. If they were, it would just be a matter of disassembling the warhead while someone else watched. Because they want to keep it secret, all sorts of counting problems are involved. Let's say I am monitoring Russian warhead dismantlement. They show me a box and say, &quot;there's a warhead in there.&quot; They take it inside their dismantlement facility, then say they took it apart. They might show me another set of boxes and say, &quot;here are the parts from that warhead.&quot; How do I know that any of that is true? How do I know the box isn't just filled with lead? How do I know they haven't just squirreled the warhead out the back of the facility? </p>
<p>There aren't easy answers here. There are some interesting technical approaches to being able to verify that the box contains a warhead without learning anything about the warhead's design. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-virtues-of-nuclear-ignorance" target="_blank">You can read about some of them here if you are interested in more details</a>, but they are essentially similar to creating a &quot;one-way hash&quot; of a 3D, physical object, e.g., something that lets you verify it is &quot;X&quot; without being able to see what the &quot;X&quot; actually is on the inside. </p>
<p>It is not clear we will ever have treaties that put firm limits on warhead counts, it is not clear it is even necessary (if you can't deliver the warhead, who cares?), but the work is being done under the assumption that maybe, someday, there will be political will to do such a thing, and if that day comes, it would be nice to have worked out all of the technical aspects ahead of time, so they don't become a stumbling block.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplifying what others have said;</p>
<p>1) remove component warhead parts and break down further. The radioactive material is often reprocessed into the nuclear power industry.</p>
<p>2) remove fuel component from missile. Liquid fuelled missiles are typically only fuelled just prior to launch. Solid fuel missiles are a little more complicated. Rocket fuel can be rather toxic depending upon the type.</p>
<p>3) missile body is then often cut up and left exposed to satellite observation, or observers from the opposite side of the treaty are there watching the destruction processes. Sometimes both.</p>
<p>4) the silos/ mobile launchers can also be destroyed depending upon the treaty. Observers &amp; satellites monitor this.</p>
<p>When Kazakhstan became nuclear free the US and Russians were present on the ground. The warheads went back to Russia and monitored into the nuclear fuel industry. The silos were systemically destroyed, with additional work undertaken every ~6 months. I have photos of several of the Kazak silos going through phased destruction back in the mid to late '90's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The one thing that was not really designed to be fixed is the &quot;pit&quot; made of dangerously radioactive material and high explosive sometimes literally glued to the pit.  You can use cold to make the explosive brittle and crack it off or use solvents to dissolve it over time.  Once you have the pit, you can recycle it to other nuclear devices or mix it with lower quality material and use it in nuclear reactors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Making it very short, they're handled in two ways:</p>
<p>First, the warheads are removed and stored at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. Specifically, in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/35°02'25.0%22N+106°36'33.0%22W/@35.0105695,-106.5507132,955m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d35.040278!4d-106.609167?hl=en" target="_blank">this massive bunker.</a> Fun fact: they're not really dismantled for the most part, they just sit in cold storage under observation.</p>
<p>Next, the delivery system (missile, bomb, cruise missile, airplane, etc.) are destroyed in a way that makes them impossible to reuse. Airplanes get cut in half — like <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PBDjAe3b57P2" target="_blank">these ones</a>, in Arizona. Missile launch positions get blown up or filled with concrete.</p>
<p>Finally, the warheads are trucked to Texas. Disassembly occurs in a plant there. Once the batteries are disconnected, a nuclear weapon is basically impossible to set off, and becomes much easier to disassemble. The conventional explosives are separated from the nuclear components. Most of the parts are simply stored separately, as they're specialized enough to be incredibly useful to say, a rogue state looking for more information on how to construct a weapon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a rule of thumb, if it bleeds, then it can heal to some degree. Also, tissues in the body generally heal using the same four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hemostasis. It is bleeding and the body sends stuff to stop the bleeding.</li>
<li>Inflammation. The body is in alert mode and sends stuff to the injury that will stop infection, clean up junk in the injured area, and generally kickstart the healing process. Without this stage, healing doesn't happen, so in the short term inflammation is a good thing.</li>
<li>Proliferation. Basically the stage when the body lays down the raw materials for the injured area to heal. Lots of collagen gets layed down here. If you snip a rubber band partially and keep pulling on it, it will continue to tear. If you somehow connect the torn edges, the tearing stops because the force on the uninjured tissue is reduced. Similar to what is going on here. </li>
<li>Maturation. This is the fine tuning stage. Cells that don't need to be there anymore go away or die. The collagen gets stronger by getting aligned with the lines of tension. </li>
</ol>
<p>Bones heal as strong as they were before the injury because your body lays down new bone. However, it can take a long time for bones to get back to full strength because of the structure of the newly laid bone. Your body is always breaking down bone and building it up to some extent, so it takes time for it to remodel into the strongest structure. Remember though, if it doesn't bleed it usually doesn't heal well, so there are some commonly fractured bones that don't heal well and often require surgical intervention.</p>
<p>Ligaments usually don't have good blood supply, so they don't heal particularly well.</p>
<p>Muscle has very good blood supply, so it bleeds when injured (this is why you often see bruising after significant strains). However, your body doesn't lay down new muscle tissue where the injury occurred. Instead, it lays down collagen in a fairly unorganized way. So at first during healing, the healing tissue is still very weak. As time passes, the new collagen changes into a more organized structure that aligns better with the line of pull of the muscle. When it is aligned better, it is stronger. Previously injured muscle won't be as strong as uninjured muscle (all other factors being kept the same)</p>
<p>Tendon is similar to muscle, except a bit less blood supply. All of the same mechanisms of healing apply still. Injured tendon will also not be able to take as much load as uninjured tendon (all other factors being kept the same)</p>
<p>Skin follows the rules as well. Generally it won't be as strong as before either. </p>
<p>Now, when we talk about &quot;strength&quot; I'm not talking about how much weight it can move. I am talking about how much load it can take. Muscles, tendons, and ligaments generally are injured through high tensile loading (like pulling a rubber band apart). So when I say they aren't as strong as before I mean they can't be pulled on as hard as before or they will reinjure. It is still possible for someone with an injured muscle or tendon to physically be able to move more weight than before their injury because they can continue to train the healthy tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The answer above goes into detail and research has shown that 75% is about as good as it gets after soft tissue injury. So, for all of you who have been in a motor vehicle accident and didn't do therapy afterwards, the soft tissue strength can be as low as 50% of its original value. Once it's injured, it is far more likely to be reinjured in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>So there are two different principles at work here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When you use a muscle or a bone you are using actin-myosin proteins which help with the strength of a muscle contraction. When you use them however you &quot;break them&quot; and your body recruits builds new ones. It will build them such that they won't &quot;break&quot; under the same amount of force the next time you use them. That's what is meant by &quot;tearing/breaking&quot; your muscles during usage. There is no actual tissue tearing.</p>
</li>
<li>When you have tissue damage in skeletal muscle and connective tissue there is actual tissue damage. Skeletal muscle are actually cells so I'll talk about them (since connective tissue isn't actually majorly comprised of cells). Skeletal muscle is known as a &quot;permanent&quot; tissue, so it can't regenerate, i.e the cells cant replacement themselves back to their normal levels. Instead your body &quot;repairs&quot; them by putting in new fibrous scar tissue. Which isn't as strong as the old muscle and doesn't have the same contraction ability.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps, I know this is ELI5 and this is the best I could do without going into more detail. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we put this all into the context of pathological damage, muscle tearing (aka muscle strains), are actually detrimental to muscle function over time. Whereas bone breaks are repaired using the same materials they are originally made of (the organization of mineral deposits, calcium, phosphorus ect.), they get stronger due to the bone callus that forms over a typical fracture. When we injure muscle, tendon, or ligament, you are repairing that damaged tissue with a lesser material, scar tissue. Scar tissue is weaker than the tissues it is meant to repair, because of their different organization of tensile fibers. A muscle full of scar tissue has reduced function, whereas resistance training does not cause scar tissue accumulation, to a similar degree as muscle strains. Same rule applies to tendons and ligaments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of cynical answers here about decorative gardens bring a status symbol/ people confirming to the standards of society. However, I think the answer is much simpler than that: people like flowers and decorative plants. I like looking at the front of my home and thinking, &quot;Wow, this looks just like I always imagined it.&quot; I don't think of how others will view the house -- I'm just glad that the work I put into the garden paid off for me.</p>
<p>Also, vegetables are readily available at the store. You can save a little money by planting your item vegetables, but what if you still want flowers? Potted flowers are harder to take care of (in my opinion, at least), and if you don't like the look of them in a pot you're out of luck. </p>
<p>People are entitled to do to their yards what will make them happy. We don't have to conform to the most efficient standard, and doing what's economically a little beneficial does not mean you're doing what's most mentally beneficial. If you want to plant a vegetable garden in your front lawn, you're free to do so (so long as you're not breaking any laws). Other people do not have to justify to you their difference of opinion on how they should utilize their yard.</p>
<p>Edit: I definitely misread the question as having an angrier tone than it really does. I apologize for the angry tone of my response to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There vast majority have their fruit/veggies in the backyard, though some in my neighborhood have a couple veggies up front.

You have to have some protection from squirrels, rabbits and raccoons here or they'll destroy. </p>
<p>Most people have a water spigot in the back, not necessarily the front.</p>
<p>Old people in my neighborhood have been known to steal a couple flowers out of people's front yard, I'd assume they could sneak a couple tomatoes if you had it out front.</p>
<p>Most houses have more open land in the back as opposed to the front as utilities come in from the street. Don't want to put your garden down where the gas line comes in.</p>

<p>We grow tomatoes and peppers and use them in salsas and things. It doesn't really save us that much money, we do it because we enjoy it. But it does attract rabbits and groundhogs, as well as insects.

I read the majority of the comments, &amp; will continue to read more tonight. Someone in the comments posted <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/rainwater-harvesting.aspx" target="_blank">this US gov't page</a> that points out state-specific rainwater harvesting laws if anyone wants to read if their state has one. Majority of them seem to be very vague, which tells me it's likely city-to-city specific as well (thanks for the link btw!).
From reading the comments, it seems that Colorado has the strictest laws regarding rainwater harvesting per resident in the US. I asked this question because I was thinking of putting a rainwater barrel out in the future and also wondered why rainwater can be owned by any one entity. I'm honestly shocked that there are that many laws governing water access, but I guess it does make sense in this day &amp; age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here in Colorado, every drop of water that falls from the sky or melts into a creek is ultimately owned by someone. It is also not that long since the last drought, when we were not allowed to water yards or wash cars at home, so a lot of people here are water-aware by default. </p>
<p>I own a house in a rural subdivision that gets its water from a creek, based on a water rights contract from the 70s, but the state is threatening to shut off every well in the subdivision if we don't mitigate evaporation and run-off. </p>
<p>They're not joking, water rights agreement be damned. The association has already gone deep into debt to pay for earth movers to come out and convert our lake into a wetlands with no standing water, and we're still not in the clear. The other option is to own a house with no source of water, so what can we do besides comply with the demands of the state?</p>
<p>The state is also actively using satellite data and planes to survey the state, looking for unauthorized ponds and other water collection, and forcing people to drain ponds that have existed for decades, because the water in those unauthorized ponds is &quot;owned&quot; by someone else. </p>
<p>So yeah, water is serious business here in Colorado, but I think we did recently get permission for each house in the state to be allowed to collect one barrel of rainwater per year, so that's something, I guess.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of ditch water from Cottonwood Creek being carried over a stream from Cottonwood Creek that I saw last week. I thought it was a pretty good example of how we really care about our water rights in Colorado, to the point where we won't allow stream water and ditch water to mix once they have been split off, even though it all comes from the same creek. </p>

<p>I've also been told by the same teacher that nucleons are much heavier than the quarks which make them up, and this mass is energy that comes from the strong force. This seems like the same scenario as the previous one... But why does the mass increase here? </p>

<p>It doesn't make sense to try to &quot;locate&quot; the binding energy. It is a property of the whole nucleus.</p>
<hr />
<p>Typically bound states (like atoms, nuclei, planetary systems, ...) have lower energies than the individual components together. If they have more energy, the components can just fly apart, and if that is possible it will happen eventually.</p>
<p>Hadrons (like protons and neutrons) are special. Their quarks cannot just fly apart, because that would lead to isolated quarks, something that doesn't exist in nature. If you still try to separate them, you have to put in so much energy that you create new particles in the process - and then the particles have more energy than the particle you started with. In that aspect the situation is still similar to other bound states: To split the system you have to put in energy.</p>
<p>Why is the neutron and proton mass so large compared to the quark masses? This is a more complicated question. Protons and neutrons are very complex objects. Describing them via their valence quarks (two up one down or two down one up, respectively) only is not very accurate, most of what makes up these particles comes from the strong interaction itself. The proton and neutron mass doesn't depend strongly on the quark masses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the reason why the mass of 6 free protons and 6 free neutrons is larger than that of a carbon-12 atom is indeed due to binding energy. In order for a stable bound state to occur, the bound state must have a lower evergy to that of the un-bound state, otherwise the constituent particles will prefer to wander off. The difference in those energies is called the binding energy, and it has to come from somewhere. Due to mass-energy equivalence this somewhere is the mass of the constituent particles. This is true for all bound states, including the atom. </p>
<p>Inside a proton things are wildly different, as seen by the fact that the total mass of the three quarks which makes the proton only amounts to about 1% of the total mass of the proton. The rest comes from the gluon field, the field associated with the strong force. The mass of the proton is the invariant mass of the system of quarks and gluons that makes it, that includes the mass of the quarks and their kinetic energies but more importantly the energy of the gluon field that binds them together, which is certaintly the largest contributor due to the immense strength of the strong force. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could go pretty far down a quantum rabbit hole answering this question, but I'll give you the short version: most of the energy of a nucleon is in the strong force's equivalent of light waves. If you're adopting a particle view of the nucleon, you'd think of this as the kinetic energy of the quarks and gluons. Or in a wave model, you'd think of it as the vibrational energy of the waves. Hopefully it makes sense that if you want to get a particle moving or a wave vibrating, you need to put in some positive amount of energy to do that; well, in a nucleon, it's as if that has already been done and the energy is already in there, so that amount of energy contributes to the nucleon's mass.</p>
<p>Binding energy is something entirely different. It doesn't come from motion, it comes from position, so the classical analogue would be <em>potential</em> energy. Imagine you have two rocks far apart and you want to get them close together (but keeping all else equal, i.e. still not moving). You'd actually need to <em>remove</em> some energy to do that - we call this adding a <em>negative</em> amount of energy - because otherwise when they get close they'd be going really fast. That negative amount of energy is the binding energy. It's not associated with either of the two rocks specifically, it's associated with the interaction between them. And it's the same way with nucleons. When they get close together, unless they're flying past each other at high speed, the interactions between them have some negative amount of energy, which is the binding energy. It's not associated with one nucleon or the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because I haven't yet seen the following stated, I feel like I need to add:</p>
<p>If you consider a system of two separated quarks (this system is not dynamically stable, but you can theoretically consider this configuration), and you weighed the <em>total</em> system, it would weigh more than the bound state of the same two quarks. There will be a huge amount of energy in the configuration, which would also consist of a huge flux of the quantum chromodynamical force in a tube connecting them, which would contribute to a large mass-energy. So the situation is not really that different from the EM case. (In fact, this explains confinement - the energy in this tube is so large that you can create more quarks out of the vacuum to screen the strong charge and create bound states.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Why only limited locations? Because they literally can only do that or nothing, they can't release the product more broadly because their supply chain for large production is MASSIVE and <em>SLOW</em>.</p>
<p>Like, I don't think you have an idea of how massively complicated it is for McDonalds to release a new product. I recall an anecdote from one of McD's corporate chefs (the people designing new products and evaluating the existing menu) about how they forewent introducing blueberry milkshakes at one point because releasing that to McDonalds'es throughout America would have required them to buy up <em>80% of all blueberries produced in North America that year</em>. The amount of work and preparation that goes into making a new McDonalds product to release world-wide or just in North America is <em>INSANE</em>.</p>
<p>Remember, the original sauce was a marketing tie-in with a major Disney animated movie, they are not going to do anything close to that for a meme spawned from some random cartoon. But, the people aware of that meme, are also people likely to hear about a limited, smaller scale marketing stunt, meaning McDonalds can get a pretty big chunk of positive marketing with the nerd crowd from the small investment of one of the chefs in the R&amp;D lab cooking up a batch of Szechuan sauce and that being distributed to a couple of locations and notable personages. In fact the exclusivity only makes this kind of marketing even more effective.</p>
<p>So, tl;dr :They got <em>some</em> positive marketing from it without needing to turn their big, expensive supply chain to produce what would likely be a fad product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I actually live about 5 minutes from one of the participating locations. The event was supposed to begin at 2pm, so me and my friends headed over around 1:30 knowing there would be lines and stuff. We get there and find out they basically gave tickets to the first 17 customers at time of opening for the SEVENTEEN PACKETS OF SAUCE they were shipped. This is a major location on a busy road in a decent-sized city.</p>
<p>I don't care too much cuz I was really there for the novelty of the whole thing, but I start to feel bad. People are showing up in R&amp;M tshirts. People are showing up cosplaying Rick. We find out early what's going on but the giant line has no idea.</p>
<p>We're starving so we get some of the buttermilk tenders anyway. We're there...and hungry...and we waited in line for 20 minutes, and I assume that was the strategy. You have a metric fuckton of people who showed up for a special event and are gonna be disappointed, but a lot of them will spend some money anyway after they chew your staff out. You didn't spend a ton of money on the ingredients and machinery needed to manufacture enough szechuan sauce for everyone to be happy.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is McDonald's is a shitty corporation. They essentially faked a special event to make quick, easy cash at the expense of their employees, who I heard getting yelled at by a bunch of angry nerds the whole time I waited for my food.</p>
<p>Edit: by the way, the buttermilk tenders were awful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Practice. It doesn't happen naturally. As others have said, it takes a lot of practice to even throw a specific weapon a specific distance. Practice long enough at different distances and you can learn to be reasonably effective. In an actual combat situation a thrown weapon is either an act of desperation or distraction.</p>
<p>A few suggestions for those idiots that are going to try this at home without expert supervision:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't. If you want to learn then find an expert willing to teach you. Renaissance Faires or historical reenactments are good places to look for a tutor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you aren't going to listen to the above advice then for the love of Thor make sure that no one else is at risk. People behind the target aren't safe, people next to the target aren't safe and people next to you aren't safe. Seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weapons bounce back. Some will land blade first and you'll feel awesome, some will partially land blade first but will bounce off, most will land in an awkward mess handle first, but then occasionally it will hit this perfect polar opposite of a sweet spot at the edge of the bottom of the handle which will cause it to bounce back at your face. When you are learning this happens often enough to be a very real risk, but infrequently enough to catch you by surprise. Be ready for this. Don't set your target to close. And take the next advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start with a screwdriver. Seriously. They are a good first step for learners. Still treat it as a weapon, so all the above points still apply. Practice until you are sinking the screw end into the target every time and then work your way up to more deadly weapons. an added bonus is that now you know how to turn a common household tool into an effective thrown weapon. Cool.</p>
</li>
<li>Don't drink and throw. Ever. I know, it helps lift your game at pool, but pool balls don't cut your face in half when you get it wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Suggestion of eye-wear is a good safety precaution too. Although there are other parts of the anatomy that are also vulnerable to flying knives and hatchets. Also others have suggested using proper practice knives instead of screwdrivers. That sounds like a good idea. I was taught to practice with screwdrivers before moving on to hatchets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that they don't.</p>
<p>Thrown weapons are designed to give you the best chance to hit with the blade, but it takes a lot of practice and even then it isn't a sure thing.</p>
<p>People who throw knives or axes at fairs and circuses and such are entertainers working in more or less the same conditions every time. With lots of practice they can get good enough throwing <em>a specific weapon at a specific range into a specific target</em> that they can land the shot most of the time.</p>
<p>In TV and movies they're straight up cheating. They have as many tries as they need to get the shot right, or they use special effects. You only see the end result, which makes it look like thrown weapons are extremely accurate and deadly in the hands of a skilled user, when the reality is it's more of a toss-up.</p>
<p>The only exceptions would be weapons like throwing stars, which are designed to be sharp from every angle. Even then, they were hardly ever used as a primary killing weapon. They would instead be thrown as a distraction, or stuck in the ground in the hopes an enemy would step on them. But they were rarely, if ever, thrown at an enemy with the intent to land a killing blow.</p>
<p>While I'm sure there were a handful of people throughout history that got extremely good at throwing sharp things and used this skill in combat, for most people throwing a knife or axe in a fight just meant you were throwing your weapon away. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They will hit tip first about 20% of the time.  There is no trick to it, the knives are as center balanced as can be or they are crap they sell to the uninformed.  Note that 20% is kind of misleading but under &quot;sterile&quot; conditions is accurate because 20% is the amount of the rotation that is capable of sticking into the board.</p>
<p>The way a practiced person does it is based on distance.  If you can properly gauge the distance then you can adjust your throw to rotate the right number of times.  My style of throw does 1 1/4 rotations per 10 feet (blade up on release).  So if my target is 15 feet I will release the knife at a different angle or hold by the other end to adjust how it hits.  My personal average is about 5/7 within a 5&quot; circle at about 12 feet.  When I change range I drop to about 50%.  Rinaldo of the danger committee can hit within about 1/4 inch from 10 feet and within about an inch from at least 20, but my god is that man talented.  Seen him cut a cucumber in half sitting on his partners forearm.</p>
<p>The average person will land 1/14 without instructions, some people get lucky some people have a knack for it but without help or practice you are bound to suck at it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3 issues come to my mind. The first is designing a spacesuit that lets you breathe normally while your bare foot is exposed. Your foot wouldn't suffer much from the vacuum exposure (see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/70s5om/what_would_happen_if_only_your_arm_and_nothing/" target="_blank">this thread</a> for details), I'm mostly wondering how you would prevent air from leaking. I'll just assume you have a solution for that.</p>
<p>(Edit: there are several followup questions about swelling when your foot is exposed to a vacuum. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/74vncq/is_it_possible_to_put_my_bare_foot_on_the_moon/do2h116/?context=3" target="_blank">this comment</a> for details and a source).</p>
<p>Then you have the problem of temperature of the lunar surface, extremely hot during the day and extremely cold during the night. Let's assume you're stepping on it at sunrise or sunset when temperatures are milder.</p>
<p>Finally, lunar dust is really harmful. It's because of the lack of weather erosion, grains aren't rounded and retain weird shapes with very sharp edges. Your scenario doesn't involve breathing lunar dust (except for what might penetrate into your suit's air, which isn't negligible), but your foot's skin certainly wouldn't be happy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my mind this is really two questions.  1) Can you expose your bare feet to the moon's environment?  2) Can you safely put your feet in lunar soil?</p>
<p>As to 1, brief full body exposure (say, 5 seconds) <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660005052.pdf" target="_blank">would not be a problem as long as someone was there to get you immediate and proper re-compression and to save you if you go unconscious (about 10 seconds.)</a></p>
<p>As to 2, there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_health_effects_from_lunar_dust_exposure" target="_blank">whole article at Wikipedia about it.</a>   So long as you washed your feet after, I can't imagine you coming to any immediate harm.  I imagine it would be something like walking in diatomaceous earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see it mentioned here yet, but the Moon actually has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_lava_tube" target="_blank">ancient lava tubes</a> in the form of intact/collapsed tunnels.  One or more of these could easily be refurbished, made sufficiently air-tight, and conditioned for human habitation.  Not saying going barefoot would be a good idea for a lunar caveman.  But it is at least a conceptually sound idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For how long? </p>
<p>Exposure to vacuum is harder than going underwater, because you can't hold your breath (we weren't made for that kind of internal pressure). Plus after a few seconds water would start boiling off exposed membranes. This is worst for your eyes, but some sort of very tight-fitting goggles could help. </p>
<p>That said, none of these problems are going to kill you instantly. Estimates for surviving vacuum exposure suggest you have between 10 and 20 seconds of useful consciousness, and up to a minute of survival. </p>
<p>So, forget the space suit with a hole in the foot, what you really need is an airlock that's not much bigger than you which can depressurize and repressurize extremely quickly. Then, you'd just take a quick hop out the airlock onto that regolith, and back in. 2 seconds on the surface, 4 to depressurize, 4 to repressurize. </p>
<p>You'll probably get a rash on your foot, wash it thoroughly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
