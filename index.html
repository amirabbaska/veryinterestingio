		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can both be defined as functions of a probability distribution, and the definitions differ by a constant multiplier. For the information theoretic definition, this multiplier is set to arbitrarily make the entropy of a coin flip 1.</p>
<p>Of interest, there is discussion in the academic community over whether they should be interpreted as equivalent notions or not. The major prevailing opinion though is that there is enough there to justify overlapping study. </p>
<p>The major difference between the two is the types of problems they apply to. For instance, it is common for the processes used in information theory to not satisfy the second law, that is entropy does not always increase. While in statistical mechanics, this law is supreme. </p>
<p>The best discussion is probably <a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Information theory and statistical mechanics</em> by E.T. Jaynes (PDF)</a>. While if you want a more recent and thorough discussion, there is the book <a href="http://webee.technion.ac.il/people/merhav/papers/gcnotes.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Statistical physics and information theory</em> by Navi Mehrav (PDF)</a>. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic idea revolves around the concept of the <strong>microstate</strong> and the <strong>macrostate</strong>.  The microstate is the configuration of the components of the system, and the macrostate is a &quot;label&quot; we use to categorize the microstates.</p>
<p>For example, in a game of yahtzee, the individual configuration of each dice might be the microstate, and the macrostate might be &quot;Number of sixes rolled&quot;.</p>
<p>We define the entropy of a macrostate to be proportional to the number of microstates that would be 'counted' as a part of that macrostate.  For example, &quot;five sixes&quot; would be an extremely low-entropy macrostate because there is only one way you could roll five dices to get five sixes.  &quot;four sixes&quot; is also a pretty low-entropy macrostate, but bigger than &quot;fix sixes&quot;.</p>
<p>You can extend this pretty seamlessly to the physical concept of entropy.  The microstate of a cloud of gas might be the position and velocities of every molecule in that cloud.  The temperature of that cloud would be a macrostate.  There are many different configurations of moleculues that will yield 300K.  And, again, that's all the entropy is -- a measure of the logarithm of &quot;how many&quot; molecular configurations would yield your macrostate (300K).  As it turns out, there are <em>more</em> ways to configure the moleclues to get 300K than there are to get, say, 30K.  There are even less ways you can configure the molecules in that cloud of gas to get 3K.</p>
<p>Information theory entropy and thermodynamic entropy are literally the exact same concept -- a number proportional to the possible configurations that would yield the macrostate you're asking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In both cases entropy can be seen as how much information it would take to describe the state of a system. The more chaotic a system is, the more information you need to completely describe its state.</p>
<p>When matter is at 0 kelvin, its atoms aren't 'jiggling' because it lacks heat and therefore you need no information to describe it, as you already know how all its atoms are behaving. You could say its entropy is 0.  In a gas at a high temperature its atoms are jiggling and colliding onto each other, so you would need a lot of information to describe the velocity and energy of each one, so it's entropy would be high.</p>
<p>In information theory, if you have a set of messages you want to transmit, entropy tells you how much information you need to describe them, IE.: How much you can compress them. If there is a lot of repeated patterns between them you can make use of this and compress the messages. The more complex the messages are, the more bits (information) you need to describe them, so the more entropy they have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They weren't all introduced at the same time, and therefore have to compete with each-other for market share.</p>
<p>Originally there was only flat-head, this is because you can make a flat-head screw and driver very easily. Before there were different types of screws, they called the driver a &quot;Turnscrew&quot;</p>
<p>Then somebody thought to themselves &quot;If there were two slots, like an X then the Turnscrew would be a bit harder to make but wouldn't slide out of the screw all the time. (this guys name was probably Phillips, not actually sure though)</p>
<p>This idea worked quite well and so there were now two standards. They both co-exist because X is definitely better to work with, but the slot is always going to be cheaper and easier to make.</p>
<p>Eventually a third person decided that the way that Phillips pops out if you apply too much torque is sub-optimal, so they came up with Robertson (Square type) This system managed to catch on quite well, but not become very widespread. This type is a little more expensive to make the screws than Phillips, but a little cheaper to make the drivers too.</p>
<p>Now we have three competing standards. All of which have their strengths and weaknesses. All of which are able to take a viable slice of the market and compete with each-other.</p>
<p>The other standards you've mentioned all came into the market in a similar manner, but I'm telling the story of the big three types because it's way simpler to explain the concept that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Phillips heads solved that problem, but introduced another: the screws strip easily when the driver cams out due to excessive torque. Newer designs have different balances of torque protection, size, manufacturing ease, etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of reasons, and many other answers have hit the high points. In general, &quot;sophisticated machinery&quot; means &quot;it's more expensive to make.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Flathead&quot; screws were created first because they're the easiest to make and didn't require sophisticated machinery.</li>
<li>&quot;Phillips head&quot; screws were created later because it takes more sophisticated machining to create them. They're easier to screw in than flat heads, but can be subject to &quot;stripping&quot; that makes reuse impossible.
<ul>
<li>They are, by design, subject to a problem called &quot;cam-out&quot;, that means the screwdriver might slip and stop applying force. In good Phillips screws, this stops you from over-tightening the screws. In cheap Phillips screws, this makes it impossible to properly tighten them without stripping.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Robertson&quot; screws were created to deal with the stripping problems of Phillips heads, but take more sophisticated machinery to create.</li>
<li>Torx and Hex screws are alternate ways to try and address the problems with Phillips heads, and also require sophisticated machinery. (I think it's possible Torx was trademarked
<ul>
<li>Robertson, Torx, and Hex are more resistant to &quot;cam-out&quot;. That means you're less likely to strip them, but you can also over-tighten them without a more sophisticated screwdriver designed to prevent over-tightening.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few other head types exist and are called &quot;security bits&quot;. The goal here is either to make a screw few people will have a screwdriver to turn, or in some cases make it very difficult to unscrew the screw without causing damage. These are for applications like public restroom stalls, where you don't want vandals to unscrew your screws. Common security bits have tri-wing, square, and triangular heads, but many tighten-only screws have drivers that look sort of like bottle openers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the reasons so many heads exist are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some screws are really cheap to make, and the cheapest possible solution will always exist even if it's very bad.</li>
<li>Some screws were designed to be easier to use than the cheaper ones, but are more expensive and have varying problems with over-tightening or stripping.</li>
<li>Some screws are designed in the hopes that you don't have a screwdriver for them, so you don't mess with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's sort of why a lot of car mechanisms use different screws on one part. The manufacturer is trying to make it so the average person with a cheap toolset won't be able to properly disassemble and reassemble the mechanisms. But the licensed, &quot;qualified&quot; mechanic's shop will have all of the necessary tools. Don't ask me why they tend to replace all of the screws with inferior, half-broken ones. That probably has to do with the &quot;cheaper&quot; reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A standard screw is simplest and works will with hand tools.</p>
<p>A Phillips screw is good with a machine driver, because it is less likely to slip.</p>
<p>A Torx screw is less likely to slip than a Phillips, so it is better when a screw has to be really tight, but it is harder to align initially.</p>

<p>As machining methods have improved we've been able to design more complex screws/drivers to overcome the flaws in the old designs.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. It would be much better if they were able to do that and hopefully they will, but it's naive to think that's going to happen anytime soon. Even though we have common enemies to some extent, both sides don't want the same things.</p>
<p>When Obama first took office, he did try to calm things down with Russia. He unilaterally withdrew planned missile defenses from Eastern Europe. He reduced our nuclear arsenal well below treaty limits. In contrast, Russia invaded Georgia (prior to Obama's tenure), he's built up the Russian nuclear arsenal well in excess of treaty violations, is developing new missile technologies Russia which are in blatant violation of treaty, conducted a proxy war in Ukraine, war crimes in Syria, has been flying bombers into West Coast airspace, buzzing US ships and jets, has been enabling Iran's nuclear program, etc.</p>
<p>The US wants peace, stability and to overall maintain its influence and the status quo. Russia is not happy with the status quo and wants to increase its own power and influence. Russian attitudes have grown increasingly disdainful of the US and sanctions employed to curb Russia's behavior only antagonized them further.</p>
<p>Russia hasn't kept to its current treaty agreements and has no intention of doing so. More talking is unlikely to change that...unless...do you have something novel you think they should talk about?</p>
<p>The US has a few options.
1) We do nothing and passively let Russia do what it wants. This avoids escalation for now but emboldens Russia and other nations to take advantage of our absence to do all sorts of things we don't like. This may lead to even larger conflict later (think how European diplomacy failed to prevent WW2).</p>
<p>2) We employ more sanctions. This may weaken Russia but is unlikely to curb behavior. It didn't work in Cuba, it hasn't worked in North Korea and it isn't going to work with Russia. Additionally, our allies in Europe depend on Russian oil among other things, so the sanctions would be fairly limited. We also run the risk of pushing Russia to establish deeper ties with countries who are already our adversaries.</p>
<p>3) We escalate the situation. <em>The point of this is to avoid war. </em> When the US says &quot;Hey man, I have zero intention of fighting you. Let's talk and cool things down,&quot; that does not have the desired effect. It just tells Putin he can do things with impunity since no one will stand up to him. When you say, &quot;you chill the fuck down or I am prepared to annihilate the ever living fuck out of you,&quot; he'd be more inclined to listen. That also risks war and a bad one. On the other hand, shying from conflict now may risk an even larger conflict in the future. </p>
<p>4) We tell Putin he's awesome and we love everything he's doing. We try to be just like him, help him do all sorts of stuff and hope he will see us as his buddies. This achieves none of our policy goals. It enables Russia. It weakens the US.</p>
<p>This situation is a bit different from the Cold War. Back then, the US and the Soviets had 2 very ideogically opposed world views and both thought the other side may risk nuclear attack at any moment. Russia knows we don't want to  nuke them. And we...well...reasonably expect Russia isn't about to nuke us out of the blue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Complicated question. Depends whom one asks. But stuff is political and there are longstanding tensions between the two, so you're unlikely to hear 'yes'. This will probably get long, convoluted and appear to be tangential (there are a lot of threads and it's past midnight). </p>
<p>You have to remember it was only about 25 years ago the USSR dissolved. Before those 25 years there was about 40 years of intense propaganda, competition and distrust on both sides. Those things reduced, but did not halt, after the dissolution. So there are still many, many people who have ingrained in their beliefs that Russia is an enemy. It's become a cultural thing in some respects to continue to view them as an enemy. </p>
<p>Now with respect to Russia and it's recent events, there are two broad camps. There is the Russia is expansionist and a threat to the west view. There is also the view Russia is threatened, acting like a cornered animal and the west fucked up. That second one is rarely repeated even though it is a serious position held in academic circles. Why is it not repeated? A combination of Donald Trump being pro-Russia (and Trump being a very disliked president elect), the above propaganda and anti-Russian culture and western/American exceptionalism (this is  related to the propaganda, but I feel like an elaboration on this would be useful). </p>
<p>What is American/Western Exceptionalism? At it's heart it's the idea that people tend to view themselves as being exceptional. That's not abnormal really, most groups of people (or individuals) tend to justify their actions and beliefs, while struggling to see the viewpoint of the other side. Unfortunately, this can and has lead to a biased and hypocritical view, especially in combination with the propaganda. E.g., how the two other replies at this point justify/explain the actions of the US. One has justified it by saying it's exporting democracy (which is very recent and even then debatable)*. The other has justified it because Russia invaded a country. The problem with this view is the US has invaded more countries, involved in more wars, more interventions etc in recent times (they're completely mistaken to think the US does it far less), so if that's a valid justification we should expect all to abandon the US. Those are two very common justifications by the way and implicit it those is their side is right. There is a kind of cycle where these kinds of views and thinking are shaped by the media at the same time as shaping the media. </p>
<p>*I've heard it said western exceptionalism is the modern equivalent to white mans burden. An interesting thought whether you agree or not. </p>
<p>And on top of all of that complexity, there does exist real conflicts in interests. The EU and NATO want to expand eastward, the US supports both (and it makes sense strategically from their own perspectives). Russia views the encroaching of those organisations as threats. They back different sides in Syria (again, makes sense from the respective positions). </p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>It's the combination of historic, cultural, political factors as well as conflicts of interest that gives the appearance of it not be acceptable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it make sense if they sat down &amp; talked things out?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might, it depends on if it were to result in any change. It really is difficult to tell from where we stand. For instance, if one were to view China as the enemy (and Trump does seem to be signalling that at the moment) it makes sense to try and deprive China of their friends, friends like Russia. In that case increased ties to Russia would be very important. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because both are great powers with conflicting interest. Russia isn't a model of democracy, but that's not really the reason why the US isn't friend with them. Saudi Arabia is probably worst than russia in that department, but their interest somehow align with those of the US.</p>
<p>Ukraine. Both the US and Russia don't really care about what the people in Ukraine really want. The US want to expand their influence in the region and limit Russia's influence. Russia on the other hand feel threaten. Think about it, poland, hungary, baltics, etc. They are used to be friendly with russia. It's a great buffer zone to protect your territory. Missile are thousand kilometer away from your border and so are enemy troops. But now the US have anti-missile shield unit in Poland, Romania and Turkey. Hell they even have nuclear missile in Turkey and Germany. Russia also have lost of alot of their access to the Meditterean. They still had a base in Sevastopol that their lease from Ukraine, but with Ukraine possible joining NATO, they just couldn't protect their trading line anymore. Russia just used the presence of Russia speaking people in Ukraine to protect their interest there. Not really democratic, but I pretty sure the US would be doing the same if needed. They invaded a couple of country for the same reason in the last 60 years.</p>
<p>Syria. A lot of people think that the involvement in of Russia and US in syria is to back their own friend in the region and prepare work for a pipeline. The US back Saudi-Arabia and Qatar pipeline going from Qatar to Turkey go through all US ally except Syria to sell Arabian oil to europe. But their is also a Russian backed pipeline going from Iran to Syrian mediterrean port for export. Syria is highly unlikely to allow both pipeline going through and the winner will have a huge economic advantage in the years after the war.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Russia has invaded it's neighbors to oppose their desires for closer ties to the West -including invading and annexing a portion of Ukraine, ignored its treaty obligations, ramped up confrontational tactics (illegal flyovers, subs in national waters, irresponsible confrontational maneuvers around allied military planes and vessels) with NATO nations, and used hacking and disinformation campaigns to sow discord and meddle in the elections of the US and our allies. </p>
<p>Ignoring all of that and saying, &quot;Aw shucks, let's be friends, pretty please?&quot;  doesn't promote normal, positive, bilateral relations. It legitimizes the illegal and/or dangerous actions of a bullying nation.  If and when Russia returns to operating within the bounds of responsible society, they'd be welcomed within it.  Now?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Countries that try to become some sort of Empire (in the economic sense) or at least dominate those around them have a problem if another country tries to be an Empire. </p>
<p>Why do you want to be an empire? Basically it is about getting ressources to produce things with and markets to sell those things to, there might be ideology and military strategy in it, but it basically is about ressources and markets. From that follows everything else: You want to keep your markets? You need to control the seaways from and to. You need to have some sort of military control over your areas of influence to not lose them.</p>
<p>Now imagine there are two or three or five of those &quot;big countries that want to be Empires&quot; and obviously there will be intersections of the areas they want influence in. Obviously, there are &quot;problems&quot; that arise. </p>
<p>For example take Syria: Russia has influence in that area via their local dicator, the US wants the russian influence gone, as such the russian-friendly local dicator. Russia wants to keep it. The US wants it gone. This is just an extreme case, but the world is littered with &quot;areas of influence&quot; of this &quot;country that wants to be an Empire&quot; or &quot;that other one&quot;.</p>
<p>This, in a pretty simple nutshell, is geopolitics explained. </p>
<p>It lead to the european powers start WWI (GB, Germany, France, Austria, Russia, Italy), GB and France start wars in Africa, Japan to attack the US in WWII (they wanted a pacific-empire), the Vietnam-War (US vs. Russia), China having problems with the US over Taiwan, ...</p>
<p>The &quot;sitting down and talking it out&quot; has precedences in history. For example during some parts of the Cold War there was an agreement of &quot;Don't fudge with our areas, we don't fudge with yours&quot;, which mostly worked. You also had the then-superpowers Spain and Portugal basically split the world among themselves 1494, simply because they knew that a big conflict would destroy them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of answers here that <em>answer</em> the question but not to a satisfying level of detail so I'll take a swing.</p>
<p>The main reason is because honey is almost completely sugar. That high sugar concentration dehydrates any cells that try to take up residence through osmosis. (Osmosis being like a gravitational pull toward balance.) If there's water inside of a cell that falls into the honey, the honey will pull water out of the cell until the proportion of water to sugar inside the cell is equal to the proportion outside the cell.</p>
<p>Since the honey had such a high sugar content, a single cell just doesn't have enough water in it to make a dent in that so the honey ends up pulling nearly all the water out of the cell, killing it in the process.</p>
<p>There are some things that can survive without any water; botulism spores have already been brought up and are a great example of why we pasteurise honey, despite how well it kills bacteria on its own.</p>
<p>There are other properties that play lesser roles like a chemical secreted by the bees called defensin-1 which works as an antibiotic but these other properties pale in comparison to the mighty osmotic pressure.</p>
<p>What this means, though, is that, yes, honey has antimicrobial properties but the main one (osmosis) goes away the moment you dilute it because the balance mentioned earlier is much easier to reach if the overall solution has a lower percentage of sugar.</p>
<p>In turn, that means that honey does not pass it's abilities on to you by drinking it since you dilute it with your saliva and stomach acid. In other words, if someone tells you it will help fight off a cold because of its antimicrobial properties, they don't know what they're talking about.</p>
<p>It will, however, make your throat feel better temporarily but that's another ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey can expire if it has too much water in it, which it can pull from the air if it is stored improperly. Bees will actually cap the honey comb when the moisture of the honey gets too high (around 16-17%) so it cannot absorb any more water. Moisture above 18% can <del>cause</del> allow the honey to ferment, which would effectively spoil the honey. When honey is processed by a beekeeper, it is typically done in a humidity controlled environment to avoid over hydration. </p>
<p>Honey, if stored properly (dry and airtight), can last thousands of years because of its sugar content and natural antibacterial properties. It will often crystallize when stored for a long time, but this does not mean the honey is bad. Simply warm it and it will turn back to honey. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of these top answers are pretty much wrong. Not really so much to do with the sugar, but not too far off. I wrote a paper about this, so I will tell you about honey and more at an age above 5.</p>
<p>When bees gather pollen from flowers, they add an enzyme called invertase to break it down into two sugars: glucose and fructose. When the bee returns to the hive and regurgitates the nectar into the honeycomb it adds one more enzyme called glucose oxidase.  This creates trace amounts hydrogen peroxide in the honey. Yes, the same hydrogen peroxide that your mother poured on your scrapes and cuts, and the same one that keeps everything it touches clean and sanitary. The bee then flaps its wings over the honey until all the water has left. The lack of water and the existence of hydrogen peroxide makes it a rough place for any bacteria to live. </p>
<p>Civilizations as far back as the ancient Sumerians know that honey helps treat wounds. It prevents bacteria and moisture from entering while at the same time, sucks moisture out of the wound. A visit to Boca's Gumbo Limbo Nature Preserve  shows how in their sea turtle rehabilitation, honey treatments are frequently and effectively placed over cracks and other exposed injuries to protect damaged sea turtles from developing infections.</p>
<p>Eating local honey also can help immunize against local allergies. As an informal study from Xavier University in New Orleans found, bees gather small amounts of pollen that could normally trigger allergies.2  But eating that honey introduces tiny amounts into you, and allows your immune system to build up tolerance to common allergens.
The positive aspects of honey continue. The National Journal of Biological Sciences research suggest that honey may be a great tool in the management of diabetes. Honey raises your blood sugar much less, and requires much less insulin to break down then the sugar found in most foods. Using it as a substitute could not only help combat diabetes mellitus at early stages, but also due to its anti-lipidemic effect,  can fight against obesity.</p>
<p>Like any good thing, honey can also have its drawback. While anyone old enough to read this can enjoy the full fledged benefits of the golden nectar, it is not recommended for infants.  Toxicologist Charles Santerre recommend waiting until the baby is 12 months old before you introduce honey into the diet.  Honey can rarely contain a bacteria called Clostridium botulinum which could affect an infant's immature digestive tract and cause infant botulism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey never expires because the water that is present in the honey is molecular and/or chemically bounded (trapped). Water becomes bonded through their strong electrical attraction (polarity), this can happen through water-ion and water-dipole interactions. This is important to know because Many microorganism, such as the types of bacteria and yeast which are associated with food spoilage, require moisture (water) to grow and reproduce. </p>
<p>You have probably bounded water yourself. When you throw salt on the sidewalk, the salt intercuts with the water trapping the molecules and preventing them from expanding (freezing) therefore lowering their freezing point and preventing snow from building up. But as we know it will eventually freeze. </p>
<p>Back to honey- </p>
<p>All foods have what is called a water activity (Aw)., with 1.0 being the maximum possible.
To show an example:
Fresh meat has a water activity of 0.985, while potato chips/crisps have a water activity of 0.08.  </p>
<p>The bacteria associated with food spoilage require a minimum of 0.90 to survive, grow and reproduce. Yeast require a minimum of 0.80 and 0.70 for mold.
There are exceptions of course which I can name if you guys are interested. </p>
<p>At low water activities, microorganisms die because water inside the cell diffuses out in an effort to balance the osmotic pressure. So basically the cells dehydrate and die because the water leaves theirs cell. </p>
<p>This is why honey never expires, it has a very low water activity, preventing it from supporting the growth of micro organisms that would cause it to spoil. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. You wouldn't be saved from eating immediately before. Your body needs to metabolize the food into your blood which isn't instant. Not only that, if you're on the brink of starvation, then your digestive system wouldn't be functioning ideally; after all, starving to death takes typically over a month (assuming you're hydrated) and in the last week or so your organs would be damaged and shutting down, plus you're barely producing stomach acid to digest anyway.</p>
<p>To add even more on top of that, there's refeeding syndrome which involves a number of pretty shitty disorders. Essentially though, from my understanding, during starvation, your body uses up it's resources and switches to consuming your fatty acids to conserve red blood cells. When refeeding occurs, the body tries to pump out more red blood cells, but the resources used to make those normally are used up, so some compound builds in the liver and skeleton which uses up ATP in red blood cells causing the red blood cells to not work properly and they don't deliver enough oxygen around your body. There are also other things that happen, but I'm not sure about them.</p>
<p>Often times, when faced with emancipated, emaciated WW2 captives, allied soldiers were told not to give any food to the emaciated captives and to keep them away from finding food as it could literally kill them because of refeeding syndrome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Standard practice when rescuing starving people is to give small amounts of food in order to prevent refeeding syndrome. It depends on your condition and the type and amount of food you have.</p>
<p>Long answer: With adequate food, the body primarily uses glucose for energy, but the body can't store as much glucose as it can protein and fat. Trouble is, the brain can't use fatty acids for energy, so the body produces ketone bodies to help replace the glucose you aren't eating. This process, called ketosis, releases acid into the body. If you undergo ketosis for long enough to starve, then ketoacidosis, a deadly acidification of the the blood, may occur. If you can't get treated for severe acidification, then it doesn't matter what you eat. You'll die (interestingly, this is why untreated Type I diabetes is also extremely dangerous).</p>
<p>But let's say your blood hasn't turned to acid before your rescue. Ketosis changes the metabolic environment of the body in other ways, but the body would prefer to metabolize food normally. If you eat a load of food, then the body will immediately shift to the normal mode of metabolism, and that shift is what causes refeeding syndrome. Several days of limited intake helps &quot;prime&quot; the body for regular metabolism and slows down the shift from ketosis to normal metabolism. If your &quot;last moment&quot; means that you have no more stored calories, then the shift from no food to enough food for you to live would probably kill you. If your &quot;last moment&quot; means that you have just enough stored calories to maintain your life until you can finish the metabolic shift, then it might save you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The sudden change causes a massive shift and depletion of electrolytes like phosphorous and magnesium among others. It's so bad it can send you into heart failure.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dug up some old lecture notes about this. If there's any factual errors, please tell me.</p>
<p>Aight, so, in the context of the human body necrosis is the word for uncontrolled cell death (things leak out of the cell, causes inflammation), while apoptosis is the word for controlled cell death (everything packed up in neat vesicles for further breakdown). Severe hypoxia will lead to necrosis eventually.</p>
<p>Essentially, what happens when a cell is exposed to hypoxia is that it starts switches over to anaerobic metabolism. This, however, produces way less ATP (energy) than aerobic metabolism, and also produces lactate as a byproduct. Insufficient ATP leads to the ion-pumps on the surface of the cell not functioning, and thus an electrolyte imbalance (as the cell normally needs to spend energy to maintain the differing concentrations intra-/extracellularly). The electrolyte imbalance results in net flow of fluid into the cell, and thus cell swelling, due to osmotic effects.</p>
<p>Electrolyte imbalance and lactate accumulation leads to a decreased pH, which in turn leads to wrongly folded proteins (protein folding is a very important and intricate process to ensure functional proteins). Crucially, these misfolded proteins along with the ATP-deficiency means the cell fails to maintain an low intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions. Ca2+ is important in many of the signaling systems of the human body, and can activate many different enzymes (for instance, phospolipases which break down the cell membrane). High Ca2+ leads to uncontrolled activation of various enzymes, which begin to break down various structures of the cell (this is semi-functional; moderate Ca2+ induces apoptosis while a high conc. induces necrosis). It also disrupts mitochondrial functioning by opening pores in their membrane.</p>
<p>The phospolipases mentioned above also break the membranes around lysosomes, which are intracellular packets containing a lot of catalytic enzymes (as a safeguard, these are supposed to only be active in the presence of the low pH present in lysosomes, but hypoxia leads to acidity as mentioned before) that the cells use to degrade various organic matter.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: cell fails to maintain electrolyte and pH balance, high Ca2+ concentration activates a ton of enzymes haphazardly that begin to break down the cell (among them, lysosome membranes -&gt; leakage of catalytic enzymes into the cytosol), improper electrolyte balance causes cell swelling, mitochondria cease to function -&gt; &quot;point of no return&quot; as ATP cannot be generated even in the presence of oxygen</p>

The stray's particles collide with the odorous particles and coagulate, forming slightly larger particles.  In effect, this removes a odorous particle from the air, but a particle that can collide with other odorous particles remains in the system.  As these particles become more massive, local air currents are not providing enough force to counteract gravity and they fall to the ground, leaving a film on your floor.  Clean your bathroom.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern chemistry has shown us that certain chemical agents, when atomized and inhaled, are capable of blocking our smell receptors, thus blunting our ability to detect odor. Other air fresheners coat our nasal passages with an oily film, and many still just cover up the original odor with better-smelling scents. A minority of air fresheners actually break down the offensive odor, and even those ones generally contain a heavy dose of chemicals.</p>
<p>What’s Wrong with Conventional Air Fresheners?
A regular run-of-the-mill air freshener will probably contain at least one of the following scary chemicals:</p>
<p>Phthalates. Synthetic fragrances usually contain phthalates, and most of us know that these are bad—linked with early puberty, autism, obesity, and birth defects. You won’t see “phthalate” on a label; it’ll just say “fragrance” or perhaps “parfum.”
PEG-40. The Environmental Working Group considers this polymer to be moderately hazardous to human health.
1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB).1,4-DCB is reasonably anticipated to a human carcinogen, and has been shown to cause kidney and testicular cancer in rats. It also has been shown to cause reduced lung function and increased asthma rates in humans.
Air fresheners may also contain some really gross chemicals that won’t show up on the label. A 2007 study tested 74 air freshening products and measured the concentration of VOCs in the air after use. They reported that a total of more than 350 different chemicals and allergens were detected, including (but not limited to!) benzene, formaldehyde, styrene, and phthalates.</p>
<p>Spray bottles (aerosol) cause additional health risks due to ingredients used as propellants, such as butane and propane.</p>

<p>tl;dr is GPUs are great if your problem is &quot;I want to do the exact same thing to an entire dataset&quot;, not so much if it's &quot;I want to run this set of instructions exactly once&quot;.  There's nothing stopping you from running arbitrary code on a GPU but performance will tank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The 100 dumb guys, meanwhile, can't do really complex tasks that easily. However, when it comes to busy work, they just have a lot more man power.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GPUs are faster for 2 reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they are much simpler cores (missing features see below) and thus smaller and more can fit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GPUs do not try to maximize IPC (instructions per clock); in other words they suck at single thread sequential execution of instructions, only problems that can be efficiently multithreaded are suitable for GPUs</p>
</li>
<li>they are SIMD machines. When you compare a proper AVX CPU implementation of an algorithm with a GPU implementation, the performance difference of GPUs already is more reasonable. When compared to a simple CPU implementation that does not take advantage of 256bit wide data words with AVX, the performance difference to GPUs appears much larger, because SIMD is really a requirement for proper GPU algorithms while it is not the most commonplace approach taken with CPU code - comparisons are usually between unoptimized CPU code and optimized GPU code and the performance difference is thus exaggerated.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a large set of features that is geared towards single thread IPC throughput in CPUs (the reason for that is that most programs are single threaded):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>out of order execution (including register renaming, data dependency conflict detection, ...)</p>
</li>
<li>branch prediction</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are a boatload of features in CPUs that make them suitable to run a modern operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>interrupts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiple privilege levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sophisticated virtual memory management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connectivity to a more complex set of support chips on the mainboard</p>
</li>
<li>virtualization</li>
</ul>
<p>Each core on a GPU is in essence a very simple SIMD CPU core. Because they lack sophisticated management functions they could not execute a modern operating system. Because programs for GPUs are harder to write they are not used for everything. Because most code executed on a CPU is hardly performance critical GPUs are not used for everything.</p>
<p>When we are talking about straightforward parallel code that is performance critical to the application then GPUs are used for almost everything; if the programmer takes the little extra time to do it right. They are for example used for everything graphics related. They are used for almost everything in the high performance computing community.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of code that a computer executes that is not really performance critical is way larger than the really critical parts, so when you want comfort and do not care about speed then a CPU is just much quicker to program.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Not everyone experiences this condition, and many times the muscles just go back to normal.  Your ligaments and joints get loose as well, all caused by certain pregnancy hormones that enable a women's hips to shift during birth.  All of this usually goes back to normal in the months after birth.  Binding your belly after birth can help your muscles come back together as well, at least anecdotally.  Your skin will almost always stay a little looser than before.  </p>
<p>FYI, there are many exercises you can do to strengthen your ab muscles after birth (wait a couple months minimum though, to heal) and these are usually not your typical &quot;ab strengthening&quot; exercises/movements.  Crunches will not help, and can often make diastasis recti worse.  A quick google search will help you find something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Pregnancy hormones allow a woman's muscles to soften and relax more; which is why you can do some serious damage lifting heavy things or playing sports (both things I did during my pregs). I had big babies so ended up post-preg with 6 inches of separation and had to do physio immediately after birth, while everything was still soft. Perfectly fine now, everything has snapped back into place, but I have a friend who did not do the physio who now has a permanent pot belly due to her abs being out of place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When somebody says 'abdominal muscles' they are mostly referring to rectus abdominus which is the 'six pack' muscle. This muscle helps you to do sit-ups and that is all (and I guess it looks good if toned). But the real important abdominal muscles are underneath the rectus abdominus. One of the primary muscles involved in keeping your abdomen together and supporting your lower back in a muscle called transverse abdominus. This muscle together with a couple of others including the diaphragm, makes up the 'core' muscles. Transverse abdominus acts as a corset around your body so, when working optimally, it can prevent any splitting of rectus abdominus during pregnancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with most of the &quot;open-mind&quot; and &quot;putting yourself in other shoes&quot; comments but I'd like to focus on a different aspect.   </p>
<p>It's about thinking about something without accepting it as true. What do I mean thinking about it?   </p>
<p>Well, let's suppose tigers are blue. Then what? Well, they wouldn't be very well camouflaged. They would probably have to radically change the way they get food or otherwise go extinct. Also, why would they be blue? Maybe a different environment could cause that, which would make the previous consideration irrelevant.   </p>
<p>What if God doesn't exist? Well, then God couldn't be the basis of morality. Is there any basis of morality at all? Would it be objective, something out in the world, or maybe the basis would have to be us as a society deciding what is right or wrong, or maybe it would have to be based on personal growth for each individual, or something else entirely.   </p>
<p>I know Tigers aren't blue, but I can still think about related issues. I, personally, don't care whether God exists or not, but there are implications and questions if God does exist, and different implications and questions if God doesn't. There is no such thing as an isolated &quot;fact;&quot; every fact is connected to many others. To be able to think about something is, in part, to be able to consider those connections. Whether you believe in God or not - heck, even if everyone in the world believed in God (and, thus, there are no actual shoes of the other to put yourself in) - you should still be able to consider what it would <em>mean</em> if God didn't exist.   </p>
<p>So, I think the quote is partly about the relationships between propositions, rather than fixating on the truth value of those propositions. After all, Aristotle is the father of category logic, which is all about those propositions and not, primarily, their truth. For instance:<br />
All X are Y<br />
Some X are Z<br />
Therefore Some Z are Y<br />
This is a valid argument - if the premises are true, the conclusion MUST be true, but we have no idea if the premises are true because it's just formal. If we fill it in:<br />
All dogs are rocket ships<br />
Some dogs are bars of soap<br />
Therefore, some bars of soap are rocket ships<br />
If the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true: If it were the case that, in actuality, all dogs were rocket ships, and it really was the case that some dogs were bars of soap, then some bars of soap would HAVE TO BE rocket ships, namely, the bars of soaps that were also dogs (because all dogs are rocket ships). So, we looked at the implications of some claims, even though the claims are obviously false and absurd. Better yet, some claims are not obviously true or obviously false, but figuring out their implications can help us to solve the question of truth, and also to figure out all sorts of other things, too.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, it's similar to the idea of &quot;putting yourself in someone else's shoes&quot;. </p>
<p>I think the argument is that a wise person should be able to understand why someone else might adopt a belief or idea that they personally disagree with. Just take any controversial belief you may hold and compare yourself to others who would oppose that belief. If you're pro-LGBTQ, try to understand why someone might be anti-LGBTQ. If you're pro-choice, try to understand why someone might be pro-life. If you're pro-gun-control, try to understand why someone might be anti-gun-control. If you support prohibition of drugs, try to understand why someone might support legalization of drugs. </p>
<p>A huge amount of people take sides on any given issue and are either unable or unwilling to consider the perspective of people who oppose them- dismissing opposing arguments as senseless, stupid, pointless, misguided, etc... I think that Aristotle is saying, a wise person is able to take a side while actually understanding why the opposing side believes what they do and respecting them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
