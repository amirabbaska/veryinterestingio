		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://www.usflag.org/uscode36.html#175" target="_blank">Flag code</a> dictates that the blue field should be upper left.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>§175. (i) When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.army.mil/e2/rv5_downloads/symbols/r670_1.pdf" target="_blank">Army Regulations</a> say it should be reversed, to &quot;give the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the
wearer moves  forward.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AR 670–1, 28018 c (2): The full-color U.S. flag cloth replica is worn so that the star field faces forward, or to the flag’s own right. When worn in this manner, the flag is facing to the observer’s right, and gives the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer  moves  forward.  The  appropriate  replica  for  the  right  shoulder  sleeve  is  identified  as  the  reverse  side  flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: to look like you're carrying a real flag as you move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The reason has to do with proper display of the flag.</p>
<p>The blue field of stars should always be in the highest position of honor. When viewing the flag on a wall, the highest position of honor is the upper left when displayed horizontally, and at the top (upper left) when displayed vertically. When displayed on a &quot;moving object&quot; like a person or vehicle, the highest position of honor is the front, and not the rear; so the field of blue should be displayed to the front.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not. US flags don't have a front and back, rather we are accustomed (by heraldry tradition) to viewing them as though the pole is on the left. The flag is always worn so as to be advancing, or carried forward, on modern uniforms. Hence the blue field is toward the wearer's front. On certain uniforms, like USAF flight suits, the flag is worn on the left sleeve and thus is sewn as you're used to seeing. </p>
<p>It was not always this way. On D-Day, the flag on the right shoulder sleeve of US Army uniforms was depicted &quot;normally.&quot; This was reprised in the 2016 Army uniform for the Army-Navy game, which featured such a flag (complete with 48 stars as I recall) on the right shoulder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you were to then carry this pole forward, you'd observe the stars forward with the stripes trailing behind.  When you make the flag into a patch, you need a left-side and a right-side version in order to give the picture of the stars forward with the stripes behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you pay the same price for a car somebody just bought put 100 miles on it and then turned back in?</p>
<p>What what you're speaking about refers to a time decades ago when the profit margin on cars was up to an average of 17%.</p>
<p>Today most cars are sold at a loss brand new. Most dealerships do not make money on the cae,  they make money financing and fixing them. The average profit on a new car was actually negative from 2004 until 2012. Under Bush,  consumers were being squeezed and car sales slunk..plus there was a lot of shifts within the industry and competitive practices were ramping up. Then Along Comes Google and it's game over for profits in the new car business</p>
<p>In 2012 the average profit on a new car finally turned positive and it was a whopping 120 bucks.</p>
<p>From time to time you'll see people complaining about dealerships and saying if we got rid of them average car prices would drop by $2,000 this is based on that time. Decades ago. The internet has changed everything, leveling the playing field to the Buyers Advantage except when it comes to your trade-in but even then just be smart. Hate to say this but if you want a good deal on a car you got to go to a big city and you got to find the guy that sells the most cars he's the one who gets the best deals from the manufacturer and is willing to lose the most upfront. At the dealership I worked at for about 6 months, they had brand new focuses with an effective price cheaper than used ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if somebody just bought a new computer and within a few days tried to pawn it off on you. Would you take this as a generous offer, or would you assume there's something wrong with it? </p>
<p>Cars might be made in factories, but there are a number of moving parts that can go wrong, or worse, it could be a lemon. Within those first moments of going off the lot, you can only have things go wrong. If you want to resell it, why? You obviously aren't going to get the same price you bought it for, so you aren't trying to flip it for profit. Statistically speaking, there is something wrong with that car. </p>
<p>Now lets say you waited a year. The new models of cars have come out and there could be dozens of reason one wants to sell last years car. Even if it was a lemon, the resale value is much higher than it was right off the lot if only because it's more reasonable for somebody to get rid of such a &quot;fine&quot; products. Unless the model in question had several recalls and/or a particularly bad reputation, you can expect a higher resale value than you would get had you sold it right out of the lot.</p>
<p>One last thing of note is, practically everything about selling cars is a headache of many people in the know selling to a customer they hope is ignorant. Sales people will try to mark up everything where they can, well past the actual value of the car, and sometimes up-sell things that are assumed standard in a resell market as &quot;features&quot; to wriggle even more money from customers. It is fairly rare that cars are actually sold at their proper value as even people who are good at negotiating a fair price get fatigued by tenacious sales practices. One of the reasons cars depreciate so quickly, is because they were never actually as valuable as the price they were bought for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of comments on here just ragging on dealers. OP did not ask a question about a dealer at all.
The answer to this question is simple. </p>
<p>It was new, it is now used. Simple as that.
Would you pay more or less for a used car that has two owners as compared to one? No. Your previously brand new car has its warranty started, it has guarantee of the condition, nor is there a guarantee of the upkeep of a vehicle, and the carFax no has it listed as a one owner used car. A brand new car has no title issued to it, never sat under that tree dripping sap onto it. Never had a 16 year old kid bang it into the parking barrier at the mall. </p>
<p>You pay a premium to know this car is brand new and that no one has been stuffing their farts into the driver's seat for the time that they owned it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The depreciation is very simple.  Dealers sell cars with a margin to make a profit.  Let's say a dealer buys a new car from The factory for $20k.  They then sell it for $23k, netting a $3k profit.  Now, if the owner comes back the next week to sell it back to the dealer, the dealer might only offer them $19k for it.  Why?  Well it's intrinsic value was only $20k new and it now has to be sold as a used car, so they discount it $1k.  The dealer is no going to pay retail for the car because they need to make a profit on it.  So the buyer decides to sell it privately, but consumers don't want to pay retail prices for a used car.  Even if you mark it down to $22k, a private buyer says &quot;well, for only $1k more I can have a brand new car and know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  So you may get more than the intrinsic value of $19k, but it will never be what you paid for it new.  You might only sell it for $20k.</p>
<p>Of course, the markup is different on different vehicles.  High end, low production, exclusive cars like a Ferrari have a much higher markup when sold, so the depreciation is much higher.  The markup is higher because fewer cars of that model will be sold, so the margins have to be higher to actually make a profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is much more simple than folks realize and no one I've seen has touched on it yet.<br />
Some of the largest volume purchasers of cars are rental companies (Enterprise/National, Hertz, Budget, U-Haul).  Enterprise alone maintains a fleet of over 1-million vehicles which cycles regularly.  </p>
<p>All of these companies have business models that involve buying new cars at an extreme discount renting them out for 1-2 years (sometimes more, sometimes less) than reselling.  The resale happens sometimes through their own lots, but more often through wholesale options auctions.<br />
Wholesale auctions like <a href="www.manheim.com" target="_blank">Manheim</a> are the primary source of inventory for both used car lots and used cars new car dealerships (no dealer likes to admit this).<br />
So basically at any given time there is a flood of 1-2 year old cars available for resale at all time over-supplying and lowering price.  </p>
<p>You'll notice cars that don't often get used by rental industries (Exotics, High-option package vehicles, cars with manual transmissions, etc...)  tend to hold resale values better than say a Chevy Impala or Chrysler Sebring.       </p>
<p>Source:  I was an executive at Enterprise for 11 years     </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the fact that humans are predisposed to feel more affectionate towards &quot;cute&quot; animals, and feel disgust for those that look alien. <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cuteness" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cuteness</a></p>
<p>Not only have scientists identified the specific facial traits that trigger &quot;caretaking behavior&quot;--big eyes, bulging craniums, retreating chins--dogs and cats have evolved to elicit it. For example, cats purposefully utilize the frequency range of a baby's cry when attempting to solicit care. <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)01168-3" target="_blank">http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)01168-3</a> And over time dogs have evolved to appear more like human babies over years of humans preferring dogs with paedomorphic facial expressions. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082686" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082686</a></p>
<p>The examples of preferential treatment by humans for &quot;cute&quot; animals is extensive. You can simply look at the types of animals on the endangered creature list, or which animals get funding for research.  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/trends-and-biases-in-the-listing-and-recovery-planning-for-threatened-species-an-australian-case-study/DC0D198D842AE8963787297094B8C263" target="_blank">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/trends-and-biases-in-the-listing-and-recovery-planning-for-threatened-species-an-australian-case-study/DC0D198D842AE8963787297094B8C263</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been shown that this bias isn't learned, but is hard-wired into our brains. The following study found that kids ages 3-6 showed the same preference for animals with infantile features, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019884/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019884/</a></p>
<p>At the same time that dogs and cats have evolved to ingratiate themselves to humans, humans have evolved to utilize dogs and cats to fulfill social and psychological needs. This study of the human-animal bond focuses on neuroendocrine regulation--primarily oxytocin secretions--and the considerable health benefits that result. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4782005/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4782005/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A famous study indicates that its how dissimilar to us humans they are. I remember a study which ranked self reported fear of a load of animals and it found those with different eyes to us, more legs or different body shape, fur, slime, speed of movement, unexpected movements and fast movements evoked more fear. </p>
<p>Various combinations came out as scarier or more frightening and I believe spiders, having many more eyes, many more legs, quick and unexpected movements results in significant difference to us, therefore evoked a greater fear reaction in those polled.   </p>
<p>Edit :This got more attention than I expected, the study is by Bennett levy and marteau if I remember correctly, I'll try and find a link to some details about it.  </p>
<p>Edit 2 : lots of good questions for a good discussion but sadly I'm not a psychologist! However we have to remember that multiple other factors will factor into phobias and fear responses, including past experience and learned behaviour, as well as cultural factors too. This studies results are by no means the sole answer to this question!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It would be interesting to see the results of the same experiment with very young children. </p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>....<em>Peterson and colleagues examined the degree to which specific areas of the brain involved in fear processing and deciding how to respond to a phobic image were activated when someone was consciously aware or unaware of the spider image. Interestingly, they found that even though non-conscious awareness didn't register in a way that could be brought to mind or was cognizant, this type of exposure caused subliminal fear responses to skyrocket.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few Reasons - </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your body produces the hormones that signal that &quot;full&quot; feeling when you're asleep. If you don't get enough sleep, your body can't regulate your metabolism as well as it would on a sufficient night's rest. </p>
</li>
<li>You didn't sleep enough last night.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's because too little sleep has been linked to higher levels of the hormone ghrelin, which is responsible for triggering hunger.</p>
<p>And to make matters worse, when you're sleep deprived, you'll usually crave carb-y, calorie-laden foods, as your body searches for alternate sources of energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Food During the Day</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't eat enough during the day, or if you eat at the wrong times, you might not have enough calories to sustain your body while you sleep. For example, if you eat dinner early, you're more likely to wake up hungry before breakfast, according to Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian, writing for NBC Today. Eating dinner later can help you make it all night without a growling stomach. Including fiber in your evening meal or nighttime snacks can also help, Bauer notes. Fiber fills your stomach and digests more slowly, so you feel full longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're actually just thirsty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A little mild dehydration can give you a sluggish, fatigued feeling -- and, just like when you're sleep deprived, the body often turns to calories for fuel. That means, then, that you may experience what you think is hunger, when it's really thirst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Although all the current coming from the toy comes from the battery, it has been used to build up charge in the cap that can release at a higher voltage and current than the battery would do by itself.</p>
<p>The toys may use something different, like an induction coil, but the basic principle is the same - they extract more current over a shorter time.</p>
<p>Reddit loves a good half-baked analogy so: Consider comparing sitting under a leaky tap for an hour, vs filling a bucket from that tap for an hour, then pouring it on yourself - the basic result is the same, but the bucket provides a much faster delivery of the water, and a much faster change of state as a result - one that is probably more noticable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If the resistance is too high or the voltage too low, you won't get any current flowing and thus not feel it. The voltage is pretty much set by the battery or the toy you are using and the resistance determined by where your hold the leads on your body.</p>
<p>For instance, touch your <em>finger</em> to the leads of a 9V battery and you feel nothing. Touch your <em>tongue</em> to the leads of a 9V and you'll get a nice jolt. Your tongue has a much lower resistance than you finger does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You have tons of salt in your body, it's in your blood, inside your cells, etc. It only takes a little bit of it to makeup the acid in the stomach. Your stomach lining secrets sodium and chlorine ions into your stomach, while reabsorbing the sodium. Meanwhile, proton pumps maintain the acidity of the stomach environment, and naturally the H+ ions pair up with the Chloride ions. The Sodium ends up balancing things out by being used to create sodium bicarbonate in the duodenum that is used to neutralize the stomach contents after they have passed through the stomach (this also effectively deactivates several enzymes that are optimized to work in acidic conditions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And since HCL is a strong acid, H^+ would not be attracted to it. So I don't how u/rocketsocks explained it is the process. According to wikipedia, this is how the parietal cells produce HCL^-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen ions are formed from the dissociation of carbonic acid. Water is a very minor source of hydrogen ions in comparison to carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed from carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase.</p>
<p>The bicarbonate ion (HCO3−) is exchanged for a chloride ion (Cl−) on the basal side of the cell and the bicarbonate diffuses into the venous blood, leading to an alkaline tide phenomenon.</p>
<p>Potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−) ions diffuse into the canaliculi.</p>
<p>Hydrogen ions are pumped out of the cell into the canaliculi in exchange for potassium ions, via the H+/K+ ATPase. These receptors are increased in number on luminal side by fusion of tubulovesicles during activation of parietal cells and removed during deactivation. This receptor maintains a million fold difference in proton concentration. ATP is provided by the numerous mitochondria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR The parietal cells exchange H+ produced by the dissociation of bicarbonate for potassium in the stomach</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That said, nature is pretty good at recycling its waste! There are many animals that will eat other dead animals. Especially in the summer this process goes incredibly quickly.
Where I live, we have many rabbits, mice, squirrels, foxes and different kinds of birds and those are just the animals I know about because I see them every day. I would be surprised if many of these animals actually survive to die of old age. I imagine most of the squirrels and rabbits end up as fox lunch while the one or two dead and decaying foxes I have seen usually had crows and all kinds of insects all over them.</p>
<p>Still, rabbits and such probably retreat to their lairs if they are sick/old. They will feel vulnerable and as they do, they hide in their holes and nests and hollowed out trees, where they will then quietly die and once they have (and sometimes before) other animals will start eating them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think most of the previous comments have accurately summarized why, though I'd like to add that often times, city maintenance workers may clean up/cover corpses. Anecdotal example: A squirrel was hit by a car just outside of my house. It was moved onto the sidewalk by a concerned passerby (no sense in letting scavengers become roadkill as well) and then the next day, I watched a city maintenance work cover the corpse in soil. <a href="http://audubonportland.org/issues/hazards/buildings/faq" target="_blank">The Audubon Society of Portland</a> says that the reason why you don't see piles of dead birds from window collisions is because predators &amp; scavengers get to them first (crows, cats, coyotes, gulls, raccoons, sometimes dogs, various insects etc.) and because the corpses are cleaned up by the city.
There's also aspects of bird biology that make them less likely to be found as corpses: <a href="https://ornithology.com/why-dont-you-see-dead-birds-laying-around/" target="_blank">they tend to be lightweight and have low body fat, and relatively thin skin, and hollow bones, so they decompose much more easily compared to mammals</a>--plus when they hit the water, they float, so they're still accessible for scavengers as well as whatever bacteria live in the water.</p>
<p>None of the sources are peer-reviewed journals or anything like that--hopefully this answer still helps, in the case of birds specifically, in North America!</p>
<p><em>Edit due to /u/spideyosu's comment:</em> Originally I included a reference to a spurious study that estimated that domestic cats cause about a billion bird-deaths a year, and included that as a cause for the relatively low number of bird corpses you see.  It turns out that since it's <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/02/03/170851048/do-we-really-know-that-cats-kill-by-the-billions-not-so-fast" target="_blank">pretty difficult to figure out how many cats even have access to the outdoors at all</a>, it's by extension basically impossible to estimate the actual number of birds that killed by cats per year. Also important is the consideration that cats' safety in general might be jeopardized if they gain too much infamy from unreliable data (which I cited by mistake, and have deleted from the original text. I apologize!)</p>
<p><em>Edit To Add</em> Something else that I didn't think of, but that other comments have alluded to, is that it might just be that we don't see the bird corpses because birds, being for the most part capable of flight, are probably more likely to die in places where we'd never be able to see them unless we spent a lot of time walking around and in between houses (thanks to /u/s1mmeh for that consideration!). Birds that seek refuge in trees, between houses, or up in the nooks and crannies of buildings would probably never be found by passerby. I imagine that's what <em>might</em> be happening to the pigeons near where I live, if they're not picked off before they die by hawks/falcons or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm no professional but from what I gathered this can happen because there is no single gene that determines our hair color or whether we have straight or curly hair. There are a number of genes that affect our hair and sometimes they can be expressed in different ways.</p>
<p>So in my case brown hair is a dominant trait that is expressed everywhere on my head except my beard. The red in my beard comes from someone in my family with the gene for red hair, and that trait just happened to be expressed in my beard.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The levels of pigmentation, or color building blocks, in your hair follicles ultimately determine your hair color. Each follicle contains a mixture of eumelanin (black or brown) or pheomelanin (red and yellow) pigments. Guys with low levels of brown eumelanin and high levels of yellow pheomelanin, you end up with blonde hair. Think of it as paint. Different ratios, create different colors. Different combinations in each follicle yield different hair colors, which explains those random red hairs and dark patches. Besides natural pigment, stress and malnutrition can change your hair color. But the biggest culprit of changing hair color, however, is the sun. It works the opposite of skin. Instead of creating more melanin, it actually destroys it. Now why is each follicle different? Well the question says why. They just are. They are each unique. That's why you may have patches, some follicles tact to testosterone different tly. So that's why you have different colors, cause each follicle is unique with pigments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't just one gene controlling hair color. There are multiple. Same for skin, eyes and many other physical traits.</p>
<p>My husband had brown and red in his beard, but no red in any other body hair, just brown. </p>
<p>His mother had brown hair, his father had very bright red hair. They had hoped that my husband would have red hair as well. </p>
<p>Obviously some of the red genes were passed on, based on his beard hair. And later completely proved by our oldest, blessed to be a full ginger. :) </p>
<p>I had family members on both sides with red hair in prior generations, but no gingers in. I was cursed to have boring brown hair, but I do have very pale skin with freckles and my brown hair would get reddish streaks in summer. I'm only half daywalker. </p>
<p>And our youngest was born with blond hair that is darkening to brown as he gets older. So there is an interesting gene combo going on there too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm Wes Wilson (/u/LabcoatNomad), a Canadian cancer researcher currently working in Australia on treating metastatic mesothelioma using combination immunotherapy treatments. I first got started in cancer research in Toronto at Sunnybrook Hospital before moving into research on childhood brain tumours at The Hospital for Sick Children. There I worked on the epigenetics of childhood brain tumour progression in 2010. </p>
<p>In 2013 the journal Science labeled cancer immunotherapy as &quot;the breakthrough of the year&quot; and many cancer patients were given new hope for treatment. But the work and research to identify the best treatments and combinations for the variety of types of cancer is still on going and desperately needed. No one knows why some immunotherapies work for some patients and others they fail. Our work hopes to increase the effectiveness of these new therapies by combining it with adjunct therapies to help the body self-vaccinate against the tumours!</p>
<p><strong>I will be back at 8pm ET to answer your questions. Ask me anything!</strong></p>

<p>Fellow Canadian here doing cancer immunology research abroad. Thanks for being here today!</p>
<p>We've seen that durable patient responses to immunotherapies targeting T cells is dependent on a variety of factors, from the number of T cells infiltrating the tumor to even the gut <a href="https://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v17/n5/full/nrc.2017.13.html" target="_blank">microbiome</a>. Do you know of any biomarkers predictive of response to the adjunct therapies that you are researching? What do you think are the biggest problems preventing adjunct therapies from being more common in the clinic?</p>
<p>Also, I think it's great that you have a <a href="http://mostlyscience.com/" target="_blank">website</a> directed at translating science to non-scientists: what more do you think us scientists can do to improve our relationship with the public and make our discoveries better understood?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If we cut the engine, and ran only electric, we'd drain batteries real fast on charged equipment- AC, monitors, suction pumps, radios, computers, etc. At our station, we would plug the rigs into outlets. Not sure about commercial diesel, but I'm sure they are running additional equipment as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turbocharged diesel engines need some time to cool the turbocharger down, especially if it's been driven at high stress.</p>
<p>The turbocharger spins at much, much higher speeds than the engine, so when you drive for a prolonged amount of time under boost from the turbocharger and you cut the engine power, the blades in the turbo keep spinning, but the oil does not keep on circulating. This makes the temperature in the turbocharger rise, which can overheat the bearings of the turbo, which burns any residual oil. The byproduct of burning oil is thick gunk which can block the bearings and cost a small fortune to fix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here try to explain how it is necessary for the engine, but none of it is really applicable anymore for modern engines. The truth is that a lot of drivers do not care and will idle just to keep the AC or heat running if they are sitting for whatever reason. They have no problems wasting fuel since the company pays for it anyway, and a lot of companies are putting a time limit on idling so the truck will automatically shutdown after sitting for a few minutes. It can also be necessary for sleeper berths to keep the accessories running if there is no APU. The only reason it is necessary is to cool down the turbocharger (ONLY for five minutes and if they came fresh from the highway with no city driving to the destination) or to build up air pressure after initial startup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

When it gets cold out diesel fuel turns into a gel like consistency. This is not good for engines. Diesels tend to have a warming plug in the fuel tank to warm the diesel up before starting the engine, but if you keep the engine running you keep the fuel warm enough to not let it geletanize </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
