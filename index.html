		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my mind, there are two categories of unusable characters: reserved characters and the rest of them, which I'll call disallowed characters.</p>
<p>Reserved characters are characters used by the filesystem itself.  For example, most Unix filesystems separate directories/folders by using a slash ('/'), and mark the end of a name using a null character (0x00).  They don't allow you to use these characters because using them would be stepping on the toes of how the filesystem itself stores data about filenames. (In regards to the slash, it really has more to do with how the OS delimits paths rather than the filesystem itself.)</p>
<p>Other characters are arbitrarily disallowed, usually to avoid confusion.  In Windows, those characters include the asterisk('<em>'), question mark('?'), doublequote('&quot;'), less than ('&lt;'), greater than ('&gt;'), and pipe ('|').  While these characters don't mean anything special to the filesystem itself, they mean special things to the command shell.  In order to prevent a user from getting in a confusing situation where a file is named &quot;`</em>.txt<code>" and then running "</code>del *.txt<code>" ends up deleting more files than intended, Windows decided to prevent the user from getting in this situation by preventing the use of those characters in filenames.  (Unix systems do not have this restriction.)  I suspect that Windows also includes ('/') in this category.  It looks like the backslash ('\\') directory delimiter, but it's probably avoided because command options are started with a slash, as in "</code>dir /w`&quot;.</p>
<p>Windows also disallows the colon (':'), which has special meaning to the OS.  It actually indicates that the name that preceded it is a device.  Drive letters are the obvious examples, but there are a number of others, including &quot;CON&quot; (the console), &quot;LPT1&quot; (through at least 3, which are printers), &quot;PRN&quot; (also a printer), and some others that I'm forgetting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some special characters mean something in the code used to make the file system. It would be possible to make the system work around this, but it's easier and safer to just prevent you from using such characters.</p>
<p>For example, a filepath might be C:\Users\MrMeltJr\Photos\pepes\le_rarest_pepe.jpeg</p>
<p>This means that the file le_rarest_pepe.jpeg is in the folder pepes, which is in the folder Photos, which is in MrMeltJr, which is in Users, which is on the C drive. Now, if I named the file le\rarest\pepe.jpeg, the computer would now think it's a file called pepe.jpeg in a folder called rarest, which is in a folder called le, and so on. But none of those folder exist, so it can't find the file. Like I said, it's possible to code things so that it can tell the difference between weird file names and actual filepaths, but it that would make the system slower (since it has to run through those extra checks every time you do pretty much anything with any file) and it's less reliable (since it's just more opportunities for something to go wrong). Safer and easier to just prevent those characters from being used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example '/' is used as a directory separator, so if you were to allow it in a filename, there would be no way to determine whether the path &quot;abc/xyz&quot; refers to the file named &quot;abc/xyz&quot; or the file names &quot;xyz&quot; in the directory &quot;abc&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While most of these explanations are mostly correct, the real answer is you can put those characters in filenames if you know how by escaping them, at least on certain filesystems, but I don't recommend it because it just causes problems. </p>
<p>For example, if I want to name a file &quot;*&quot; on Ext2 in Linux:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Operating system uses this characters as templates. For example, for searching files by parts of its name, for redirecting input/output streams, and as path delimiters.</p>
<p>If you want to find some files on your disk but can't remember how used word 'color' or 'colour', you can use this template: &quot;colo?r&quot; (without quotes and with question mark).
Here question mark used as replacement for one symbol (any allowed) or its absence. Results can be: &quot;color&quot;, &quot;colour&quot;, &quot;colo7r&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>Slash/Backslash symbols used on different platforms (windows/Linux/web) as path delimiters.
Windows: &quot;C:\games\game1.exe&quot; - sounds like &quot;go to 'C:' (look at another special symbol) drive then 'games' directory inside and find file named 'game1.exe'&quot; inside this folder.
Linux: &quot;/usr/bin/games/game1.exe&quot; - means the same but Linux isn't using drive letters.
Web: &quot;ftp://pub/docs/doc56.txt&quot; - 'ftp' is a file transfer protocol, 'pub' and 'docs' are folders, 'doc56.txt' is a filename.</p>
<p>Definition of some symbols can be different for different contexts. You can find all of the symbols and its description and use-cases by googling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By folding the paper in half diagonally and horizontally, and then further bisecting the resulting angles, you arrive at a handful of standard forms (&quot;bases&quot;) with a certain number of flaps (which can be formed into the wings or limbs of whatever animal you're trying to represent). The crane base has four long flaps (from the four corners of the paper) and one short one (from the center of the square), and those form the head, tail, wings, and back of the traditional crane. A folder who knows this base might decide to use it to make some other kind of bird, or a dragon, fish, etc. Other traditional bases have other numbers and arrangements of flaps that suggest other animals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy in an isolated system (such as yours) always increases towards the maximum.</p>
<p>For a system like you are describing, the maximum entropy state is one where the molecules have a <del>normal</del> boltzmann distribution of energy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned the Boltzmann distribution, but that's only correct for the canonical ensemble. If you have a completely closed and isolated system, you have a microcanonical ensemble. The equilibrium distribution for the microcanoncial ensemble is not the Boltzmann distribution, but rather a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>So all the particles in the gas will not have the same energy nor speed. But they'll obey a probability distribution which assigns the same probability to every accessible state.</p>
<p>If your system is closed but not isolated, and held at thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T, then you've got a canonical ensemble. In that case, the probability of each particle being in a state with energy E<em><em>i</em></em> is not uniform, but rather proportional to exp[-E<em><em>i</em></em>/kT], where k is Boltzmann's constant.</p>
<p>If you write this in terms of velocities (assuming a nonrelativistic gas), it becomes exp[-m<em><em>i</em></em>v<em><em>i</em></em>^(2)/2kT]. I've written the mass as m<em><em>i</em></em> to account for the different species in your second situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most gases can be approximately fairly well as an ideal gas. The velocity distribution for ideal gases in thermodynamic equilibrium is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">Maxwell-Boltzman Distribution</a>. It's mean value defines the kinetic temperature and the distribution is slightly positively skewed.<br />
In real life gases won't behave exactly like ideal gases, so there might be some differences to this <em>model</em> but the main idea is still the same: The particles won't all have the same velocity but rather some distribution of velocities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would be more specific in the title, but it would be too incomprehensible and cut-short probably. It will take some explanation before I get to my question again but it's there:</p>
<p>I was working on a math puzzle a while back where I had to guess the next number in a series. The given series was &quot;1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, __&quot; and I had to guess the last number. I guessed correctly, but instead of intuitively realizing that the pattern was &quot; x^2 &quot;, I found the answer via another method.</p>
<p>I found the differences between the adjacent numbers in the series, i.e. 4 - 1 = 3, 9 - 4 = 5, so on, and used those to create a new series: &quot;3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13&quot;. I then performed the same operation on that line, finding the differences between adjacent numbers and then using those to create a new line: &quot;2, 2, 2, 2, 2&quot;.</p>
<p>I thought this was interesting, because by performing this differences method twice on my given series, I was able to bottom-out/hit a ceiling at the number 2*. The number 2 was useful, because I could then work my way back down/up (depends on how you write it down, I guess) to find the next number in the series: 64.</p>
<p>I decided to try this again on a new, related series. I made the series &quot;1, 8, 27, 64, 125&quot; ( x^3 ) and resolved to use the same differences method on this line. The first time yields: 7, 19, 37, 61&quot;; the second time yields: &quot;12, 18, 24&quot;; the third time bottoms out at: &quot;6, 6&quot;.</p>
<p>So ( x^2 ) bottoms out at 2<em>, and ( x^3 ) bottoms out at 6</em>.</p>
<p>I continued this with ( x^4 ): &quot;1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401&quot;. The differences method yields: &quot;15, 65, 175, 369, 671, 1105&quot;; again, and it yields: &quot;50, 110, 194, 302, 434&quot;; again, and it yields: &quot;60, 84, 108, 132&quot;; again, and it yields: &quot;24, 24, 24&quot;.</p>
<p>So ( x^4 ) bottoms out at 24*.</p>
<p>Finally, my question: Is there a name for these bedrock numbers that I've marked with the asterisks? </p>
<p>Additionally, I would like to know: is there reading material on the matter? Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?</p>

<p>2 underlies ( x^2 ),
6 underlies ( x^3 ),
24 underlies ( x^4 ),
and so on, for reasons explained above.
Why?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, for x^n the number you're looking for will be n!, which is shorthand for n * (n-1) * (n-2) *....*3*2*1.</p>
<p>For example, x^7 would end up with the number 7! = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040</p>
<h2>To see why:</h2>
<p>Focus on x^2 to start. </p>
<p>To generalize the difference between consecutive items in the sequence, we have:</p>
<p>(x+1)^2 - x^2</p>
<p>Do some algebra and get:<br />
<strong>2</strong>x^<strong>1</strong> + 1</p>
<p>Repeat the process:</p>
<p>[2(x+1) + 1] - [2x+1]<br />
= 2</p>
<p>So there's your 2.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now we do this with x^3:</p>
<p>(x+1)^3 - x^3<br />
= <strong>3</strong>x^<strong>2</strong> + 3x + 1</p>
<p>Repeat the process:<br />
[3(x+1)^2 +3(x+1) + 1] - [3x^2 + 3x + 1]<br />
= <strong>6</strong>x^<strong>1</strong> + 6 </p>
<p>Repeat the process:<br />
6(x+1) + 6 - [6x+6]<br />
= 6 [aka <strong>6</strong>x^<strong>0</strong>]</p>
<h2>Making sense of it:</h2>
<p>Notice that I've bolded a few coefficients and exponents in the above section. As you go through the repetitive process, you see that your highest power term always gets canceled out in the algebra. In the x^3 example, you start with 1x^3 being your highest power term. Then you do the difference process and you end up with 3x^2 being your highest power. Then you do the difference process again and you end up with 6x^1 being your highest power. Then you do it once more and 6x^0 is your highest power. </p>
<p><strong>In the x^3 example, do you see how the highest power term goes like this as we go through all the steps:</strong></p>
<p>x^3<br />
3x^2<br />
6x^1<br />
6x^0</p>
<p><strong>So the general pattern is:</strong><br />
x^n<br />
nx^(n-1)<br />
n(n-1)x^(n-2)<br />
n(n-1)(n-2)x^(n-3)<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
n(n-1)(n-2)...3*2*1</p>
<p>which is the formula we talked about up top.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something vaguely related to this phenomenon, but sadly I have no source (hopefully someone can back me up with real sources).<br />
If I remember correctly, <strong>a part</strong> of enjoying music is being able to relate to the music, being able to predict what comes next. That is why music that is &quot;in tune&quot; will sound more pleasant than music out of tune, because we don't listen to much music out of tune and therefore are not accustomed to it. Music that we do not like is generally music we cannot predict well and that doesn't stimulate us. By listening to music that we do not enjoy, we are forcing our brains to work hard at trying to guess what comes next but because it's no good at it, it needs to start from scratch again.</p>
<p>A useful analogy is that of how a (computer) processor predicts what it needs to do:<br />
First it will pick which branch (of multiple possible choices) of execution to expect.<br />
Then, possibly before it even knows which branch it will <em>really</em> take, it will load some relevant information into memory.<br />
When the CPU realizes that it is following another path, it has done a lot of work for nothing and discards the information and starts over from the beginning of the mispredicted branch.</p>
<p>It's possible that our brains evolved this &quot;feature&quot; to reward intelligence (or rather, being good at predicting outcomes), but since I am a software engineer and not a biologist or geneticist, I really wouldn't know.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> (disclaimer) to clear up some confusion:<br />
I never stated that our brains <em>prefer</em> predictability over spontaneity, just that predictability <em>plays a part</em> in it. Indeed many of us seek out unpredictability in music, there is a balance to be had. Likewise, once we can perfectly predict the music we can get bored of it, causing an inverse effect. There are a lot of good points made in the thread of this comment which either further elaborate or provide alternate points of views, all of which may or may not be valid. </p>
<p>I personally think that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr8758/" target="_blank">this reply provides a good alternate point of view</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr7he1/" target="_blank">this partly addresses loudness (which I did not touch on)</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr5iw7/" target="_blank">this drives another alternate point of view, touching on the notion of music appreciation as learned behavior</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loudness may not be the culprit. Have you ever heard a brand new song, and despite it being by one of your favorite artists, you don't really enjoy it that much the first few times you hear it? Its your favorite artist though, so you'll listen to it a few more times and maybe hear it on the radio a time or two. Then one day you realize you actually like the song very much. <em>Seems weird, right?</em></p>
<p>I'll diverge a second. As humans, we generally stick to habits, and any deviation from our typical habits feels unusual and different. It takes a couple (sometimes a lot more) attempts at a new routine to turn it into a habit, and our bodies might respond during that transition period by aches and pains. Telling you, hey this is different, I don't like different. Music works on us the same way, because listening to music is a habit. You hear music you don't like and your brain finds a way to balance it out, or force you to stop it, which is where a headache can occur.</p>
<p>It turns out that the radio industry has had to create techniques of gradually adjusting listeners to new songs, even if radio executives already know the song is going to be a hit. The challenge is to prevent you from changing the radio channel (or turning it off) when you hear a new song that you don't quite like right away. One way to do this is by sticking the new song in between two already popular and well liked ones. You don't immediately notice that this unfamiliar new song is playing because you just heard one you really like. What happens by the time you notice the new song playing? It ends and another popular song comes back on. After hearing the new song a few times, even if you weren't all that focused on it, your brain is more familiar with it. Have this happen a few more times and you might soon find that you really like the song because your brain got </p>
<p>I first read about this in a book called &quot;The Power of Habit&quot; by Charles Duhigg, which explores our habits in general, including how they can be developed or changed, and uses music as an example at times. One example in the book is &quot;Hey Ya&quot; by Outkast. It became an incredibly popular song, but at first radio listeners literally hated it. To make people like it, the song was first squeezed between two already popular ones and eventually it reached the top spot on Billboard for 8 weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbasket.blogspot.com/2014/12/who-killed-good-music.html" target="_blank">Another article that discusses the Hey Ya situation and references The Power of Habit</a></p>
<p>Edit: I want to summarize 2 other situations that have been asked in comments.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Why do I dislike music I've listened to constantly, such as at work? My brain knows what to expect right?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose you like country music and hate heavy metal, but your jerk of a coworker always plays his metal too loud. You could hear his music over and over again but odds are that you won't like it ever. Simply put: you don't like metal, you like country. You respond positively to country and metal is nothing like it, so your brain forms no connections between the two.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What about a brand new song that I instantly fell in love with? Even if the artist is someone I've never heard of?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>It's probably pretty similar to something else you've heard before, musically speaking. The song's beat, the artists' voices, the rhythm, etc. something about the music itself was noticed by the brain and connected to other songs you like. What's the thing about Nickelback songs? They all sound pretty similar, and most people that like one of their songs (crazy, I know) tend to like most of their music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your question is very specific to right after the winter solstice, because the Sun actually rises and sets between days at varying rates, as <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/new-york" target="_blank">shown here</a>. The Sun traces out a sinusoidal pattern in the sky over the course of a year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-exposure_photography#Solargraphy" target="_blank">shown here</a>. In a similar vein, the sunrise and sunset is a sinusoidal pattern, where the greatest rate of change occurs at the equinoxes, so you can expect up to 3 minutes of change per day near the equinoxes at mid-latitudes. Meanwhile, at the equator, there is very little change, and in the arctic circle, sunrise and sunset can change as much as half an hour per day up to having only one day with a sunset at the North Pole.</p>
<p>To answer your actual question about the difference of sunrise and sunset gaining time though, it actually has to do with solar noon, or culmination. The time at which the Sun gets to the highest point in the sky gets later and later in winter because the Earth's orbit is an ellipse and is going faster since it is nearest to the Sun in winter. This can be read about more <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-dont-sunrise-and-sunset-times-change-symmetrically.426655/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/38270/why-is-the-solar-noon-time-different-every-day" target="_blank">here</a>. Basically, the difference between sunrise to solar noon and solar noon to sunset is roughly the same, but solar noon itself changes. Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a cool effect due to the fact the Earth is not on a circular orbit. Instead, it is elliptical, which means it travels faster around perihelion (January) and slower around aphelion (July).</p>
<p>We must also consider the fact that, with respect to background stars, the Earth spins on its orbit 366.25 times per year, with the trip around the sun effectively subtracting one day and giving the usual 365.25. That means that a day with respect to fixed stars (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time" target="_blank">sidereal day</a> ) is slightly shorter than an apparent day at 23 hours, 56 minutes. </p>
<p>So, if the Earth wasn't moving on its orbit, 23h56m after you saw the Sun in one location, it would be seen in the same location. The reason it shifts is because the Earth has moved ~1 degree (well, 366.5/360 degrees, or 4 minutes) <em>around</em> the Sun. So the Earth has to turn just that bit more for the Sun to reach the same point it was yesterday.</p>
<p>Now, if the Earth was on a circular orbit, all would be fine, and every 24 hours the Sun would return to the same location in the sky (negating seasons). BUT, it has an elliptical orbit. This means the speed around the Sun varies over the year, so as you get towards perihelion, the Sun actually appears to move slightly faster around the earth. But we set a day from the <em>average</em> spin of the Earth.</p>
<p>Hence near perihelion the Earth is moving faster, and after 23h56m+4mins, the Earth hasn't quite spun enough to make up for it's speed on its orbit. The effect of this is that the apparent position of the Sun compared to the average position seems to move forwards. As sunset and sunrise are roughly equidistant from when the sun is highest, sunrise seems to stay still while sunset races away.</p>
<p>At aphelion the opposite happens and after 23h56m+4mins the Earth, which is travelling more slowly than usual, slightly over-rotates with respect to the Sun. Hence the position of the Sun appears to be moving backwards during the (Northern) summer months.</p>
<p>I hope that makes some sense. The entire effect is quite confusing, but it's why we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma" target="_blank">Analemma</a>'s, and it's why the sunrise and sunset seem to move around, especially around perihelion, when Earth moves fastest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Close to the solstices the sun is at the top (summer) and bottom (winter) of the figure 8 pattern. As the sun &quot;turns the corner&quot; from our perspective it is moving more laterally than up and down for several days. During that time the sunrise/sunset times don't deviate too much. Look at your chart right around Jan 8, you will see the sunrise/sunset times start to make bigger changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am assuming that you meant &quot;Spring Equinox&quot;. The closest approach of the earth to sun happens in Northern Winter, Jan. 4; Because the Sun is at the nearest focus on the orbit but the earth's rotation is petty constant, the observed solar transit is sped up before the winter solstice and retarded with respect to a clock after. This effect is greatest from fall until spring.</p>
<p>This is also why the switch from daylight to standard time is not symmetric to length of daylight. The equation of Time, and that figure eight on some globes tells us that we can extend daylight savings lime in the fall and retard it in the spring because the sunset is as much as 20 minutes late in the fall and we can wait until early March to begin daylight savings time because the sun is slow by that amount even though the length of day is more in March than it is in November.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, which is absolutely not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four standard drinks per day.  Milder symptoms have been found with two drinks per day during the early part of pregnancy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder" target="_blank">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historically, people would be drinking &quot;small beer&quot; (small beer is beer made from grains already used to brew a batch of beer), which is about 2% abv compared to today's 5%+.  So the beer wasn't as alcoholic, and didn't cause as much of an issue as drinking a similar volume of beer would today.</p>
<p>Also, never forget that fetal alcohol syndrome was absolutely a problem in the past, even if not directly caused by the really weak beer they were drinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 1750.... A letter was written to Parliament voicing
concerns about the gin problem and stating that, &quot;too often the
cause of weak, feeble, and distempered children, who must be,
instead of an advantage and strength, [become] a charge to their
country.&quot; <a href="http://www.come-over.to/FAS/congress.htm" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think history makes a fuckload more sense when you believe that most people in any position of power before 1800-ish were kinda drunk all the time and were born with some combination of inbreeding and FAS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ohm's Law is not a law derivable from Maxwell's equations, but rather just a description of how many materials behave, derived directly from experiment only. (There is some justification for it though from an atomic perspective.) All materials will disobey Ohm's Law past their dielectric breakpoint. There are also materials that just simply don't obey Ohm's Law even under a weak electric field (e.g., semiconductors), and they are said to be <em>non-ohmic</em>.</p>
<p>Also note that if you are measuring resistance in a lab and not controlling for joule heating, you will find that <em>V</em> is not a linear function of <em>I</em> simply because the resistance (say, of a bulb) increases with temperature, which itself increases with current. Hence <em>V</em> = <em>I</em>*<em>R</em>(<em>I</em>), with <em>R</em> a strictly increasing function of <em>I</em> (i.e., not constant). This is not necessarily a violation of Ohm's Law though, because the full statement of Ohm's Law has the caveat that it applies to a circuit element <em>in a given state</em>, in particular, at constant temperature. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> Some clarification is needed here since many of the comments are getting some things wrong, <em>seemingly</em> contradicting me, or just outright contradicting me.</p>
<p>In many physical systems, we have some set of equations that hold no matter what (e.g., Maxwell's equations in classical electrodynamics, or Navier-Stokes equation in fluid dynamics, or Vlasov-Maxwell equations in plasma physics). Often our set of equations is not <em>closed</em>, which roughly means we have more variables than equations. The problem of closure is particularly notorious in plasma physics. So we need to supplement our equations with what are called <em>constitutive relations</em>. These are equations that hold only for a specific material and only under certain conditions or approximations. They allow us to add enough equations to our system of equations to make it solvable.</p>
<p>For instance, in fluid dynamics we may use the approximation that the fluid is Newtonian, which gives us a constitutive relation for the Cauchy stress tensor, the viscosity tensor, and the velocity field. (We may even <em>further</em> approximate the fluid as homogeneous and/or isotropic, which gives us a further constitutive relation that simplifies the form of the viscosity tensor.) There would still be the issue possibly of closing the equations with a proper constitutive relation for the pressure.</p>
<p>In electrodynamics, one such constitutive relation we can impose is Ohm's Law, which is <strong>J</strong> = σ<strong>E</strong>, where σ is a <em>fixed</em> number. This is a fine enough approximation for a wide variety of media. Of course, if you want to be more accurate or if you are investigating a regime in which Ohm's Law is not true for a material for which it usually is, we may write that <strong>J</strong> = <strong>σ</strong>.<strong>E</strong>. Here <strong>σ</strong> is a rank-2 tensor, and this is a more general constitutive relation. (See /u/RobusEtCeleritas's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5kouq8/how_true_is_ohms_law/dbpvwmn/" target="_blank">post below</a> for some more details.)</p>
<p>Of course, we can always make up whatever constitutive relation we want. But if it gives us nonsense results or results that very badly approximate our problem, it won't get used much, if at all. Ohm's Law is a good approximation for many media, in particular, many simple circuit elements for which the temperature (and other state parameters) do not vary too much. So Ohm's Law gets used quite a bit. </p>
<p>Some of the confusion in the other comments I think lies in treating (or mistreating) Ohm's Law as a <em>definition</em>. For instance, we <em>define</em> a Newtonian fluid to be a fluid such that <strong>τ</strong> = <strong>μ</strong>.(<strong>∇**</strong>v<strong>), where </strong>μ<strong> is a <em>fixed</em> rank-4 tensor. But it's just a constitutive relation and we know that not all fluids will obey this equation. Similarly, we <em>define</em> an ohmic medium to be a medium such that </strong>J<strong> = σ</strong>E**, but it doesn't hold for all media. In that sense, Ohm's Law is absolutely true always because it's just a definition. Anything that violates Ohm's Law is just a non-ohmic medium. </p>
<p>Finally, note that the electrical resistance <em>R</em> of a circuit element is <em>defined</em> as the ratio of the voltage <em>V</em> and current <em>I</em> through that same element. Of course, there is no reason to believe that <em>R</em> is constant or even independent of either <em>V</em> or <em>I</em>. So in that sense the equation V = IR is <em>always</em> true no matter what. But that equation is <em>not</em> Ohm's Law. Ohm's Law is <em>specifically</em> the statement that <em>R</em> is independent of both <em>V</em> and <em>I</em> (but may still depend on other state parameters such as temperature and strain), i.e., that V and I are <em>proportional</em>. And so Ohm's Law is emphatically not always true.</p>
<p>The same exact phenomenon occurs in elastics. We can <em>define</em> a Hookean body to be a body such that <strong>σ</strong> = -<strong>k</strong>.<strong>ε</strong>, where <strong>k</strong> is a <em>fixed</em> rank-4 tensor (here <strong>σ</strong> is the stress tensor and <strong>ε</strong> is the strain tensor). In one dimension, this reduces to F = -kx, where <em>k</em> is a constant. This is just the usual <em>Hooke's Law</em> you learn in high school physics. But no one in their right mind is going to say something like &quot;Hooke's Law holds for all elastic bodies&quot;. That's just absurd. It's only a constitutive relation between the stress and strain that just so happens to be a good approximation for a wide range of materials.</p>
<p>Ohm's Law <em>feels</em> different to a lot of people because, frankly, I think they forget that the equation V = IR on its own is a definition of <em>R</em> and <em>not</em> Ohm's Law. (Note that Hooke's Law F = -kx is not used as the definition of anything, since <em>F</em> and <em>x</em> can and are defined completely independently of springs. Electrical resistance, on the other hand, needs to be defined in terms of circuit elements.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Things like Ohms law are totally correct for ideal components, and are close enough to be useful as long as certain factors aren't in play. For example, wires can be treated as having zero resistance unless you have massive currents or very low voltages. Wire wound resistors can be treated as pure resistors as long as you don't have or don't care about AC frequency responses, etc.</p>
<p>Learning where these things matter and where they don't is a good chunk of learning to be an electronics engineer, but in my experience it isn't taught explicitly, you just pick up a feeling for it as you go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did you allow for the temperature coefficient of resistance? It's never (?) exactly zero and not always very linear.</p>
<p>TCR has become really useful for e-cigarettes in the last couple of years because the changing resistance allows the (average) temperature of the heating coil to be measured via V/I, so newer tech can produce vapour at a set temperature and prevent wicks from burning if they dry out. This page provides some handy data for the various metals used in e-cigarettes: <a href="http://www.steam-engine.org/wirewiz.asp" target="_blank">http://www.steam-engine.org/wirewiz.asp</a> It's a bit confusing because it's used for designing heating coils - just choose a metal from the box below the plot and it'll give you the plot for it (if available) and the box on the left will repopulate too. </p>
<p>Kanthal, the default, has a TCR very close to zero (hence the near horizontal graph) - its stability is one reason why it is so good as a heating wire. The other wires listed all have a positive TCR (because it would be dangerous to use a wire where the resistance decreased whilst drawing current from a lithium battery) but it can be negative, eg carbon fibre. <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/resistivity-conductivity-d_418.html" target="_blank">The Engineering Toolbox</a> has a useful page.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's a quantum mechanical theory where you use transmission and reflection probabilities in an electron's path to connect microscopic theory to resistivity (and hence Ohm's law), but that's beside the point.</p>
<p>Ohm's law is defined to be true.</p>
<p>Your confusion stems from the fact that <strong>resistance is not always constant over time</strong>. This does not violate Ohm, it just makes R an R(t). <strong>Your resisting element warms up as current travels through, modulating the resistivity</strong>, and hence the resistance.</p>
<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/resis.html" target="_blank">Here you can find the relation between resistance and resistivity</a>. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>For this explanation to make sense, it's important that you know what bits and bytes are, and how a computer uses them to store information. This is a topic of its own, and you can find ELI5 threads that explain it.</em></p>
<p>A simple algorithm is counting how many there are of each byte in a set of data. Remember that a byte consists of 8 bits. You then replace the most common byte with a single bit, 1. The second most common one is replaced by two bits, 01. The third most is replaced by 001, etc.</p>
<p>In the end, you end up with a lookup table, and a bit pattern.</p>
<p>The string &quot;AAABBC&quot; looks like this in binary (in bits, with added spaces for easier reading):</p>
<pre><code>01000001 01000001 01000001 01000010 01000010 01000011
A        A        A        B        B        C          </code></pre>
<p>But if we replace every occurrence of the most common pattern, &quot;01000001&quot; with just 1, etc, we end up with something that looks like this (still with added spaces):</p>
<pre><code>1 1 1 01 01 001
A A A B  B  C</code></pre>
<p>Since a byte is 8 bits long, and we have 10 bits here, our result would be two bytes:</p>
<pre><code>11101010 01000000
AAAB B C   (Padding)</code></pre>
<p>We have effectively compressed 6 bytes down to 2.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edit, and some possibly interesting points:</strong></p>
<p>It's important to remember that to be able to unzip a file, you must keep track of which replacements you've made. Somehow, you have to remember that 1 corresponds to 01000001. In this particular algorithm, you can declare a dictionary by first listing how many items are in the list, then all the items in the list itself, and finally the zipped string.</p>
<p>In the case above, this would result in the following:</p>
<pre><code>Length   A        B        C        AAAB B C   Padding        
00000011 01000001 01000010 01000011 11101010 01000000
(The length being 3.)</code></pre>
<p>This means that out of our original string, which was 6 bytes long, we've now zipped it down to 2 bytes, but we also added 4 bytes of data to know what the zipped portion means.. :)</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that it's not always useful to zip data. Very small amounts of data, or data that is very diverse, could end up being no smaller, or sometimes even bigger than the unzipped version.</p>
<p>The algorithm still works, though. We could pack a few more A's into this, and still keep the size at 6 bytes, for example.</p>
<pre><code>AAAAAABBC</code></pre>
<p>would turn into</p>
<pre><code>Length   A        B        C        AAAAAAB  B C  Padding        
00000011 01000001 01000010 01000011 11111101 01001000</code></pre>
<p>which is still only 6 bytes, but we've packed 9 bytes into it. We could add another 3 A's, and it would still be only 6 bytes:</p>
<pre><code>AAAAAABBCAAA</code></pre>
<p>would turn into</p>
<pre><code>Length   A        B        C        AAAAAAB  B C  AAA
00000011 01000001 01000010 01000011 11111101 01001111</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>Another quick edit:</strong></p>
<p>I should mention here that this algorithm is a slight variation of something called Huffman's algorithm. Huffman is used in combiantion with LZ77 in zip files.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the data computers regularly deal with is not random, but has various more or less obvious patterns in it. If you know what patterns to expect (say, by already seeing some of the data, or by knowing what sort of data it is), then you can use that knowledge to convert large patterns into smaller symbols and then add a decoding instruction to the file to convert the smaller symbols back into the larger patterns, and if the patterns occur frequently enough, the space you save by converting them into smaller symbols outweighs the size of the decoding instruction.</p>
<p>Here's an example: Imagine that you took a TXT file of one of Shakespeare's plays, analyzed it, and found that the letter 'z' appears 2000 times and the two-letter sequence 'th' appears 5000 times. In that case, you could switch all the original 'z' for 'th', and all the original 'th' for 'z', and put a note at the beginning of the file saying 'before reading this, replace all the 'z' with 'th' and vice versa'. By replacing the occurrences of 'z' with 'th' you increase the size by 2000 letters, but by replacing the occurrences of 'th' with 'z' you <em>decrease</em> the size by 5000 letters, and because the note is only 65 letters long (counting spaces and punctuation), you end up with a TXT file that is smaller than the original by 2935 letters but can still be precisely reconstructed into the original by following the instructions in the note. You've taken advantage of the fact that 'th' occurs especially frequently (and 'z' especially <em>in</em>frequently by comparison) to produce a file that ultimately says the same thing (assuming the note is followed correctly by whoever reads it) but has fewer letters in it.</p>
<p>The actual techniques used by modern data compression software are more advanced than this, but the basic idea, that of finding patterns and encoding them using smaller amounts of information, is the same.</p>
<p>Note that <em>not all</em> types of data have patterns that you can take advantage of in this way. In particular, data that has <em>already</em> been compressed using a technique like this tends to have fewer patterns in it than the original version.</p>
<p>(This is a copy+paste of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3ymt63/eli5_how_can_the_3gb_zip_i_download_turn_into_7gb/cyess3t/" target="_blank">previous post</a> I wrote on the subject, so I apologize if it doesn't seem written precisely to address your question. If you have further questions about these techniques or their mathematical limitations, or any clarification of the above, ask away.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to reply because the top explanations are very different from ZIP and do not capture what makes ZIP special. One top explanation is RLE (run length encoding) and teaches how to replace strings like &quot;RRRRRGGGBB&quot; with &quot;5R3G2B&quot; (5 Rs, 3 Gs, and 2Bs). RLE is simple, but is not ZIP, and unlike ZIP, cannot effectively compress strings like RGBRGBRGBRGB... Another top explanation is dictionary-based compression, where long bit patterns are replaced with much smaller offsets into a dictionary. Then the dictionary and the smaller offsets are stored together, ready to be decompressed by looking up each offset in the dictionary they were stored with. This is also not ZIP and I think does not explain what makes ZIP really magical and elegant. ZIP is special because like dictionary compression it performs an effective substitution-based compression, and so is more effective than RLE, but unlike dictionary compression, it does not have to store the dictionary alongside the compressed output, making it much more efficient than dictionary compression in the end (the dictionary is quite large).</p>
<p>ZIP uses a sliding window. It scans over the uncompressed data from start to finish with a fixed-sized window and prints out the compressed data to a separate output file. So it might make more sense to say ZIP encodes rather than compresses the original input file, as the input file is left untouched while ZIP is running, and instead a new encoded (compressed) output file is constructed alongside the original uncompressed file. What ZIP will do is try to replace each string in the uncompressed input file by printing a much smaller offset to the compressed output file. Each time ZIP does this we say it is &quot;replacing&quot; the string from the input file. The key idea in ZIP is to replace the string just beyond the sliding window with a pointer to a matching string found within the sliding window, and then move the sliding window forward to encompass the string we just replaced, and kick out a string from the sliding window to keep the window a fixed size:</p>
<pre><code>uncompressed input, with window ending at '|', valid strings to point at are 0, 1, 2, and 3:
|(3)RBGR(2)RRR(1)R(0)BBB|RBGRBBBRRRGBG...

compressed output, with window ending at '|', strings replaced with pointers into window:
|RBGRRRRRBBB|302GBG...

move window in input forward now...
RBGRRRRRBB|(3)B(2)RBGR(1)BBB(0)RRR|GBG...

move window in compressed output forward now...
RBGRRRRRBBB|302|GBG...</code></pre>
<p>If a string cannot be matched up with a string within the window, that string is not replaced, but instead becomes a valid string to point at within the sliding window, hopefully helping to compress later strings. This also means that when starting compression, the window is empty, and it cannot replace strings with smaller pointers as there are no valid strings to point at yet. ZIP has to &quot;get started&quot;. Once it encodes some data however, it has built up enough contents for its sliding window of valid pointers and is able to achieve good compression from then on.</p>
<p>The most elegant thing about ZIP is during decompression, the contents of the sliding window where the values of the valid pointers are stored is always decompressed first, so subsequent pointers can always be decompressed. This is very roughly like surfing, where the decompression of data is like the wave, and the end of the sliding window, where we are replacing compressed pointers with their original pointer values is like the surf board. We complete decompression when the surf board reaches the shore. Since the 'dictionary' (the wave front) is built dynamically during decompression, there is no need to store it with the compressed output.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an example of an exception to the already provided answers - in Poland an abandoned bunker has provided a situation where wood ants are regularly separated from their colony by falling down a vertical pipe under the main colony.   Because it is so common, a semi-functional secondary colony operates underground without much food or light.  The ants dig, clean away dead ant bodies to the large &quot;graveyard&quot; surrounding the colony, and mostly act as they would above ground, but eventually starve.  The colony only keeps going by the regular rain of new workers from above.   The scientists studying them aren't sure if they eat anything, like bat guano or mites living on the dead ants, but as of yet haven't identified a food source.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It stops eating and wastes away and dies.  It will try hard to get back for as long as it can first.  The bee needs the hive.  The hive needs the bee.  Social insects aren't following orders from anyone, they are acting on instincts written at the level of DNA.  The queen (and king, if termites) are just as bound to the system as the workers.  Many ants even have multiple queens per colony for redundancy.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to assume social insects can't think for themselves because of the colony.  In the lab they will learn to solve a problem and then teach the solution to others.  They are just intimately a part of the group.  Don't think of a fascist slave state.  Think of an army unit: when one is smart everyone gets smarter; when one is strong, everyone becomes strong.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a large misunderstanding here in that the insect is &quot;following orders&quot;.  It's not.  It's following programming.  Big difference here.  </p>
<p>I know for bees (so I assume for most hive insects) they function on very specific &quot;rules&quot;.  So for example, a &quot;scout&quot; bee will fill up with honey (fuel) and fly out (up to 4 miles away) to find a source of nectar and pollen.  Once it's found, it'll bring a small amount back, and then do a little dance to tell the other bees where to find it.  The bees will taste the samples, and if everything meets the criteria, they'll suck up JUST ENOUGH honey for the trip, and head out.  If they get blown off course, or otherwise delayed enough that they run out of &quot;fuel&quot; before getting back, they die.  Sure, it's not good for them, but for the hive as a whole (which is the more important organism) it's better that a few bees die this way while conserving &quot;fuel&quot; than to waste excess fuel by having bees overeat before each trip.  </p>
<p>No commands were given, and the queen had no part in the process.  </p>
<p>If the queen dies, her lemon-grass smelling pheromone starts to wear off, and the bees will go to work creating some new queen cells from the most recently laid eggs.  Other than that, the existence of a queen has little to do with a bee's day-to-day programming.  </p>
