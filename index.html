Two words: fat distribution.
For reasons that a chemist/endocrinologist can better explain, hormones affect the way our bodies distribute fat.
Now, this is a little more roundabout, but I have seen the way testosterone affects facial shape firsthand. When a AFAB (assigned female at birth) person takes testosterone, fat moves away from places like the jawline and cheeks, which causes their face to look more traditionally masculine.
With estrogen, it's sort of in reverse. Fat gets distributed to places on the face that makes it more traditionally feminine. More padding on the jawline and cheeks, for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reduction of muscle mass and redistribution of fat deposits.
It's as simple as that. Testosterone causes your body to have more muscle. Since Hormon replacement therapy includes a Testosterone blocker the body changes to a female typical muscle mass. Since everyone is training their &quot;chewing muscles&quot; the same way blocking testosterone causes your jaw to appear slimmer.</p>
<p>The fat stuff is on the estrogen. Different tissues in the body react differently to either sex hormone changing the dominant sex hormone causes one type to grow and the other to shrink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your second question is the more important.</p>
<p>At 1.35 m/s^2 , there is a planetary body where the average human of the same dimensions would weigh only around 30 lbs, and furthermore large-scale monsters like the Titans could theoretically move around. Plus, it can be theoretically terraformed for human life. </p>
<p>That location is, of course, Saturn's moon, <strong>Titan</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have answered the gear physics well. Lethal forces across the board. It's the same type of issue that ruins FTL travel fantasies. </p>
<p>To expand a bit more on the animal side of the equation though, the mass of most creatures follows a cubic scaling with size, while their skeletal structures only increase squarely. The largest creatures are all in the ocean due to the water essentially supporting their masses against gravity. The largest titans would hardly be able to move, and their size itself might kill them. Breathing and cardiac issues would wreck them,  especially as bipedal mammals. In fact, the small ones, which are blocked by the wall, would be the only actual issue as predators. </p>
<p>So you would need either everything to be underwater, or go to a planetary body that allows both sides of the equation to be viable, and still the humans still might be too fragile to operate the gear properly. Think of how bungie cords work, then realize that the 3D cables won't be doing much stretching. They'd be more successful with crushing, falling, or tripping traps on Earth if not these celestial bodies, which won't have the oxygen levels to support huge beings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes (it is possible to do so) but in practice no.</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>The gas powered gun for the tethers is possible and exists. They release gas to reorient themselves akin to a jetpack which is also possible though you'd need to eject the gas at incredible speeds. Basically it's a jetpack and Spiderman's webshooters rolled into one.</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>It causes incredible changes in momentum which would at the very least break bones.</p>
<p>It's basically a flying car to people who still use horse drawn carriages. I'm not going to say it'll never exist but it won't within ypur or your childrens lifetimes. And even then its usability is limited to Spiderman like swinging around.</p>
<p>Location: changing gravity only affects how fast the user falls (gravity is basically a constant vertical acceleration) and that's not a major issue if you can retract and shoot the cable fast enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a different layer of skin that is normally never exposed unless you get cut or something to slice open your skin. Basically your skin is made up of 5 layers of skin cells that work their way up to the surface from the deepest layer. The top layer of skin is actually just a bunch of smaller layers of dead skin cells, which helps the skin withstand abrasion. The nails are just a modified form of the top layer of skin (the same type that covers your whole body). So when it gets removed, the middle layers of skin that lie below it are exposed, and are extra sensitive as a result.
As far as it's purpose, it houses a lot of sensory organs that give us information about things like touch, vibration, body position, etc. It also produces new epithelial (skin) cells that I believe will eventually be modified and become a fingernail (not 100% sure about that last part). </p>
<p>Hope this helped! Anyone else with more knowledge feel free to correct me or add on! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have an extremely sensitive sense of touch. Your finger tips are filled with extra sensitive nerves that are stimulated as you grasp something, and the fingertips and nails work together to sandwich these nerves, and heighten the sense of touch. Humans are capable of sensing an object less than the width of a human hair, and you can test this yourself by plucking a hair, placing it on a table, and running your finger over it. This allows us to have extreme dexterity in our hands, which is likely due to being descended from primates who lived in trees where grip is essential for survival. Further selection in later hominids to make tools and perform other fine motor tasks essential for survival likely increased this ability over time. This is why you can dig around in a backpack or purse and find objects without needing to look because your fingers give you the information. It's also why humans are capable of incredible fine motor control to do things like paint masterpieces or perform brain surgery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The area under your fingernails is rarely stimulated except for just after you trim them etc. This means that the fibres etc which encode tactile information as everyone else has mentioned are activated in response to stimuli that would have previously needed to be sufficient to displace the nail on top. So after a while you get used to the area being exposed and become less sensitive to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you hold an item, it pushes against the front of your finger, which in turn pushes against your fingernail. Your skin there is sensitive to the stimuli so that you can understand how much pressure you are putting onto the object you're grabbing. It's what allows you to grab an egg with ease with your fingers without even getting close to breaking it, but if you tried the same thing with your forearms, it's a lot harder to tell how hard you're pushing against an object. </p>
<p>TLDR- it helps understand the pressure your fingers are exerting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For distant stars and galaxies, there's some highly educated guesswork based on apparent speed and brightness, but for closer ones, there's actually a really intuitive method called <strong>parallax</strong>!</p>
<p>It works like this: suppose there's some distant object like a mountain that you want to know the distance to. Notice that as you walk sideways, closer objects like trees appear to pass you much faster than the mountain. This is the parallax effect.</p>
<p>To use it mathematically, simply measure how far you walked, and how far you had to rotate your head to keep the mountain in view. Now the start point, end point, and the mountain itself form a triangle, of which you know the measure of one side and two angles. Using trigonometry, this is enough information to determine the remaining sides, which are the distance between you and the mountain! </p>
<p>It would be difficult to walk far enough on earth to see a measurable change in the location of a star, but we can &quot;walk&quot; the entire earth just by waiting 6 months for it to be on the opposite side of its orbit. This enables us to calculate the position of nearby stars, without actually going to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From an earlier post, you seem to understand the doppler effect and how it relates to velocity. </p>
<p>From parralax, we know that further away galaxies are moving away from us faster. If we assume this holds, we can model the universe is expanding and the rate of that expansion is increasing. If we know that light from farther away galaxies take longer to get here, we know that farther away galaxies are older (than we see them now). </p>
<p>Older parts of the universe are redshirting more than younger parts and we can confirm this with <em>standard candles. </em></p>
<p>A standard candles is a term for a super nova (or other physical event) that has a fixed luminosity due to the nature of the event. If it has a given apparent brightness, we can know how far away it is from another means. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers in here, but there is one that doesn't seem to be well covered yet. Specifically, supernovas.</p>
<p>There are multiple types of supernova, but there is one in particular that is helpful in judging distances. It is a type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova" target="_blank">Ia</a> supernova.  This occurs when you have a binary star system that has a white dwarf and a red super giant star.  In this scenario the white dwarf is siphoning mass off the red super giant.  Eventually this start exceeds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit" target="_blank">Chandrasekhar limit</a> and creates a supernova.</p>
<p>This is helpful because we know very specifically how much mass is required to make this occur, and the circumstances in which it occurs. Thus we know how bright the supernova <em>should</em> be. You see, there is a law called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">Inverse square law</a> that measures how much intensity light will lose over a given distance. If we know how bright the explosion was, we can measure how bright the light we received was and then use the inverse square law to get a reasonable estimate of distance.</p>
<p>Edit: It is important to note that multiple types of measurements are made to judge the distance of a star.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YYTgENyJxs" target="_blank">Hoberman</a> sphere is a good example of how intensity of light is lost. If you think of a star in terms of a hoberman sphere, you can think of photons like the points on the hoberman sphere. In the case of the star however, the points have near infinite density. Even with near infinite density, a light year is a LOOOOOOONG way to travel. Even a near infinitesimal difference in angle becomes noticeable as you travel light years. As you travel 1000 light years, the density of photos will have dropped rather dramatically. This makes the star look dimmer than it actually is.  This is one of the reasons why satellites use long exposure times when photographing space.  You are literally waiting for the information (photons) to collect. Telescopes act like huge light buckets that catch more of these photons in order to re-focus them into intelligible pictures.</p>
<p>A good example of this is the &quot;black spot&quot; in space that scientists pointed the Hubble telescope at. To our instruments it appeared to be devoid of anything which is very, very, unusual. So they redirected Hubble to point at this spot and hold it's shutter open for 100 hours.  What they found after this was a huge number of galaxies.  They are simply so far away that not many of the photons reach us. <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/24/when-hubble-stared-at-nothing-for-100-hours/" target="_blank">Link here for the curious</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One problem with the question is that pain research often tosses &quot;perception of potentially harmful stimuli&quot; in the same pot as &quot;suffering&quot;. </p>
<p>Many very simple organisms have ways to perceive and react to things that might hurt them. A bee doesn't like to be squeezed and will sting in defense if it gets too bad. A simple coral will notice touch and withdraw from it. Even plants react to damage.</p>
<p>What they don't have is the higher capacity to think and worry about those experiences. It happens, seems to be uncomfortable, the animal tries to get out of the situation, but they don't seem to develop a lasting &quot;fear&quot; or often even just a strategy to avoid the same situation from happening again. </p>
<p>A big part of what turns pain into suffering is the brain's ability to simulate the future. We can expect that something will hurt, we can fear it, we can imagine how bad things could get. We worry. Simple animals don't.</p>
<p>Context matters a lot to humans. The pain after a good workout can feel good, while the same amount of pain after an accident can have us suffering. It's very difficult to test for such processes in animals. You can check their bodies for special pain transmitting nerves, or chemical changes to damage, but that doesn't say anything about their ability to interpret the sensation beyond reflexes to move away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an abstract from an actual study. Invertebrates probably feel pain. </p>
<p>Nociception or pain in a decapod crustacean? Barr 2008. Animal Behavior. </p>
<p>Nociception is the ability to perceive a noxious stimulus and react in a reflexive manner and occurs across a wide range of taxa. However, the ability to experience the associated aversive sensation and feeling, known as pain, is not widely accepted to occur in nonvertebrates. We examined the responses of a decapod crustacean, the prawn, Palaemon elegans, to different noxious stimuli applied to one antenna to assess reflex responses (nociception) and longer-term, specifically directed behavioural responses that might indicate pain. We also examined the effects of benzocaine, a local anaesthetic, on these responses. Noxious stimuli elicited an immediate reflex tail flick response, followed by two prolonged activities, grooming of the antenna and rubbing of the antenna against the side of the tank, with both activities directed specifically at the treated antenna. These responses were inhibited by benzocaine; however, benzocaine did not alter general swimming activity and thus the decline in grooming and rubbing is not due to general anaesthesia. Mechanical stimulation by pinching also resulted in prolonged rubbing, but this was not inhibited by benzocaine. These results indicate an awareness of the location of the noxious stimuli, and the prolonged complex responses indicate a central involvement in their organization. The inhibition by a local anaesthetic is similar to observations on vertebrates and is consistent with the idea that these crustaceans can experience pain.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: However, another group could not replicate these findings, for whatever reason. </p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Nociception is the physiological detection of noxious stimuli. Because of its obvious importance, nociception is expected to be widespread across animal taxa and to trigger robust behaviours reliably. Nociception in invertebrates, such as crustaceans, is poorly studied.</p>
<p>Methodology/Principal Findings</p>
<p>Three decapod crustacean species were tested for nociceptive behaviour: Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus), and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.). Applying sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, or benzocaine to the antennae caused no change in behaviour in the three species compared to controls. Animals did not groom the stimulated antenna, and there was no difference in movement of treated individuals and controls. Extracellular recordings of antennal nerves in P. clarkii revealed continual spontaneous activity, but no neurons that were reliably excited by the application of concentrated sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p>Conclusions/Significance</p>
<p>Previously reported responses to extreme pH are either not consistently evoked across species or were mischaracterized as nociception. There was no behavioural or physiological evidence that the antennae contained specialized nociceptors that responded to pH.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting topic. </p>
<p>The current theory is that there is a correlation between complex and non complex organisms and the interpretations of pain. More complex organisms feel pain similar to humans. </p>
<p>For example vertebrates, like a dog or human, are more complex then a spider or bumble bee. </p>
<p>An experiment took place with two groups of bees. One group had their leg pinched, simulating their leg being cut off, while the other group had nothing done to their legs. Two solutions of surcrose were also placed near the bees. One mixed with morphine and one mixed without.
In theory, the bees that had the pinched leg should be drawn to the morphine solution. However, this was not the case. The &quot;hurt&quot; bees did not consume more morphine than the control group, thus showing that less complex organisms do not react to pain the same way that humans do. The &quot;hurt&quot; bees did consume more of the normal surcrose and the morphine mixed surcrose so they were prone to some type of hyperactivity. Whether or not they feel the pain and experience the same things, we do not know. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: No. but they still feel something. </p>

<p>We know that insects are very different from mammals, and we know their nervous systems are far simpler.

<p>There are developmental &quot;stages&quot; (known as schemas) which children go through that teach them about the world around them. This particular phase falls under the &quot;Transportation&quot; schema.</p>
<p>These schemes are: </p>
<p>-Trajectory - creating lines in space by climbing up and jumping down. Dropping items from up high. (Throwing food from high chair)
-Positioning - lining items up and putting them in groups. (Cars/Trucks etc)
-Enveloping - covering themselves or objects completely. Wrapping items up or placing them in containers. (Hiding in boxes)
-Rotating - enjoys spinning items round and round. Likes to run around in circles or being swung round. (Pretty self explanatory)
-Enclosing - adding boundaries to play areas e.g. fences around animals. Adding borders to pictures.
-Transporting - carrying or moving items from one place to another; (carrying items in containers or bags.)
-Connecting - setting out and dismantling tracks, constructing, joining items together with tape or glue.
-Transforming - exploring the changing states of materials, transforming them from a solid to liquid state and back again.
Orienteering – an interest in positioning themselves or objects in different places or positions e.g upside down or on their side.</p>

Even babies will attempt to make eye contact with you. We are highly social animals. So, that simple act of interaction between you and the toddler is teaching her how to interact with another person she isn't normally around. </p>
<p>Now, from a cognitive perspective, a toddler is learning quickly that s/he can significantly manipulate their environment. One aspect of this is [object permanence] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence</a>), which is the mind-blowing concept (to a baby) that just because something can't be seen anymore, doesn't mean it ceases to exist.  Monkeys, apes, some birds, dogs, and cats may have this ability to a degree.  When the child hands you a toy, she is at the point where she knows that that toy isn't going anywhere. It's not going to disappear, she can get it back. It's part of the development of meta cognition. </p>

<p>1) Very young children do not understand how to control their hands and use them to move objects. They learn this throughout early childhood and are still learning it into toddlerhood. Picking up objects and throwing them or carrying them around is an expression of this new skill and is fun and interesting to the toddler.</p>
<p>2) When the toddler brings you a toy, you react. Young children <em>love</em> getting reactions from adults. Smile at a baby, and the baby will almost definitely smile back. This is why the toddler hands you the toy. You probably smile at them or talk to them when they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people puff out a smoke ring, the particles retain the original shape because they are traveling in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring" target="_blank">vortex ring</a>. The vortex ring forms as the air is blown/pushed out of the smokers mouth with a high speed relative to the surrounding air. The fast moving air around the edge gets slowed down and then is pulled along again in the wake of the faster moving air creating a ring to travel. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsPuX5V6swo" target="_blank">This video shows a smoke ring</a>.</p>
<p>When the smoke is just leaving a lit cigarette it is mostly acting as a passive tracer(moves with the fluid) and just shows how the air is flowing given the local turbulence. Air deforms continuously so you won't see any instant breaks. You can increase the rate at which is disperses by adding more turbulence (ie turning a fan on nearby, waving your hand around)</p>
<p>Edit: I've had a lot of replies to this, but the comments aren't showing up in the thread. If you want to PM me I'll answer your question and I'll put it in an edit because someone else might have the same question.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When you have a lit cigarette in a room with minimal air current, the smoke seems to stick to surfaces (much like water, but in a smokey way). is that related to the air currents too or is it a different physical phenomena?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>When you have a constant current over a surface, near the surface a boundary layer develops. It develops because the fluid along the surface &quot;sticks&quot; to the wall and has what we call a no-slip boundary condition. So the region near the wall has greatly reduced flow compared to the flow far from the wall. The thickness of the layer depends on the speed of the flow (the higher the speed, the thinner the boundary layer). In the boundary layer the turbulence is also lessened.</p>
<p>Its reasonable for me to think that in a room with low air current the smoke sticks near surfaces because the air is fairly stagnant in the boundary layer. So there is reduced turbulent mixing and no flow to carry the smoke particles away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>All fluid motion (air is considered a fluid) is modeled by navier stokes equations, here is a link to those equations:
<a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/nseqs.html" target="_blank">https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/nseqs.html</a>
To my understanding, fluid motion has momentum and this is conserved in laminar flow(smooth) This will cause a regular dissipation because the cigarate smoke will have a different density then air. It will hold its shape and slowly widen in 3 dimensions based on area and pressure and time. this is not instantaneous because dissipation takes times which is also represented in the equations as a time derivative. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because of the Reynolds number of the fluid (air) as it is heated up (near the tip of the cigarette). At this point the Reynolds number is low so the flow of the smoke is laminar (straight line up from the tip/cherry of the cigarette).  As the air rises and moves away from the heat source, the Reynolds number increases and the flow turns from laminar to turbulent.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia; &quot;Smoke rising from a cigarette is mostly turbulent flow. However, for the first few centimeters the flow is laminar. The smoke plume becomes turbulent as its Reynolds number increases, due to its flow velocity and characteristic length increasing.&quot;</p>

<p>Basically the length scale of the smoke plume eventually gets large enough that the momentum of the particles dominates the viscosity of the fluid and starts behaving in a chaotic manner.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the difference between laminar and turbulent flow. Basically a function of the Reynolds number, which is just the ratio between inertial and viscous forces. Reynolds number = (velocity of fluid * linear length) / viscosity. Smoke coming off of the cigarette in a still room will initially be very hot and the density will be low. This warm smoke will want to rise, and as the velocity of the fluid increases, the Reynolds number increases, which means that the inertia in the smoke column becomes more dominant over the surrounding air viscosity. At this point the flow transitions from slow and steady laminar to more turbulent, where inertial forces dominate since there is an increase in energy in the system. When a system has more energy, it's entropy increases, and you get more mixing, vortices, and dissipation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not really.  The methodology of programming is similar, but there is no single ancestor.  You need to understand how the CPU works at the very low level.  It fetches data from a memory location.  That data contains a bunch of bits that represent an instruction.  That instruction can be an add, multiply, jump to a memory location, etc. - a very simple operation.  A CPU is really an ISA - an instruction set architecture.  An ISA defines what all the different bits mean - what operation they represent.  An x86 ISA is different from an ARM ISA - the different bits mean different things. (A CPU is a HW implementation of an ISA to be precise)</p>
<p>So, when you have a CPU, in order to get a program, you need to string a bunch of these data together.  At first, sure, people would &quot;write&quot; them by hand.  Then people realized that it's convenient to write small chunks of these instructions together into &quot;procedures&quot;, which use multiple instructions to perform more complex tasks.  At some point you create enough of these to create a compiler - a program that takes a text file (assembly or C), and emits the instructions for you.  Then you can start writing a new compiler using the old compiler, etc. etc.  Just a note that assembly is simply a more readable binary, and there is a 1:1 ratio of assembly to binary instructions.  C needs to be parsed and broken down into simpler operations, but it's surprisingly close to assembly, to the point that some people call it a &quot;more elegant way of writing assembly&quot;.  This may be a stretch, but it's not a huge stretch.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's what would have to happen if you had the first CPU, but it's not what would happen today if you created a new ISA.  If you create a new ISA and you want to write a compiler for it, you'd take an existing compiler on your PC, say, GCC, and you'd write the emitter portion for your ISA.  The parts that parse the C/C++ text files are just fine - they don't need to change.  The only part that needs to be implemented is the &quot;back end&quot; the very &quot;last&quot; portion that actually emits the instructions for the ISA.  You'd have yourself a &quot;cross compiler&quot;, because you'd run it on your PC, and use that CPU to generate the binary instructions for the new CPU.  Once that's done, you could compile the compiler itself for your new ISA using the very same compiler on your PC, and run it on the new CPU!  Fun, eh?  These days, only very small ISA-specific bits are written using assembly - and it takes a very simple compiler to translate the mnemonics of the instructions into binary.</p>

<p>Once you know how to make them, most of the difficulty of writing a compiler comes from making it good, not making it at all. Accurately handling all the corner cases. Diagnosing erroneous code. Optimizations.</p>
<p>If you wanted to make a crummy compiler for a small subset of C89, just enough to compile the gcc bootstrap compiler, an experienced compiler dev could do that, in hand-written assembly, possibly in only one week.</p>
