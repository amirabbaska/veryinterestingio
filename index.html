		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Import tax be passed on to consumers by raising the price of imported goods?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For any goods that are imported, yes (which is a lot of them, at least in part). The idea is this incentivizes people to buy domestic goods, which will create more jobs domestically.</p>
<p>It also tends to hurt exporting businesses, because other countries will retaliate with their own tariffs. In addition, depending on what trade agreements are in effect, we can be fined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are American citizens being helped by paying more for the same products?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that making jobs at home is worth the higher prices. It's generally accepted that isn't worth it (at least nationally. on a smaller, industry specific area it can help).</p>
<p>Part of the problem with globalization is that certain areas tend to get hit extremely hard. In the U.S.'s case, one big example is manufacturing (because it's cheaper labor). In theory, the decrease in price makes us more than rich enough to help those people who lost their jobs out, and still be richer. In practice, we haven't done a particularly good job of having those people switch to a different job, relying on the market to sort it out (which can often be a long and painful process).</p>
<p>tldr:
Yes, it will basically just hurt us. But people are extremely upset with the status quo, and it's not obvious to the average person that it won't work. It sounds very compelling.</p>
<p>edit:
As a couple people have mentioned, i did leave out the impact of automation (for simplicity. Although, it's larger than globalization). While the above explanation still holds, technology just makes things even worse, since tariffs clearly aren't going to put the technology genie back in the bottle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>His import tax has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with politics.</p>
<p>Economics generally agree that free trade and globalization is good on average. Keyword here: <strong>average</strong>. Free trade and globalization is the reason that your iphone, which has parts and rare earth minerals from all over the world, doesn't cost $1500.  When the entire world assigns different people to make different products in the most efficient way, and then sell to each other, instead of having one country struggle to make everything by itself, everybody wins. That's the upside of globalization.</p>
<p>However, the downside of free trade and globalization is lower skilled people in developed countries lose their jobs en masse to poorer countries with lower cost. </p>
<p><strong>On average</strong>, free trade is good for the US. However, the benefits and downsides are not symmetrical. The upside of free trade is that everybody gets cheaper Iphones, cheaper fruits, cheaper T-shirts, cheaper TV shows, cheaper everything, improving the standard of living. However, these are subtle changes that affect everyone, and people generally just take it for granted, and rarely base their political decisions on it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the downside of free trade is much more visible, much more striking, and affects a smaller number of people, but in much deeper ways. When a factory or a plant is shut down, the entire town might lose its job, and spiral into disrepair, drugs, and population loss. And the people who lost jobs definitely think about it as they enter the voting booth. That's why it's much easier politically to be against free trade than for it.</p>
<p><strong>By placing his chips against free trade, Donald Trump is betting that the people he is trying to court (disaffected Rust Belt working class voters) will notice and credit him as they vote, while the people that he will hurt (everyone else) either won't notice or will forget the rising prices in storefronts by election day.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is yes. Tariffs are passed on to the consumer at the shelf. Its essentially a penalty against your own citizens for buying foreign product. It says, if you buy foreign, im going to add a tax so it costs as much as buying American.  </p>
<p>He thinks it will &quot;create jobs&quot; but it will likely just starve low income walmart shoppers in the rust belt even more. </p>
<p>It might spur some American industry but far from enough to create the change and jobs that he is falsely promising.  If we all only bought American and kept all the money in our own businesses in theory companies would be able to pay more Americans, but reality is that we cant become self sufficient or reach autarky. </p>
<p>His tactics are also bully tactics and PR stunts that do not help Americans. The &quot;Carrier Deal&quot; is a total sham and crony capitalism.  The attacks on individuals and individual companies are just PR tools to support the narrative for his voters that he is making &quot;deals&quot; and &quot;negotiating&quot; and fighting the &quot;establishment&quot;. In reality he and his nepotistic enterprise are probably just shorting stocks right before he bashes a company on Twitter. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it's been mentioned that we already know what will happen, because we tried it in the 1980s with Japanese auto imports. Domestic car makers raised prices an average of $1,000. Turns out that there's not much price elasticity in highly segmented markets like the auto industry. </p>
<p>I do believe, however (somebody will correct me) that the Japanese import tariffs are what spurred the Japanese automakers to build factories in the US.  </p>
<p>Either way, Trump is playing chicken with the auto makers. He hopes that the threats will stop auto makers from building or expanding plants in Mexico. If they ignore him (as it appears BMW will), it's bad news for consumers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Others have already brought up the sun turning into a red giant but I dont consider that the death of the solar system. That's just a problem for the inner planets. In fact, places like Europa will start to thaw out and conditions might be even more suitable for life.  The orbits might still be screwed up though and a star passing nearby might be enough to fling the planet out of the solar system but as long as there are some planets, moons, dwarf planets, and other bodies remaining.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the sun goes through the main sequence part of its lifecycle, it's slowly getting hotter. We have about a billion years before it gets too hot for life as we know it to persist on Earth, about 10% more luminous than it is now. The sun will turn into a red giant in about 5 billion years, but even though it will expand out to past Earth's current orbit, it will also lose a lot of its mass by then - right now, about 600 million tons of matter in the sun's core is converted to energy every second. On top of that, lots more of the sun's mass will be thrown off in solar wind when it becomes a red giant, so it will only have about 2/3 its current mass when it expands to the Earth's current orbit, which means the earth will spiral outward and orbit farther away, so it will be spared being swallowed by the sun, at least at first, though it will long since have become a charred dry rock, with all of the water in the atmosphere boiled away. Eventually, even though the Earth's orbit will be about 1.5 times as big as it is now, the sun will overtake it and the drag of the sun's atmosphere will slow the Earth down, causing it to spiral inward as the sun continues to grow until it is eaten by the sun. The sun will continue to grow until it's almost twice the size of the Earth's current orbit, then shrink and heat up, then expand again in pulses until it runs out of fuel, at which point it will be a white dwarf roughly the size of the Earth's current orbit. It will then slowly cool to black over trillions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question has some pseudo-scientific implications because, as you probably know, we can't move at the speed of light. </p>
<p>So let's say we're moving at 99.9999% the speed of light away from the Sun. If we look back at the Sun, what do we see? Well, first of all you probably wouldn't seem much because the light from the Sun would be redshifted by about z=1400. That is to say that the optical light that we see from the Sun (peaking at a wavelength of about 500 nm, green light) would be shifted into the sub-millimeter/radio part of the spectrum (at about 0.7 mm). So you wouldn't be able to see the Sun (or any other stars) whilst looking behind you.</p>
<p>What about looking in front of you? Well, at these speeds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background</a> would be blueshifted from the microwave part of the spectrum to the infrared part of the spectrum. You would begin to see a red glow everwhere in front of you.</p>
<p>What if you were travelling <em>at</em> the speed of light? Well, like I said, you can't. &quot;But what if you could?&quot;... You can't. &quot;But <em>what if</em>?&quot;... OK, fine. <em>If</em> you were a photon travelling at the speed of light and looked behind you, what would you see? Photons probably don't experience time. (Note that this is all pseudo-science.) If our understanding of relativity holds for reference frames travelling at the speed of light, then a photon experiences infinite length contraction. It travels across the entire length of the Universe instantaneously in its own frame. So, you'd never have a chance to look behind you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1099949" target="_blank">few studies done on it in the 70s</a> showed it was comparable to medicine prescribed for asthma patients (namely isoproterenol which wouldnt be prescribed for it today) and using it in an inhaler it could stop a full blown attack in its tracks.  </p>
<p>People might downvote me for the over used comparison with Tobacco Smoke, but there is a big misconception that all smoke is equal.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1277837/" target="_blank">It isnt</a>.  Yes there are carcinogens in the smoke and people are generally getting more tar since there aren't really any comparable filters for weed as there are for tobacco cigarettes.  But two things that happen with Tobacco smoke are increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis#Tumor_angiogenesis" target="_blank">Angiogenesis</a> which is the bodies ability to create new blood vessels, in this case specifically for cancer tumors. As well as being anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" target="_blank">apoptotic</a> which is the process our cells go through when they reach their end of life, meaning they don't die properly, or in other words mutate and increase chances of cancer.

No heart problems never been paranoid while under the effects of pot. Mainly just wanted to hang and chill with my lady and friends. But like I said this is just me and some people like cigarettes I preferred pot. I suggest if u are going to try it. Don't make any plans of going out and being in a very public place. Don't do it around children and mainly don't have any responsibilities for a couple of hours and just find a good friend or life partner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While many drugs have symptoms that appear rapidly weed has a longer span of time needed to produce effects. Some people can smoke weed for their entire life and have no issue similar to some people being able to handle other drugs. Only recently have scientists found results that weed (THC) has ill effects. The main reactions that happen are symptoms of withdrawal e.g. mood swings, that do tend to clear up over time. THC has been linked to mental health issues by worsening the effects of depression or interfering with medication. </p>
<p>Now here comes the less supported parts. Many people in the business environment feel that people who smoke weed are less ambitious as time goes on. Since it is hard to measure ambition it is just stated and hard to support. </p>
<p>It has been found that 1 in 10 users become addicted to weed. From what I have looked into I am unsure as to if this is an effect of  THC or the act of smoking but those who smoke weed over time also have a higher risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular issues. </p>
<p>Edit: THC, the compound responsible for the &quot;high&quot; of weed affects people differently. It is also hard to separate the difference between THC's and smoking's effects. If you want to read some of the sources I have found there is a mixture of government, organizations, and educational pages. I encourage you to read them but there will be bias as many government sources are against the use of weed. </p>

Does it feel empty? depending on where you are floating say in your space suit it would feel rather disorientating, you might be very slowly rotating. You would certainly see stars around, although as soon as you face the sun it would be pretty blinding, your eyes would take a bit to adjust and so you would see mostly blackness around. </p>
<p>Plasma in space are usually around stars ( or planets with magnetic fields) or star forming regions. The reason we see them is mostly due to long exposures in astrophotography. And remember that often a nebula is several hundred light years across so we are seeing an accumulation of light from a huge amount but spread out over a vast distance. </p>
<p>If you ended up in a region between two galaxies space might appear a bit darker, though if you had some binoculars would be able to make out other galaxies around you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to understand is that there are no absolute physical boundaries marking what is and is not &quot;outer space.&quot;  The density of matter and energy, as well as the chemical proportions of matter, just changes from place to place across the universe.</p>
<p>We arbitrarily say that space begins (with respect to Earth) at something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line" target="_blank">Kármán line</a>, at 100 km above sea level because this is a convenient number and the density of atmospheric gases is quite low by that altitude.</p>
<p>Similarly arbitrary points would denote where space ends and the Martian atmosphere begins, or the stellar corona, or the beginning of interstellar space, or what have you.  This is not to say that these points have no physical basis - the heliopause, for instance, is roughly wherever the solar wind and interstellar wind are in balance - but these are not absolute locations, but rather vague statistical regions.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the universe is completely devoid of matter/energy, so it just changes as you go.  If you encounter a solid object, the densities and compositions change very quickly, but even then the change is not instantaneous from one microscopic location to another - there are atoms constantly in motion, being blasted off of a solid surface by impacts from particles in the stellar and interstellar particle flux.  </p>
<p>This is what is meant when researchers say that a body otherwise in vacuum like Mercury or Pluto has an &quot;atmosphere.&quot;  They don't mean there is any practically significant amount of gas around it that you would experience, but simply that there is some small amount of molecules that linger in a gaseous form near the object.  </p>
<p>The amounts never go to zero as you get farther away, the numerical density just decreases until it meets another environment where it increases again.  If you were to travel from the surface of Mercury to the surface of Earth, the density of (for instance) oxygen would go from some small number and keep decreasing over the space between until it came close to Earth, then start increasing more and more until it was very high at Earth.</p>
<p>As to what space <em>is</em>, that's a deeper matter that delves into quantum theories and various alternative models (etc.).  One thing that has been observed is that &quot;empty&quot; space - lacking in massed particles - is not in fact empty, but rather a froth of mutually-canceling particle pairs with opposite energy to each other (thus not changing the net amount of energy in the universe).  </p>
<p>The opposite way that gravity affects the constituents of these pairs is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">Hawking radiation</a> can cause black holes to lose mass and evaporate over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>William James explained the difference between voluntary and involuntary attention. Voluntary attention requires effort - an example is concentrating on a demanding task like driving in traffic. But anything effortful can make you tired. Cognitive psychologists don't have a good idea exactly what inside of you is &quot;getting tired&quot; but we use a term called &quot;cognitive resources&quot; as a metaphor for the whole thing. The idea is that this kind of effortful attention drains those resources.<br />
In contrast, involuntary attention requires no effort. In voluntary attention you have to decide what to attend to and how to respond. In involuntary attention, something just grabs your attention and holds it. No decision making is required. It has been compared to a state of fascination.<br />
Many have used these ideas to explain why taking a walk in the woods feels restorative, because you can stop using those &quot;resources&quot; and just let yourself explore.<br />
Spacing out could easily be seen in the same light. You are not doing anything in particular, so you are resting and restoring those so-called &quot;resources&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spacing out is basically meditation.  You are allowing your conscious mind to rest. It also acts as a reset, since your mind may be stuck in a loop of thoughts.  Like, maybe you're anxious/stressed that you have an exam.  You want to study, but your place is dirty.  You want to clean, but can't because you need to be studying.  You know you're running out of time, because you have an exam.  Repeat.  </p>
<p>There's a lot of information out there about the benefits of meditation. The benefits of meditation in relieving stress and improving concentration are well documented.  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858" target="_blank">Here's Mayo's article, but there's a lot out there</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Linguist here. In geek terms I think you're asking, 'how do researchers conduct monolingual field work on an unknown language such that they can eventually understand the vocabulary and grammar of that language in great detail, and/or become proficient in speaking it?'</p>
<p>The 'point at things and say their names' method (suggested by lacerik, who I suspect is not a field linguist) is not useless, but it will never uncover the full range of a language's words, sounds, meanings, grammatical elements, range of syntactic structures, etc. Successful monolingual fieldword and analysis is less <em>Dances with Wolves</em> and more about engaging with speakers, repeating linguistic forms, using contextual and linguistic cues to make inferences, and of course taking advantage of the pattern recognition abilities of our human brains.</p>
<p>Crucially, people tend to behave in predictable ways when engaged in conversation, even if they can't fully understand one another  (see <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html" target="_blank">Gricean maxims</a>). People also naturally recognize attempts at imitation and many if not most people can provide meta-linguistic feedback when a linguist asks questions about their language, or attempts replicate an utterance. By starting a conversation, recording what you hear, using contextual cues and pattern recognition to associate meanings with components of linguistic forms (i.e. sets of sounds), and then refining hypotheses through repetition and variation, a linguist can go from first contact to very basic language quite quickly, and then over a much longer time figure out myriad details. This is easier to do if you start with some sense of the range of sounds and grammatical constructions used in the world's languages, their relative frequencies, and ways in which they commonly interact than if you are a monolingual speaker of an unrelated language with little cross-linguistic experience or training.</p>
<p>I'm not personally a huge fan of linguist Daniel Everett, but there is <a href="https://youtu.be/sYpWp7g7XWU" target="_blank">a video of him from a linguistic summer school a few years ago that demonstrates how a linguist works through the beginning stages of analysing a language when (s)he does not share a common translation language with the speaker (s)he is working with</a> (simulating the sort of un-contacted situation you describe). It is not as exciting as an alien movie, but may be of interest.</p>
<p>Oh and fun Arrival fact: I haven't seen the movie yet, but word on the street is that linguists at McGill University did a pretty good job with the technical consulting and not letting Hollywood stray too fancifully far from real linguistics, and that the set design, right down to books on shelves, was right out of the McGill linguistics department offices...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The consensus about the movie is that its interpretation of the Sapir-Worf hypothesis is way deterministic, and that Louise's analysis jumps to a bunch of conclusions. However, most of us are just grateful for the first movie portrayal of what real linguists do (i.e., being descriptive scientists instead of just polyglots). Her approach, especially in explaining her process to the military, is relatably realistic, but pretty vague and very lucky, because...</p>
<p>[Maybe spoilerish?]
Basically, the entirety of descriptive linguistics is dependent upon human cultural or cognitive commonalities. We can translate and learn other human languages because we know a lot about their typology and limitations. The fact that she, as a human linguist, made any progress with the Heptapod language at all (let alone their orthography!?) means that humans and Heptapods must share some kind of cognitive functions. That's pretty lucky, but maybe also makes an optimistic claim about commonalities among all life in the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like any radiation worker, they apply ALARA. That means that you should take steps to make your radiation exposure &quot;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&quot;. The ways to do this are the maximize distance from the source, minimize time near it, and use shielding when possible.</p>
<p>If you pay close attention when passing through security, you'll see that they rotate between positions throughout the day. So the people operating the x-ray machines rotate around to other positions as well.</p>
<p>You may also notice that some employees are wearing badge dosimeters. These are little badges that you wear on your body. Over time they will accumulate on average the same exposure density to radiation that your body does. Every few months you send them in for testing to see if you had an abnormally high exposure within that time.</p>
<p>I don't know much about the manufacture of their machines (I'd guess it's not something they want the public to know much about), but it's not hard to add some shielding to strongly attenuate x-rays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun creates these things called <em>photons</em>. These photons are little packets of light and energy. These are ejected from the sun trillions and trillions of time per second. </p>
<p>When photons hit things, they can give up their energy to them. That's why light can heat things up. Solar panels take this energy and store it. The main mechanism is called the <em>photovoltaic</em> effect. </p>
<p>Solar panels have a crystal panel that the light shines on, and inside there is a lot of circuitry which is connected to a battery or energy storage device. The crystal panel is made up of atoms. </p>
<p>Atoms are composed of their cores, and the electrons which orbit them. The cores, assuming they have at least one proton are positively charged. To even out the charges so the atom is neutral, negatively charged <em>electrons</em> surround them. They &quot;orbit&quot; the atoms at different energy levels. Getting into this area any further ultimately leads to quantum mechanics and things get a little too wishy washy and mathy to do a good ELI5 on it.</p>
<p>If a photon hits the orbit of an electron, the electron could take that energy from the photon and <em>excite</em> and go up an energy level. Now the solar panel has <em>captured</em> the energy from the sun. This happens all over the solar panel.</p>
<p>This is where the <em>photovoltaic</em> effect kicks in. The crystal panel's exposure to light (because of how it can capture energy to excite electrons) causes a <em>voltage</em> change, and can cause an electric current in the circuit. This causes energy to flow into a battery and we can store it for later.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the suggestions /u/TBNecksnapper</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar cells are made up of several photo-voltaic cells. Each photo-voltaic cell is divided into two layers. The two layers of the cell are typically known as P and N. The P layer is designed to allow energy to flow to the N layer but energy from the N layer cannot flow to the P layer. There is a short gap between the two layers which permits energy from flowing in the opposite direction (from N to P).</p>
<p>The vast majority of modern day solar panels are created from silicon which has been chemically altered to absorb electricity more efficiently. Each photo-voltaic cell is made up of silicon. When sunlight strikes the N layer of a photo-voltaic cell it becomes charged but it cannot retain the charge so the electricity is immediately transferred to the P layer of the photo-voltaic cell. The amount of electricity that is transferred at one time is usually around the 0.5 volt mark but there are ways to increase the amount of electricity each photo-voltaic cell produces. The electricity in the P layer is then transferred to the main semi-conductor and the electricity flows to the solar panel's battery.</p>
<p>Solar cells are only capable of converting about 1/16 of energy in sunlight. The reason for that is because the sun's rays rarely shine directly on to the solar panels and most of the rays are reflected or absorbed into the surface of the solar panel. Most calculations state the maximum amount of energy that a solar panel can gather from sunlight is about 30%. However, there are currently no solar panels on the mainstream market which are capable of gathering that much energy from sunlight. </p>
<p>Typical solar panels are around 15% energy efficient. In other words, they can only convert about 15% of the energy in the sun's rays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In a battery, these come from a chemical reaction; in a generator, magnets force them to start moving.</p>
<p>In a solar panel, bits of light (photons) hit the surface of a metal (silicon, or a specially created mix of materials like silicon), exciting an election from its normal place in the atoms of silicon to somewhere up hill from where we can leach them off and coax them into flowing around a circuit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Preschool teacher here, with a masters  in education. Simply put, babies and animals like high pitched cooing. It feels safe and comforting to them. The high pitched baby talk portrays a positive emotion to babies, while grumbling or yelling would likely make a baby upset. That explains tone, but the type of language we use demands further explanation.</p>
<p>We tend to say things like, &quot;woooooooooow, what a big girl, playing with the choo choo train! Chooooo Chooooo!&quot; Talking to an adult, we would never extend the vowel sounds or ask about the Choo Choo, we would just say train. Adults say these types of things, in short, to help children understand vocabulary and assign words to objects and actions. We exaggerate vowel sounds to encourage them to start imitating and speaking. We offer a play-by-play of what we are doing (&quot;you are playing with the train&quot;) and state the obvious, (&quot;the train is blue, the train has wheels&quot;) just to let the kid know what's going on. </p>
<p>But, if we are trying to teach them to talk, why not just say train? Isn't Choo Choo train harder to say than train? Yes, but we like to offer the child basically an adjective and a noun. &quot;This is a train and it makes the Choo Choo sound, so it's a Choo Choo train&quot; or &quot;this is a cow and it says moo, so it's a moo cow&quot;. It basically provides a scaffold for the children; if they forgot cow, maybe they will remember the moo part. Or they can learn to associate the sound with the object, the color, the shape, size, etc. All about vocab building and recognition.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is also because it helps us bond with the babies. We as adults feel the need to &quot;get into character&quot;, to shift our speech patterns to acknowledge to ourselves and others the special relationship we have with the baby. Our nurturing, loving, never swearing, always teaching side kicks into gear and we babble and coo away. It's a learned social behavior that conveys to both the adult and baby that they are in a loving relationship. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be some confusion regarding what &quot;baby talk&quot; constitutes. See /u/sippy_cup 's response to get a good summary of some of the features of what has been referred to by linguists and speech-language pathologists as &quot;motherese,&quot; or more recently &quot;infant-directed speech&quot; (IDS). </p>
<p>Many of the comments seem to be objecting to the use of vocabulary that people associate with kids (i.e., &quot;doggy&quot; and &quot;kitty&quot;) and modifying grammar in ways that are not associated with adult-like speech. That is not what IDS is. IDS refers to the exaggerated prosody, hyperarticulation, and higher pitch that tends to feature in the vast majority of cultures' speech to pre-lingual infants. Older children do benefit greatly from being exposed to more complex sentences and a wide vocabulary, but that is not mutually exclusive with parents using infant-directed speech to their babies while they are pre-lingual.</p>
<p>There is actually plenty of evidence pointing to benefits from IDS. To quickly add a few sources for the curious:</p>

<p>babies prefer to listen to motherese (and getting babies to listen is crucial for language acquisition):

<p>…similarly, babies respond better to IDS, and there is neural imaging evidence for it. Improved response even when it’s a stranger.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I studied language acquisition in college.</p>
<p>I just wanted to note that child-directed speech (motherese) is not universal among all human cultures. Some cultures do not use motherese (such as Samoa and Papua New Guinea) and just speak to children the same as they speak to anyone else. I remember studying about one culture (I can't remember which culture it is) that does not even speak to a baby (child) until the baby starts speaking. The babies in that culture learn the language by hearing it, not by being spoken to.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether child-directed speech is used or not, or even if the child is not spoken to at all, children all pretty much learn and progress in their language development in similar steps and at similar ages.</p>
<p>To sum up, we talk weirdly to babies because it is what is normal in our culture, not because it benefits the baby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
