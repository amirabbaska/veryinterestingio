		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're already trying.</p>
<p>The UN has this thing called the <a href="http://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/en/treecounter/our-target" target="_blank">Billion Tree Campaign</a>. As you can see, they claim to have already planted 14.2 billion trees.</p>
<p>But it gets interesting. As you can also see from that site, they want to plant <em>One Trillion</em> trees. Why is the goal of the &quot;Billion Tree Campaign&quot; to plant a trillion trees, you ask? Because nine years after the campaign was started, scientists discovered <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/02/scientists-discover-that-the-world-contains-dramatically-more-trees-than-previously-thought/?utm_term=.289b44da5070" target="_blank">the planet is home to 3.04 trillion trees, blowing away the previous estimate of 400 billion.</a></p>
<p>That said, <a href="http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0000322.html" target="_blank">algae is our best source of photosynthesis</a>. So combined with the facts there are literally already trillions of trees and that trees take up a lot more space than algae, planting more trees is not the best approach to curb global warming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a similar question posted earlier: One of the best carbon-capturing trees is the Silver Maple. It can scrub 25,000 pounds of carbon in a 55-year useful lifespan (454.55 pounds per year). Coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania (a moderate producer of CO2 from coal) produce 136 million tons of CO2 annually. This equates to 37,057,220.7 tons of carbon. (Atomic weight of carbon=12, of CO2=44). Now do the math. 37,057,220.7 tons / 454.55 lbs = 163,050,141 silver maple trees. For reforestation purposes, it's recommended you plant between 726 and 435 trees per acre. Using the average spacing, that's about 680 trees per acre. So to cancel Pennsylvania's annual coal-fired carbon, you'd need 239,779.61 acres of silver maple trees. Which is about 374 square miles (.31 Rhode Islands).    </p>
<p>Oh, The National Arbor Day Foundation sells Silver Maples for $6.98 each. You'd need to budget $1,138,089,984.18 for the project, not counting the cost of the land.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of carbon being in three buckets on earth.</p>
<p>1 - the atmosphere</p>
<p>2 - the biosphere and </p>
<p>3 - sub surface</p>
<p>we are pulling the carbon out of the subsurface bucket and placing it in the other two buckets. Planting trees may help to remove carbon from the atmosphere but it only stores the carbon for a short period of time. trees die, burn, etc, and release that carbon back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>the main way carbon is removed from the atmosphere is the oceans. phytoplankton removes the carbon and when it dies, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean, is compressed and due to plate tectonics is slowly submerged underground. this is obviously a very slow process. thus, the only real method to reduce carbon emission in the long term at our disposal is to either stop pulling it out of the ground or else find a reliable, long term method to get it back into the ground.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forestry technician here. Planting trees as well regenerative farming practices for soil depletion as well as algae  are our answers to global warming. As far as just planting trees is concerned you don't just need to plant them you need to cut them down too this is sequestering carbon and storing it in items that we can use. Trees are the most green renewable energy. Some things being made/synthesized from wood (I went to a woodlot confrence the other day) : jet feul, fibreglass, biomass, feul wood. Wood is also the second most stable solution to heating your home. More wood we use the better. sustainable forestry has been around for hundreds of years we just don't practice it efficiently enough and cleary do not care about our planet.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A lot of ad services specifically will not advertise &quot;adult content&quot;. This is for a number of reasons, but one is that most sites don't want to be seen with that kind of advert.</p>
<p>For the same reason, most advertisers will go to ad services that prohibit use on 'adult' websites. This is what really leads to the difference in ads on adult and non-adult sites.</p>
<p>You won't likely see any ads for 'horny girls in your area' where you hadn't before, because they aren't really targeted at anyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A lot of ad services can track you by your ip address and serve up relevant ads to you across multiple sites and devices. That said though there are limit's like you shouldn't be seeing porn ads show up on walmart for example and most porn sites are basically on &quot;fringe&quot; ad networks because many reputable advertisement company's / brands don't want to be associated with those sites for the most part. Long story short is you really should only be getting porn ad's on porn sites or super shady sites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way Internet Service Providers are gathering your internet history is by simply tracking what websites you request and what is delivered to your network. If you request to see google.com then the ISP will see your request and route the traffic accordingly. And now they log that you requested google.com and can legally sell that to anyone buying. If they can see which individual computer is the one requesting the website is another story. It depends on how far ISPs implement in order to gather your history. If they have router access, Which is likely, than they can see which specific computer requested to see those luscious videos. </p>
<p>I believe this is a logical concern. But I do not think it will be a problem. As ISPs will likely have some sort of identifier (Say a local IP or MAC Address) for who wanted the traffic and target that person individually. It wouldn't make sense if sharon wanted shoes and they send bob some lovely coupons on his next pair of high heels. The targeted advertising wouldn't be effective then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Generally, people write it a certain way because that's how people before them wrote it. In the US we write the sign before the number because that's how the British wrote the pound sign before us.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to writing the $ before the number. It makes it harder for forgers to modify numbers. You can't change $100 to $2100 by adding a number because there's a dollar sign in the way. Also it's easy to read the difference between dollars and cents on a sign, because the cent sign is written after the number. It's written like $3 and 50¢. Also if you wrote an amount as a decimal, 3.50$ the dollar sign is next to the cents values, and that could get confusing. </p>
<p>But there is little to no evidence that any of these were the reason that way of writing currencies became standard. Language, symbols, and writing systems are constantly evolving, and their origins are too old to know with any certainty. People tend to keep doing what was done before unless there is a good reason to change. That's why we write the dollar sign before the number. Any more specific explanation is speculation at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The US uses the English convention for writing currency symbols: the symbol of the primary currency unit goes before the number. So it's not just $50 but also £50, €50, ¥50 etc. Other languages do this differently, so saying that it's to reduce forgery seems like pure speculation: there is no good reason to suppose that only English-speaking businessmen saw a greater need to reduce forgery in this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Oxygen will be able to dissolve in some liquids in high enough concentrations that it is possible for your lungs to extract enough oxygen from the liquid to stay alive. The advantage to using liquids and not gas is that gas will compress under pressure which can cause complications in some cases. The two main areas where liquid breathing may be used is in deep sea diving where super compressed air makes things more complicated and for high force maneuvers in jet fighters and rockets where suspending the body completely in liquid can prevent g-lock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid ventilation (I think this is what you're referring to) is something that's currently being developed/researched/looked at.</p>
<p>In terms of mechanically ventilating someone, from a physics standpoint, all ventilation is fluid ventilation, since you can treat gasses like a fluid.  for ventilating someone, we currently use an air/oxygen mixture (or just 100% oxygen) depending on what's required.  Liquid ventilation would be just changing the mixture, from air/oxygen to something else (that would still likely contain oxygen).</p>
<p>Ventilation functions based on pressure gradients (and a bunch of other factors but we'll focus on this one for now).  Things tend to go from high pressure to low pressure, high concentration to low concentration (in this case pressure and concentration are essentially the same, just a term for measurement.)</p>
<p>So when we want to get oxygen into your blood, we need more oxygen inside your lungs then in your blood to force the oxygen from the high concentration side (lungs) to the lower concentration side (your blood).  The process is the opposite for carbon dioxide.  The reason the average healthy person breathes is to get rid of CO2.  So we need less CO2 in your lungs than in your blood, so the CO2 will leave the blood and go into your lungs to be exhaled.</p>
<p>So the mixture of air/oxygen is just a medium.  We could use literally anything, as long as all the gas diffuses correctly.  The only issues we might come across are the actual fluid mechanics (how they vary between solutions) and dealing with how that would affect the lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Studies realized by the US Navy have so far (as far as I have read) shown that liquid breathing of some sort of oxygenated liquid is not likely to work due to the viscosity of the liquid itself. Without assisted ventilation, it would be impossible for a person to renew the liquid in its lungs often enough to avoid a Carbon Dioxide (CO2) buildup. CO2, being 20 times more narcotic than Nitrogen (N2) would thus produce more problems than it would solve.</p>
<p>I believe that currently, liquid breathing is only being seriously considered as a treatment for premature babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It probably has something to do with four big differences between Norse Medieval contact and Renaissance Europe contact with the New World.</p>
<p><strong>1) Norse contact benefited from a natural quarantining</strong>  In order for any disease to use Norse contact to get the New World it first had to travel to isolated communities in Scandinavia.  Then it would probably have spend time wintering in the Shetland Islands or Dublin.  Then it would definitely have to winter in Iceland.  And finally it had to reach Greenland.  At every stage of the way the Norse would spend time waiting out the worst of the weather for weeks at time.  And even if a disease had jumped from a walrus ivory trader in Greenland to an Inuit, the Inuit would also introduce their own natural quarantining to any disease because of their well spaced apart settlements.  Meanwhile Spanish contact came straight from crowded urban areas to the Caribbean (one of the most populated parts of the New World) within about a month a half.  This was short enough time for a person sick with small pox or measles to have spread it to his crew and they and their trade goods to still be be highly contagious when they started interacting with North American natives. </p>
<p><strong>2) Norse contact was much lighter</strong> The Norse only established one failed village on mainland North America, and the population of Norse Greenland topped out at 10k at the most, maybe a similar sized population of Inuit nearby.  Hispaniola, Spain's first colony, had a native population of around half to 1 million when founded and was tied by native trade routes through out the Caribbean.  </p>
<p><strong>3) Europeans were not as diseased when the Norse were visiting</strong>  The version of measles that that was fully acclimated to humans probably evolved around 1100 to 1200 AD.   The Black Death did not come to Europe until 1346.  Smallpox just reached Europe in the 8th and 9th centuries, but did not become widespread until the 16th century.</p>
<p><strong>4) Norse may have been more xenophobic</strong>  There is some evidence that the Roman Catholic priests who where the primary owners of the Greenland territory, may have forced the population to stay away from the Inuit for religious reasons and order to keep their population under thumb so they continue to benefit from the walrus ivory (If the Norse had known the Inuit's survival tricks they would not have been beholden to producing ivory for trade) .  As such, even if disease had made it to Greenland, the isolationist behavior of the Norse would have kept from spreading to the Inuit.  Meanwhile the Spanish were f*cking, trading with, converting, and enslaving what ever natives they could find.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>It comes down to population density and contact.</strong></p>
<p>The kind of A-level diseases in Europe (smallpox, measles, cholera, typhoid, plague, etc.) that whipped through North America require a certain population density to become endemic, and Norse farms and villages didn't quite make the cut. Remoteness and lower population density than the 15th century Spanish made Norse sailors less likely to have the diseases to begin with, and probably less likely to survive and keep them going if they did catch them.</p>
<p>These diseases also require a pretty good population density to take off once they get to North America. Many areas of the New World had just that (Easter Woodlands, Valley of Mexico, etc.), but I suspect that remotest Newfoundland did not. The combination of distance from other folks and a complete lack of immunity meant that, if the Native Americans did get a disease from the Norse, the whole family/village/clan was likely wiped out before they had a chance to pass it down the line. Newfoundland was also pretty far removed from the intra-continental trade networks that linked many of the cultures further south, so were less likely to pass disease on through trade.</p>
<p>Most of these diseases require physical contact or proximity to transfer. The Norse didn't stay particularly long, were limited in location, and a lot of their contact with the &quot;Skrælings&quot; was violent, so there weren't as many opportunities for disease to spread as there would be under the sustained and (violently) intimate contact initiated by the Spaniards and others.</p>
<p>This website has some interesting theories as well:</p>

Today on askscience we're going to learn about genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, and what they mean for the future of food, with the help of Kurzgesagt's new video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmcXYp8xu4" target="_blank">Check it out!</a> </p>
<p>We're joined by the video's creators, /u/kurz_gesagt, and the scientists who helped them make this video: geneticist Dr. Mary Mangan, cofounder of OpenHelix LLC (/u/mem_somerville/), and Prof. Sarah Davidson Evanega, Professor of Plant Breeding and Genetics at Cornell (/u/Plant_Prof),</p>
<p>Additionally, a handful of askscience panelists are going to be joining us today: genetics and plant sciences expert /u/searine; synthetic bioengineers /u/sometimesgoodadvice and /u/splutard;  and biochemist /u/Decapentaplegia. Feel free to hit them with a username mention when you post a question so that they can give you an answer straight from the (genetically modified) horses mouth :D</p></div></div>

<p>For the moment, nevermind that the event happened.  My question is, how could they have not known beforehand, before changing the water that this was going go be a problem?  It should be know by some people, that river water is more acidic than lake water.  Nobody spoke up and raised the alarm that river water is more acidic?  Did nobody in charge really know this?  Did they know and just not care?  Did they know and just think the high lead would not be discovered?  This doesn't make sense to me.  What is going on here?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems nobody purposely got anyone sick.  Flint was looking to get out of its water contract with Detroit Water and Sewage, where they were receiving treated, clean water for many years.  Flint River was a backup water source already.  It was presumed safe to use as a backup and thus safe to use as a go forward solution until they could get something more modernized in place.  The water they got from the river had to be treated, so they built a water treatment facility.  However, old pipes, poor planning, etc.. created issues and the water ended up bad.</p>
<p>Some scary things that happened was that the EPA and government officials knew the water was bad and they didn't tell the public.  While the mayor is on TV drinking tap water to calm the fears, the EPA had already measured high levels of lead in the water and didn't do anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Governor overrode the local elections and put an &quot;Emergency Manager&quot; by the name of Darnell Earley in charge. Basically he took away the power of the locally-elected officials. The idea is that this &quot;Emergency Manager&quot; would be able to cut through the red tape and get stuff done in order to fix whatever emergency the Governor dreamed up in order to justify his action. </p>
<p>The problem is that bureaucracy and red tape exists for a reason. Rules get put into place because someone screwed up (or was corrupt) before. When you bypass those rules, you risk making the same mistake someone else made in the past. I'm all for efficiency, but when a business screws up, it folds and people go find jobs somewhere else.  When a government screws up, people die (or in this case get neurologically damaged for life).  This came from running the government like a business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the reason the pipes corroded was because the water from Detroit was treated with several chemicals (as is necessary and normal), one of which was there to protect the pipes from corrosion. However, when flint switched to the river as its main source of water, they left out this very important chemical, there for causing all of the pipes to begin erroding, releasing lead from the makeup of the pipes.
This is also why even though we have switched back to Detroit water, the lead levels are still moderately high (though deemed &quot;safe&quot; now). The pipes' internal seal is now gone and they continue to release lead into the water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of pressure to not raise water and sewer rates. Since governing bodies have to determine these rates, the pressure is political. Historically water has been free (wells) or nearly free when a large local industry was paying a huge share of the cost (Canton NC sewer comes to mind). Modern wisdom is that combined water and sewer bills are deemed &quot;affordable&quot; when below about 1.5% of median household income. But even at this rate, most utilities are falling way behind on regular maintenance let alone keeping up with treating dirtier water, or complying with stricter wastewater pollution standards. There is indeed studying of the issue, but nobody really wants to admit that the real cost of clean water is much higher than this accepted threshold. 2%? 3% 5% of your income? We don't know really, and it's very basin specific. For some idea of the magnitude of such numbers, if your household income were 50,000 a year, that'd mean your combined water and sewer bill would be over $200 a month ($208). You're knee jerk thought that this is atrocious is exactly why elected officials won't ever consider such high rates, and exactly why even a minor cost savings as seen in Flint, can end up happening, despite the consequences. Rates as a percent of income is of course already a flawed measure, since for low income areas, food and housing eat up a much higher percent of incomes right off the bat so in a place like Flint, with a shrinking customer base to boot, any increase to rates is acutely felt by those paying it, especially on the low side of that median. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instead of thinking of the act of dividing, let's think about what things are like after you divide.  So if you divide 15 by 3 you end up with 5. Why did you end up with 5? Because 5 groups of 3 makes 15. If you divide 8 by 4 you get 2 because 2 groups of 4 makes 8. </p>
<p>So what if we divide 10 by 0? You're thinking we should get 0. Do 0 groups of 0 make 10? Hmm...Weird... Is 8 divided by 0 also 0? So 0 groups of 0 also make 8? I thought 0 groups of 0 was 10? </p>
<p>Essentially, division is the opposite of multiply. So think of division as asking about multiplication:</p>
<p>8/4=2 because 2*4=8</p>
<p>15/3=5 because 5*3=15</p>
<p>10/0=0 because 0*0=10? No that's not right...</p>
<p>10/0 asks the question &quot;what times zero equals ten?&quot; Which is just a question that has no answer.</p>
<p>But here's where things get interesting, what is 0 divided by 0?  You might think it's 0... Let's check:</p>
<p>If 0/0=0 then 0*0=0?  Yes! That works!</p>
<p>But I might say that if you divide something by itself you always get the number 1. Let's check that:</p>
<p>If 0/0=1 then 1*0=0? Yes! That's also right...</p>
<p>If 0/0=7 then 7*0=0? Yes</p>
<p>If 0/0=54 then 54*0=0? Yes</p>
<p>It certainly seems like every number is going to work...</p>
<p>So when you divide 0/0 you are asking a question where the answer is &quot;all numbers&quot;. This causes problems when we work with calculations so we prefer to say that there's no answer to that question.</p>
<p>Other times, when you divide 7/0 you're asking a question that simply has no answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real numbers with + and <em> form what is called a field. A field is basically just a set of stuff which obeys the same properties ordinary real numbers do (like distribution of </em> over + for example like FOIL). It is the generalization of the reals. </p>
<p>A field must have at least two distinct objects: an additive identity (so an element, let's call it 0, such that a + 0 = a for all elements a in the field) and a multiplicative identity (a number,  let's call it 1, such that a*1 = a for all elements a in the field). </p>
<p>The inverse of a number x is a number y such that x*y = y*x = 1.</p>
<p>To divide by something means you are multiplying by its inverse. So for example, we can divide by 3 because there is nothing wrong with multiplying by 1/3. And, of course, 3*(1/3) = 1.</p>
<p>What happens if we allow 0 to have an inverse? Call its inverse b. So, if b is the inverse of 0, then this means that 0*b = 1. </p>
<p>Why is this an issue? Well, because 0*anything = 0. Why is this true? </p>
<p>Since 0 + 0 = 0, it is true that r*(0+0) = r*0 for any number r. </p>
<p>Distribute r over the bracket like we're allowed to and you get r*0 + r*0 = r*0.</p>
<p>Now, just subtract r*0 from both sides and you see that r*0 = 0 for any number r. </p>
<p>So if you allow 0 to have an inverse called b, then you have two conflicting statements: 0*b = 1 but also 0*b = 0. So we can't do that. This contradicts both of the rules we laid out, and it also &quot;proves&quot; that 0 = 1, which is contrary to our assumption that a field must contain at least two distinct elements 1 and 0. We would have a bunch of nonsense statements in math, like 0 = 3*0 = 2*0 = 0, dividing by 0, we'd have 3 = 2. </p>
<p>So we don't allow division by 0 in a field like the real numbers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your example, the answer is not actually 0. This is most easily shown through a quick exercise.</p>
<p>Let's start with the number 1 and we'll divide it by smaller and smaller numbers to see what happens as we get closer to 0.</p>
<pre><code>1 / 1 = 1
1 / 0.5 = 2
1 / 0.25 = 4
1 / 0.1 = 10
1 / 0.0001 = 10,000</code></pre>
<p>Clearly, we can see that as we divide by smaller and smaller numbers, the result gets bigger and bigger. By this pattern, we can presume that dividing by 0 will give us a result of infinity (∞).</p>
<p>However, we can approach zero from the other side as well: from the negative side. Let's start at -1 and divide by smaller and smaller numbers and see what happens.</p>
<pre><code>-1 / 1 = -1
-1 / 0.5 = -2
-1 / 0.25 = -4
-1 / 0.1 = -10
-1 / 0.0001 = -10,000</code></pre>
<p>Uh oh. This pattern makes it look as though dividing a number by 0 will give a result of negative infinity (-∞). How can something equal both <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y%3D1%2Fx" target="_blank">infinity <em>and</em> negative infinity</a>? Easy: It can't. This is why we call anything divided by zero as being &quot;undefined.&quot; It has no meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
