It was mentioned that hummingbirds are capable of flapping their wings upwards of 200 times per second.  After a quick google, it seems 70 is the more common number for &quot;normal&quot; flight.  That's obviously still extremely fast and made me wonder what humans are capable of in terms of pure speed, so I thought I'd ask here.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human vocal folds can have an incredible rate of motion. An operatic soprano can achieve a pitch (fundamental frequency) of over 1000Hz, which means her vocal folds are moving back and forth 1000 times per second -- a substantially higher frequency than the hummingbird's wings.</p>
<p>Now, vocal fold vibration is not a fully &quot;articulated&quot; motion, the way flapping wings or, as in another example, throwing a ball would be. Muscle tension causes the vocal folds to come together (adduction) and to become tensed. Exhalation builds up pressure below the glottis, and the combination of this subglottal pressure and the tension on the vocal folds leads to their very rapid vibration. So while not articulated, we do create this motion &quot;voluntarily&quot; through muscle action (adduction, tension, and exhalation). </p>
<p>(And, lest you think the 1000Hz example is particular to sopranos, human speech can regularly include fundamental frequencies up to 800Hz for female adults and 400Hz for male adults).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're one of the few animals to eat a high-carbohydrate diet, a diet only possible because we grow grains as crops with agriculture. Because we eat carbs, we leave lots of delicious bits of sugar behind on our teeth for bacteria to feast on, causing tooth decay. If we don't brush, we can get painful cavities and our teeth can fall out. This is a huge health problem, and was even worse before modern oral hygiene practices.</p>
<p>Domestic dogs that eat corn-based dog food also need to have their teeth cleaned, which wild dogs don't need. Luckily there's chewy dog treats you can give your dog that do a decent job at cleaning their teeth so you don't have to do the unpleasant task of literally brushing your dog's teeth with a toothbrush. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our diet is rich in sugars, which bacteria love, because most our foods contain complex carbohydrates: think wheat, potatoes, fruit. Our food simply leaves a buffet for bacteria to feast on behind in our mouths.</p>
<p>Second: we learn. We've discovered that certain foods do this more than others, and we've learned that fluoride helps counter this effect. That means brushing alone is already neat (the calcium (chalk!) in the paste scrapes away most of that buffet), and that brushing with fluoride actually counters most of the effects!</p>
<p>How we've discovered fluoride does this: we observed that over the span of decades, some towns' people suffered tooth decay less than others, and we looked and found that their water supplies contained more fluoride. Off to the lab to check if fluoride indeed does this, and yup: it does.</p>
<p>Voilà, fluoride based toothpaste became a thing.</p>
<p>Add SLS to make it bubbly through friction, so that the bubbles can get the fluoride more between your teeth; add mint to make it nice and fresh; and bam: modern toothpaste for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive psychologist here: The basic idea is that you have a specific amount of attention your brain can pay to things. If you do not fill up your attentional resources yourself by choosing to focus on certain things then things in the environment will. If you think of a time where you were really engaged in your work that nothing in the environment (bar something crazy) would have distracted you then you were in a state of &quot;flow&quot; and your attention tank was completely full. This happens most when you have to put a lot of attention into something thus you are consciously controlling, and focusing all your attentional resources on the task. When you are lying in bed trying to fall asleep, you are using very little of your attentional resources meaning any noise or distraction in the environment, or any random thoughts you have will easily get your attention. Some people struggle with this as they just start to think about many things and find it difficult to sleep.</p>
<p>Putting background noise like TV shows on helps to control your mental resources as now you are leaving less room for those intrusive, anxious thoughts. More of your tank of attention span is being taken up by either listening/watching the TV show OR by your brain working in the background to block out the noise so you can sleep. This blocking task focuses your brain away from anxious thoughts and can calm some people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

White noise creates a masking effect, blocking out those sudden changes that frustrate light sleepers, or people trying to fall asleep. &quot;The simple version is that hearing still works while you're asleep,&quot; </p>
<p>Of course, not everyone needs [white] noise. In some people, the masking effect of white noise can do the exact opposite of what it does for most people--actually increasing sensitivity to underlying sounds.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While white noise is indeed monotonous and can mask out other noise, the sound of TV is quite different. There can be music, talking, silence, sudden changes in rhythm, or anything really.</p>
<p>I've found that there are certain people who particularly require the sound of TV or the sound of traffic to fall asleep, and other types of sound, like white noise, won't do it for them. It's not just any kind of noise that some people need, but very particular kinds of sound.</p>
<p>My theory is that those who need TV to fall asleep may have grown up in homes where parents would watch TV late into the night while the child slept. So they came to associate the sound of TV with the comfort of being home and their parents being around as a source of comfort. To them, silence would mean that no one is home or that the parents are sleeping - leaving them vulnerable and unprotected against whatever a child may be afraid of. Then this gets carried over into adulthood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction.</p>
<p>You find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. </p>
<p>Your thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly. </p>
<p>tl;dr - the sweat glands in your armpits produce scent based sweat with proteins in that bacteria eat. The byproduct of them eating protein is a bad smell. Washing and replacing your shirt gets rid of this smell. Sweat glands in your legs just produce water with salt which doesn't attract bacteria and thus does not smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a really good book on the topic of mother/infant evolution called Mother Nature by Sarah Hrdy. As I remember, she's a primatologist as well as an anthropologist so she looks at all primate parental behaviors to draw conclusions about primitive humans. As other have noted, most babies are pretty helpless so humans aren't an exception there. But two points Hrdy made that stood out to me the most.</p>
<p>One is the importance of alloparenting in primates. As they say, it takes a village to raise a child and for primates thats literally true. An entire troop is dedicated to helping the young survive, not just parents. </p>
<p>And two, many assumptions we make about what a human baby does are inaccurate. You're right that extended crying would not be a good survival technique but more primitive cultures tend to have more peaceful babies, partly because they're less colicky (I've heard this is because they dont lie babies down, which leads to acid reflux because the flap in their esophagus isn't fully formed?) and they have many cultural practices to keep babies pacified, like someone always holding the baby, nursing on demand, swaddling etc. </p>
<p>There are some writings from early Appalachia where the white explorers specifically mention how peaceful and quiet the babies of the Native Americans are. One of them even describes how (shockingly!) a baby would cry while on his mothers back and she would expose her breast, slip him under her arm, and continue with her work. I believe it was Anne Newport Royal who wrote about this.</p>
<p>Similar things could be said about babys' reflexes. Obviously they were useful at some time so we can't make assumptions that the babies we see in modern culture reflect how babies have always been.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short summary of human evolution to this day.</p>
<p>Because we out-thought them. Many human babies, as weak and helpless as they are for so many years, definitely did die by tooth and claw. But, on average, their parents were smarter than the things that wanted to eat them.</p>
<p>So they were able to defend them for years with basic logic, planned ahead to have enough food to feed their useless mouths in winter, and grew and prospered.</p>
<p>Over time those brains became even bigger and more useful. Crude clubs were fashioned to equal any tooth or claw, and battles were won. Dirt walls were piled up and men with clubs were posted to keep watch, and no mere animal could approach without detection.</p>
<p>Gradually we learned about our environment, and due to evolution of our vocal chords we were able to form language to pass down tales. Tales that told that if you spit out the fruit seed and pressed it into the earth it would be fruit for your children to eat. And so we had more fruit than any other animal could ever hope for.</p>
<p>We won so many battles and killed so many lions and tigers and bears, oh my, that they eventally evolved to fear us. A bear will not come after a human child unless it is starving to death (which isn't that uncommon). Better to eat poison than to have your entire genetic line hunted to extinction in an orgy of vengeance.</p>
<p>Lacking any animal that could stop us we quickly colonized the entire Earth. In some cases wiping out smarter (at the time) rival homonid species that didn't breed as fast (Neanderthals).</p>
<p>Eventally there was no one to turn on but ourselves. We quickly adapted to war with even bigger brains and specialized bodies. Northern European men have massively enlarged upper bodies, full of muscle, able to swing a sword and carry heavy metal armor (on average).</p>
<p>Now we are adapting to peace. No longer does the mighty arm win the argument. You have to remain calm and talk things through. You don't want trouble with the government. Eventually, over hundreds of years, that will too breed itself into our bones.</p>
<p>And we are losing the ability to operate as a biological organism without technology. Brains are so incredabily useful that women can now give birth to babies with brains two sizes to big for their hips. Surgical c-section has enabled a new era of expansion in brain sizes, with 30% more women since 1950 in America birthing babies with brains too large to survive without knife and antibiotics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some ways, your view of babies may be skewed as you only see them as they are today.  Babies have adapted to making lots of noise in order to get food, attention, etc.  I watched an episode of I shouldn't be [alive] (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914620/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914620/</a>) where the family got caught in a blizzard.  The child was 5-months old.  Instead of screaming the kid got very quiet and the parents were terrified to open the duffel bag they were carrying him in.  You find out at the end that the baby went almost into hibernation and young humans are actually able to handle that type of situation better than adults.  I believe his name was Clayton Stapola or something similar.  </p>
<p>Infant babies, even today, prefer to be swaddled and carried around (think of all of the adorable baby pictures on facebook of the kid sleeping while the parent has them in some sort of transport on their body).  I believe it is a natural and common thing that has been used for a very long time.  So the parents, as stated, outsmarted the predators but also kept them close.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Many differential equations that describe natural phenomena show this kind of dependence, making (e) inevitably show up in the solutions describing these natural phenomena. </p>
<p>Another way to think of it is in terms of the Euler equation and Eigenfunctions. Many system models describe systems as Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems. In these systems, the exponential functions with a complex argument is an Eigenfunction, i.e. a complex e stimulus yields a complex e response with some scaling factor. This makes them the simplest, concise and complete way to describe the response of such systems.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes from a particular function : the exponential function.</p>
<p>Ok, so the exponential function is pretty unique. It is the only function other than the &quot;always-zero&quot; function that is always equal to its own gradient. That means that a lot of random things follow its shape, things where the speed of the process depends on the size of the process (chemical reactions, atomic ones, bacteria populations who double every fixed amount of time, etc etc.) Basically, it's the function that fits phenomenon that have a feedback loop built into them : the bigger it is, the faster it goes, and the faster it goes, the bigger it becomes.</p>
<p>Now, e, the number, is just the value of this exponential function for an entry value of 1. It pops up a <em>lot</em> because it makes writing the exponential function very, very easy : exponential of x (exp(x)) can be written e^x</p>
<p>Plus, the &quot;always equal to its gradient&quot; bit means that the exponential function is the cornerstone of every technique we have to solve differential equations, so it pops up in a lot of abstract math too. </p>
<p>And it can also simplify a lot of work on complex numbers, which are a powerful tool to work on a whole other class of problems </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1>A Simple Answer - Why e (the number) appears so often.</h1>
<ol>
<li>Nature tends to be self-referential in many ways. One way is rates-of-change.   </li>
<li>The number e is mathematically interesting because it represents <em>the</em> (the one and only) self-referential power function. IOW, the derivative of e^x is e^x.</li>
<li>Therefore, many natural (self-referential) rate-of-change equations can be (must be) described in terms of e^x.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it!  But it's also useful to understand a little more about the definition of derivatives and the number e itself, which I discuss next.</p>
<hr />
<h1>What is a derivative?</h1>
<p>All of the following are (nearly) the exact same thing:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The rate of change of a function.  </li>
<li>The derivative of a function.  </li>
<li>The slope of a function.  </li>
<li>A tangent line to a function.  </li>
</ul>
<p>For visual learners, here's an animation. The <em>value</em> of the moving line (shown at the bottom) is the slope aka the derivative:</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Tangent_function_animation.gif" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Tangent_function_animation.gif</a></p>
<hr />
<h1>Whenever we talk about e we keep referring to e^x.  Why?</h1>
<p>Because that's where e comes from.  It is specifically the function y = A^x , considering A is a constant, such that the value of the function (the y value) is everywhere exactly equal to it's slope (equal to it's derivative).  The solution is A = 2.71828183... = e.   It looks like this:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>e</em> comes up so often because the exponential function <em>e^x</em> comes up so often.</p>
<p>And the exponential function comes up often because it describes situations where the rate of change in the amount of something is related to how much of the something you have at any point in time. </p>
<p>This relationship is important for radioactive decay, bacteria growth, finance, wave theory in electromagnetics, speed of chemical reactions, and tons of other phenomena.</p>
<p>Bacterial growth is probably the easiest example here.  If you have a bunch of bacteria sitting in a nutrient rich environment, then 30 minutes from now, you're going to have more bacteria.  And the amount of new bacteria is going to be related closely to how many you started with.  That right there is a relationship described by an exponential function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Very simplified answer if someone needs</em></p>
<p>Let's say you put money in a bank and you get a certain revenue, say 5% yearly.</p>
<p>One way to approach this is simply to add 5% to your account at the end of the year.</p>
<p>But what if you want to add 2.5% in the middle of the year and 2.5% at the end. Since you will be adding 2.5% to already increased price, you will get more.</p>
<p>Now divide the year into 3, 4, 6, 10, 1000000.. parts in a similar way, always getting a little more because you increase your funds a bit along the way. When you eventually 'chop' the year into infinite parts, the cashflow can be described by the exponential function. </p>
<p>Now you can apply this to, say, a colony of bacteria. To simplify we can assume that the rate of growth of bacteria is only proportional to the number of bacteria.  Since the growth is proportional to their numbers in every given moment, similarly to the bank model, you can again use the exponential function to describe number of bacteria in certain period of time. Most things in nature have similar dependency and therefore are described by the exponential function. </p>
<p>Many people said d/dx (e^x) = e^x is the reason, I think it's more likely another consequence of the meaning of exponential function, although the mathematically correct derivation has this property as one of premises for the function.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A person standing on the summit of Mt Chimborazo in Ecuador (furthest surface point from the center of the Earth, 6260 m ASL, 1.47° S.) would weigh about 0.7% less than they would at the North Pole.  </p>
<p>While I haven't done the math recently, I believe the two effects in play, gravitational and rotational, each contribute approximately equally to this result – between 0.3-0.4% each.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's do the math:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank">Earth's equatorial radius</a> = 6,378,100 m
Earth's polar radius = 6,356,800 m</p>
<p>Rotational velocity at equator = 2<em>pi</em>(6,378,100 m)/(24 hours * 3600 seconds/hour) = 438 m/s (980 mph)</p>
<p>Centrifugal acceleration = V^2 /r = (438 m/s)^2 / (6,378,100 m) = 0.034 m/s^2</p>
<p>Which, as others have said is ~0.34% of 1G, so the rotational velocity of the equator would reduce your weight by that percentage relative to the poles. </p>
<p>Acceleration due to gravity is G*m(earth)/r^2, so the difference in gravity at the pole versus the equator is just (r(pole)/r(equator))^2, assuming Earth's mass is uniformly distributed. </p>
<p>((6,356,800 m)/(6,378,100 m))^2 = 0.9933 or a 0.67% reduction.</p>
<p>So unless I screwed up the math somewhere, the effect of the larger radius is approximately double the effect of centrifugal acceleration and the two effects together effectively reduce your weight by ~1% at the equator vs the poles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I learned: more mass = more &quot;gravity&quot;
If the earth has a higher radius and the density is the same - and I think it should - shouldn't the gravity be stronger at the equator since there is more mass between you and Space than at the North Pole?</p>
<p>Centrifugal force should lower the force you are being pressed against the earth, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it's a bit off topic but those machines are extremely sensitive and can detect the tiniest amounts of anything they are looking for. My local airport uses 2 machines, one to just identify <em>if</em> there's anything on your hands. If that one picks anything up they bring you to a small holding area and test your hands again this machine figures out exactly what's on your hands. How do I know this? Well...</p>
<p>I worked on F-15's for the air force. My grandmother passed away so I flew home for a week to visit my family. A full week of washing my hands and showering daily (I shoild mention Im always very thorough ti wash the backs of mya hands). On my return trip I went to go through airport security and accidentally forgot a foil wrapper in my back pocket. They had to swab my hands as a precaution. It dinged positive. Talking to the TSA agent he was former air force and we chatted casually while he ran my hands through the bigger machine. After a minute or 2 he gets a print off from the machine and chuckles &quot;You said you work on airplanes? That explains why you have jet fuel on your hands.&quot; So yeah, even after all that time, washing my hands frequently (funeral lots of hand shaking etc.) And showering daily. Some how that machine was still able to pick up the JP-8 on my hands. I don't even work directly with the stuff it just leaks all over the place from tiny leaks in the jet's skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These machines are mostly ion-mobility spectrometers (IMS). The swab sample (solid or liquid) is ionized, coming up off the swab and into the air (as a gas). Ions are electrostatically pulled down a drift tube, which has an electric field (mobility source pulling the ions) and a detector. </p>
<p>The detector records the time it took for each ion to travel down the drift tube, which can be compared to lookup tables for common chemical warfare agents/explosives, drugs, etc. The operator gets a red light if any dangerous matches are found.</p>
<p>TSA can reuse a swab dozens of times as long as no positive result has been triggered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to how the machines work aside from this example (very rudimentary).</p>
<p>Let's say you have gun powder, or TATP or some other homemade explosive(HME) residue on your hands, clothes etc.  The swabs pick that up, and they're ran through the machine.  The machine throws in ions, or whatever else that react to the ions or bonds that are on the swab and then that mixture is sucked out and interpreted based on the bonds.  Results come out in a graph and the machine displays the results.  It is possible that some other compounds will pop positive for HMEs, sanitizer, lotions, grease etc.</p>
<p>False positives can be common based on the machine and when it was calibrated last.</p>

Many men lived out lives and there were clubs and newspapers and other community oriented activities that were open about being for homosexuals. When the Nazis took power, these were the first people targeted. After that, identifying gay men proceeded much the same as it does in any country that oppresses homosexuality. People were outed to the authorities and punished. Some police forces set up undercover units. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People just freely grassed them up. The Nazis would literally get thousands of unsolicited letters everyday from Germans wanting their neighbours taken off to concentration camps. Often they weren't even really gay, just single and loners in a small town where people were arseholes. But it wouldn't just be one person in town writing letters, the Nazis would often received dozens from different people about the same completely harmless person so of course then the guilt of that person was then assumed as why else would all these normal people take time out of their day to write letters. </p>
<p>It's a very interesting aspect of the Nazi regime which gets over looked because it shows how german culture enabled and even encouraged Nazi atrocities and you could argue that cultural issue has never been fully addressed. The programme Nazis, A Warning from History had a piece on it and found one of the letter writers who got one of her neighbours killed, needless to say she denied any memory of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One thing I haven't read yet are the pink lists (German Wikipedia: <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Liste" target="_blank">https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Liste</a>) The police had, even before the Nazis rose to power, been keeping taps on who was gay (mostly on male gays, though) or frequents gay clubs and bars. If you were under surveillance, there was little you could do about it since the police claimed that they're just collecting data and not using it (which was not entirely true). Of course, these lists came in handy when someone decided to round all homosexuals up. (it's a story you a lot when talking about data protection and someone drops &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; or &quot;they're just collecting data, they only need a warrant when they want to do something with it&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They were unfortunately easy targets for the Nazis. As the Nazi party gained more and more power they spread more and more propaganda. People who were once tolerant began to fear homosexuals. In 1933 the &quot;purge of homophiles&quot; banned LGBT groups, clubs, and publications. In 1934 The Gestapo complies a list of all the known LGBTQ people. Thousands were arrested, some went to regular prions while others went to concentration camps. </p>
