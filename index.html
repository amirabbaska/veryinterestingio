		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really fall asleep so much as we fade asleep, and scientifically speaking, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where wakefulness ends and sleep begins. The process of sleep starts before you're in bed, even. As you get towards the end of the day or your usual sleep time, your body temperature starts to drop, hormone levels change to get your body ready for sleep, you start to feel a bit drowsy. When you get into bed, your brain starts to take in less and less external information and your brain activity slows, shifting from active and awake beta and gamma waves to slower alpha wave to even slower theta waves. Heart rate and breathing rate slows but your muscles are still somewhat active. This is considered the first stage of sleep, NREM 1. What's interesting is that if you woke someone up in NREM 1 sleep, they may not recognize that they were asleep. In the next stage, NREM 2, you would see theta brain waves with sleep spindles and K-complexes. Your muscle activity drop and you are nearing the point where you are unaware of the outside world. This is the point where someone would be considered fully asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sleep-wake cycle is complex, and is regulated by multiple neurological circuits and neurochemicals. Serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine, noradrenaline, and hypocretin maintain the waking state. The onset of sleep is controlled by the sleep drive, which steadily increases while you are awake, as well as circadian rhythm fluctuations. As for actually falling asleep, sleep-promoting neurons in the anterior hypothalamus release the neurotransmitter GABA and inhibit the wake-promoting regions in the hypothalamus and brainstem, generating slow wave sleep (SWS). During REM sleep, regions in the brainstem typically inhibited while awake or SWS become active. The now active cholinergic neurons in the brainstem activate the thalamus which in turn increases the firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex; dreams result. Finally, sleep-promoting substances that accumulate in the brain while awake gradually increase the sleep drive by stimulating sleep-promoting neurons (Murillo-Rodriguez, Et al., 2009). How these sleep-promoting substances are accumulated and destroyed is also complex, involving feedback loops of transcription factors and other proteins, endogenous chemicals and signaling cascades that act at the genetic and cellular level. This transcriptional regulation pathway is thought to be responsible for circadian rhythm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The bladder is a muscular bag and it is not difficult to imagine that a bag of muscle will have difficulty contracting till its internal volume is zero. </p>
<p>The amount of urine left after peeing is called the PVR or postvoid residual urine (voiding being the technical word for peeing), and we know it is a thing because researchers have catheterized subjects after peeing and measured the amount left. Nowadays we can show there is urine left behind after voiding much more comfortably, using ultrasound. A PVR of less than 100ml may be quite normal.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/alesserweevil answered this pretty well. One thing to add is that incomplete emptying can be a problem. As was mentioned, a normal PVR (Post Void Residual AKA amount left in your bladder after you pee) should be &lt; 100 ccs. It can be very near zero. Anywhere in that range is generally fine. If your PVR is significantly higher, it can be signs of bladder problems, urethra problems or spinal cord dysfunction to name a few issues.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: your bladder tries to get rid of everything, but somewhere between 0 and 100ccs of urine are usually left behind. Significantly more than that = medical problem.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Novice mountaineer here. I'll try my best to answer this with what I've been learning over the last couple years of climbing.</p>
<p>Mountain summits are measured, as far as I know, in 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Elevation</strong>: Which is simply the height of the summit above sea level. Since you asked about a planet without seas, it's important to note that this is based on a <em>geodetic</em> sea level. I'm pretty sure this can be applied regardless of the existence of actual water, since it sort of defines where a sea level would be. I'm not a geologist, so that part might require clarification from someone experienced in geology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prominence</strong>: aka <em>topographic prominence</em>, is the height of the summit compared to its surroundings. Simply put, this is a measure how much higher the summit of a mountain is compared to other mountains/hills in the area. This is a big one for mountaineers because it gives a certain significance to reaching the summit, and it's sure to offer amazing views once you get there.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: This is a measurement of how far the summit lies from the closest landmass with equal elevation. This is very similar to prominence, but if a given mountain has a high <em>radius of dominance</em>, it means that it could be the highest point in the region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I'm only a novice, and I'm sure there may be a more qualified answer coming along. But I hope this helps to shed some light on the subject until that time comes!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda like a continous batch.</p>
<p>The stomach doesn't digest the food though. The stomach has the essential enzymes for protein digestion (Pepsin, Kathepsin) which cracks the polypeptides in small digestable chains. Fat basically just passes through the stomach but get made more liquidous through peristaltic. Carbohydrates are also just passing the stomach since the enzymatic digestion of the alpha(1-4)glycosidbinding of amylose through alpha-Amylase gets inhibited through the low ph Value of the stomach.
Which is the next function of the stomach. It inhibits the growth of a lot of harmful microorganisms.</p>
<p>The stomach passes the &quot;mash&quot; to the intestine. The pylorus takes care that everything stays long enough in the stomach so that it get &quot;worked up&quot; enough and supply the intestine slow and continously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The only exception to this is when the gastrointestinal tract makes so-called moving-motor-complexes, a sort of cleaning program for the tract. This happens in short intervals after fasting for approximately 8 hours. That is the only way to rid the stomach of small fragments of plastic that you might have eaten. If you never faste for 8 hours straight (some people like to eat small meals frequently), these fragments can back up in the stomach indefinitely, so remember to take a break from eating every now and again. These moving-motor-complexes are not well understood at all, so there may be more to them than just emptying large particles from the stomach. </p>

The time of gastric emptying into the small intestine varies slightly but usually is complete in just over an hour. Up to four hours for an empty stomach. So it is a batch, but a batch that takes anywhere from 1-4 hours to complete, depending on the person, batch content and medical status.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>USB C is the solution to the Heisenberg uncertainty port!  There is no right way or wrong way, there is just the way</p>
<p>That is by far its biggest upgrade over classic USB 3.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that it can provide <em>a lot</em> of power.  USB PD specs it for 60W or 100W depending on the setup, that's enough to charge a laptop</p>
<p>Its fast, it can support 10 Gbit/s, that's faster than SATA (3 the cable that connects to your hard drive)</p>
<p>Its not fairly universal.  Over the last couple years different organizations have been making specs on how to send their data over USB C cables.  It is now supported by Display Port, MHL, Thunderbolt, and HDMI.</p>
<p>So that gives it power, speed, diversity, and most importantly, no frustration</p>
<p>Pretty nifty huh?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. </p>
<p>When people go to a quick casual restaurant the price you see is the price you get. This is hopefully the optimum price for owners and customers, and the employees are paid a wage dependent on the local market.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense from a supply and demand perspective, including labor and production. Customers pay a price they are willing to pay, workers work for the most the market will bear, and owners make as much profit as they possibly can. The system is based on the constant push and pull, ultimately leading to $8.50 burritos.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this transfer to sit down restaurants? Denny’s all the way up to a steak house, waiters are paid around $2.50 + tips, while at a Chipotle it is reasonable to expect a starting wage at $9.50. Both are providing basically the same product, food. Why shouldn’t people be paid the same?</p>
<p>The question we should ask isn’t “why shouldn’t people be paid the same”, rather “why aren’t people paid the same”. It is always more useful to understand why before asking if things should be different.</p>
<p>So why are people tipped? The idea when you first look at it is ridiculous. Every single waiter in the country is an actor, playing their part, and at the end of each performance they receive a grade. Their tip. And arguably the better your performance the better your tip. Is this why people tip? Mostly no. If someone tips 20% at every meal the chance they will tip less than 15% is highly unlikely. And just as unlikely is tipping 25%. The same can be said for someone who tips 10%, or 5%. People go into restaurants with their own idea of what is appropriate and tip accordingly, regardless of service.</p>
<p>This is not to completely diminish the importance of competent waiters, good service and hard work matter. They just don’t matter nearly as much as many people would like to believe.</p>
<p>This misconception is important explain tipping’s staying power. It fits nicely with American ideas of hard work and individualism. It also makes it easier to manage a wait staff. The carrot is nicely held in front “do good work, be diligent and friendly, you will be paid more”.</p>
<p>That isn’t the only reason for tipping, full service restaurant economics might be more important. For those unaware full-service restaurants are expensive operations. If you buy a plate of pasta for $20, reasonably you can expect 10% to 15% of the bill to go to rent, around 25% to 30% to go to the cost of food, between 20% and 25% of the bill is labor. Just with rent, labor, and COGS a restaurants margin is somewhere between 45% and 30%. This does not include management, cleaning, maintenance, marketing, utilities, and dozens of other small expenses. When all is said and done, most sit down full-service restaurants make anywhere between 4% and 7% of gross income. That pasta made the owner somewhere between $.80 to $1.40.</p>
<p>Should you pity the restaurateur? Probably not. It can be a good living and owner operated locations often have the benefit of not “paying” for management and some labor, meaning someone can run a $600,000 a year restaurant and bring home around $80,000 to $120,000. But for big corporate chains the reality is margins are low compared to other businesses, operating cost are high, and there is a nasty little industry secret.</p>
<p>They don’t make money 80% of the time.</p>
<p>A slow lunch on Tuesday doesn’t keep the lights on. It might only cover the cost of rent. A good example is Twin Peaks, a chain similar too Hooters. Each Twin Peaks has a very expensive building, in an expensive areas, with expensive cooks, high management costs, and only makes money after 5 PM Monday through Thursday. Those high-volume times are so high they pay for the rest of the “dead time”.</p>
<p>This is typical for many restaurants, some are busy for lunch during the week, others are big breakfast places, others need have a good Friday or they can’t pay their suppliers. Whatever the pattern of customers it is very rare to find a restaurant which can support a full staff 100% of the time. Here’s the kicker, customers expect and demand the same service level 100% of the time.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>You need cooks in the back, at a minimum labor is $10 an hour (probably more, in large Texas cities a good line cook makes at least $11.50 an hour). You need managers, contrary to popular belief they do things. Here is where tipping makes a lot of sense. The cooks and the managers jobs are the same Monday through Sunday. Yes, they may be busier sometimes, but a manager can do inventory on slow times and a good line cook is always prepping for busy times. They can spread their labor around, and as such it is unreasonable to expect a them to be paid less in a slow time.</p>
<p>Now for the waiters, they can’t functionally spread their labor to other times. You can’t build up waiter capacity and use it when needed. A waiter is only useful to a restaurant when a customer is in the building.</p>
<p>The cost of running a restaurant are fixed (even labor and management to a certain extent) but the revenue is inconsistent. Tipping allows restaurants to meet the expectations of customers, high quality service always, and allows restaurants to pay waiters only when they can afford to pay them. The waiters get to earn a percentage of their sales and give up a standard paycheck in return for more control over their salaries.</p>
<p>There are plenty of holes in the argument and it raises a lot of question. Why don’t restaurants find out what the actual hourly wage is for servers and pay them accordingly? Why don’t restaurants staff employees more effectively? Why don’t customers accept higher prices? Why don’t restaurants raise prices to just pay people more?</p>
<p>All the questions are worth answering, but it always gets back to supply and demand and human behavior. When people look at the price of a menu they decide to purchase the food or go to another restaurant. And with Yelp and Google price comparisons are easier than ever. It means if a restaurant charges $15 for a burger it had better be at least 2X as good as $7.50 burger. Higher prices must correlate with higher value. And as much as every restaurant claims to have “the best….” there is a market price for a burger and for a steak.</p>
<p>But almost all Americans know the price you see is not the result. We don’t have VAT, we factor in tax and tip. We are all taxed the same, but we don’t all tip the same.</p>
<p>Tipping functions the same way as a coupon. Tipping allows customers to receive the same service, eating at a restaurant and ordering the same food, while paying different prices. There is an efficiency to the system. Those who are price conscious and less willing to tip are more enticed to a restaurant with low prices, while a less price conscious person is attracted to the same restaurant. The owner gets the business of both customers and the wait staff gets functionally an average tip from both customers.</p>
<p>At this point it is worth pointing out how many redditors have said “while I was in university I waited tables” or “while I was in college I worked the bar” and they made “well over minimum wage” because “they worked hard”. This is a generalization and as a rule should be avoided. Except in the preceding sentence. But they hint at a very uncomfortable truth about the service industry, educated, young, and attractive people can make very good money from tips (big assumption, redditors are young, attractive, and well educated). I assure you, you are not better at your job than the middle-aged waiter at Denny’s, but you will get paid more. The ability to access higher paying jobs in the service industry is based on your background, your looks, and how you speak.</p>
<p>What is the conclusion? Should we abolish tipping? Outlawing tipping might make waiters at lower cost restaurants get paid more (this makes sense, tipping is a function of a percentage of sales, lower cost food leads to a lower cost per transaction, leading to a lower tip, and lower wages), but it certainly would impact a lot of college educated people capitalizing on their social skills. It might make a lot of restaurant radically readjust their labor, with some restaurant surely closing. It might make an entire industry segment, sit down restaurants (which are losing sales and business at a fast clip) less attractive to customers, lowering sales and lowering overall wages.</p>
<p>Personally, I see tipping as a bad system, not from an economic standpoint but from a moral standpoint. People shouldn’t have to sing for their supper. They should do a job, get paid for the job, and whether some jerk tipped shouldn’t affect whether you make rent. But it is much more complicated than that. Many restaurants have tried to change tipping culture, and none has met with much success. Certainly there hasn’t been a brushfire of “de-tipping”.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before the Prohibition of alcohol, tips were basically bribery so some customer could get better services like bigger plates of be given food faster. When the Prohibition of alcohol came, restaurants saw a huge income decrease and they encourage their waiters to accept tips so they could get paid, instead of readjusting the whole prices so the money before spent on alcohol was driven to food and non.alcoholic beverages. </p>
<p>This become so strong that now reataurants can pay little no nothing while their customers live out of tips. In reallity, they can accept the tips and if they dont get to minimun wage, they can legally ask the money to their employer so they can get minimun wage.</p>
<p>This is something just in USA and maybe some other countries. In Spain, where i live, tipping is not mandatory but is somewhat encouraged if the service is good, fast and take more orders than normal, if the table was big, if they bring bread and tap water instead of bottled when we ask for it... In Japan is even considered of bad education to give money as a tip cause is seen as a way to show off how much money you have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will, of course, get lost or downvoted to oblivion.</p>
<p>I'll put the TL;DR first...</p>
<p>TL;DR The tipping system creates higher potential wages, lower operating costs and a less expensive dine in experience for customers.</p>
<p>On average in my business my tipped employees make 19% off of my gross sales. That's one hell of a lot better than what I make off of it. And, I'm the one shouldering all the risk. I work the most, work the hardest and went years without income to build it.  Even if the business is losing money, the tipped employees still make a percentage of gross sales.</p>
<p>So, the plebe assumption seems to center on &quot;Those cheap owners, why do I have to pay their staffs wages?&quot;. Not only does the customer have to pay the wages, they have to pay the rent, utilities, food costs, insurance, trash pick up, water ect. If customers do not pay at least 100% of the costs of a business to operate that business closes.</p>
<p>The next plebe argument is &quot;Just raise menu prices to cover tips so I don't have to feel bad about not tipping&quot;. And here is where they've really gone off course because that would actually cost customers MORE money than the current tipping culture/system.</p>
<p>The assumption is that I can just raise my prices 19% (to cover the tip rate) and eliminate tipping and servers/bartenders can make the same amount of money. Here is why that is wrong.</p>
<p>1) Sales Tax: There is no sales tax on tips. But, if tips were rolled into the menu price the cost of the meal not only went up by 19%, sales tax also went up 19%. The cost of the meal is now 21% higher.</p>
<p>2) Insurance premiums: The premiums of the various types of insurance a restaurant/bar must carry (with the exception of insuring the property itself since that's based on its appraised value) are based on gross sales. Assuming that at the higher price, total volume remains the same (which it won't but I'll get to that) gross sales increase so insurance premiums increase. That cost must also be added to the cost of the meal (increasing the menu price and the total sales tax paid again)</p>
<p>3) Employer payroll taxes: This costs about 13% of payroll. The increase in payroll increases the amount of employer payroll tax (which increases the menu price and total sales tax paid again)</p>
<p>These are the big three. It is, therefor, cheaper for the customer to pay a lower menu price and tip.</p>
<p>Now lets talk about what happens at the higher price point.</p>
<p>Restaurant/Bar spending is highly elastic. What does that mean in economics?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If a small change in price is accompanied by a large change in quantity demanded, the product is said to be elastic (or responsive to price changes). Conversely, a product is inelastic if a large change in price is accompanied by a small amount of change in quantity demanded&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the higher price point, volume will decrease. You may achieve the same gross sales but the volume moved to get those sales is lower (less items sold at a higher price). This reduces the demand for labor. There will be less hours available to work.</p>
<p>At a higher price point, the size of the customer pool a restaurant/bar has to draw from will shrink. Tipping creates a sliding price scale for customers. One customer may pay less than another customer for the same meal because they tip less. Our average tip rate is 19%. Some customers tip 40%, some 20%, some tip 0%. A $10 meal costs customer A $10 and customer C $14. If you eliminate tipping and raise the price to $12, customer B will still come and probably still tip while customer A has been eliminated from your market. (decreasing volume and the need for labor)</p>
<p>Now lets talk about the employees specifically.</p>
<p>Tips are federally protected wages. I can't touch that money. It must go to the tipped employees. If I raised my prices and eliminated tipping, that money is now MINE to do with what I please. There are plenty of operators out there that would just slide some of that money into their pocket.</p>
<p>With regards to inflation: Because tipped employees make a percentage of their gross sales, a big chunk of their wages are directly tied to inflation. If my costs go up 3% and I have to raise my prices 3% they make 3% more in tips. Flat wages instead of tipping uncouples tipped employees wages from inflation. So, keep that in mind when you hear a server complain how they are making the same hourly wage they did 10 years ago, because they are not. Their tips have increased with inflation.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of fair compensation between tipped employees. Tipped employees make a percentage of their sales volume. If tipped employees made flat wages instead, how many would be clamoring to work a Friday or Saturday night, deal with all that volume and stress when they can just work Monday and make the same amount of money? I'd rather be off on the weekends! Our lowest total hourly wage tipped employee averaged $16.13 an hour (tips + hourly) last year and our highest almost $30 an hour (tips + hourly) last year. But, the $30/hr employee worked the toughest shifts, handled more stress and offered more flexible hours (aside from just being a better employee period). The tipping system directly accounts for the difference in how much effort the two employees put in last year. How do you account for that in a flat wage system? And don't tell me I have to do additional hours of payroll acrobatics with fluctuating hourly payrates based on demand.</p>
<p>With the tipping system in place now, the highest value, most talented and hardest working employees are directly compensated by making a percentage of their higher gross sales and they are directly compensated for working the toughest, highest volume shifts.</p>
<p>TL;DR The tipping system creates higher potential wages, lower operating costs and a less expensive dine in experience for customers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>not sure if anyone has said this yet, but this gives some background on how the idea of gratuity arrived in America from Europe. this is an excerpt from something i wrote for my job. </p>
<p>According to the New York Times, the idea of tipping was conceived in 17th century Europe. During the late-1700s, private homeowner’s would open their homes to upper-class travelers, sort of like a snooty, prehistoric Air BnB. Following their stay, the guests of these private homes would leave money for the host’s servants, thus inventing the idea of leaving monetary compensation for being waited on. So, what started as something that only rich people did, soon spread to other classes of European society. Here’s a fun fact: according to the same New York Times article, the term ‘Tip’ is actually an acronym that stands for “to insure promptitude.” So, back in the day, if you wanted your tea and biscuits ASAP, you’d slip a nickel in your waiter’s knickers to insure the promptitude.
So how did Europe’s strange practice of insuring promptitude make it to to America? War. In the late-1800’s, following the Civil War, wealthy American’s began vacationing in Europe and, in turn, picked up on the aristocratic practice. When they returned home, they brought tipping with them in order to show off how high class they were. Unsurprisingly, not everyone was stoked about handing over more of their hard-earned cash. So, tipping came along and a lot of Americans weren’t feeling it. They thought it promoted classism and aristocratic ideals, something they had just freed themselves from. In fact, an 1897 New York Times article compared the spread of tipping to the spread of ‘evil insects and weeds.’ The fear, was that the incentive of tipping would lead to waiters and waitresses going to extreme lengths to appease customers. By 1904, the Anti-Tipping Society of America was founded. Their mission? No tipping for one whole year. Anti-tipping sentiment grew and grew until Washington state became the first of six states to make tipping outright illegal. But, as is turns out, the psychological effect of not tipping turned a lot of people into walking piles of shame aka the laws weren’t followed, they were rarely enforced and almost never held up in court. Once 1926 roared its way in, anti-tipping laws were extinct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Flash applet is like a program. It can run it's own code and be used to write information to your computer. While modern up to date computers try and prevent this from  happening, unknown bugs or design choices in either Flash, your internet browser, or operating system can lead to exploitation. It's just one more security gap you have to worry about, and it was designed in a time where internet security was much less of an issue</p>
<p>From a usability perspective, it does not cleanly integrate with the rest of a website. You can right click &quot;inspect&quot; a webpage and see the various parts that make it work. Doing the same on a flash applet will basically tell you &quot;THERE IS FLASH HERE&quot; and tell you very little or nothing about what the app is doing. This is particularly bad for the visually impaired, as most screen readers are unable to read content from flash. The flash app does not work with back / forward buttons. Reloading a hung page will reload the app and usually erase any progress made. It is intensive to run on your CPU (not so much today, but computers are  just that powerful). Older apps may not run properly on modern browsers. Each browser needs it's own plugin. It's one more thing you have to keep updated and install on a new computer. IOS no longer supports it. Older android phones can be blocked from installing on Google Play.</p>
<p>Flash was a quick and dirty way to provide multimedia content when people were on 33.6 Kbps modems. Most apps would utilize vectors rather than store bandwidth intensive bitmaps. It was never meant to become a video streaming standard. Feel free to dive down the rabbit hole of Microsoft and W3C battles over web standards if you want to unravel the history there. (TLDR; without a standard, it was the only semi-universal way of doing it without licensing issues).</p>
<p>It was neat gimmick that stepped up when there were no viable alternatives. Removal of IOS support was the writing on the wall, as it lost support for one of the top Smartphone manufacturers. It's limped along with Adobe (who bought it from Macromedia) threatening to kill it every few years. Like Internet Explorer 6, it looks like it may finally be laid to rest.</p>
<p>SIKE! </p>
<p>IE6 still trudges along with a 1% market share as of 2015! Flash's zombified corpse will probably still haunt at least a few of our grandchildren.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flash was a huge step forward for adding rich web content... when it was new. This tool came around in 1996 when webpages were absolutely lifeless compared to now, the most you could do was scrolling text and a MIDI song. Flash gave you tons of bells and whistles.</p>
<p>But the tools built into HTML and javascript got good and browser support for them got much better. What used to take fancy Flash now works with just built-in browser abilities, even games or video playback. Flash was getting squeezed out, and didn't really have a new area to grow into. However, even without Flash adobe is still heavily cemented as a go-to tool for creators... tons of content on the web, even if it's not flash, was probably made with Photoshop/Dreamweaver/After Effects. They're still making money as &quot;the digital creative stuff people&quot; and don't have to support Flash anymore. If anything, that's better for them.</p>
<p>Adobe Animate CC is ultimately the replacement for Flash, offering similar functionality and animation tools while running on top of HTML5 instead of requiring users get the Flash Player plugin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>B meson, not beta.</p>
<p>With the LHCb run 2 dataset and Belle II, it's possible that one or several of these anomalies could reach 5σ statistical significance (if they're real effects, of course). What happens next depends a bit on which process it is. If it's the tree-level b→c anomaly (R(D), R(D*)) then it's a bit easier to explore the nature of the new physics in these decays. If it's the loop-level b→s anomalies (R(K), R(K*), P5´) then it could be some very heavy new physics entering the loop which might not be directly accessible at the LHC.
Either way would motivate direct searches for new particles. If nothing is seen at ATLAS or CMS after the HL-LHC is finished, then this motivates building an even higher-energy collider.</p>
<p>Popular suggestions are: Z´ (&quot;Z prime&quot;), leptoquarks, 2HDM, charged Higgs, SUSY etc. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06861" target="_blank">here</a> for another summary.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was at an aeronautics conference recently and there was a lot of talk about helium airships. The question of helium came up, and nobody seemed worried. Even if helium airships become the norm, we have enough helium in readily available states worldwide to last until at least 2100. </p>
<p>Helium is a by product of mining natural gas, but because we have so much of it right now it's not worth storing. When we start running out (which, again, is a long time from now), we will begin mining it again. Yes, there's a limited supply on earth, but that limit is far far away. We'll be exploring space by the time we run out of helium, and there's plenty of helium in space.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Just to be clear, the 2100 estimate is for our <em>current</em> supply. That is, assuming we cease all extraction efforts. There is still way more helium in the earth than we have ever touched in the history of mankind. There are also many more deposits. <strong>We are not going to run out in 2100.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>^(2): Some articles.<br />
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/06/18/were-really-not-about-to-run-out-of-helium-no-please-stop-it-were-not/2/#145067c062bb" target="_blank">Forbes, 2015</a> &quot;We're as likely to run out of helium as we all are to starve to death because we've eaten the bacon in the refrigerator, meaning that we cannot ever have breakfast again.&quot; This article also debunks the claims that we'll run out in 25-30 years (which is what most articles pick up on). The current market prices will rise in 25-30 years; there's still a lot of helium.<br />
<a href="https://www.chem.info/blog/2015/07/world-running-out-helium-or-it" target="_blank">Chem.info, 2015</a> &quot;So while it’s true that the U.S. supply of helium may be dwindling, that doesn’t mean we’re in any immediate danger of losing this precious element.&quot;<br />

The reason for the recent shortage is governments  stopped supporting the sequestering of helium which is extremely expensive.
So now if a company wants to sequester helium and purify it to be a usable grade in machines  such as an MRI it takes a lot and I mean a lot more money. So currently there are just not enough companies willing to produce high quality helium. It's not like MRIs and balloons are competing for the same thing.  </p>
<p>Edit: MRI machines and other medical/important devices get first dibs on the helium as well so the shortage really affects chemist who need it for spectroscopy plus a bunch of other experiments
and apparently scuba divers </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Helium is actually a byproduct of radioactive decays that are still going on in earth crust. Helium atoms are actually alpha particles which acquire electrons after coming out (or, alpha particles are actually helium nuclei, atoms without electrons). More than one helium atom will be produced as an uranium atom decays in multiple steps down to a lead atom. With that kind of production -albeit slowly, in billion years- going on, we should not be afraid of 'wasting' helium even for Donald Duck karaoke parties.</p>
<p>As other answers indicate, we get helium from oil or natural gas extraction sites, but that's only because those are the places where we find it profitable to drill into earth's crust and they are natural pockets where alpha particles will gather as helium atoms. If we run out of oil or gas, we should still be able to extract helium (maybe in much smaller quantities) from any drilling site, but then the helium buyers may have to pay for the drilling costs. only then we may regret the helium &quot;wasted&quot; for frivilous purposes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
