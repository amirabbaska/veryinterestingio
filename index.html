		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, to start off, muscle memory is not in your muscles, it's in your brain. Muscle memory is essentially your brain learning what to do to make a certain movement happen. </p>
<p>When you start off trying to learn a new physical skill, you often know what you want the end result to be (I want the ball to wind up over <em>there</em>), but you don't know exactly how to make that happen. You try to make the right movement, and over time your brain learns exactly what sequence of individual muscle movements (and what visual / bodily feedback to use) will produce the result you want. </p>
<p>Essentially, in the process of learning a motor (movement) skill, your brain creates a new &quot;program&quot; that it can run whenever it's needed. When it's time to throw a ball, your brain can activate the &quot;ball throwing program&quot; instead of having to consciously figure out exactly what movements to try, like you do when you're first learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When your brain issues a complex command correctly, like playing a sequence of notes, or swinging a baseball bat, or executing a maneuver in a videogame, there is a reward signal that serves to strengthen connections between neurons in that pathway. Eventually the process becomes more like this: The higher functioning part of the brain sends a signal to &quot;do that thing&quot;, and it's so encoded in the downstream pathway that it kind of just takes it from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how in pictures of the brain there's this spaghetti-like lump at the back? That's the cerebellum. The cerebellum is a <strong>cybernetic control machine</strong>. I've yet to see a textbook explain how fascinating it really is. Let's take a look.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>About 75% of your neurons are located in your cerebellum. Some researchers estimate <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776484/" target="_blank">that it contains 100 billion neurons</a>, all packed into that ball of spaghetti. Because of this, you'd be right in assuming that the cerebellum is the brute-force mechanism of the brain in terms of information processing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what does it do?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've used the word &quot;machine&quot; to describe it, which might sound odd to you. In 1967, a trio of researchers published <em>The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine</em>. Therein, they argued that the cerebellum was analogous to a computer. This idea has persisted and has been expanded on by others.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The cerebellum performs error correction; it reduces the discrepancy between intended and actual movements. When you reach out to grab something, you rely on proprioceptive feedback signals to adjust your trajectory. Motor plans originate in the motor area of the cerebral cortex. Signals are sent down to the spine and to relevant muscle fibers. At the same time, a copy of the motor plan travels to the cerebellum. Signals from the motor fibers head back up to the cerebellum. There they converge. The cerebellum can adjust the movement so that becomes nice and smooth rather than &quot;jerky&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, the motor plans and the error correction is fine and all, but there's an important question we haven't considered: <em>should</em> you reach out to grab something?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The basal ganglia can be blamed for your habits, good or bad. It is believed to be highly involved in <strong>habit-formation</strong>. What's more, it is thought to evaluate and scrutinize motor plans.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The motor cortex is, in fact, at all times inhibited by the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia frees cortical neurons from inhibition when it has been decided that the motor plan is appropriate. In a sense, the basal ganglia is the sculptor of behavior. Actions that lead to good consequences are encouraged (less likely to be inhibited) and actions that lead to bad consequences are discouraged (more likely to be inhibited).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As the basal ganglia is involved with value, it has been suggested that its goal is to maximize reward. <em>Skill</em> simply means you are able to more efficiently carry out a task, which means you can collect rewards faster.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, this all seems nice and dandy. There are some issues, however. People with cerebellar ataxia, meaning their cerebellum is screwed up, are just pretty clumsy. They aren't flailing around in misery. When treating Parkinson's disease, DBS is often used to essentially put the basal ganglia out of commission. And it doesn't seem to affect people very negatively. So if these two structures are so incredibly important, why do we seem to manage so well without them? I have no idea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some researchers argue that the basal ganglia in humans mostly controls the <em>vigour</em> of movement. I'm not sure what I think about this idea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One idea I'd like to leave with you with is the idea that automatization of behavior is remarkably similar to organizational structures in human groups. There's a leader, like the prefrontal cortex, that decides on the overall goal and how it should be achieved. The leader shouldn't concern itself with minute details, just the overall progress toward the goal. Similarly, humans tend to &quot;space out&quot; when their attention is not required. What I believe actually happens is that attention moves where it is most useful. While lower brain areas steer your car towards your destination, you engage in (relatively) incredibly complex simulations of the future, such as planning what you will be having for lunch. This is beyond the scope of most organisms on the planet. You are acting not on the actual world, but on a model of it that is so exact that you can treat it as a substitute for the real thing. This should blow our minds more than it does.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Acquiring &quot;muscle memory&quot; is the process of delegating trivial motor activity to subconscious processes so the conscious part can focus on more important issues.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's precisely what concert stage musicians rely on to perform so perfectly. The constant practice in repetition of musical notations produces an addiction symposium in the brain. Musicians literally addict themselves to the exact notational patterns by repeating over 300 times. The brain co-operates by creating a neural netting of synapse and each time the passage is played correctly, the synapse is further emphasized and electrified.
With the pattern well-defined in the brain, the cluster of muscles fired-up and necessary to perform with the instrument, follows in sympathy to the already familiar neural passageways in the brain.
On-stage concert performances of many selections having complicated muscular movements are delivered by memory -- many musicians have prepared totally by rehearsing their entire repertoire blind-folded! That's complete muscle memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every answer so far has discussed neural adaptation. But sometimes when people use the term &quot;muscle memory&quot;, they're referring to the phenomenon wherein it's usually faster to re-build muscle, than it was to build muscle mass the first time around. This is because of the greater proliferation of <em>satellite cells,</em> which are what initiate the production of muscle tissues in response to resistance training. Once you make more of these, you always retain them, and thus have an easier time regaining your gains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a caterpillar forms a chrysalis to metamorphose, despite common misconception, a suite of enzymes doesn't literally digest the body down to a rich fluid to reform anew from scratch. Only some of their organs do that; the rest remain largely intact and simply undergo radical remodelling via cells undergoing programmed death to be replaced by other rapidly dividing cells. A chrysalis is not quite just a bag of protein goop.</p>
<p>With this in mind, how does a caterpillar survive? Let's break it down:</p>
<p><strong>Oxygen:</strong> A developing chrysalis clearly needs some sort of gas exchange taking place to keep breathin'. All insects breathe through teeny pores that line their bodies called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiracle" target="_blank">spiracles</a>, which lead into long tendril-like tubes that penetrate deep into the body, carrying oxygen. Thankfully, during metamorphosis, this respiratory system remains intact (even through a bit of renovation), allowing the developing butterfly to continue breathing throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrients:</strong> Unable to forage for food, a stationary chrysalis is at risk of running out of energy - after all, it uses a considerable sum to forge a new body. However, before enclosing itself in a hard outer shell, the caterpillar spends almost all waking moments gorging itself, storing up an enormous amount of energy as body fat. During metamorphosis, it's this stored fat that's broken down into the requisite resources needed to survive; a chrysalis can lose over half its weight during the entire process, as this fat is broken down.</p>
<p><strong>Waste:</strong> As with the spiracles that provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, a series of malpighian tubules remove excretory waste - albeit in this case not outside the chrysalis. They're likewise retained through much of metamorphosis and release concentrated nitrogenous waste into an isolated subsection along where the caterpillars intestines once hung about. When the butterfly emerges, it releases all of this, well, poop and bits of old caterpillar carcass as a red fluid out the abdomen, known as meconium. Finally released of this debris of its past experience, it can stretch its wings and fly away.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I first want to say how cool this is and thank you very much for sharing. So this was long before the days of digital electronics that you could just program to do something like find the current in a circuit. What your great grandfather did was work with a method of measuring the current going through a circuit by taking pictures of a magnatized needle. When you have current running through a wire, it creates a magnetic field around the wire. So if you have a magnetized needle next to it, the needle should move according to the strength of the current. Since the current from an AC source is constantly changing, if you take a bunch of photos timed just right, you can backtrack the current going through the wire at some time by the position of the needle.</p>
<p>Though, he says at the beginning that he did not develop the technique, it seems like he was focused on applying it to new situations to make sure it is a valid way to measure the current in complicated circuits. Again, this is really awesome and I'm glad you shared it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware, we still don't <em>quite</em> know.</p>
<p>Compared to humans, we've known for some time that insects are generally more resistant to ionizing radiation, and multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this radioresistance.</p>
<p>For a long time it was thought that because actively dividing cells are those most sensitive to radiation, insects would succumb less as, unlike humans with our leagues of constantly dividing cells, insects undergo discontinuous periods of growth (only with every moult). But this whole organism approach to radioresistance was tricky to interpret, as the physiology between us and, say, invertebrates is very different.</p>
<p>At a cellular level however, experiments on cells controlling for proliferative rate have revealed that insect cells are <em>de facto</em> more radioresistant than human cells, leading us to believe division rate actually might only have a little to do with it. When you blast human and insect cells with ionising radiation, the DNA within the insect cells itself undergoes much less damage, and what damage is present is more effectively repaired. Likewise, those same insect cells experience lower oxidative stress as a consequence of radiation exposure (radiation triggers the production of rather harmful reactive oxygen species that, amongst other things, trigger cells to commit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" target="_blank">apoptotic</a> suicide). </p>
<p>So yup, it appears the suite of repair enzymes insects utilise are simply better at dealing with DNA damage, explaining why insects have greater radioresistance. As for the evolutionary reason why they're more efficient, we're still not quite sure.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reason might just be the number of cells. For example, one of the reason why you can freeze sperm cells and not live animals is that if 1% of sperm cells die from cryogenization, you still have 99% live ones ; meanwhile, if 1% of your cells die from it, you are dead.</p>
<p>By the same token, a radiation that would transform ten of your cells into tumors would mutate only 1 cell from an animal with 10 times less cells, and very small animal would most likely not be affected at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For small animals, their volume (and hence weight and mass of cells) is MUCH smaller compared to their surface area.

<p>The dose of ionizing radiation is proportional to the flux of radiation through a given frontal area.  Large animals have much, much more mass of flesh behind each square centimeter of frontal area in which the radiation can stop and impart its energy.  Small animals have much LESS mass of flesh behind each unit of frontal area.  Is it possible that ionizing radiation is more likely therefore to pass right through a small animal?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you see a building. It’s one of those company buildings that has automatic doors, but these automatic doors only open from the inside so people can walk out. You think this is interesting, and you want to know how it works. It could work a couple of ways, it could have a weight sensor, or it could have a motion sensor. You don’t see a floor pad, so it couldn’t be a weight sensor. You notice that there’s a gap in between the doors and you happen to have a can of compressed air that has a straw that will fit inside the gap. You figure “if it’s a motion sensor, it should sense the dust the compressed air moves” so you stick the straw through the gap and spray air. The door opens.</p>
<p>This is hacking. Typically you think of hacking as computer hacking, but hacking really is just getting things to do something they weren’t intended to do. Computer hacking is typically seeing a system, investigating how it works, and seeing if you can get it to do something it wasn’t intended to do</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>I noticed that the path behind Florence is showing the water cooled (because Florence is taking energy from the water).  Does this ultimately help cool the Earth because the heat is transferred into the atmosphere where there is more surface area for it to radiate into space?  Even if this effect is minuscule -- is it still possible?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What temperature does the surface water have to be to sustain a hurricane?  Does it depend on the atmospheric temperatures because a hurricane is basically just a heat engine?</p>
</li>
<li>If the surface temperature of the ocean was near boiling, how much more powerful could hurricanes become?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen is just very inert, it's not reactive and is not easy to take out of the air for use in reactions.</p>
<p>But there is a cycle, naturally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation#Biological_nitrogen_fixation" target="_blank">nitrogen fixing bacteria</a> take nitrogen from the air and turn it into nitrogen compounds like ammonia, this is what plants and other organisms use to incorporate nitrogen into other compounds (it's required for many amino acids). These bacteria typically live in the roots of Legume (plants like soybeans and peas). Thus nitrogen is a critical fertilizer for plants and it's required for all plants but not &quot;fixed&quot; many places.</p>
<p>We use a synthetic process to make ammonia, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process" target="_blank">haber process</a> because we needs LOTs of ammonia to grow crops on a huge industrial scale the way we do. We spend over 1% of all the worlds energy doing this, essentially to accelerate the nitrogen cycle.</p>
<p>All that nitrogen eventually goes into living things to make their proteins. Some things will eventually release the nitrogen back as a gas (some bacteria will do it, as will just burning plant/animal matter). In general, there isn't much movement outside of this bacteria and human pathway to take nitrogen out of the air, and it's very stable in the air, so things tend to just turn to N2 and stay that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nitrogen molecules that make up 80% of the atmosphere are very stable and it's therefore hard to do anything with (or to) them.</p>
<p>In nature, some amount of nitrogen is essential for plants and animals to create proteins. But they cannot use atmospheric nitrogen for that, only some bacteria are able to turn atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that are useable - these are then used by plants, and by the animals that eat the plants, and by the bacteria and fungi that decompose dead animals, and then again by plants... You can see the whole cycle here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle#/media/File:Nitrogen_Cycle.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle#/media/File:Nitrogen_Cycle.svg</a></p>
<p>Nitrogen is an important component of fertilizer, and there are some parallels to fossil fuels - nitrogen deposits are created by plants or animals in some circumstances, and in some places we're harvesting thousands- or millions of years old deposits to fertilize our fields. However, this is less critical than fossil fuels because it doesn't really have an impact on the atmosphere, and in any case the fertilizer can also be produced artificially.</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing nitrogen is used for is to make explosives and rocket fuel. The amounts  are pretty irrelevant on a global scale, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Nitrogen gets more wonky as you breath it at high pressures such as being underwater. As you go down you your body becomes more saturated, this isn’t too big of a deal until you try to resurface without giving your body enough time to wash out the nitrogen from your tissues. What can happen here is called DCI it decompression illness.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen is an “organic” element, meaning it’s found in all life. Carbon is also found in all living life (not to be confused with carbon dioxide, just elemental carbon). Hydrogen is another element that is found in life. Nitrogen can be found in soil, various minerals and plants, and in the air.</p>
<p>However it is non-reactive for the most part. Nitrogen doesn’t change very much the way carbon and other elements do. This means that, while it’s found everywhere on Earth and in our atmosphere, it doesn’t come in many forms.</p>
<p>Elements like carbon can be shaped into gases, solids like diamond, soft solids like graphite, etc. Oxygen can bond with many things like hydrogen (becoming hydrogen monoxide, which is a lethal gas), water, carbon, and many other elements.

<p>This claim that body size has an effect isn't so far off, as obesity has been shown to cause increases in inflammation throughout the body. Additionally, influenza tends to have a higher infection rate and mortality rate in obese individuals. So, to answer your question, yes, the duration and severity are both impacted.</p>
<p>Fatigue can also lead to worse contraction of a virus, so don't overdo the exercise.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There has been some research into the relationship between fat-free muscle mass/limb muscle volume and immunity. Much of the interest comes from the evolutionary biology question, &quot;If more muscular men are much more attractive mates (as exhibited by modern surveys of volume of sexual encounters and age at first sexual encounter), why is there still such a large population of males with lower muscle mass?&quot; (please forgive the generalities in that question statement, it's not the main focus of this post so I didn't spend a lot of time on it).</p>
<p>Anyway, a likely answer to that question appears to be that higher ratios of fat-free muscle mass and limb muscle volume are negative predictors for C-reactive protein and white blood cell count (measures of native immunity). In other words, naturally fit or muscular bodies seem to have an inverse relationship to immune system fitness in male human populations.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138\(09\)00039-7/abstract" target="_blank">this abstract</a> for more precise language on the topic.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Opiate overdoses have already been mentioned as causing respiratory depression. I’m an ER nurse, they way I explain it to people is your body doesn’t know it needs to breathe. </p>
<p>When you hold your breath, you experience the burning lung sensation and eventually, your body will force you to breathe again. (Little kids who say they’re going to hold their breath till they die? Doesn’t work.) </p>
<p>Opiates block that feedback from happening. Your body, overdosed on opiates, does not recognize that it needs to breathe. So it doesn’t. </p>
<p>A normal (adult) respiratory rate is 12-20 breaths per minute. I’ve seen people come in at 3-4. Even if we give Narcan (the opiate reversal drug) depending on how long they’ve been at 4 breaths per minute, we might not get them back. Brain damage from lack of oxygen starts at around 3 minutes. Sometimes people have been down for hours before they’re found. </p>
<p>Cocaine can speed up your heart rate so much that the heart can’t keep up, and will stop. When your heart is between beats, that’s when blood flows to the actual heart itself. The faster your heart rate, the less blood/oxygen is getting to the heart, and eventually the heart can’t go on. (I’ve only seen this happen once, and it was intentional.) </p>
<p>People ask “What’s your poison” regarding alcohol for a reason, it really is. How you die from alcohol depends on how much you had, and if you mixed with something else, usually. Choking on their own vomit is common. Being exceptionally drunk can suppress the gag reflex. All jokes aside, the gag reflex is there to force you to protect your own airway. If someone comes in drunk, unresponsive and doesn’t have a gag reflex, they almost always get intubated. Long term, your body will process alcohol out but there’s a lot of not fun things that can happen, like liver failure. Another one is alcohol related dementia. Slang term is “wet brain”, but those patients are almost always awful. Nothing will test your nursing compassion like a mean ass drunk. Also with alcohol, it might not be an overdose but people do really, really stupid stuff while drunk. Like jumping off roofs and aiming for the tree next to it, and missing. Or less exciting, driving and wrapping their car around a light pole. </p>
<p>Recreational drug use aside, there’s plenty of prescription (and over the counter) medications that can kill you/make you sick. Too much Tylenol can put you in liver failure, too much Advil can cause a stomach/intestinal bleed. Blood pressure medications will drop your blood pressure/heart rate to dangerous levels, blood thinners can cause spontaneous bleeding (and lengthen the amount of time it takes for your blood to clot.) </p>
<p>Wow this got really long. My point is- some things we can save you from. Some things we can’t. Read directions, drink responsibly, if it’s illegal maybe don’t do it. (Except weed, that would get it’s own post, and it’s next to impossible to smoke enough pot to kill yourself.) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the drug abused.   </p>
<p>Opiate painkillers and benzodiazepines, especially when combined with each other and/or alcohol, can induce respiratory depression: aka you stop (or significantly slow down) breathing.   Obviously if you aren't breathing you won't last very long without medical help.   </p>
<p>Many other drugs may have extremely unpleasant side effects in excess (such as psychosis when abusing stimulants), but they might not affect critical body processes enough to be immediately fatal.    </p>
<p>Another common example is acetaminophen (paracetamol).    The metabolism of acetaminophen creates a toxic intermediate that is usually eliminated quickly.  However, excess consumption of acetaminophen, and/or concurrent alcohol consumption, can overwhelm that pathway (depleting Glutathione, which both the metabolism of alcohol and acetaminophen require) , causing a build-up of the toxic intermediate which can cause liver damage/failure.  Not immediately fatal, but a painful way to die.</p>
<p>Cocaine and Tricyclic antidepressants are also known for potentially fatal overdoses, as both alter nerve signaling within the body (both inside and outside the brain), which may cause elecated body temperature, heart rate/blood pressure, and the like which may become fatal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the drug and what biochemical pathways are affected.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepine sleeping pills: people fall asleep and can't wake up, rarely leading to nervous damage when they fall asleep cutting off one and their body can't move/wake up due to the depressed/downed state it's  in. This can typically last from days to many years or be permanent, people might lose a lot or all control over the affected extremity. Regenerating such nerve damage might also take a lot of training and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Antihistamine sleeping pills: you will get a very dry mouth and most likely fall asleep because you're extremely tired, also any itching you might have had is completely gone, if you manage to stay awake you might notice that you lost proper access to memories, almost all ability for logical thought, have become extremely easy to influence/manipulate, lose yourself every few minutes dissociating, you also most likely will have absolutely life like hallucinations which are fudged memories I guess. This can be extremely dangerous, the hallucinations from these dissociatives tend to be absolutely life like and the affected person will not be able to distinguish between reality and them (However they can be easily influenced to realize that they're not actually seeing what they're seeing and that they're actually in some completely different place, just mentioning this questioningly will often snap them out of it)</p>
<p>cocaine overdose: will make people extremely agitated and social, barely capable of stringing thoughts to communication and arguing about things if aquamarine or ultramarine blue is of greater historic significance of art, there is a rare chance to die from heart and blood pressure related issues.</p>
<p>heroine and opiate painkillers: it seriously reduces the activity of certain  muscle groups, especially those around your digestive system and your lungs, so an overdose might lead to (if you survive) literal shitting of brick like material devoid of most fluid and dying from your lungs not capable of breathing on their own, at higher doses people have to breathe consciously or die, if they fall unconscious they will die.</p>
<p>alcohol and GABAerg things like 'liquid XTC'/GHB/GBL
will put you in a delirious state and especially liquid XTC has an extremely high chance to make you puke while you lost your consciousness, if you are laying wrong you will die from asphyxiation. Beside that just massive hammering headaches from your brain having lost extreme amounts of water and in rare cases your liver could give up and you die due to that, but it's less likely and more a long time issue for only very few people.</p>
<p>anaphlogistic painkillers ibuprofen, paracetamol: liver damage and intestinal bleeding</p>
<p>THC without (or little) CBD: extreme blood sugar drop, often leading to base anxiety and panic, coupled with rather high psychedelic action, people might lay around having vivid out of body like experiences, puking a lot and or having extreme anxiety and panic attacks and problems coping with the strongly psychedelic action on perception (especially audio and touch, but not limited to)</p>
<p>THC with lots CBD: Extremely flattened, with little tolerance most likely extreme hunger from the extreme blood sugar drop, lack of energy, feeling wasted, uncomfortable body feeling.
Puking might happen as with the above but chances are people just fall asleep afterwards instead of having 'visions' and 'dreams'.</p>
<p>Amphetamines: Days awake, incapable of stringing thoughts to communication, lack of hunger and at some point fatigue from that, extreme excitability and neurotic behaviorisms, often paranoia and possible kidney damage.
MDA derivative amphetamines (MDMA being XTC): pretty much as above but with strong emotional volatility and a considerably increased chance to get epileptic attacks or similar (compared to other amphetamines)
2cb derivative amphetamines (mescalin is structurally similar to 2cb and hallucinogenic phenthylamines): similar to description under amphetamines just with strong psychedelic effects that when overdosed can either put you into heaven or hell, especially with all the side effects your body is subject to.</p>
<p>So if they are fatal and how fatal they are depends a lot on site of activity, biochemical pathways affected (think of them as information highways and transistors, like in the computer or any other analogue information theory, it's also the reason why hallucinogenic drugs cause certain artifacts well known in analogue videography) in the end it all depends on what kind of cascades of information is 'put lose' pharmaceutical technicians will often know the effects of drugs and medicine they design before they even invent it, because a lot of those pathways are very well known.</p>
<p>If you are interested this is
<a href="http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1" target="_blank">http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1</a>
this is one of the maps created by Roche Pharma, I have it hanging in my appartment and value it as a piece of psychedelic Art.</p>
<p>If you're interested in any other drug and their possible overdose effects (simple version as well as extended) just ask about it, chances are my interest went over them at some point in my life.</p>
<p>Many drugs become considerably more powerful when used in conjunction and can extremely increase certain side effects, this is less based in both drugs exciting those pathways (because basically if one substance has a higher affinity it will mediate most of the information sent) but many of the drugs are reduced over certain enzymes and functions in our body, Cytochrome p450 is the most (in)famous when it comes to cross reactions, the metabolism only works at a certain speed and if it is inhibited by working on substance A there will be less 'metabolism' be done on substance B leading to a far higher blood plasma level of either drug, making an overdose far more likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Video games (for examples) don't do that. They simulate the world frame per frame. The world doesn't exists in between frames, there is no real movement: objects are basically teleported during the simulation.</p>
<p>This means that when the game renders a frame it can only display the world as it is at this exact point in time, all information about movement is lost, it thus need to display at a higher framerate to appear as smooth as a real camera.</p>
<p>Motion blur tries to circumvent this (by computing the difference between the current and last state). While it helps a bit, it is an approximation (like anything else in real-time CG) and isn't as good as true, physically correct, motion blur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The REAL answer has nothing to do with motion blur. It is that human beings are very sensitive to latency: the delay between an action and the result of the action.</p>
<p>If you put a mouse cursor in a 24 frames/second movie and moved the mouse, you would suddenly find the low refresh rate almost unusable. Movies at 24 fps and TV at 30fps work because there is no feedback that could be used to detect latency. </p>
<p>Stated another way: Humans are terrible at absolute time sense but awesome at relative time sense. Without any time basis to compare, 24fps is adequate to make the illusion of smooth motion. As soon at there is a time basis for comparison like pressing button or moving a mouse, the illusion is spoiled at 24fps. In human trials, most humans do not notice latencies less than 1/60th of a second but do notice 1/50th of a second. This is why 60fps is considered the optimal/minimal frame rate.</p>
<p>Further note: If you game using an LCD monitor/TV and brag that your game achieves hundreds of FPS on high graphics settings, all you are doing is bragging about wasting electricity. Most (almost all) LCDs are configured in hardware so that pixels physically cannot change color more than 60 times per second. If your game is producing 120fps, half of all the frames are being discarded. You never see them.</p>
<p>If your game is running at 45 fps, it is an averaged value meaning half the frames took 1/30th second and the other half took 1/60th of a second. Variable frame rates are often considered worse that slow frame rates.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that your display updates 60 times per second, if your game doesn't finish a frame within 1/60th of a second, you must wait until the next 1/60th boundary to see the new frame. This means your true fps drops from 60 to 30. There is no frame rate in between unless the frame rates are averaged. If you don't get 30fps, you drop to 20fps, then 15, then 12, the 10, then 6, then 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</p>

<p>I think we are ok with it for the same reason we are ok with watching Black and White movies or with watching cartoons- your mind accepts these visual &quot;discrepancies&quot; as if they belong to the story world. </p>
<p>I think this is the main reason you haven't seen the filmmaking industry upgrade to higher frame rates as the gaming industry did. The look of 24fps has become so associated with what people think of as a &quot;movie&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that film projectors can easily vary their frame rate to whatever is being played. 24, 30, 48 and 60fps where each is required. AFAIK, TVs and Monitors are either NTSC or PAL dependent on location, and mine at least don't change between 25hz multiples and 30hz</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually do not like watching movies in the cinemas these days because I notice the low framerate a lot and the stuttering is ruining the experience for me. 3D makes it even worse.</p>
<p>I really LOVED the Hobbit movies that were shown in 48 fps, and I do not understand why they do not increase the framerate even beyond that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I watched VGHS (Video Game High School) in 4K 60fps and this is the best movie/series experience I ever had. If you haven't watched it yet go and see for yourself just how smooth of a movie experience that is!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
