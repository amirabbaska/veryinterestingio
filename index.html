		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some is naturally released into the environment from various sources like runoff, volcanoes, etc. So there is an amount that would be found in fish always. From my understanding natural mercury accounts for about half of current mercury released into the environment. So from preindustrial times we have doubled the amount going into the environment every year. Could be completely wrong but that's my understanding. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concentrations found in the current era are largely due to industrial pollution. Burning coal, without adequate scrubbers and controls, releases large quantities of heavy metals into the atmosphere, which in turn falls on the ocean, and works its way up the food chain.</p>
<p>The other issue is that most of the fish that we eat are the predators of the sea (Tuna, Salmon, etc...) so the metals that were initially consumed/absorbed by the plankton work their way up the food chain and concentrate in the local alpha predator.</p>
<p>However, even without the industrial pollution, it's likely that there would be detectable levels of heavy metals in these predator fish. Mostly for two reasons, the first is that the detection equipment is extremely sensitive, so it can detect things well below dangerous levels.</p>
<p>Secondly, it isn't uncommon to find heavy metals and other toxic materials, leaching into the water system naturally. I have been peripherally involved in a mine site remediation project, and one of the interesting side-notes of the project is what was in the river water upstream of the mine vs down stream. For example, there are detectable amounts of Arsenic in the water, but the levels are the same up and downstream. Somewhere, in the valley, there is an orebody exposed to a creek that contains Arsenic. It makes sense, as the valley is likely heavily mineralized to begin with, otherwise there wouldn't have been the orebody that was mined out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>I assume that the reader is familiar with the idea of extrasensory perception, and the meaning of the four items of it, viz., telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and psychokinesis. These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual scientific ideas. How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very difficult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these new facts in.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to /u/gammbus's comment:</p>
<p>Rhine's work on ESP was very high profile at the time, at a respected university (Duke), and was supposedly done by careful scientific method with good statistical analysis -- the methodology was in fact deeply flawed in many ways, but that wasn't obvious at the time.</p>
<p>(After years of thorough critique, much more careful later experiments and analysis were unable to statistically replicate Rhine's positive results.)</p>
<p>Because of this, a lot of scientifically-minded people at the time were at least open minded about Rhine's work, who otherwise would have dismissed the subject out of hand.</p>
<p>A minor example of this is in Robert Heinlein's works; he mostly did very hard science fiction (adhering carefully to known science and engineering), but some of his stories take Rhine's work at face value -- that's not an indication of Heinlein's beliefs, just an example of Rhine being part of the zeitgeist of the time.</p>
<p>Anyway considering how high profile Rhine was back then, I agree that it is extremely likely that this is what Turing had in mind.</p>
<p>And the above context perhaps explains why someone like Turing would be influenced by &quot;obvious pseudo-science&quot;.</p>

<p>Using the standards applied to any other area of science, it is concluded that psychic functioning has been well established.
The statistical results of the studies examined are far beyond what is expected by chance.  Arguments that these results could be due to methodological flaws in the experiments are soundly refuted.  Effects of similar magnitude to those found in government-sponsored research at SRI and SAIC have been replicated at a number of laboratories across the world.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The President is the head of the Executive branch of the US government and is in charge of executing the laws through enforcement (the police are an example of the executive branch acting to enforce laws on the state level, the national guard being sent into an area to enforce laws such as the desegregation in Little Rock at the national level). One way the President can enforce/execute the laws is through an executive order. However, because the President is only in charge of executing the laws and not making the the laws (which is left up to Congress), the President needs an actual law (let's call it a &quot;base law&quot;) to attach an executive order to. The President cannot (or should not) just make things up and sign executive orders that mandate things Congress has not contemplated. </p>
<p>In the scenario of the Muslim Ban, President Trump's executive order probably falls under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which is the immigration policy of the US. Section 212 of the INA deals with &quot;Inadmissible Aliens.&quot; That chapter basically lists the situations in which an immigrant will be considered &quot;inadmissible,&quot;- not allowed entrance into the country. </p>
<p>So, it is not completely true that the other two branches of government do not approve of the President's executive orders. The base law must still be passed by Congress, following all of the bicameral steps to become an actual law. The Judicial branch sort of stays out of everything until it is called upon through a lawsuit. In fact, it is a practice of the Supreme Court not to even entertain questions of Constitutionality before a law is passed or has been challenged in a lower court. Neither Congress nor the President can ask the Supreme Court whether a law (and probably an executive order by extension) is constitutional before it has been challenged. In other words, the Supreme Court does not approve or disapprove of laws until it is asked to do so. </p>
<p>In addition, as other posters have pointed out, Trump's order was done under the color of national security. In general, when a law or order has been passed through the proper steps, the Supreme Court will usually defer to the other two branches. For example, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order mandating the detainment of Japanese citizens on the west coast during WWII. When this order was challenged in Court (See &quot;Korematsu&quot;), the Court held that the interment was not a violation of the Constitution because national security is regarded as a higher priority. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It falls under the purview of the President, as it is considered a case of immediate national security.  The precedent was set by John Adams in 1798 as a result of our relations with France.  The Alien &amp; Sedition act gave the president the right to imprison, deport, or refuse immigrants from a nation considered hostile to the US. </p>
<p>First, it is not a &quot;Muslim ban.&quot;  No one is barred entry due to their religious beliefs.  It is a temporary suspension of immigration from countries with a high rate of radicalization into ISIS, which has used the immigration process in the past to get onto US soil.  Immigration from these countries is only expected to last as long as it takes to come up with a thorough and effective vetting process, to determine no ill intent or ISIS affiliation of the person entering the US. </p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this is not the first time the President has suspended immigration from certain countries due to high risk of people immigrating from those countries.  </p>
<p>In 1882, President Chester Arthur suspended immigration from China, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1889 as constitutional.  Justice Stephen Johnson Field wrote, &quot;The power of the government to exclude foreigners from the country whenever, in its judgment, the public interests require such exclusion, has been asserted in repeated instances, and never denied by the executive or legislative departments.&quot;</p>
<p>The immigration act of 1917 was passed by congress which barred immigration from Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>And in response to Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt suspended immigration from Japan, Germany, and Italy with Presidential Proclamations 2525, 2526, and 2527. </p>
<p>This current temporary suspension is due to the same sort of risks FDR was responding to.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The President as head of the executive branch has always had the task of implementing laws passed by Congress. There is never enough detail in a law to put it into practice. The President issues and executive order with sufficient detail that a government department can implement the law. Exactly how much detail is done at what level is negotiable and variable.</p>
<p>President Bush began issuing broader executive orders. The practice continued under more Presidents. conservatives grumbled that Obama was issuing executive orders violating the Constitution. But these orders were carefully researched. None were successfully challenged in a court of law.</p>
<p>As President Trump has shown, executive orders can be issued immediately. The other two branches of government operate much more slowly. Congress can pass more specific laws. Lawsuits can be filed challenging the executive orders. This seems much more likely because Trump's executive orders do not seem to be well researched or even well thought out.</p>
<p>Bur lawsuits take time to file and appeals take a long time to move through the system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm from the southern US and now live up north. I learned to cover my southern accent intentionally as a kid to sound less stupid (yes, that stereotype also exists in the South). Now, after living in the northeast for almost 7 years, I don't have to cover it intentionally anymore.</p>
<p>My husband, also from the South, has undergone the same transformation. We both still had accents when talking just to each other for a few years, but now we sound more SAE (Standard American English) even when we're alone. My brother says I sound Canadian when we talk on the phone (we live in Maine, so...).</p>
<p>The worst part is that when we lived in the South, we would do a really intense southern accent when telling stories about someone stupid we had encountered. Since that stereotype doesn't work as well in New England, we have lost a funny part of our conversations. Or at least until we get good enough at the Maine accent to switch to that one...</p>
<p>Edit: Also, I should add that if you learn a new dialect/language after what's called the &quot;critical period&quot; for language acquisition, you'll always revert back to your original language/dialect when drunk or tired or whatever. That's the same reason why if you learn another language after age 14 or so, you'll never master the accent and will always sound &quot;foreign&quot; (with few exceptions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So when you open your eyes in the water, the light gets bent in a way your eyes haven't adapted to deal with and still focus.
I think I read that pearl divers have adapted to be able to focus under water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, that third of your life is spent sleeping, which you would very quickly die without. I'd say that means lying down is <em>definitely</em> healthier than <em>not</em> doing it.</p>
<p>As for sitting down, it's unhealthy because it's not a natural position to be in for extended periods. We're supposed to be moving around a lot. You know how blood circulates around your body? Well, your heart is great at pushing it <em>down</em>, but not pulling it back <em>up</em>. Walking helps your blood circulate - we've evolved so that the muscles we use for walking help push the blood back up our bodies. </p>
<p>When you're lying down, gravity isn't that big of a problem. </p>
<p>That's just <em>one</em> reason. We're also not supposed to have a sedentary lifestyle. We're supposed to get a decent amount of sleep (as discussed earlier, lack of it <em>will</em> be detrimental to the point of lethality) but other than that we're built to be active and we've not evolved out of that. So sitting around all day means we're conserving way too much energy that our body doesn't have anything to do with, so it stores it was fat, which makes our body <em>less</em> efficient and means we need even <em>more</em> exercise. </p>
<p>Again - we've evolved to sleep for ~8 hours, and then be active most of the rest. Not doing either of those is not healthy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what was added by others sitting is bad for the muscles in your hips. Your hip flexors get shortened and tigtened because your body now thinks that sitting is your natural position and will actuslly begin to remove sarcomeres from the muscle fibers. Your hip extenders (ie. Glutes)  become stretched out and lengthened as well causing them to become weaker. Now you have created a muscle imbalance in some of the primary muscles involved in your gait cycle. </p>
<p>The forces on the vertrbral discs in your spine also change as you lay stand and sit. Laying down puts no pressure on your spine, standing puts 100% more pressure on the spine , sitting increases this force to 150%. Sitting down and bending over is even worse clocking in at 200% of the normal force on your spine. </p>
<p>There are also some numbers dealing with calories burnt while sleeping standing and sitting , i couldnt tell you the exact numbers off the top of my head but sitting burns the least per hour. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood houses are built using wood skeletal frames,  the &quot;bones&quot; of these houses are studs.  They provide sufficient structural support to keep the building standing and intact for decades, even centuries. You dont need to build housed out of solid wood, as it would just be unnecessarily expensive.</p>
<p>Drywall replaced <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lath_and_plaster" target="_blank">lath and plaster</a>. lath are thin wood planks that would be nailed to the studs in ceilings and interior walls.   They don't provide structural support, they just create a flat surface between the studs, which would then be plastered.   This was a multistep process that took several days to complete a room.  Drywall, on the other hand, prefabricates the walls, ready to install.  Just nail the sheet to the wall and you're basically done.  Experienced drywallers can do i ln a day what lath and plaster-ers could do in a week, while offering a comparable result. This dramatically cut down construction time, required less labor, and thus saved money, so it was widely adopted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drywall engineer here! (yes we exist) </p>
<p>Many of the answers in the thread are correct, but one of the big reasons everyone is missing is the fire rating of drywall. Drywall is made of gypsum, a hydrated form of calcium sulfate. When the gypsum is exposed to heat, the crystalline water begins to calcine off. This reaction consumes a TON of energy, and prevents fire from spreading across the sheet for considerable time. You can aim a flamethrower at one side of a typical 1/2&quot; sheet of drywall, and the opposite side of the sheet won't rise above 220F for about 30 mins. Hopefully the fire department has arrived by then. </p>
<p>Feel free to ask more questions, I find pleasure in explaining this kind of stuff!</p>
<p>Edit-to kill some misconceptions, I work in capital projects engineering for a drywall manufacturer. &quot;Drywall engineer&quot; doesn't exist, and would be way too general of a field!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buildings began as solid wall construction using logs or stone to as the structure, and a bonding agent to fill the gaps and add structure.  But solid walls require a lot of heavy material and they don't insulate temperature or sound well, and it takes a tremendous effort.  Also, every house was constructed individually so logs were hand shaped on site, and stone was assembled based on the available materials.  </p>
<p>When the hollow wall came into practice, precut (milled) lumber could be used as the 'bones' of a home dramatically reducing the work time,  weight, and variations due to materials.  With just the bones in place, the walls needed to be covered. </p>
<p>For a long time, small, rough thin boards were used (lathe) to cover the walls, then a layer of plaster was applied to make it smooth, attractive, and air tight.  But cutting/buying thousands of boards, nailing them up, and artfully spreading plaster is time (and money) consuming.</p>
<p>Using large, premade sheets to cover the walls would make installation easier and cheaper.  When drywall offered all of these benefits, it became to predominant material.  However, other materials have come &amp; gone with trends.... real wood (knotty pine is in my house), manufactured (fake) wood paneling, etc.</p>
<p>Thoguh I didn't mention it above, the advent of electricity, indoor plumbing, and insulation all contributed to the development of these materials &amp; styles.  Likewise the scale that was needed to serve the growing population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone seems to be ignoring your other questions.</p>
<p>Walls have a surprising amount of stuff in them. Ductwork, wiring, plumbing, and insulation.  If you made walls thinner it can be difficult to run all of this stuff. Also if you used less wood inside the wall it would be more flexible and wobbly.  Some walls are actually framed thicker to accommodate for larger pipes. The wall behind a toilet is typically framed with 2x6s rather than 2x4s because the main plumbing stack is very large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting that we in the Nordic countries have pretty much the same tradition of building single family homes as in the US (and Canada?), but our friends farther down in Europe (Denmark and south) prefer stone.</p>
<p>I guess it is mostly relying on tradition, sparsely populated countries with lots of forest had easy access to, and the tradition of using,  lumber. Also, it wood might be better suited when the winters are long and cold.</p>
<p>Out homes evolved from log houses  with external wood panel and interior clay/paint to studded frame(?) with interior cladding with either lath+drywall or OSB+drywall or drywall+drywall. Single drywall sucks. Outer wall have room for 30cm insulation (one feet for the metrically challenged). To remove problems with condensation in the wall, a plastic foil is needed behind the drywall on the inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are likely structural differences in the brain which may account for &quot;high IQ&quot;. For example, it was found that individuals like Einstein have larger than average areas of the brain in charge of imaginative abilities. Likely enhancing Einstein's ability to imagine/stimulate complex phenomena. He famously gained insights into light/physics/energy from literally imagining himself traveling along on a beam of light. </p>
<p>We know that different areas of the brain perform various functions so it's likely that a predisposition to stronger connections or activity and likely size of the specific region may influence abilities</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are asking a question to an answer we dont fully understand yet. If you worked out on some level every day versus the same version of you sitting and reading reddit all day were to get an IQ test, you might score the same for different reasons. Due to other factors you might score different. There are a lot of variables to your question. Your age/experience would definitely be a factor, what if you were born in a cave but aced at cave-paintings? I would love for someone who is more qualified than me to chime in.</p>
<p>I will bet money that a current version of you will do better than you if you were to do things that helped brain development and neuroplasticity. Whether is was taking vitamins, working out, taking drugs or just connecting your brain to the internet in the next ~50 years. I wonder if an individual who has an IQ of 120 can get 180 just because he designs the IQ tests.</p>
<p>There are DEFINITELY physical differences in the brain, whether its nature or nurture. Neural pathways are always changing so yesterdays &quot;you&quot; is different from today's &quot;you&quot;. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a medium strength correlation between IQ and reaction time. <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/18569" target="_blank">This stackexchange answer</a> gives a nice overview. So <em>if</em> reaction time is determined mostly by bulk properties of neurons, or something similarly &quot;physical&quot; (as opposed to, I don't know, conscious decisions or something), then yes, that's a difference.</p>
<p>Regarding genetic contribution, Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ" target="_blank">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The general figure for the heritability of IQ, according to an authoritative American Psychological Association report, is 0.45 for children, and rises to around 0.75 for late teens and adults.[5][6] The heritability of IQ increases with age and reaches an asymptote at 18–20 years of age and continues at that level well into adulthood.[7] Recent studies suggest that family and parenting characteristics are not significant contributors to variation in IQ scores;[8] however, poor prenatal environment, malnutrition and disease can have deleterious effects.[9][10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But make sure you understand what &quot;heritability&quot; means, it's pretty complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The whole idea of IQ is pretty outdated at this point. I'm sure you've heard the 'blaming fish for not being able to climb trees' quote at some point, and that is a pretty decent take on the situation. There are many, many different measures of 'intelligence,' and it is nearing impossible to look at changes in the brain as causation rather than correlation.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of IQ research comes from a time when people believed the brain didn't change or adapt, and now neuroplasticity is well-studied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As it has already been said we don't know a lot about why this is. However, in the mid 1980's after a scientist studied Einstein's brain. What he found was different than what was expected. Instead of Einstein having more neurons or synapses than the average brain, he had nearly twice as many glial cells. What is known about glial cells is that they provide support and nourishment for neurons, and they play an important role in synapse formation. While the meaning of this difference is still unclear it seems that Einstein's brain had much more neural support than many others, which could have assisted in his higher learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
