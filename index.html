		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for lack of technical terms here, but this is what I know from working in AR/VR space where we had to take into account the science of the eye for calibration and ergonomics.</p>
<p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;hurt&quot;.  When you look around, two aspects of your eye are moving: the muscles that control direction, and the muscles that control focus.  The focus muscles are mostly indirect control, but you can learn you control them directly.  When your eyes are looking straight ahead (perfectly parallel) then your eyes believe you want to focus on infinity, so they move the lens to try to focus on infinity.  When you look at something 1 meter away, your directional muscles pull the eyes inward, and the focus muscles move the lens to focus on 1 meter away.  When you cross your eyes, your directional muscles pull your eyes all the way inward, and your focus muscles TRY to focus on 0 meters away, which they cannot do.  Those focus muscles are straining, and that is where the pain comes from.  When you look far to the left or right, your focus muscles are not straining, because you are probably looking at some object a few meters away.  You can feel the same strain if you look far to the left or right AND at an object right next to your face.</p>
<p>Also, you can learn to control the focus / directional muscles independently. Those &quot;magic eye&quot; images require it. Your directional muscles look &quot;through&quot; the page, but then your focus muscles must focus on the distance of the page.  Since these two muscles are conflicting, it can cause eye strain over time.</p>
<p>This is also another reason why AR/VR displays can cause strain / headaches.  Those AR/VR worlds display objects at different distances, but with the same focus (there is only one focal length of the lenses in the displays).  Manufacturers will set the focal distance to around 2 meters, since that seems to work well enough for most situations without causing much pain.  So when you look at a VR object that is only perceived to be 0.5 meters away, your directional muscles are looking at 0.5 meters, but your focus muscles are looking at 2 meters, causing strain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two systems exist for moving eyes. Conjugate movements are saccades and pursuits, fast and delicate. Convergence movements are slower and multipurpose, because the brainstem center that stimulates convergence also stimulates accommodation, focusing effort. This coordination of effort keeps the image single and focused at the same time. </p>
<p>Humans use convergence effort to help focus the eyes, so convergence developed to the degree you could stretch the tendons to a level of pain.</p>
<p>There was never a need to develop &quot;excess&quot; saccade ability, because extra-strength saccades would overshoot, for example.</p>
<p>So &quot;eyestrain&quot; usually results from an imbalance in the amount of effort needed to focus the eyes and converge them to the same distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye convergence (crossing your eye) is directly related to eye focus. When you focus you change the shape of the lens in your eye to clear things up close. That takes effort which is why we get eye strain when a lot of computer or phone use. </p>
<p>When you cross your eyes you are pulling the converging muscles and focusing at the same time. Without something to focus we tend to over do it and it can get very uncomfortable. But if you take a finger and slowly bring it towards your nose, crossing your eyes tend to be a little bit easier (up until you get too close).</p>
<p>Last thing: it gets more difficult as we age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are- rhabdomyosarcoma, for example. </p>
<p>It's comparatively rare though because there isn't much turnover of cells in the muscle, and they don't get much exposure to carcinogens. Any lining of the body has a high rate of cell division, and that's where errors creep in. </p>
<p>Imagine photocopying the instructions for baking a cake every time you baked one, but instead of using a master copy you used the previous photocopy. And there's a little gremlin who can come in and change a number or a letter at random, and you don't know what the gremlin has been doing. </p>
<p>The first cake is fine. And so is the 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc. Until eventually you can't quite tell if it's 5 or 6 ounces of sugar. Or what that squiggle means that you're supposed to add a teaspoon of. This is what happens with cancer. The photocopying is cell division, and the gremlin is the action of carcinogens on the DNA of the cell. Most of these errors get caught, either by the error checking in the cell division mechanism, by the immune system which kills off cancer cells, or by the cell simply ceasing to function properly and dying. </p>
<p>Muscle cells don't duplicate very often, unlike your skin or the lining of your bowel. Your lungs, skin, bowels etc are all basically linings, and so have loads of cell divisions going on all the time. Rhabdomyosarcoma is commonly a disease of childhood, as this is when muscles are growing and the cells are dividing. When someone trains a lot in the gym, they don't actually get new cells in their muscles, it's that the existing cells develop more muscle fibres within them, so the individual cells get bigger.  </p>
<p>Basically, the muscle cells are like a cake recipe that you bake once a year. Skin, bowel, etc etc are cakes that you bake every day. Lungs are cakes with a particularly disruptive gremlin, if you're a smoker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The popular answer is the evolutionary one--that emotions have helped us survive. When we lived in the wild--with monkeys and mastodons and tigers--we needed emotions in order to react quickly to dangerous stimuli. If faced with a tiger, it's better to be rocked with a fear so strong it triggers a rush of blood than to sit around and theorize about the threat. We developed an emotional system because it could induce quick responses to danger.</p>
<p>Other emotions work the same. Humans are rather clever animals. We've managed to teach ourselves how to express ideas through written words, as well as emotions through art and music. Think about that for a minute. Through our art and music, the emotion felt by an artist may be encoded through color, shadow and harmony to be decoded and experienced by an observer or listener. That is arguably one of humanity's greatest accomplishments. </p>
<p>And yet, despite the apparent ease with which artists or musicians can create a work that unlocks emotions in the audience, <strong>we have no idea how it does such an amazing thing. We do know that emotions may be expressed in art -- and that humans can readily recognize them.</strong></p>
<p>As with music -  Jordan Peterson explained this pretty well in one of his lectures.</p>
<p>We want meaning in our lives. Life is a balance between order and chaos and we don't take too well to chaos but it can be overcome and made into order, making us feel accomplished and life meaningful. Music mimics this process. It's highly ordered and miraculous. He claims even the most nihilistic of us like music because of this reason. It generates meaning. People on psychedelics often say they really understand and can see the structure of music way differently than the normal waking state. Haven't done them though so can't comment.</p>
<p>More details :</p>
<p>Music is processed by the auditory system in the brain, just like verbal information (speaking). The auditory system is connected to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotion processing. Music can, just like verbal information, activate the entire limbic system and thus stimulate an emotional response if it's suitable for the situation (context processing is also important in stimulating an emotional response).</p>
<p>The same goes to other sensory perceptions - vision can also stimulate an emotional response, for example art paintings. Smell is unique in the sense (pun unintended) that smell information travels directly to its cortex in the brain, unlike the other sensory information that first passes through a relay station (the thalamus), and is tightly connected to the hippocampus (responsible for memory formation, context and emotion processing). Smell can thus trigger very profound memory recall to specific situations</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read an interesting dissertation a while back about this effect in music.  The idea was that music impacts us on a lot of different levels at once.  On the physical level, studies have shown that your heartbeat responds to the beat of music, which in turn influences your mood/excitation.  On the social level, we are taught from a very young age to interpret certain sounds certain ways.  For example, many Americans interpret music in minor keys as &quot;sad.&quot;  There is also the associations that our brain makes - we hear a particular tinkling run of notes, and that tinkling sound is associated by our brain with water falling.  Then you add in personal experiences, and the result is synaesthetic (which means experiencing one sense triggers memories of others).</p>
<p>So I hear a song with a slow beat (slows my heart, relaxes me), in a major key (socialization = happy!), where the melody reminds me of moving water (like the waves at the beach), and my brain takes all that together and connects me to a wonderful memory of building a sandcastle with my niece at the beach.</p>
<p>I can't speak to other forms of art/literature, but I suspect there's similar results.  The dissertation was &quot;Indra's Note:  An Investigation into Musical Awareness&quot; by Randall Pabich</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well remember that all art, music, and literature, is made by <em>people</em>. People who wanted to <em>express</em> something through one of these mediums. Express something like a feeling, or thought, or idea, something that they could not convey in simple words, as they were confronted with a strange gap between the limited range of everyday communication, and the seemingly intangible nature of the thing inside of them, waiting to be shared.</p>
<p>So they try to bridge this gap. They try to create paths, links, associations, from the '<em>thing</em>', the little bit of reality within, to something created outside, which mirrors that feeling inside. The artist, hoping to be able to re-create the feeling - or something analogous to the audience - tries to keep in mind that this path can't be too unique to him or her. It needs to be a path that could take many to a similar place within them, even if they're all different people.</p>
<p>Artists create art because they are moved. What makes them great artists, is not conveying just what they moved, but recreating the way that they became moved at all, through the basis of our mind which is the senses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the comments here are from a scientific perspective. I'd like to add a philosophical perspective to the conversation. </p>
<p>Extraordinary art (in general) resonates with us when it points to some deep truth about the nature of our reality as humans. Whether that is the truth of suffering or our hope for the alleviation of that suffering, art reminds us of what it means to be human by tapping into that which we all desire, fear, love, or hate. Goya's <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Goya_Dog.jpg" target="_blank">Dog</a>, for example, immediately conveys a sense of isolation and fear that we have all experienced. Sometimes we are not as connected with that part of our inner life, so seeing the image punctures the dam we've built up, and the emotions pour out. </p>
<p>Or see this explanation of <a href="http://www.classicfm.com/composers/mahler/guides/symphony-no-2-genius/" target="_blank">Mahler's 2nd Symphony</a>. If you pay attention to the symphony, it's almost impossible not to be moved, since we all fear death. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbonation is bubbles. Bubbles pop. That's why carbonated drinks feel tingly in your mouth. Have you ever blown bubbles outside, and had one pop close to you? Sometimes you get sprayed with the soapy water as the bubble pops. The same thing happens in your mouth. When the bubbles pop, the drink can spray the inside of your mouth.</p>
<p>So what happens when you eat spicy food? Well, spicy food has a chemical in it called capsaicin. It touches your taste buds and makes them feel hot. When you drink a carbonated drink and you have capsaicin in your mouth, the bubbles pop, and they spread that capsaicin around to more taste buds. Instead of cooling your mouth down, it makes it spicier! </p>
<p>Maybe that's what you are feeling. Not everyone feels the same thing. Some people don't mind the spicy flavor spreading. I like to drink beer with spicy food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be technical neither pepper spicyness nor carbonation are tastes.</p>
<p>As others have mentioned the the capsaicin in peppers are what causes the spicyness. This is actually the capsaicin agrivating and activating the pain/nerve receptors on your tounge. </p>
<p>The carbonation in sodas are not a taste either as others again have mentioned this sensation is caused by the popping of the bubbles on your tounge.</p>
<p>Most liquids tend to spread the capsaicin around your mouth and throat. (Milk being one of the exceptions.) A carbonated beverage would do the same while the bubbles pop in your mouth and throat.</p>
<p>Some people might find these sensations to be less pleasurable together. I personally am not bothered by drinking a carbonated beverage with spicy food. </p>
<p>Basically to some extent it is just your personal preference. </p>
<p>Although I would be interested to know whether and how much these sensations actually effect the fruity taste of the peppers and the sugary taste of the soda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bioluminescence is produced by chemical reactions involving molecules called luciferins.  These chemicals are able to produce light very efficiently without a lot of waste heat.</p>
<p>As for making them, well, we can.  The reason we don't use chemicals for lighting is because, while efficient, they aren't very <em>bright</em>.  Try lighting a room with a bucketful of fireflies and see how much illumination they'll give you.  Enough to <em>see</em>, but probably not enough to read by.</p>
<p>Another issue is that bioluminescence requires a constant feed of new chemicals to power it.  You need something producing new luciferins, as well as oxygen to make it glow.  Like a fire, oxygen will be consumed in the reaction and must be replenished, so you can't keep it isolated in a tube.  Less convenient than electric lamps.</p>
<p>But for situations that don't require much light, scientists are already looking into it - <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/lamp-whose-light-comes-bioluminescent-bacteria/" target="_blank">check out this bacteria-powered lamp</a>!  It has it faults - it isn't very bright, the bacteria need to be fed, and it needs to be in motion to keep the oxygen flowing.  But still cool stuff.</p>
<p>It also turns out that luminescent genes are one of the easier things to splice into...basically anything.  Scientists have made glowing plants, fruit flies, shrimp, mice, rabbits, and even cats.  I've heard of plans to use genetically engineered glowing trees instead of street lamps in some cities, so that's something to look forward to.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, most of these genetically engineered organisms are florescent, not luminescent - they don't actually produce their own light, they just glow in the dark.  But there are some experimental <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/we-may-one-day-be-reading-light-houseplant/" target="_blank">bioluminescent plants</a>, although it seems they have shorter lifespans because they use up a lot of their energy to produce light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of this has to do with time, and some are about unexamined assumptions, but there's a third component. </p>
<p>First, time.  When we discovered vaccines, the world was a very different place. It was not unusual for most children to die from disease. Whole generations might be decimated by disease. This happened only 100 years ago, I'm not talking about the Middle Ages. </p>
<p>So when we invented vaccination, it saved a whole generation. It was treated as a miracle drug. For the generations who grew up with disease, the prospect of raising the next generation without it was...its impossible to overstate how <em>important</em> it was to the folks who grew up with disease to make sure their children were vaccinated.</p>
<p>But those people weren't <em>smarter</em> than us. They (by and large) did not <em>understand</em> how vaccines work. They just believed the doctors, and they could see the results. But it's not like these people were somehow smarter or wiser than us. </p>
<p>The next couple of generations were still able to talk to the parents, and then eventually grandparents who grew up without vaccines. So there was this generational knowledge that vaccines were hugely important. Again, these later generations did not <em>understand</em> herd immunity, or how vaccines work, but the world before vaccines was still part of living memory.  So they listen to their parents, and grandparents, and vaccinate their kids.</p>
<p>But now there's almost no one left from that last generation that grew up without vaccines. So now we have still widespread ignorance about how vaccines work, that's not new, but we also have no one left alive who paid the price of living without vaccines. No grandparents who can just say, &quot;shut up and vaccinate your kids.&quot;</p>
<p>So to this new generation, the whole idea of vaccination is essentially no different from superstition. And there's a deep distrust running through America towards doctors and science but will get to that after the unexamined assumptions. </p>
<p>Second, unexamined assumptions. Most Americans living today, grew up during times of unparalleled prosperity. Especially if you have parents or grandparents who were alive in the 50s and 60s, where America was the only industrial power left in the world.  Literally every other industrial center in the world, outside America, has been bombed during World War II. So Americans were crazy rich compared to other countries. Even normal middle-class people could afford cars, gas was cheap, everything was cheap.</p>
<p>Now starting around the 1970s the oil companies started to realize that they were having a profound, negative, and therefore dangerous effects on the environment. But, doing anything about it would've been hideously expensive. So they just cover it all up. You know, none of them are going to live long enough to see the results of pouring sulfur and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So whatever. </p>
<p>Time passes and it starts to be obvious there's a problem, but the scope of it is not obvious. We have smog, so we create the EPA in the 1970s (thanks Nixon!) and actually the smog problem is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. So that's a problem solved right?</p>
<p>In the 1980s, we discover there's a hole in the ozone layer. You haven't heard about that a while? Well that's because we banned Chlorofluorocarbons and replaced them with hydrochlorofluorocarbons.  And that basically solved the problem!  We should be proud of these things, they show how the federal government is able to affect change. And many of the state governments! Los Angeles had the worst smog in America, so California enacted the most strict emissions policies. But the point is if we work together we can solve these problems.</p>
<p>However, none of these things really required people to do anything different. It's just required some corporations to spend a little more money than they normally spend.  Most of the stuff happened without most people knowing about it! It was perfectly plausible to live through the 1980s and never hear about the hole in the ozone layer, never know what a CFC is how it's different from an HCFC. </p>
<p>Toward the end of the 1980s, it started to become obvious that there was a problem with the global temperature. I remember this because I was in college in the late 1980s and I did a report on global warning. Almost 30 years ago we were talking about this. James Burke, a BBC science reporter did a whole special called After the Warming in like 1989 about what the future was going to look like if we didn't do something. So this isn't a new problem. 'Climate change' is a new term that people invented in attempt to cover up how bad the problem is. Everything getting hotter is obviously bad. But everything merely changing? Well doesn't the climate do that anyway? </p>
<p>The problem with this is, doing something about it it's going to be hugely expensive. It's gonna be expensive on the scale the likes of which no one has ever dealt with before. And it's going to force people to change their lifestyles. They're going to have much less access to things like not just Gasoline, but like plastics. All plastics come from petroleum.</p>
<p>Part of the solution to this is going to be getting people to be mindful of how they consume things. But we've now had several generations of Americans who did not have to worry about being mindful about consumption. And these people do not like the idea that the thing they've been doing for several generations, is actually bad. They've lived with this unexamined assumption: it's ok to consume as much of anything as we want, and waste as much as we want.  And they do not want to examine that assumption now, for fear it will turn out to have been wrong! </p>
<p>And, like vaccines, the climate is a big complex thing that most people do not understand. They do not understand the problem.  So they hear other people saying &quot;there's a problem with the climate, you need to change how you behave,&quot; all they hear is one group of people trying to control another group of people. And that's not a fantasy, human beings have been doing that to each other throughout all of human history. The question isn't &quot;do people do that?&quot; The question is are these climate change fanatics actually trying to control how people behave?</p>
<p>So finally, and then I think we get some good news, we have this basic problem that Americans have never liked science. Isaac Asimov wrote back in the 40s that there's a deep deep anti-intellectual streak running through America. There's a great Frank Zappa quote about how Americans fundamentally distrust anything that doesn't have obvious practical value. This includes distrusting science and art. We love technology! Technology is something you put your hand on and see how it solves problems. We love knowing how much movies make! We know that money has practical value, so that's what most of our artistic discourse is about. But very rarely do you ever hear anyone in the news talking about a painting for the sake of the painting. You only ever hear people talking about paintings, when they sell at auction for a lot of money. </p>
<p>There was a thing  in Europe called the Enlightenment, where Europeans were discovering science and it seemed as though science was gonna save the world. But some Europeans, especially a group called the Puritans in England, really did not like the enlightenment and left England to come to America where they could live a simpler, godly life.  They came to America seeking a life that was much less pluralistic. So they didn't have to share a country with, for instance, Catholics. </p>
<p>The Puritans believed the simple life was good. They believed that suffering was good! To the Puritans, disease was sent by God to punish people for wickedness! This is an archetype that we don't really have in America. We tend to view our Puritan ancestors as noble and enterprising. But that's because we are the descendants of those Puritans!  If you watch, for instance, Blackadder from the BBC, they show a much more comical and derisive view of the Puritans. This is the way the people the Puritans left behind thought of them.</p>
<p>So Americans are essentially a nation founded by rich white guys, but settled by religious nutjobs.  The Puritans were OK with technology, technology would do things like increase crop yield, and that is obviously good. They were not super comfortable with science, and as a result of Americans are still deeply distrustful of science. </p>
<p>There have been times in our history when that was less obvious than it is now! Because we confuse technology and science. They are related, but they are not the same thing. During the space race two whole generations of American kids grew up idolizing astronauts, and wanting to be engineers. Engineers, very practical.  But actual scientists? Hmmm...not sure what those guys do, exactly.</p>
<p>So I don't think it's accurate to say we are now, mysteriously, more distrustful of science. We have always been distrustful of science. </p>
<p>When it comes to climate change the good news is that Americans are still affected by what the pope says. Which is kind of amazing for country founded by Puritans, but there you are. And the pope is actually smart dude who went to college and worked as a chemist.  So  when the pope recently came out and said, climate change is real, it's going to screw almost everyone, and it's really really going to screw poor people way way worse than  rich people , Americans actually listened. The tide of opinion is changing. </p>
<p>It's one of the reasons Donald Trump was gobsmacked by the reaction he got to pulling out of the Paris accord. He actually expected a lot of people in America to be very happy with him. He thought he was doing with those people wanted. What he did not realize, is that public opinion has changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The internet.  </p>
<p>Prior to the internet, in order to spew your <del>stupid</del> unscientific ideas about the geometry of the Earth to an audience you'd need to go through a university publication, scientific journal, newspaper, magazine or go through an aggressive self publishing campaign. </p>
<p>During any one of these processes there are peers, editors, technical writers, fact checkers going over your work and saying &quot;you're an idiot, get out of my office&quot; and that's that. It used to be much more difficult to publish unsubstantiated garbage, not to say that it wasn't published. While the barriers to publishing your ideas and being heard is lower than ever, it's has some negative externalities we didn't anticipate as a society.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism" target="_blank">Yellow Journalism</a> did, of course, happen in your tabloid rags, but the public view on these were similar to the views we have of tabloids today. They're great kindling, but that's about it. Occasionally you have an older person that subscribes to the tabloids, but there was never much mainstream push behind it. </p>
<p>With the internet we have two problems...</p>
<p>Firstly, everything is 'equal'. Consider this Google search of &quot;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/EklZRAL.png" target="_blank">NASA approval rating</a>&quot;. One of these is <em>not</em> like the others. </p>
<p>Part of this is due to how advertising priorities have changed. Tabloid newspapers weren't terribly popular among the wealthy and educated, an advertisement in them didn't go very far, even if the people reading it would believe what you're selling, so advertisers stuck to more popular  mainstream news outlets. Today, those motivators don't exist on the internet. Advertisers care less about the kind of people viewing their ads and instead are more focused on raw numbers and clicks; engagement. They don't care from whom or from where, so to advertisers Breitbart and the Wall Street Journal might as well be the same. </p>
<p>Equality extends to appearances as well, tabloids have gotten much better at legitimizing themselves online and appearing more mainstream. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> has won 122 Pulitzer Prizes and is a 165 year old journalistic institution. </p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/" target="_blank">The New York Post</a> is tabloid. </p>
<p>Telling between the two is somewhat difficult if you aren't up to snuff on the history and credibility of journalistic institutions. </p>
<p>This leads quite well into the second problem. </p>
<p><em>Human beings aren't very good at evaluating objective facts.</em></p>
<p>To begin with, we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a>, like confirmation bias. </p>
<p>Someone with more objectivity and were less attached to Flat Earth theory they might google 'is the Earth flat?', while someone more invested in Flat Earth theory might google 'Flat Earth proof'. Google is <em>fantastic</em> for someone who wants to confirm things they already believe. </p>
<p>Our emotional investment into our beliefs and facts makes us resistant to things that disagree with our world view and more receptive to things that enforce our world view. This isn't a partisan thing, this is a <em>human</em> thing.  </p>
<p>So you have given creatures that are emotionally, psychologically, sometimes financially, invested in their believes a tool that allows them to find information that confirms their ideas and other people that <em>also</em> believe their ideas. </p>
<p>Being surrounded by a homogeneous group is an  <em>INCREDIBLY</em> powerful way to condition people to behave/believe along with the group. Human beings are, at their most fundamental level, social creatures that feel compelled to be liked and included in groups, and disagreeing with the group is very difficult for a social creature. This is how you can condition perfectly normal Germans to genocide millions of Jews. This is how you get a normal person to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment#Results" target="_blank">shock someone to death in the name of science</a>. </p>
<p>Well, we gave  people a tool to find and create whatever communities they like, and they behaved exactly how our psychological models expected them to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may not be that it is on the upswing, but may that they have a bigger platform. Think vaccines are satan's serum? There is a FB group for that with 1,000 other people agreeing and posting bogus crap to support your idea. Social media has now given everyone a voice and niche to belong to, so this may be more of an issue of a loud voice now versus an actual rise in incidence. Either that orrrrr I could hypothesis there is a disconnect and distrust between the scientific community and the general public. News outlets bastardizing scientific work may be a giant issue, since most average people won't take hours of their life to read and sift through the jargon of a scientific journal of actual publications, and will believe a 5 word headline explain a complex study and then 12 more deny that initial study. Example: &quot;Chocolate causes cancer&quot; and then three weeks later &quot;Chocolate, in moderation, prevents cancer&quot;. </p>
<p>Just some ideas from my experience, I am finishing up degrees in psych and biomedical microbiology and have focused a lot on ethics and the communication of science to the public and these are main points that come up a lot when it comes to denialism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One more explanation: The world changes faster than most non-subject matter expert humans can adapt to it.  One coping mechanism is to deny that the change is happening.</p>
<p>Prior to the Renaissance, every farmer farmed the way his father taught him. The world changed slowly if at all.</p>
<p>A example of the world changing too fast: most scholars concur that Copernicus completed his book on the heliocentric theory of the solar system <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium" target="_blank">On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres</a></em> around 1530.  However Copernicus waited until just before his death (1543) to publish it. Why? Because Copernicus thought it would not be accepted and he didn't want to face the resulting sh#t storm from the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Similarly, Albert Einstein never fully accepted the probabilistic nature of Quantum Mechanics.</p>
<p>&quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.&quot;

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, adrenaline and cortisol. If you haven't eaten in a long time, your body doesn't relax, it instead increases stress hormones which induce the metabolism of energy stores (ie, fat tissue, glycogen) and help mobilize you so that you can find food or fight for it. </p>
<p>Once you eat, stress hormones decrease, blood flow to the intestines and visceral organs is restored, and you feel hungry again (this is why appetizers induce appetite).   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try and answer, but it's been many years (10+) since I've done this study. </p>
<p>One of the most predominant reasons is gluconeogensis, when you do not eat for a period of time your body detects the fall in serum (bloodstream) glucose (This and your stomach being physically empty will trigger a hunger mechanism) and eventually it begins to increase the gluconeogenesis pathway.       </p>
<p>This is a process by which your body begins to increase glucagon production (Hormone that tells your body to raise glucose levels) and maintain your blood glucose level, conversely it will decrease insulin production (Most easily explained as: insulin is necessary to transport glucose for use at the cellular level and therefore decreases serum glucose levels).     </p>
<p>As you enter gluconeogenesis, your body is now breaking down predominantly proteins and fats rather than utilising the glucose as it is entering your bloodstream from the food absorbed in your (predominantly small) intestines.
Initially these proteins and fats will be from intramuscular/lipid/cellular stores and then finally, provided by directly catabolising your own body tissue and organs.<br />
Throughout this process, essential for life neurotransmitters: phosphates, magnesium and potassium continue to be utilized to maintain fluid balance, electroconduction and intracellular movements (which includes the glucose we're 'producing' and using).</p>
<p>Once a stasis level is achieved (stomach has collapsed, intestinal peristaltic motion has slowed considerably, serum glucose is stable) you no longer feel hungry as there are no rapid changes occurring, essentially your body is being supplied the necessary fuel it currently requires to keep going.
(And from a perhaps historic standpoint: There was probably no point tormenting you that you're hungry while you're trying to hunt for food).  </p>
<p>If you maintain this fasting for long enough, there is a risk of potential serious medical compromise (Cardiac Arrest, Seizure etc) predominantly due to neurotransmitter depletion and in some cases due to direct catabolism of the vital organs to provide glucose (such as the heart).   </p>
<p>There is a further risk if you enter in to this state and that's resuming eating, this is called 'refeeding syndrome'.<br />
In refeeding syndrome, where the body is already in an elevated state of glucagon production, the sudden increase in blood glucose results in a sudden increase in insulin and thus consequently your body's overall metabolism spikes which continues to include proteins and fats (Elevated Glucgaon).  With this, neuotransmitters (Potassium and Phosphate predominantly) which the bodies stores have already depleted to maintain serum levels, have a sudden intracellular shift and serum levels can decrease to fatal levels.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers, but I'd like to add another perspective. Without going into too much detail, your appetite is controlled by two opposing processes - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin" target="_blank">ghrelin</a>
(the &quot;hunger hormone&quot;) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin" target="_blank">leptin</a>
(the &quot;satiety hormone&quot;). Fluctuations in leptin/ghrelin levels may affect your appetite independently from metabolic processes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how long you're talking about fasting for, &quot;because you're in ketosis&quot; is the answer. </p>
<p>People eating the Standard American Diet are almost never burning their fat for fuel as they always have blood sugar to use (because they eat carb-based foods frequently). </p>
<p>If you don't eat for a little bit (or you avoid carbs), and your body runs out of blood glucose, your body starts converting glycogen (stored in your liver and muscles) to glucose. Once that's gone, you start converting fat to energy. </p>
<p>Hunger is a response to hormone levels (insulin and ghrelin mostly) that are largely driven by energy levels in your blood. </p>
<p>For every pound of fat on your body, you have 3500 calories of energy available to use. So nearly everyone in the western world is carrying around weeks worth of energy they can draw on when needed (once they enter ketosis). </p>
<p>As an example, a 175 lbs guy with 20% body fat, has ~35 lbs of fat on their body. That means they have 35 x 3500 calories (122,500) worth of energy. That's roughly 49 days worth assuming 2,500 calories burned a day. </p>
<p>That's why you stop getting hungry. You enter a really sustainable energy mode without the spikes and valleys associated with glucose-based energy and your hormones stop causing hunger as often or as significantly. </p>
<p>I'm not advocating month-long fasts as there are other things that have to be consumed for you to function well (electrolytes are critical, for example). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look up intermittent fasting and how it works, you will find more specific information. The general physiology is as follows. When a person abstains from eating the body uses the stored reserve called glycogen. After the glycogen in your liver is depleted (10-12 hours on average), your body switches to fat burning. When the body uses fat as fuel, hunger diminishes and brain activity increases. This is an evolutionary means of survival through famine, so the body can focus on finding the next feast.  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4UkZAwKoCP8" target="_blank">intermittent Fasting Tedx</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people seem to be saying &quot;so they can target ads&quot; or &quot;so they get lots of information about you&quot;, but that's not really the case. Let me explain a bit about how this works.</p>
<p>When you click &quot;log in with Facebook&quot;, the website sends you to a website controlled by Facebook (not them) that asks you to log in if you aren't already logged in, and then asks you to authorize their application to access certain information. If you click OK, then it sends a token to that website allowing them to access only the information that they requested access to.</p>
<p>That Facebook page will tell you what they are requesting access to. The list of things they can ask for is on <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/" target="_blank">this page</a>, but most of these websites just ask for the basics- public_profile and maybe email, so they'll get your name, profile picture, and your email, but they won't have access to your likes or your friends list or anything like that. If they do want access to that other stuff, the page will tell you. You should always read this page to make sure that random websites aren't requesting permission to spam all your friends and like pages on your behalf. </p>
<p>The advantage of this to Facebook is that you have more stuff tied to your Facebook account so you become more tied to the Facebook ecosystem. They also know what app/website you're using, but they don't know enough about what you're using the app for to target any additional ads to you.</p>
<p>For the website, there are two main benefits.</p>
<p>First of all, the sign-up flow is way easier- it's literally just two clicks if you're already signed in to Facebook. If they need a bunch of information from you, they'd otherwise need a much longer sign-up process, and a lot of people tend to give up if the sign-up process is too long. </p>
<p>Second, they get to take advantage of all of Facebook's security. Facebook has something like 17,000 employees. They have whole teams just dedicated to keeping your information safe. Joe's Forum does not have whole teams dedicated to keeping your information safe, so it's much more likely that Joe gets hacked than Facebook. That means Joe doesn't have to worry about stopping hackers from creating tons of fake accounts, and if his website does get hacked, the hackers won't get access to all of his user's personal information (since all of that is stored in Facebook).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I mention the concept of &quot;friction&quot; because there are tons of website out there competing for your attention.

<p>If they get you to create an account without using Facebook, you're still handing them you're email address, which is still useful. </p>
<p>It all boils down to this simple fact: if a service is free, then you are not the customer, you are the product. Any time you use a free product, try to think of what information you're giving them and how you are being marketed as a product. </p>
<p>Edit: Also, there's a difference between something like Spotify allowing you to login through Facebook and that stupid quiz to find out what Disney princess you are that your friend shared asking you to login through Facebook. One of them is a service that you're likely to use a lot, and they are outsourcing the authentication infrastructure to Facebook, the other is just trying to collect information to sell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

			<a href="/posts/6m8jly" onclick="return false">In Olympic rowing, why do all the players (on a single boat) row in sync rather than alternatively, for instance half team pulling and other half recovering, thus, resulting in a smoother motion?</a>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trivial answer is to &quot;go faster&quot; but why does that happen?
What is actually involved that makes the boat go faster while rowing all in sync instead of alternatively?</p>
<p>[edit] What I mean by alternatively, is, suppose the whole team (present on boat) is divided into 2 halves, A &amp; B. To move through the water, first the team A pulls the boat (using their oars) and when they have finished their power stroke then team B does the pulling. So, when team A is done pulling it goes into its recovery phase. Meanwhile, team B pulls the boat. And then A again, and so on continuing as ABAB... (What I DON'T mean is half team is pulling for half the distance and other half for the left over distance).</p>
<p>[edit 2]
Thank you for all your responses. </p>
<p>Summary of the reasons (mentioned in the thread) rowing is done in sync and not otherwise:</p>
<p>Limited Space on boat   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making it unable for rowers to go out of sync</p>
</li>
<li>The oars hitting one another</li>
</ul>
<p>Boat imbalance  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unnecessary stresses on the boat when rowers are going in opposite directions</p>
</li>
<li>Half rowers on one side in sync with each other but completely out-of-sync with the other side, make the boat go zig-zag, increasing the distance they're covering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Half of the rowers pulling the weight of other half who are recovering, halves the acceleration (not exactly though), which is not desirable.</p>
<p>Synchronization becomes unmanageable. </p>
<p>While in recovery, rowers move in a direction opposite to the motion of boat, thus the pseudo force pushes the boat forward, slightly though. If the rowers were alternating, the motion of the rowers would cancel out and thus
wasted.    </p>
<p>When a boat is being rowed, if half the rowers have completed their pull, the water is set into motion, and some rower of the other half will be applying the force with the oar in moving-water, thus inefficiency in its application </p></div></div>

<p>The absolutely <em>simplest</em> answer here is that the way it's done now means there's zero chance of anyone's oars hitting someone else's. And that reason in and of itself is worth not taking the risk.</p>
<p>It's also a lot easier to stay in sync when you work as a team than as two teams. You'll notice there's one pacer per boat; your way would mean either two or on doing two jobs. </p>
<p>Plus, as with many things, it boils down to tradition. That's how they've always rowed; that's how they row now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics tells me that, given you can apply the same forward force even if split up, it's more efficient to do so. This is because drag force is relative to the velocity squared, so high velocity is punished harder than what you save from low velocity - keeping the average velocity is more efficient. I'm not sure how much difference this makes though. (1^2 +1^2 =2 while 0.5^2 +1.5^2 =2.5, 25% more drag force if you evenly shift between 0.5 and 1.5m/s compared to a constant 1m/s, although the average speed is still 1m/s)</p>
<p>So why don't they do that?</p>
<p>1) As others have mentioned, there may simply not be space for the oars to be out of sync. While this is probably true, if it was more efficient, I imagine the boats would be designed for that, so I don't buy this fully as a single explanation.</p>
<p>So I'll add two other possible reasons, just speculations from my part:</p>
<p>2) Being at the boats lowest speed when putting down the oars may also allow each rowman to add more force each stroke compared to if they put it down at a speed closer to the average, so my initial assumption may be incorrect.</p>
<p>3) Being out of sync means some rowmen has to wait half a stroke into the race before starting to add their force, this sounds inefficient, it's likely that half the rowmen will put one less stroke into the water by the end of the race.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason, besides oars colliding, is that more power in the stroke means more speed, which lifts the hull further out of the water, so there's less drag, which means even more speed.  It's like a multiplying effect.  Having people stroke at different times means the hull never lifts very much, so you don't get that increase in speed.</p>
<p>See also &quot;hull speed&quot;.  It takes a lot less power to skim over the water than to push through it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
