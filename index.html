		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few Reasons - Taken from previous <a href="https://redd.it/mlct5" target="_blank">thread</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leonardo Da Vinci painted it. He is the foremost Renaissance artist. Artist's credibility adds to the paintings popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte hung the painting in his master bedroom in 1800. This - I think - was the first tipping point of making the painting one of the most popular paintings in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1804, Mona Lisa is hung in the Louvre - and others can now glimpse at the painting that Napoleon slept with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the real tipping point for the paintings popularity only hit in August of 1911 - when Mona Lisa is stolen. Stolen from heavily secured Louvre which experts said was impossible. No one knows who stole it or how. Conspiracy theories abound. The painting is talked about in every newspaper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 2 weeks of much fan fare, Police arrest Guillaume Apollinaire on suspicion of theft. He is the only person they have arrested. Apollinaire implicates Pablo Picasso. The rumor of Picasso stealing the Mona Lisa adds in a lot more fuel in making Mona Lisa very very popular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picasso is questioned and released. Guillaume Apollinaire himself is released after 5 days. Everyone is still clueless as to who stole the painting. But conspiracy theories abound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two years after the theft, the Mona Lisa is finally found when an employee working at Louvre tries to sell it to an art gallery in Florence for $100,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Mona Lisa is returned to the Louvre, it draws massive crowds. People visit the Louvre only to see this one painting.</p>
</li>
<li>And then it hit the Paris Hilton effect. Its popularity added to its popularity. So much so that most people don't know why it is popular in the first place.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Legitimate history and origins aside, the &quot;aura&quot; around the Mona Lisa reminds me of this excerpt from DeLillo's <em>White Noise</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several days later Murray asked me about a tourist attraction known as the most photographed barn in America.  We drove 22 miles into the country around Farmington.  There were meadows and apple orchards.  White fences trailed through the rolling fields.  Soon the sign started appearing.  THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED BARN IN AMERICA.  We counted five signs before we reached the site.  There were 40 cars and a tour bus in the makeshift lot.  We walked along a cowpath to the slightly elevated spot set aside for viewing and photographing.  All the people had cameras; some had tripods, telephoto lenses, filter kits.  A man in a booth sold postcards and slides -- pictures of the barn taken from the elevated spot.  We stood near a grove of trees and watched the photographers.  Murray maintained a prolonged silence, occasionally scrawling some notes in a little book. </p>
<p>&quot;No one sees the barn,&quot; he said finally. </p>
<p>A long silence followed. </p>
<p>&quot;Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn.&quot;</p>
<p>He fell silent once more.  People with cameras left the elevated site, replaced by others.</p>
<p>We're not here to capture an image, we're here to maintain one. Every photograph reinforces the aura.  Can you feel it, Jack? An accumulation of nameless energies.&quot; </p>
<p>There was an extended silence.  The man in the booth sold postcards and slides. </p>
<p>&quot;Being here is a kind of spiritual surrender.  We see only what the others see.  The thousands who were here in the past, those who will come in the future.  We've agreed to be part of a collective perception.  It literally colors our vision.  A religious experience in a way, like all tourism.&quot; </p>
<p>Another silence ensued. </p>
<p>&quot;They are taking pictures of taking pictures,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>He did not speak for a while.  We listened to the incessant clicking of shutter release buttons, the rustling crank of levers that advanced the film. </p>
<p>&quot;What was the barn like before it was photographed?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What did it look like, how was it different from the other barns, how was it similar to other barns?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;The 'Mona Lisa' wasn't even the most famous painting in its gallery, let alone in the Louvre,&quot; Zug says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was 28 hours, they say, until anyone even noticed the four bare hooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of a sudden, James Zug says, &quot;the 'Mona Lisa' becomes this incredibly famous painting â€” literally overnight.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the Louvre announced the theft, newspapers all over the world ran headlines about the missing masterpiece.</p>
</li>
<li>After a weeklong shutdown, the Louvre re-opened to mobs of people, Franz Kafka among them, all rushing to see the empty spot that had become a &quot;mark of shame&quot; for Parisians.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody talked about the Mona Lisa before 1911; it was not popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was stolen in 1911, but not noticed the entire day (28 hours). </p>
<p>Once the theft was reported all over the world (which shows what a big deal it was back then before the Internet or even television), overnight mobs of people became interested and wanted to see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The heist put it into the public consciousness in a very dramatic way, lifted it out of obscurity and became immediately famous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> One day nobody knows anything about the Mona Lisa, the next day it's <strong>stolen</strong> and everyone has to see it. Over a hundred years later it's the most famous painting in the world, but nobody remembers why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leonardo's border-free painting that achieved depth and shading through many layers upon layers was a revolutionary technique that had previously been unheard of and quickly became used by other artists after the Mona Lisa was finished.</p>
<p>Leonardo's existing fame plus the painting's innovative brilliance made it instantly famous, but it wouldn't become the &quot;most famous painting in world history&quot; until the painting's own history made it legendary. The painting was stolen and nobody knows how or by who so the rumors and suspicions around it gave it more and more attention, and then when it was finally recovered people from all over flocked to see it at the Louvre to see what was so special about this painting they'd heard about. </p>
<p>Then people heard about massive crowds at the Louvre and decided they must see for themselves, so on and so forth. Da Vinci himself even continues to gain fame every few years or so when someone tries out one of his centuries-old sketches and makes it actually work, then the internet goes into a frenzy researching the man and inevitably comes across the painting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Or you could add that this portrait masterfully employed, amongst many other techniques, a technique known as 'sfumato' which essentially means blending and tricks the eye so you cannot perceive where one carefully layered detail ends and another begins, like how smoky eyeshadow can create visually pleasing and strangely captivating eye-candy.</p>
<p>The big idea here is that the painting masterfully incorporates and utilizes numerous effects and styles and is representative of pretty much everything a good portrait painting of that period can or should possess. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orcas are fairly intelligent.</p>
<p>The various communities all have different hunting techniques.</p>
<p>Anyway, there was a case about an orca pod attacking a boy in Alaska, the boy was swimming and felt something touch him, he looked and saw an Orca.</p>
<p>Experts think the orca aborted the attack, thinking the boy was a seal as it was close to a harbour where seals are common.</p>
<p>My guess is the orca could have taken that boy without question.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are horror stories of orcas eating humans a few hundred years ago, before the rise of whaling. So I suspect orcas perhaps fear humans, if a human is killed by them then there would be retribution.</p>
<p>So yeah, whales are rarely ever aggressive to humans. Probably because they do not understand us, they are curious and do not see us as a prey item. </p>
<p>They are intelligent enough to know we would be an easy meal though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Since humans are not consistently in killer whales hunting areas they wouldnt have developed a &quot;taste&quot; for humans or the tactics to hunt them.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Killer whales use echolocation to find their food. This tells them where the food is, how big the food is, and what it is made of. They can tell the difference between copper and lead balls - this sense is really sophisticated.</p>
<p>There are different groups of Killer whales, called 'ecotypes', which vary in size, colour and location. They also eat different things -some eat fish, some go for mammals. Whatever they usually eat, they can tell the difference between their normal food and a person with their echolocation. We don't look the same to them as a seal, or whatever else they might be eating. We are also not a very nutritious food, nor do we usually hang out where Killer whales do, so there hasn't been a need to adapt to make us part of their diet.</p>

<p>Animals have to adapt to survive negative consequences. We're humans but we're animals too and for us to have survived this long, we will have to have learned to remember what did not work for us. We remember what almost killed us or hurt our social status because we can't have happy, healthy, wealthy children if we are dead; nor if nobody likes us. So our brains are wired to keep us alive and in good standing with society.</p>
<p>In other words, we can't forget about the things that sucked in our lives because our genetics want us to learn from them so that we can have children that can learn from them too. Evolution!</p>
<p>TL;DR: If our brains didn't dwell, this would be a planet of the apes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A whole lot of bad info here.</p>
<p>Short version:  So Congresspeople can get reelected by their constituents.</p>
<p>Longer version:  The military-industrial complex employs a <em>lot</em> of people (citation needed).  Those numbers don't include just those in uniform, or even the civilians who took over the outsourced jobs that used to be rotational duty for service members (mainly in personnel and admin, but also maintenance contractors and subject matter experts).</p>
<p>It also includes those people who <em>make</em> all the equipment the military uses, both on a daily basis as well as for wartime use.  The cuts that the Pentagon proposes would severely impact the plants that manufacture those products.  It came up in the news <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/9/lawmakers-force-pentagon-to-buy-tanks-keep-ships-a/" target="_blank">in</a> <a href="http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/12/18/congress-again-buys-abrams-tanks-the-army-doesnt-want.html" target="_blank">recent</a> <a href="http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/01/28/pentagon-tells-congress-to-stop-buying-equipment-it-doesnt-need.html" target="_blank">years</a> after sequestration became a thing.</p>
<p>There is, technically, a reason to keep some of those plants running besides local economy.  The going theory is that if you ever get rid of, say, the Abrams tank plant, and a war happens, it's going to end up costing more to spool the plant back up, retool all the machinery, and re-teach brand new employees how to make the tank...which will add time and cost to producing the end product, and/ or may mean the first generation or two of new tanks may not be up to par.</p>
<p>This isn't that unreasonable a concept.  On a particular weapons system I worked on, the company stopped producing part of the control system.  A high-end, high fail-rate <em>must have</em> part simply did not exist, except for the same part that was being installed on newer versions of the same ship.  We resorted to stealing the parts from the ships being built, and then when those ended up dying through normal wear-and-tear, we were given two options.</p>
<p>A) Wait 30 months for a brand new part.  This included the time to restart the manufacturing, including training all new workers and remaking the machinery to make the part.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>B) Wait 9 months for the part to be refurbished.</p>
<p>Note that Option C (all of the above) was not listed as a possibility.  I know.  I asked.</p>
<p>Now, that's anecdotal, and certainly doesn't address the fact that thousands of extra tanks exist when they shouldn't, but it's not entirely a bullshit excuse either.</p>
<p>All that said, the bottom line really comes back to local jobs.  Voters reward those who bring jobs to or keep jobs in the area.  It's why the subject of BRACs is such a hot-button issue whenever it comes up, and why Congresspeople will fight tooth and nail to keep the plant in <em>their</em> district open, while not giving two fucks if the next district over loses theirs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit:  To answer more as to why the military would tell Congress point blank why they don't need as much money, sometimes it's not the <em>amount</em> of money so much as it is <em>how</em> that money's being spent.  There's whole herds of senior officers and bean counters, some pretty smart fucking people, who know roughly how much money is available for the military's use, and money's just another resource.  Same as beans, bullets, and bandages.  They have their own needs and wants, and know that if you get rid of money from Column A (outdated tanks or ships that need to be retired), you can then spend that money on Column B (R&amp;D on new weapons or armor, new ships, or maybe even more service members).</p>
<p>There's a very real frustration in that, in the military's eyes, they're being hamstrung over the long term for the benefit of those who hold their budget in their hands, and it's a bipartisan problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit 2:  There's a few questions involving the overall expenditure of money to the DoD as well as our global force.  We do spend a LOT of money on our DoD, true.  However, if you look at our spending on our military vs. our GDP (basically, how much of our budget as a percentage goes to military), we're actually in a pretty good spot.  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?year_high_desc=true" target="_blank">As of 2015</a>, we were 20th in military spending vs. GDP, at 3.3%.  That's behind Russia's 5%, Israel's 5.4%, and Saudi Arabia's 13.5%.  </p>
<p>For spending 3.3% of our GDP on military, what do we get?  </p>
<p>A) Jobs.  These are actually pretty needed, in a very general sense.  There's much to be said for shifting those jobs to higher priorities, but the fact of the matter is that at a local level, if that happens, there are going to be people that lose their jobs, <em>even if</em> other people gain jobs.  I'm not stating this to defend it, just to put the info out there.  This is primarily what your average Congressperson is concerned with, because guess what?  It's what their constituents are concerned with.  Which, in the military's eyes, is actually a win.  Wait, why is this?  </p>
<p>Because when was the last time the entire nation banded together and really was a truly unified country?  When it faced a threat that had hit home soil, and had showed some capacity of bringing the fight here to our shores.  </p>
<p>As soon as Pearl Harbor happened, the patriotic instinct of &quot;we must protect this house!&quot; came into full bloom, and the entire nation bent its will towards doing everything in its power to make sure that no invasion of the US happened, by ensuring its enemies were destroyed far from its shores.  Which leads to...</p>
<p>B) Defense in Depth.  This is really what we're buying with our money.  The people who volunteer to serve, the equipment they train in and on, the tools to take the fight to the enemy, the massive support structure back at home, all of that exists for one purpose:  To keep the fight as far away from us as possible.</p>
<p>I'm going to go Navy on this for just a moment, because hey, that's what I know, but other forces also have similar strategies.</p>
<p>If you're an aircraft carrier, you have multiple layers of defense.  It's not just the force that the ship itself provides, because while that's good, it's just not enough, and there's holes.  Threats exist to which the carrier is not readily equipped, <em>on its own</em>, to deal with very well.  Subs can fire torpedoes.  ASCM (anti-ship cruise missiles) can be launched.  Swarms of attack craft can come on out and blow themselves up next to the ship.  The list goes on.</p>
<p>So what does a carrier do, accept those risks?  Oh hell no.  Instead, what they do is take a whole flotilla of ships with it.  Destroyers and cruisers keep an eye out above and below the surface of the water, ensuring that at the very least, any possible threat is identified and assessed, if not engaged.  A lone friendly sub may also be somewhere out there, likewise protecting the carrier as well as everyone else.  The carrier itself launches Combat Air Patrol to ensure that other nations' helos and fixed wing aircraft are warded off and engaged far away from the ship.</p>
<p>If, <em>somehow</em>, a threat worked its way through all of that to attack the carrier itself, the ship still has its own limited ability to fight it off.  Two different kinds of self-defense missiles as well as an extremely beefed up gatling gun protect the ship from any missiles, and can even be used against both air and surface targets.  Small arms crews can employ crew-served weapons against small craft.</p>
<p>Bottom line, to take out a carrier, you're going to have to be both lucky <em>and</em> good, and come in with a fairly sizeable force.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Note that this is simply one hypothetical, and is vastly simplified.  This is, after all, ELI5.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of that is just to say that the same concept is applied to our nation.  Envision the US as our carrier.  Sure, we have lots of guns at home, and a Coast Guard, but the further away our forces can meet the enemy and force a conflict elsewhere, the better our chances of never seeing an engagement on our own shores is.</p>
<p>Diplomacy and international aid are kind of like our long-range radars, in a way.  We can use those to detect the possible threat and veer ourselves (or the other country, really), out of our line of sight.  But should that fail, and it does for a wide variety of reasons, we have our own military to ensure that potential conflicts stay far away from us.</p>
<p>No other nation in the world projects force like we do, in part because most nations are far more concerned with their own backyard.  Even the old USSR at the height of the Cold War never really gave much of a shit about our land or resources, they just wanted to stop us from meddling in their plans for Asia and Europe.  China?  Wants to dominate SE Asia.  Hell, the Middle East?  Just wants us (and everyone else, really) to leave them alone, except to buy oil.</p>
<p>And this is why the very fact that Congresspeople are more concerned with jobs at the local level than with our ability to fight wars overseas is a win...because it <em>is</em> a comparison between those two, and not local jobs vs. an ability and a <em>need</em> to fight those same wars at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is in the same vein as politician speak on crime/drugs. Even if we have law enforcement, criminologists, data scientists telling us year after year that the war on drugs has failed and is doing more harm than good, politicians will always run on a tough on crime, tough on drugs policy because the average voter won't be reading research papers on the drug war. Instead they are more susceptible to populist rhetoric about crime and drugs ruining their neighborhood. So as a result, regardless of party affiliation, if the politician is from a large, national party they will be &quot;tough&quot; on drugs and crime because otherwise, it allows their opponent a free means to accuse them of having a weak stance on the law and protecting your streets and families.</p>
<p>This applies to military spending. The average person for the most part is against war but they are not against the military/it's soldiers. If a politician takes an active stance of cutting military spending especially in a period of uncertainty, that politician leaves him/herself open for a free attack on being against the troops and against national security regardless of whether the attacking politician wants to start a war or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I served nearly 10 years in the military, Active Duty starting in 2006. I also was the equipment manager for four separate equipment accounts worth millions of dollars each. That means I ordered stuff, repaired stuff, or sent stuff to be repaired at the proper station, as well as kept accountability on all pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>Let me try to answer your question: Does the military need more money for new/better equipment?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes. The stuff we have is old and crappy. Not all of it, and different bases with different missions might have some pretty badass stuff - but my base didn't. Our stuff was 40+ years old a lot of time, and probably cost more to repair every year than it would to just buy a modern one (but it's hard to buy $50,000 pieces of equipment routinely, usually a squadron can only afford ordering a few things a year - spread over hundreds and hundreds of pieces of equipment).</p>
</li>
<li>We need less than you may think. Why? Because TONS of money is thrown away/wasted every year. I'm not going to say too much, but due to an inspection that was coming up I was given a (unlawful) order to literally throw away about a hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment that was found by a member of my unit in a storage bin which was undocumented and ordered by someone who left the base years and years ago (this was overseas, so people in and out all the time). The individual who told me to do this was a Master Sergeant and I was a Staff Sergeant. I'm not gonna say what happened, but I will say that we did well on the inspection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty stupid if you ask me but it's also something that happens a lot. </p>
<p>There are a lot of issues with our military, but it would take a lot of great men to fix them, and that's just a resource that we no longer have much of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with how your brain prioritizes sensory stimuli. The thalamus is the control center for sensory stimuli and it essentially permits certain stimuli to be more in conscious attention like new scents or change temperature. So in your mouth you have chemoreceptors for the main food stimuli which are sweet (glucose), sour (acid), bitter (basic), salty (Sodium ions), and umami (protein/glutamate). Now your saliva is composed of many things namely digestive enzymes and water, so you should taste something technically speaking. Another caveat is that the stimuli must be able to dissolve in order to trigger a receptor. So the reason you don't taste or at least don't perceive the taste is that it is removed from your conscience attention to focus on more pertinent stimuli. The human body really likes to separate &quot;self&quot; from &quot;foreign&quot; so it will highlight exterior stimuli more often than not. </p>
<p>Tl:dr The thalamus tells your brain to ignore your saliva to focus on other stimuli.</p>
<p>Edit #1: You should taste others saliva because of the residual food that is in that individuals mouth. Otherwise humans should have the same proteins in their saliva, so in terms of composition they're identical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ooh i know this. In a neuroethology paper I did in my postgraduate studies, we focused on the function of the cerebellum, as a sort of sensory data processing centre of the brain. One of its key functions, is differentiation between the self and others/the environment ( another the anticipation of movement, consequences for movement etc ). The cerebellums ability to differentiate between the self and others is a survivalist mechanism, that allows for better situational awareness and shaves vital seconds off reaction time. The key way that the cerebellum helps differentiate the self from the environment is by dynamically counteracting continuous afferent stimuli ( constant repetitive incoming signals ) the kind of constant stimuli that the body produces on its own as a byproduct of actually functioning. One of those is the taste of ones own spit, others include the sound of ones own passive breathing, that fact that you don't wake yourself up from your own loud snoring etc. The cerebellum actively cancels this stimuli out because... well, its information that the brain, for the most part deems useless, and blocks, so it can focus on defensive actions and self preservation as indicated by novel and sudden changes in the environment, things that are more important than its own breathing. That being said, you can function pretty well without a cerebellum. Since lack of split second situational analysis is not ESSENTIAL to life, it just helps a lot. There are individuals that have no cerebellum and function pretty well.</p>
<p>tl;dr : it is a part of the brains innate prioritisation mechanisms, repetitive stimuli, like the taste of your own spit, is innately blocked by the cerebellum, hence no taste</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my personal theory has always been related to melatonin and cortisol levels.</p>
<p>cortisol suppresses the immune system, melatonin stimulates it. this is why coughing, runny nose, inflammatory pains are worse at night when cortisol is low and melatonin is high.</p>
<p>however, cortisol normally peaks shortly after waking up(giving you energy and making you feel more alert) so you shouldn't have worse symptoms at that time.</p>
<p>cortisol makes you more alert and reduces runny nose because it increases the sensitivity of alpha receptors(alpha receptors in your brain keep you awake and alert, while alpha receptors in your submucosal glands(which make and release mucus) reduce mucus production)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we can consider spacetimes with any number of temporal or spatial dimensions. The theory is set up essentially the same. Spacetime is modeled as a smooth <em>n</em>-dimensional manifold with a pseudo-Riemannian metric, and the metric satisfies the Einstein field equations (Einstein tensor = stress tensor).</p>
<p>A pseudo-Riemannian tensor is characterized by its signature, i.e., the number of negative quadratic forms in its metric and the number of positive quadratic forms. The coordinates with negative forms correspond to temporal dimensions. (This is a convention that is fixed from the start.) In general relativity, spacetime is 4-dimensional, and the signature is (1,3), so there is 1 temporal dimension and 3 spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's a lot of math, but it all basically means that, yes, it makes sense to ask questions like &quot;what does a universe with 2 time dimensions and 3 spatial dimensions look like?&quot; It turns out that spacetimes with more than 1 temporal dimension are very pathological. For one, initial value problems do not generally have unique solutions. There is also generally no canonical way to pick out 1 of the infinitely many solutions to the equations of physics. This means that predictability is impossible (e.g., how do you know which solution is the correct one?). Essentially, there is no meaningful physics in a spacetime with more than 1 temporal dimension.</p>
<p>(Ultimately, the problems comes from the fact that allowing more than 1 temporal dimension allows the existence of closed timelike curves, i.e., time travel, even in perfectly regular spacetimes, like those with a flat metric. Regular metrics with CTC's do exist in GR, e.g., the Godel metric, but these metrics with CTC's generally do not correspond to anything reasonably physical, <em>or</em> the CTC's are hidden behind the event horizon of a black hole.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We as a species have always retained a pretty high diversity of foods in our diet.  If anything, we would likely not have evolved if it weren't for the ability of our hominid ancestors, specifically H. erectus, to cook and process food.  There is a theory in evolutionary anthropology about the relative balance of the gut and the brain, sometimes referred to as the gray ceiling.  The idea being that both the digestive tract and the brain are biologically &quot;expensive&quot; organs requiring lots calories to do their jobs.  When H. erectus developed cooking anywhere from 750kya to 1mya, hominids suddenly gained the ability to get much more out of their foods, nutritionally speaking.  Cooking and food processing made digestion easier, allowing for the greater extraction of nutrients, and allowing for the gradual increase in size and neural convolution of the hominid brain.  If anything we have required dietary variation for our development as a species and to maintain the calories to support our complex brains.</p>
<p>By about 250kya, H. Sapiens appeared on the world stage, and by 20kya, we had developed agriculture.  There has been lots written on the downsides of agriculture, especially as it pertains to overall health of localized human populations (the prevalence of dental caries in Native American populations really sticks out in my brain), but let's not lose sight of the forest for the trees: except in certain instances of localized population collapse due to crop failure, agriculture has been a huge net positive for human as a species.  Agriculture has crucially provided us the ability to have a readily available source of high calorie foods and as such has supported the development of both cities and civilization as we understand them today.  Even though the relative diversity of foods may have declined as groups developed crop specialization, humans have always required multiple food sources for proper nutrition and survival.  While there is clearly a plethora of literature available evaluating the role of famine in causing local population collapse, the idea that humans as a species would subsist solely off of a single food source is a bit of a misconception.  The Native American groups of the Southwest subsisted on more than just maize.  Unless there were extreme circumstances affecting a localized population, such as a natural disaster or crop collapse, humans have always sought out food diversity by supplementing major crops with other vegetables, adding protein to their diet through animal meat and/or milk, and by trading with other groups for other types of food.  This has been the ultimate key to our species' success.</p>
<p>tl;dr--While agricultural development created a sort of dietary bottleneck, it has never been so extreme as to cause a species-wide population collapse.  In actuality, the ready availability of calorie dense food brought about by the development of agriculture far outweighed any nutritional deficits on a species wide scale and ultimately led to rapid population growth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>History, being the part of the human past that has been written down, is not that long. When you consider that the human digestive system has been evolving for millions of years, a few thousand is relatively small. In fact, the diet you are likely most familiar with is very uncommon throughout Homo sapiens' past. </p>
<p>In prehistory, the human diet was much more widely varied than it is today. Hunter/gatherers had to range far and wide to get the foods they needed to survive. It wasn't until a period known to archaeologists as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic" target="_blank">neolithic(new stone age) period</a> that humans began to narrow their food sources with agriculture(5-10k years ago) and a more sedentary life. The period is named this way because we find stone tools used for processing large quantities of grains associated with the time period. The most common of these are known as <a href="https://www.nps.gov/meve/learn/education/artifactgallery_manometate.htm" target="_blank">manos and metates</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the body evolved to need a well balanced diet- we humans can survive on pretty unbalanced food just fine.</p>
<p>What a well balanced diet is is that we have discovered that certain food combinations optimize the nutrients that out body gets.</p>
<p>Think of your body like a car, food is fuel, you can put pretty much any gasoline in your car as fuel.  But, you know, some gasoline works better in your car than others, some leaves buildups that make the car run worse, some contain additives that help keep the engine cleaner, and there are different octane levels that, while they can all technically burn in your car, often there is one specific one that is best suited to being used.</p>
<p>TL;DR: your body can get by on a lot of things, and the well balanced diet is less a requirement of your body than the result of a lot of trial and error trying to figure out what is most optimal to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of issues with the question/premise.</p>
<p>A &quot;well-balanced diet&quot; is largely a nutrition science idea, and even the best nutrition science is still rather limited. There are a huge number of things about food that we don't know - it's actually a pretty complex subject. </p>
<p>So, what determines a &quot;well-balanced&quot; diet? If we're talking what makes people feel the best (energy, good sleep, etc.) and have the best medical markers of health (low blood pressure, low cholesterol, healthy weight, good lung capacity, good heart rate, etc) it's still likely to vary. Part of it is likely biology. We're just now learning more about how different cultures actually may extract different amounts of nutrients from the same food. (Asians vs. Caucasians eating seaweed for example, or being able to process soy products better.)</p>
<p>But even just, what works for your body? Some people swear by low carb, for example. I have no energy and am super cranky if I try low carb. </p>
<p>Lastly, &quot;well-balanced diet&quot; is not remotely necessary for survival. Arguably, a lot of people on a &quot;western&quot; diet don't eat &quot;well-balanced&quot; in any of the typical accepted versions of the term. Too much sugar, too much over-processed food, etc. But it's not necessary to eat a well-balanced diet simply to <em>survive.</em> You can survive in a lethargic state, in a tired state, with high blood pressure or cholesterol, etc. In fact, a lot of us <em>are</em> surviving in that state. It's not desirable, IMO, but it's happening.</p>
<p>The rise of &quot;western&quot; diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart attacks.. a lot of these are diet-based, but it's not because we're trying to &quot;diversify&quot; or have a &quot;well-balanced&quot; diet. It's more likely (from what evidence we do have) the result of the <em>type</em> of diet we're consuming. The extra processed junk, the massive amounts of sugar, things like that.</p>
<p>Humans by and large can survive on a wide range of diets, and even be pretty healthy on a lot of them. The idea of a &quot;well-balanced&quot; diet is science trying to figure out what it hasn't yet been able to solve. </p>
<p>Check out Michael Pollan's work on nutrition, like In Defense of Food. It's pretty fascinating stuff, tracking the rise of government food pyramids and the removal of &quot;imitation&quot; labeling, the anti-fat craze that was not medically backed, and a whole lot of looking at other cultures throughout history, and what they ate.</p>
<p>It's really interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software solutions exist for this (see the <a href="https://horizon.camera/" target="_blank">Horizon</a> app), but the vertical vs horizontal problem is a hardware constraint that can only be partially solved by software.</p>
<p>Just like film in a camera, the sensor that is used to capture an image is <em>physically</em> a rectangle. For usability, purposes the manufacturers align the rectangular shape of the sensor to the rectangular shape of the phone. I.e. the long axis of the physical sensor is parallel to the long axis of the phone. EDIT: I can't stress the usability issue enough. Having the long axis of the phone parallel to the long axis of the handset means the orientation of the phone <em>represents</em> the orientation of the sensor (and thus the photo). If the long axis of the phone were perpendicular to the long axis of the sensor, that would increase the cognitive load on the user. </p>
<p>That means, in a phone that is held vertically (the long axis <em>of the phone</em> on the vertical), there are <strong>only three solutions</strong> to taking a photo with the long axis <em>of the sensor</em> oriented horizontally: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Manually turn the phone 90 degrees. Duh. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the phone oriented how it is and mechanically turn the sensor without the phone being moved. This is certainly mechanically possible, but would require additional components and a tiny motor to rotate the sensor inside of the phone before the photo is taken, either automatically or on demand. This doesn't happen because the value of doing this (over #1 above) isn't worth all the extra space in the phone this kind of physical mechanism would take up. </p>
</li>
<li>A software based solution, like the aforementioned Horizon app, which uses the phones' accelerometer to determine tilt and adjust <em>which</em> pixels on the sensor are being used to capture the photo. The downside to this approach is when the phone is held vertically (long axis of the phone on the vertical), the long axis of the photo sensor is still on vertical. The way the software gets a photo with an aspect ratio with the long axis of the photo on the horizontal is to ignore large portions of the sensor data. So when you're holding the phone vertically (or on an angle), an app like Horizon is only using a sliver of the middle section of the sensor to maintain the aspect ratio and orientation, and throwing away the rest of the sensor data. So you're giving up picture resolution and detail in favor of maintaining orientation. EDIT: <a href="https://horizon.camera/demo/" target="_blank">this demo of Horizon</a> makes it clear what data is being left out. </li>

It was assumed that people using their phone cameras would know which way to hold their phones to get the landscape shot, and for a while that assumption was true. Today the position is the opposite. Phones are expected to have a camera or two, and just as there is now a generation of people today who have no idea what the save icon in most word processor or graphics design programs is based on, so too are they unfamiliar with what were considered common sense practices with cameras ten or fifteen years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
