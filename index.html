		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have spent about a half hour trying to google this, and I always get the same page often titled &quot;How is black body radiation produced?&quot; that keeps on telling me what black body radiation does after it's radiated.</p>
<p>I learned long ago about the basic equations used to describe the phenomenon or how to calculate the spectral lines, and I'm very familiar with how a spectrum with a graph on it looks. None of these answer my question.</p>
<p>So Reddit please save me. <em>HOW</em> is black body radiation actually produced on the quantum level? What mechanism takes place to generate the actual photon and what parts of the atom are involved, what are the specific quantum interactions, and which specific Fermions and Bosons are doing what in what way? What energies are involved?</p>
<p>I realize this will have at least 3 different answers depending on the phase of the material, and that there is quite a bit of cross over with thermal radiation.</p>
<p>Bonus: How do monatomic gases emit black body radiation in rare cases?</p></div></div>

This means that some particles always have a possibility of transferring to a lower energy state, releasing a photon at a specific wavelength corresponding to the energy transition. At the same rate, other particles are thermally excited into higher energy states maintaining a constant energy distribution if the object is in thermal equilibrium. The resulting spectrum of emitted photons is dependent on the energy distribution which is a function of temperature and gives us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law" target="_blank">Plank's Law</a> and black body radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of mechanisms both intramolecular and intermolecular (or atomic). For example, the transition of electrons between different energy states in atomic or molecular orbitals. The energy states of different vibrational and rotational motions of molecules (these tend to be in the IR range) as well as the motion of atoms and ions relative to each other (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon" target="_blank">phonons</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung" target="_blank">Bremsstrahlung emission</a>) are how radiation is emitted.</p>
<p>All of those together create a background set of processes at different energy levels that couple together and result in black body radiation along with thermal equilibrium. Depending on the temperature different mechanisms will dominate (nuclear, electronic, atomic, molecular, etc.) Because there are a lot of different possible energy states, there's enough to fill in the black body spectrum. When you have a huge collection of atoms you have a lot of complicated energy states that basically involve the motion of every atom relative to every other atom, which is why macroscopic objects can have such &quot;smooth&quot; black body spectra.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not unique to the UK.</p>
<p>Other countries have or had the same sort of thing. It just evolved differently in many places. In the UK what stands out is that you have so many tabloids competing with each other egging each other on and raising the bar about what is considered acceptable because everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>For comparison in Germany you have the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper which is the countries biggest selling newspaper and largely a print repository of exaggerations, rumors, lies and unethical journalism in general. (One popular band called them out in lyrics of one of their songs as consisting only of &quot;fear, hate, tits and the weather&quot; and a novel about a woman's life being ruined by a Bild reporter and subsequently murdering him is required reading in many German classes in school.)</p>
<p>In the US the height of this form of journalism was when the tabloids in New York started the Spanish American war based mostly on lies and manipulations by yellow journalism. One of the main culprits later Joseph Pulitzer ended up regretting his behavior so much that in his will he left his fortune to help make better journalist though education and though creating a prize in his name that rewards the exact opposite behavior of what made him rich.</p>
<p>In the UK the tabloids just managed to hold on in numbers and continue to make the world a worse place through their lies and unethical behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Celebrities, the Royals, deceased soldiers, bombing victims and 13 year old murder victim, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Milly_Dowler#Voicemail_tampering_investigation" target="_blank">Milly Dowler</a> all had their phones hacked.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists working for the News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends to think that Milly was still alive</p>

<p>I always found this incredible screwed up! Surely they should all be TRUE at least?</p>
<p>They're essentially paper representations of various demographics utilising clickbait style techniques to drag their 'readers' in. They're VERY opinion based and the government doesn't hold journalism to high scrutiny as they are notorious for gagging orders/public enquiries they can control the release of information over. The 'newspapers' pander to the parties they believe they will have the most success selling too. Morality and good journalism is few and far between, in the U.K. And the world. </p>
<p>E.g. The Daily Mail is notorious for pandering to the audience that has no idea what life is like for MOST people so they get away with saying any of shit because their readers aren't commonly known to be deep thinking, research driven customers. They are often face value readers, much like The S*n. Both have countless lawsuits against them in response to false news stories. </p>
<p>The Guardian, on the other hand, appeals to mostly Liberal viewed readers, the social justice readers. However, aside from a few reporters, they don't really push the boundaries very far anymore or cause much debate. </p>
<p>Essentially they've become 'safe' if their market so don't do any journalism anymore. </p>
<p>They do mix it up a bit for the sake of meeting various journalistic standards but any opinions they print for 'balance' are buried in sections you'd struggle to spot them in anyway. </p>
<p>TL;DR: They pander to different political demographics using sensationalist tricks to guarantee clicks/sales; like if buzzfeed was printed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several multiverse theories, but in all of them I am aware of,  physical constants could vary. </p>
<p>The catch is that you can only exist to observe them in a very select subset of those variations, so from your point of view as an observing agent, the laws of physics would be constrained to those which support existance as an observer.</p>
<p>This has been proposed as the mechanism which provides a sense of constraint and continuity in an otherwise extremely diverse and  chaotic multiverse. </p>
<p>This also may be the reason that we perceive time as having a vector in the &quot;direction&quot; of entropy instead of as a &quot;static&quot; dimension such as space..... Human observation is dependent upon entropic processes like electrical and chemical processes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the comments already written mostly get at what you are asking, but I think use some extra jargon. </p>
<p>The idea of the multiverse (not the many worlds hypothesis) is that we can only observe a patch of the universe. It is entirely possible that something like the charge of an electron, or the mass of the Higgs boson, or any other bunch of constants, varies in space. The catch is it happens so slowly that in our patch, it is either constant, or almost perfectly constant. </p>
<p>In this sense different patches define different universes, because they are too far away to contact one another they are said to be causally disconnected. </p>
<p>This all might sound a bit hokey, but the motivation (as far as I understand) is two fold. </p>
<p>First our understanding of particle physics suggests there is a Higgs field, which is vary analogous to a magnetic field. In the early universe there was a hot plasma, and this defines a temperature. In a magnet, at high temperatures the magnetic field is zero, while at some critical temperature (the Currie temperature) magnetic fields begin to appear. The Higgs field does something similar, at early times it is zero, and then it begins to aquire a finite value (finite value == particles have mass). We know in a magnet that patches of the magnet develop different magnetic fields, and so in this analogy it is reasonable to expect the Higgs to have different values in different places. </p>
<p>While that's all cool, it seems useless if we can't observe outside our patch, but this idea is important in the context of the anthropic principle. One problem with the Higgs mass is that it seems &quot;fine tuned&quot;. Traditional solutions to this problem involve supposing there is new physics that does the fine tuning for you, but as more and more searches keep not finding any of this new physics, some people have turned to the anthropic principle, which basically says &quot;Well if it wasn't fine tuned we wouldn't be alive to think about it&quot;. This seems hokey until you suppose that there are an infinite number of Higgs-patches and then the idea that one has the special value needed for life becomes rather plausible. </p>
<p>tldr; Standard multiverse assumes Higg's is different in each patch, in principle other constants could vary too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The metamorphosis of insects is incredibly complex and there are uncounted ways such a process can fail.  </p>
<p>When I worked rearing moths for research, I usually found 15-30% of a batch could not to make it out of their pupae. </p>
<p>Some common failures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They got stuck inside and trapped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Couldn't free themselves of the pupa shell completely, and so became malformed when their exoskeleton hardened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>portions of their body failed to express adult characteristics, usually the abdomen, so they remained soft and pliable without the proper organ development on sections of their body</p>
</li>
<li>they were too small/underfed before they pupated, so they likely died of malnutrition/exhaustion in the process</li>
</ul>
<p>You can imagine that if you had to melt down and reconstitute your entire body at the level of individual tissues before you became an adult, that there are hundreds of places nature could throw a wrench in that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In mattress sales over here, and the type of mattress that people buy can affect this a lot. That's why there's all types of sleep guarantees, and if you don't like it you can return it type of sales. When someone who always sleeps on their side gets a really nice firm mattress they aren't going to like it. It's going to put too much pressure on their shoulders and hips. Same way with a back sleeper switching to a soft mattress, it will not give them nearly the same support that they're used to. </p>
<p>Think about it like this, in your home you want slippers. They're nice and cozy. On a run you want tennis shoes, they're durable and flexible. When you're on your feet all day, you'd want a nice pair of dress shoes with enough support to help with your posture, but at the same time having a good comfortable sole. With stomach sleepers you want a very soft mattress to take the stress off of your lower back. Side sleepers want soft mattress to conform to their curves, but also enough support to keep from sinking in. Back sleepers need support to keep their spine in line. Not a perfect metaphor, but it gets the job done. Sometimes one might have to change the way you sleep based on the type of mattress you have. </p>
<p>Just because someone has a great mattress, it doesn't always mean it's a great mattress for them. P. S. Buy a mattress protector with at least a 10 year warranty, yes they're expensive but it goes a heck of a long way. </p>
<p>Edit: they're, their, there. Because that seemed like the end of the world to some people. </p>
<p>I will admit that was pretty atrocious though. I apologize for completely not proofreading.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to point out that if you have a firm mattress and you sleep on your stomach, I'm not saying that you need to go out and buy a new mattress tomorrow! Honestly if you're feeling pain then try to sleep on your back. I had to do this and it was super annoying at first and it honestly took me about 2 weeks to completely adjust, but once I did I started getting wonderful sleep with the same mattress I already had. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm not sure why people are so skeptical of my advice considering I'm getting no commission off of this, and the chances of me running into any of you is extremely unlikely. Take it as you may, I'm just trying to help out the everyday type people. </p>
<p>Final Edit: When I said tennis shoes I meant athletic shoes in general. I grew up around people who referred to athletic shoes as tennis shoes. I know the difference, but I'm just so used to calling them tennis shoes. Kind of like how a lot of people will call tissues &quot;Kleenex&quot;, or call lip balm &quot;Chapstick&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry about format. I'm on mobile :) </p>
<p>Sold mattresses for years. Still weirdly passionate about it. Here's my take:
Our bodies are made to sleep on our back. Unfortunately, a lot of times our pillows and mattresses work against us. I would see a lot of people (usually elderly) come in and say &quot;I have back problems. I need something firm for support.&quot; Unfortunately &quot;support&quot; and &quot;firmness&quot; are two very different things! Think of what your spine looks like: it isn't a straight line, is it? It's curved. So when you lay on something hard your spine goes down to meet that hard surface as opposed to that surface coming up to meet you. THEN you have springs in most mattresses. They have what I used to call a &quot;push back system.&quot; Those coils, no matter what they are made out of, are constantly trying to go back to their natural position causing pressure points along your body. It may be subtle but it's why a lot of people toss and turn! Their body can feel those coils pushing on them after a while.
Does a softer bed help? Somewhat! But what if you're not comfortable on a soft bed? No problem! My number one recommendation will always be a high quality memory foam bed or a hybrid (there's enough memory foam between you and the coils to make it pressure relieving). My personal favorite is a Tempur Pedic because science. Like, for reals. They have put a shit ton of research into those beds, BUT there are other options that aren't as pricey!
If you get around to searching for a new bed the #1 way you will find a mattress that works for you will be to lay on that bed for 10-15 minutes. I don't care what sales people say, trust your body and keep an open mind!
Pillows? Go see your chiropractor. They have this kick ass pillows that are weird at first but they'll fix you right up!
Hopefully that helps somebody! Having what we called in the biz &quot;a good sleep system&quot; seriously helps your quality of sleep and really your quality of life. I slept comfortably at 9 months pregnant, which is usually unheard of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience as a massage therapist there isn't really a prefect answer. Most of this is just preference and what the body is used to. </p>
<p>If you're a side sleeper, it's not that you <em>can't</em> sleep on your back it's just your body isn't used to it. If you laid there long enough you would fall asleep. And vice versa. </p>
<p>For those wondering, best sleeping position is on back with pillow or some support under the knees. If you're a side sleeper stick a pillow between your knees. Don't sleep on your stomach. (But thanks to those who do because you keep me in business.)</p>
<p>Edit: usually stomach sleepers have neck pain because the neck is always on one side for hours at a time. If you don't have pain and it's comfortable then go for it. If you wake up with a sore neck then consider changing positions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep technologist here and in my experience, position dominance is quite common due to sleep apnea. Typically the fight or flight syndrome kicks in from the individual having sleep apnea, or lack of oxygen, and patients find the less destructive position. Many patients that tell me &quot;I can't sleep on my back&quot; aren't lying. This is because the body will interrupt sleep to breathe since they aren't breathing while sleeping. When apnea occurs continuously, sleep is significantly interrupted and the heart is stressed from reduction of oxygen in the blood. Too often the individual will turn to their side as a result where apnea is less frequent and severe. Same goes for many patients sleeping on their stomach. However when sleep apnea is resolved, many of these people that &quot;can't&quot;, sleep on their back, end up doing so quite successfully. Hope this makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even while not in a deficit, fat is your primary avenue of energy consumption. Different intensities of exercise determine where energy is converted from. Easiest example I will use is track and field. </p>
<p>(anaerobic)100-200 meter sprint= ATP-PC (adenosine tri phosphate/ phosphocreatine)</p>
<p>(glycolytic)400-800 meter sprint= carbohydrates</p>
<p>(oxidative)1600 meter+ = fat (which is why distance runners are always super lean)</p>
<p>Now each of these metabolic pathways do have over lap. You will never burn purely one energy source at a time.</p>
<p>During a normal sedentary day, you are burning primarily fat but not very much. Same with while you are sleeping.  Now on a low carb day, once your body uses up all its carbs (glycogen/ carbs that have been stored in the muscle) it will then resort to only breaking down muscle into to glucose. Lastly, breaking down fat will occur since it is the most abundant source of energy. In addition the process of gluconeogenesis occurs when there are non carb sources left which is the body's way of &quot;creating sugar from sciency components such as lactate or glycerol because sugar in a more readily available form such as a carbohydrate does not exist&quot; But I will need a bio chemist/ exercise physiologist to confirm that process because that is still foreign to me.</p>
<p>The average person can walk 500 miles on the fat energy stores alone. It is the primary source for energy, but the hardest to convert, which is why losing weight is so difficult. </p>
<p>Having a lot of fat is ideal for survival, so while it is the largest source of energy, it is the hardest to convert.</p>
<p>SOURCE- Kinesiology graduate</p>
<p>EDIT: hey neat, GOLD! Judging by comments and corrections, take this information as general explanation, all the reddit biochemists/med students are tearing me up! My degree has prepared me for &quot;this is how you can lose weight&quot; more so than &quot;physiologically, this is HOW you lose weight&quot; so I apologize for some misinformation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make an analogy: imagine your body is a cabin in the woods with food in the cabinet, food on the table, and the rest of the food in winter stores in the cellar. </p>
<p>If you use some of the food on the table for energy (muscle energy), eventually you will put more food on the table by taking it from the cabinets (your liver). One the cabinets start getting low you either buy groceries (eat food), or you open up the winter stores (fat reserves) and prepare some food for the cabinets and table (replenish the liver and muscle stores). </p>
<p>Your question is akin to 'if I eat all the food on the table, do I use up food in the cellar? and the answer is not immediately,  but without replenishing the food from an outside source eventually you got to get it from somewhere and that's the long term food storage (fat) </p>
<p>Your body has a few buffers in place to prevent you from suddenly having critically low levels of energy available. You store some fuel in muscles, ready for very fast and rapid energy like running away. You store more in your liver in the form of glycogen and fatty acids. When you fast for a few days it's your liver that is providing most of that energy. One the liver is tapped out you will find a sudden drop in energy and you will feel very lethargic and weak. Over the next few days the body ramps up it's fat burning metabolism and you will come to a stable state with better energy but you can deplete it quickly with prolonged activity. </p>
<p>Now imagine that you ate at any point in that, your body would use some of that for immediate energy, but it would use the rest to try to replenish the energy stores consumed already. If you burned more than you ate, you have a net loss of calories from your energy stores and you lose weight. </p>
<p>A deficit of 3500 calories is 1lb of fat. </p>
<p>The general answer to your question is no. Your body doesn't take energy from fat when you skip a meal or two, but longer term it may have to burn fat to replenish your liver and muscle stores. You could say that if you burn energy and don't replenish it, that eventually it results in fat loss. If you are not eating enough calories for a long enough period of time your body goes into a ketone metabolism where the body switches from running on fats, proteins, and sugars, to mostly running on ketone bodies produced from metabolizing your fat stores. Once you begin a ketogenic metabolism from lack of calories, then the body gets faster and more efficient at using up your fat stores so eventually yes you are burning more fat with less of a buffer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Newton's theory of gravity, you can definitely define gravitational field lines. The reason they aren't used very much is that they aren't as useful as magnetic field lines are, for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Magnetic field lines can be seen directly. For instance, plasma is often frozen onto magnetic field lines, as in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona#/media/File:Traceimage.jpg" target="_blank">example on the Sun</a>. You can use a magnet to force iron filings to align with the magnetic field.  In contrast, the gravitational field is much less useful directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newtonian gravity has no speed limit. There was never any need to use a field to transfer the force from one place to another, because Newtonian gravity is instantaneous. Note that electrostatics (Culomb's Law) is also instantaneous, so electric field lines were not invented until after magnetic field lines were invented.</p>
</li>
<li>(related to the second) There are no (Newtonian) gravitational waves. Fields become necessary (as opposed to just useful) when they carry significant energy independently of matter. Light is an electromagnetic wave which can only be understood classically in terms of a field. There are no free gravitational waves in Newtonian theory, because Newtonian gravity is instantaneous. </li>

<p>For an electric field, the characteristic is charge and the lines point in the direction that a positive charge would travel. </p>
<p>For a gravitational field, the characteristic is mass and the lines point in the direction that a point mass would travel. </p>
<p>For a magnetic field, the characteristic is a moving charge and the lines point in the direction that a compass would point.</p>
<p>The strength of all these fields can be displayed by drawing more lines within a certain area. More lines means stronger field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something to add to the other comments already here: Magnetic fields can store energy in their fields, and the upshot of this is that the field can sustain <em>tensional stress</em>. This makes it behave a lot more like a physical object than other fields. </p>
<p>When something like iron filings or a plasma is contained in the field, this makes the material seem like an elastic ribbon, moving under tension (e.g. as seen on the suns surface). It's important to realise that the material is just there because its stuck along the field, and the energy is driven by the static magnetic field storing and releasing tension. In the coronal arcades of the sun, the changing magnetic fields can release this the elastic tension and 'flick' plasma out as mass ejections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Americans are identified by credit institutions with their social security number. A social security number, therefore, can open a lot of doors in the US. This number is issued at birth, is very hard (or impossible) to change, and is used on every credit application (apart from maybe some payday lenders who lend on title collateral). It is both a unique number, widely used, and stored on many different systems with varying levels of security.</p>
<p>In the UK (for example) there is no centrally identifying single number or document that is used to establish identity (well, there is the National Insurance number but that is not used on credit applications). Identity is established by means of history. This history, usually address history, is matched with electoral registers, previous business with that company, and other factors, to establish a trust profile. If you can match your addresses with your electoral register registration for the last three years, it is a good indicator that you are who you say you are. In establishing this identity, the identity theft fraudster has to know a lot more about the person they wish to defraud (more than a number, anyway).</p>
<p>Another oddity of the UK is that it is not required to have identification. A person can, and many do, in fact, live their lives without ever holding a passport of a driving license and have no way to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently SSN is not unique. Maybe unique enough to generally work?
Edit 2: SSN is not automatically issued, it is issued on application.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically most countries when you are born/turn 18 get some sort of national ID with picture and 1/2 unique codes. That ID will need to be re-issued every x number of years.<br />
For any important transaction like loans/bank stuff  or education stuff like enrolling in highschool/universities you again need that ID. Sometimes they will even ask for copies from parents ID since their name will appear on your ID.</p>
<p>In America they don't have any national ID. They have a social security number but it's basically a piece of paper with just a number written on it and a name you get at birth, hell it even says on it&quot;Not for identification purposes&quot;. No picture or parents name to cross reference the number .<br />
So if you know some basic information from a person like name/social security number/address/bills to prove that address(which you can take out of the garbage for example) a bank will allow any person to open an account under that name and rak on bills.  </p>
<p>For one of the most advanced countries on earth they have the shitiest social security protection in the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are still running on the <em>benefit</em> system of identification. Social Security was supposed to be only used for tracking your employment history throughout your life in order to receive Federal retirement benefits. It works extremely well when used for this purpose. Then bankers decided to piggyback on this system as a means to track down potential debt defaulters. Since it can generally produce an address, they have a way to contact. Then everyone jumped on this same system to the point where social security is now more related to your personal  financial record than your history of paying into a retirement fund. Due to the lack of protections, as others have mentioned, and the electronic economy where you do not have to produce facial identification, it is extremely easy to take over someone's identity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Your Birth Certificate, All past addresses, Phone Numbers, Car Registrations, Marriage and Divorce, Mortgage, Land rights, voter registration information, criminal (of course), &quot;owed money&quot; and a lot more of information you don't even realize is stored in government databases and is by law &quot;Public Information&quot; and can be accessed by government websites. Google, FaceBook, Data Brokers and &quot;Background Check&quot; sites like Spokeo, Ancestry, Whitepages, etc. build robots (and pay very cheap labor to &quot;data input) that scrape all this public information and put it in their database. Have you searched your name recently? Your information could be on literally thousands of these &quot;Background Check&quot; sites. All these sites collect and relate you information then make an &quot;account&quot; about you.  They sell the information and or place ads along side your information.

Think about how your computer screen looks inside at night compared to outside on a bright day; It looks brighter inside because your eyes adjusted to the lower ambient light, and the actual objective difference of light conditions is much bigger than you might expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
