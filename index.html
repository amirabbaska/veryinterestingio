		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given this is probably inspired by the United thing, I'll answer off that first. It was handled in a way that was completely wrong. In my 200 flights in the last year and a half I have NEVER seen it handled like that. They completely fucked up and it's a bad example of how it's supposed to work. I think what happened is they boarded and then realized they had to get a crew of four to another city so they could be the crew members on another flight because of the recent storms that stranded a ton of people for days. </p>
<p>What should/usually happens is pre boarding they ask for volunteers to give up their seat. Continually raising the amount in vouchers they'll give you. They generally don't board the plane till this is figured out. Usually this is caused by overbooking or stand by passengers who missed a connecting flight because of weather/other unforeseen events. Once they have enough volunteers they have them wait and not board, asking them to sit off somewhere. Then about 20-30 later once they have boarded everyone else they'll either tell none/some/all the volunteers if they need them to board or if they'll put them on another flight. If the airlines lucky a few people don't show to the flight or missed a connecting so those volunteers will still get to go home. If they need those seats they'll cut the volunteers a voucher and schedule them for the next available flight to their destination. You're told in advance when the next flight you'll be put on when you volunteer so it's not a guessing game. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It also seems exceedingly odd that an airline would consider it acceptable to have a customer wait about 18 hours to take a half-hour flight which could be driven in under 5 hours. The airline may have been within its rights but United was sorely lacking in commonsense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotics don't &quot;know&quot; where to go and how to get to the infection.  However, different antibiotics distribute within the body differently and on different time scales - what we call &quot;pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics,&quot; or &quot;PK/PD&quot; for short.  Also, different antibiotics affect different pathogens differently (their &quot;spectrum of activity&quot;).</p>
<p>So, your doctor prescribes the correct antibiotic (and formulation) for your specific infection, considering both the underlying bacterial strain(s) and the location of the infection.  </p>
<p>For example, vancomycin is an antibiotic that is not absorbed well when taken orally - that is, it does not cross over from your stomach to your bloodstream, what we call &quot;oral bioavailability.&quot;  So, for specific types of gastrointestinal infections (such as those from Clostridium difficile) where you would want  to keep a high concentration of the drug in the gut, it's a logical choice.  </p>
<p>But, for an infection elsewhere (such as an abscess in the skin), it would be a terrible choice, as not enough antibiotic would get to the site of infection from the gut.  Thus, you would need to use an intravenous formulation of the same drug (or choose another antibiotic that is orally bioavailable).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question!  Some other posters are right.  The antibiotic goes wherever the body sends it.  The antibiotic is designed to be more toxic to the bacteria because it is designed to attack parts of the bacteria that ideally our cells do not have.  Bacterial cells have some important parts that our cells do not.  The things called enzymes that make these parts are what the antibiotics normally work against.  </p>
<p>We also can design drugs that behave differently in our bodies to make them more useful.  By making changes to the chemical structures we can make them absorb better in our stomachs so  they get in our bodies faster, or make them slower to leave our blood.  If you have a urinary tract infection, a drug that gets in your urine fast is great. If you have a bad case of food poisoning,  a drug that stays in the gut rather than being absorbed in your stomach is a better option.   So knowing where you are sick and what is causing your illness all are factors in deciding which antibiotics to prescribe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The use of error codes is considered a good practice in programming, because it allows different errors to be strictly defined and distinguished from one another. The name and explanation of that error can then be easily localized.</p>
<p>For example, HTTP error &quot;404&quot; has a detailed specification indicating when it should be issued. It happens to be called &quot;Not Found,&quot; but a web site may choose to return a page with a different name and an easy-to-understand explanation if it wants to. Or a browser can choose to provide that information, even translate it based on the user's language. Either way, behind the scenes the web server and browser both understand just what is meant by &quot;404.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others said about users not being able to fix and therefore not really caring specifically about teh error, there's also the fact that other programs consuming the program you are using will look for those errors to handle them in specific ways. But they can't parse your error <em>message</em>, they need something easier to parse and more unique than that.</p>
<p>Let's say the error was &quot;Page could not be located&quot; and you set up your browser to show a certain toolbar on invalid pages. Now let's say you decided to change the wording a bit to &quot;Page not located or inactive&quot;. Now all the code that was looking for your previous message has to update. By using special codes, it lets you change the human-readable side of things without impacting any consuming code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

When I'm writing code and dealing with catching errors, I generally display a human readable message about the error (easy for the consumer to understand) and often include the error code somewhere in there for a consumer to google. As for other devs working on the same codebase, I always print the localized description to the console so that when replicating bugs, they know exactly what's going on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some really nice &quot;textbook&quot; examples by which gravity affects waves in an atmosphere... </p>
<p>Acoustic (sound) waves at very low frequencies behave differently in an atmosphere with gravity. As the frequency get very low, their wavelengths become too long relative to the scales at which density decreases with altitude, and they thus approach a &quot;cut-off&quot; frequency (corresponding to ~4 minute period in Earth's atmosphere below ~100 km altitude). This is a direct consequence of gravity and the resulting exponential decrease of density with altitude that occurs in an atmosphere. </p>
<p>Disturbances to the atmosphere at lower frequencies than the acoustic cut-off frequency will tend to result in &quot;buoyant&quot; fluid motion instead of compressions (in particular, at frequencies below the &quot;Brunt-Väisälä&quot; frequency - which is a natural frequency at which oscillations in the fluid occur due to the disturbances of the balance between buoyancy and gravity). At these very, very low frequencies (&gt;5 minute periods at most altitudes &lt;100 km), atmospheric &quot;internal gravity waves&quot; form as a direct result of the interplay between buoyant and gravitational forces. These are analogous to oceanic internal waves, within the fluid; note that the ocean waves we are more familiar with are those at the surface, aka &quot;surface gravity waves&quot;. </p>
<p>So, yes, many classical waves are a direct result of the force of gravity upon a fluid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The net movement of the air around you is not up or down; the force of gravity is balanced by atmospheric pressure. So in that sense the medium is stationary and the sound of your voice will not fall over distance, it will only decrease in volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A powerful laser is fired in a short pulse into a plasma. The light scatters off the electrons in the plasma and is Doppler shifted by the thermal motion of the electrons. One images the scatter with a spectrometer to divide up the light by wavelength, and then images that with a photomultiplier tube or other similar highly sensitive light sensor. The spread of the wavelength of the laser pulse is correlated with the temperature. This is one way you can measure the temperature of a plasma without cooling it off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although you could in principle measure temperature with a laser, you're probably referring to an IR thermometer. Fun gifts for tinkerers. They usually use a low power laser so you know what you're pointing it at. In any case they measure the frequency of the IR radiation emitted by whatever surface you're pointing it at. Everything in existence above 0 degrees Kelvin emits characteristic  radiation called black body radiation, starting in the infrared and then the hotter you get the higher the frequency of the radiation you are emitting becomes. This is also how night vision goggles work  coincidentally. </p>
<p>Edit: it was correctly pointed out to me that here in the real world with real world limitations, these thermometers simply measure the abundance of light in some predefined IR frequency range and correlate that to some calibration curve and determine the temperature. In an ideal world however you could still just measure the frequency of the highest intensity light if it wasn't so darn hard to measure the energy of low energy photons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additionally autism is now basically a catch-all diagnosis. Every new edition of the DSM adds symptoms and imho it's being massively over diagnosed at the moment.</p>
<p>But to answer your question the brain is divided into regions with each region being responsible for a specific task. Examples are processing visual input from the eyes, muscle control, regulating emotions, controlling breathing etc. Most brain disorders only affect one or a few of these regions, leaving everything else working normally.</p>
<p>Often the brain compensates by using another region to do the task of the broken region, but this is a bit like having one person do the work of two people. It's more hard work and the results are suboptimal. This is why some people with high-functioning autism/Asperger syndrome are virtually undetectable. Their brains have compensated, but they may be consciously applying rules of social interaction that they've learnt rather than it being an automatic process.</p>
<p>Where an unaffected person would know that someone who is trying to change the topic of conversation isn't interested in the current conversation someone with Asperger syndrome would need to consciously recognise the body language and other signs that this is happening, compare that to previous conversations and figure out that's what's happening.</p>
<p>Someone without the condition would do this automatically and may not even recognise it's happening.</p>
<p>As you can imagine being able to hold down a complex conversation whilst simultaneously analysing the body language and subtle social cues of the people you're talking with is harder than doing one or the other. This is why some people with the condition just do one or the other, and will keep talking as you get more and more uncomfortable. 🤣</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your brain as a character in an RPG. You start out with base stats, and you get to assign 10 points to any stat you want. Everybody gets roughly the same total ability, but how they distribute those points can be customized. </p>
<p>So you have languages, empathy, imagination, logic, memorization, coordination, anticipation, math, spacial orientation, all as possible things to put points into. </p>
<p>This is a way of thinking of the different things a brain does, which is a LOT. If you think about it from an AI perspective, just teaching a computer to have a consciousness is almost insurmountable, yet even the most Autistic person can do that easily. So things we take for granted, are still a kind of miracle, like looking at an apple and knowing it came from a tree, what it tastes like, smells like, what you can do with it etc. </p>
<p>People with learning disabilities may be deficient in some areas like memory, or logic, but be strong in others, like math, empathy, or anticipation. Someone could have excellent memory, but lack the capacity to really understand the meaning of what they are memorizing. </p>
<p>Now we don't all have exactly the same total ability, but I would wager the difference in brain power between Einstein, and your gardner is not as great as you think. Certainly not as large as the difference between IBM's Big Blue and a 9 yr old. </p>
<p>So people may be capable of much, but have trouble learning. They may arrive at high function, but it may take them longer to get there. People with dyslexia for instance are not dumb, but school can be hard for them and they need longer. </p>
<p>Other people may be severely disabled and lack the ability to do things we take for granted, and yet have extraordinary gifts in other areas. </p>
<p>Even average people may have a few abilities that are far above average. It depends a lot on a persons mind, and not just their brain. How organized their thoughts are, can affect how well they communicate ideas, how well they reason problems out, even without getting into the physical aspects of a brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my theory is compensation. I am autistic, and I think I have to work  extra hard in some arenas just to keep my social head above water, and this manifests itself in some interesting ways. </p>
<p>pretty simple, if someone loses an arm, the other one gets stronger, because they must work harder with what remains. </p>
<p>In my case, I have a difficult time remembering information people tell me, because it all sounds like a wild cacaphony, so I don't well distinguish it from background noise or simply from people bullshitting, stuff I should ignore anyway. I don't have automatic context, and context is the only way I can find to retain information. I undergo far too many permutations to find meaning in what you guys automatically and skillfully rifle through. </p>
<p>My solution is to start to &quot;paint&quot; facts and feelings and stories on the landscape onto or near where I heard it. It barely works, and I fail all the time, no matter how hard I try. I put tons of effort into it though, and I really have to focus to listen and then apply. </p>
<p>The hilarious side effect is that I could recreate a setting I was in with uncommon clarity and detail, and tell you what facts or stories or information may have occurred there. Alternately, I'll revisit a place I &quot;painted&quot; the info onto, and I'll remember a lot of irrelevant data I applied to the scene. I won't remember the facts any better than anyone, but almost no one on earth will remember the setting better than I. This isn't especially useful, but I'm lucky that people are attracted to others with uncommon abilities. </p>
<p>Also, it makes me better than average at 3D modeling and spacial recognition, and visual problem solving, and pattern recognition. All of which I am in the top 1%. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With respect, the answers saying the autistic are dedicating more of their brain to memory and have special abilities are perhaps missing some practical information.</p>
<p>I've been working with the autistic for a decade now. The reason they seem to have good memories about preferred topics is <em>perseverance</em>. That's the symptom name for their habit of repeating things over and over and focusing on one small preferred topic. You hear about the autistic teenager who knows every bus number and scheduled bus time in Los Angeles? Well, you could know that too if you spent 6-7 hours per day staring at a bus schedule and repeating the numbers, for years, like he does. That's an actual example. Some of these kids wake up in the morning and grab their preferred material from next to the bed and go over the information for the millionth time and keep at it every chance during the day. They lag in other areas, and are often hard to draw into speech about anything other than their preferred topic.</p>
<p>If they're lucky the preferred topic can at least be something other people are interested in. If not, they might be memorizing part numbers for the 1965 sears craftsman tool and die catalog. It can be hard to understand or predict what they will seize onto. Your memory could be just as good, though, if you dedicated as much time to the narrow material choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a post about what causes Autism*</p>
<p>*Representing a pretty well supported but not final body of research in neurology. </p>
<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a diagnosis based on social and behavioral features (restrictive interests, repetitive behavior, problems with social interactions) rather than by a common biological cause. </p>
<p>Interestingly, there seem to be two rough groups of people affected by Autism. The first group tends to have the social/ behavioral problems in addition to intellectual disability, developmental delay, mis-developed body features, other stuff associated with  genetic disorders. There is mounting evidence that for these folks, Autism if often a result of various spontaneous genetic mutations in the parents sperm or egg (or in early embryo) that interfere with brain development in ways that converge on a common pattern &quot;Autism&quot; as well as other symptoms depending on what genes are affected. </p>
<p>But for group number 2, they have the same kinds of social/ behavioral features, but are otherwise completely normal and don't have the higher incidence of harmful genetic changes seen in group 1. I don't know of any comparable leads on the biological basis of the disease for this group but awesome science is happening a the time so who knows. </p>
<p>I can provide sources if anyone is interested </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The center is right where you are standing. If you hopped in a time machine that was stationary but could travel through time like the one in H.G. Wells's &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; and set the dials for the beginning of the universe, you'd zoom back through time as the universe shrank around you. The universe would shrink to a size too small for you and your time machine to be in before you got to the beginning though, and even before you got to the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_\(cosmology\)" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> period, at which time the universe was about the size of a grain of sand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can &quot;see&quot; all the way to the cosmological horizon already, the edge of the observable universe. What we see there is photons that were emitted about 380,000 years after the start of the universe. Before that, the universe was so densely packed with stuff that any photon emitted by one atom would be absorbed by another atom almost immediately. Those photons have been travelling for so long and so far that they are all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" target="_blank">redshifted</a> to microwaves, but in any direction, that redshift indicates a distance of 46.5 billion light years. The observable universe is a sphere 93 billion light years across, with you at the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more space between two object the faster the expansion is. This is due to dark energy. This means that where ever you are in the universe everything is generally moving away from you (with exceptions due to gravity). This means that all points appear to be the location of the big bag and the center of the universe from that locations frame of reference. Therefore it is not possible to find the center ( if there is one ) with this method. An easy way to demostrate this is to take a rubber band cut it so that it is a straight line and make different points on it with a marker. Stretch it and check the movements of each of the points relative to several different frames of reference and you will find all things seem to move away from the frame of reference you choose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
