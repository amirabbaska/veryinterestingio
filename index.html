No isotope of technetium has a half life of more than a couple million years, so if there was any present when the earth was formed it's all gone now. It was only discovered in the 1930s after being created by irradiating molybdenum in a cyclotron. There are small quantities in the earth that are a fission byproduct of natural uranium, but these are not a significant source and natural technetium was only discovered after the element was synthesized. Technetium is a very important material in nuclear medicine so there is demand for it, and basically all of the technetium we use is artificially created in nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>Edit for more information: this is more relevant than some new, high-z element with a short half life because technetium is element 43. It's the lightest element with no stable isotopes, so before it was discovered there was a hole in the periodic table right in the middle of a bunch of common elements, some of which had been discovered centuries before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In case you couldn't tell, this is a complex topic.</p>
<p>What you describe as hearing the root of the chord as interchangeable with the full chord isn't always the case. Western Music (the European tradition) is built on a system of harmonic function. The goal is to get from your tonic (the primary note) to dominant (the fifth note of the key, which functions as the yin to tonics yang) back to tonic again, like taking a journey. Tonic is home, dominant is the store. You start at home, go to the store, and come back. Each chord with in a key has a function, or job, in getting you through that journey.</p>
<p>Through the common practice period (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven), we have created a series of expectations that are learned through hearing them a lot. Certain chords create tension that have expected resolutions. As the various musical lines move through these tensions and releases, certain notes become more important than others. This process tends to highlight roots of chords.</p>
<p>In non functional harmony, it's much harder to hear the roots of chords as the chords often become more complex and the normal tension/release relationships of functional harmony get left behind.</p>
<p>As was also mentioned, every note you hear contains many notes within it. These notes follow a very specific pattern known as the over tone spectrum. As you go further into the over tone spectrum, the ratio between the frequencies of the over tone and the fundamental become increasingly harder to calculate. For instance, the first overtone is the octave above the fundamental. These have 2:1 ratio, creating a very pure sound where the wave peaks line up often. Your 2nd overtone is a fifth above that and has a ratio of 3:1 to your fundamental and 3:2 to the 1st overtone. Still pretty clean. The next over tone is another octave, so 4:1. The next one is a third above that, which is a 5:1  ratio (giving your major chord a ratio of 6:5:4 in it's closest interation). Eventually these start getting silly, like 27:23 once you account for octave displacements, which signifies that the notes spend more time out of sync than in sync. Most of your prominent functional chords stay to the first 6 overtones, which represent the first four distinct pitches to show up in the over tone spectrum. So there is a physics explanation, but it gets clouded by chord extensions and chord voicing pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Edit: a commenter reminded me exactly how to find the ratios, so I edited the information to reflect that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of a chicken or egg problem. </p>
<p>Do our brains perceive harmony to correspond to roots because of some physical interaction in those frequencies? Or is it because our system evolved that way and we're just trained to think that way? Or did the system evolve to be that way because of something physical? </p>
<p>You see the dilemma.</p>
<p>Realistically it's probably a bit of both, but the evidence that other systems of pitches don't have the same concept of harmony, and our system has changed significantly in the last 3-400 years, and that you can change the actual frequencies pitches correspond to and get the same effect, leads many to think this phenomenon is cultural or otherwise learned from how we've made music for the last few centuries. </p>
<p>There are also some really interesting theories that have to do with information entropy in how we select interval relationships and gravitate towards particular harmonies, but that's kind of an out there theory that isn't very widely accepted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of wrong answers here and couple that are right but don't go into a lot of detail. So I'll weigh in with what I know (which is a lot. I'm an engineer who studies fundamental and functional harmony in my free time) and hope I don't get completely buried by popular answers.</p>
<p>The reason why this happens is because of the constructive interference between the sound waves of the notes being played. This means that there are various points in time where the root waves of all three notes being played (assuming a major triad) are at the exact same point of their motion at the same time.</p>
<p>Let's assume a textbook structure of an A major chord based on the harmonic overtone series. This consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A (440 Hz)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E (1320 Hz)</p>
</li>
<li>C# (2200 Hz)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the sound waves of each of these three notes take a specific time to complete a full wave. The amount of time being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A (1/440 = 2.2727 miliseconds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E (1/1320 = 0.757575 miliseconds)</p>
</li>
<li>C# (1/2200 = 0.454545 miliseconds)</li>
</ul>
<p>So every single time the base wave of your A note completes a full wave, the base wave of your E note will have completed exactly three waves and the base wave of your C# note will have completed exactly five waves (3x0.757575 = 2.2727 and 5x0.454545 is also 2.2727).</p>
<p>This interference causes the wave of your A note to be strengthened on every single repetition, where the wave of your E note is only strengthened every third repetition and the wave of your C# note is only strengthened every fifth repetition. This is what causes your A wave to stand out to the ear as the &quot;root note&quot; even when it's not the highest, lowest or loudest note.</p>
<p>When different octaves of the same notes are used this interaction still happens but they happen between the overtone waves of your three sound waves, rather than between the base waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a simple way to explain what you might be experiencing is one of several factors: Either you're hearing the root (the lowest note) or the highest note, because these are easiest to pick out with your ear and this becomes especially noticable in the context of progressions where your ear wants to follow that note on it's way (usually down). Another explanation could be the particular voicing of a chord, where the tonic note (Such as the C of a C chord) is repeated more than once as an octave and as such has more presence in the sound. Lastly, there's the more complex idea of the harmonic series. Where in a note contains sympathetic frequencies on top of the fundamental. So for example if you were to play a C note on a piano, while you mostly hear the note &quot;C&quot; as the fundamental harmonic frequency, that C note also contains all the notes for the full C major triad. You can experiment with this more on any instrument with vibrating strings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we think of as one &quot;note&quot; is in fact lots of notes. When you pluck a string you're not just getting one single note or frequency, but a mix. One of these is the largest and biggest, the one which the string can vibrate with easiest - this is the fundamental frequency, and makes the loudest sound.</p>
<p>However, on the same string there are other vibrations, and these come in a mathematical pattern called harmonics. They are smaller and quieter, so we don't hear much of them, and they add to the instruments &quot;timbre&quot;, that is the general quality and texture of the sound. </p>
<p>The reason chords &quot;work&quot; is because the additional notes you play are causing all the smaller vibrations to overlap in exactly the right pattern to match the harmonics. </p>
<p>For example, the fundamental frequency of middle C is at 244Hz. The first harmonic of this is E, at 320Hz. If we played the E note in addition to the C note, these two frequencies overlap and create a much richer, harmonious sound than the two notes indivudually. </p>
<p>To answer your question: in this example, we're considering the harmonics of the C-string, so it is in relation to the fundamental frequency of 244Hz. Everything we add that correctly overlaps with the harmonic frequencies has it roots at that number, so the overall sound is like that of the C note, just far richer. If we did the harmonics starting at E as our fundamental, it would be a different pattern, and our ear would instead pick out the fundamental frequency of E being richer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sebaceous glands are found inside the pores of our skin, all over the body, except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There are more sebaceous glands on the face and scalp than elsewhere.  </p>
<p>As the glands produce sebum inside the pores, new skin cells are constantly growing, and the outer layers of skin are being shed.  </p>
<p>Sometimes, dead skin cells are not shed. They remain in the pores and get stuck together by the sticky sebum, causing a blockage in the pore.  </p>
<p>Pore blockage is more likely to occur during puberty, as the sebaceous glands produce more sebum at this time. </p>
<p>Oils build up inside the pore as it slowly swells in size, and in the case of acne where bacteria feeds upon the oils within the pore, white blood cells also accumulate, causing an even more violent and accelerated development of sores under the skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current top comment is about oil which is modestly accurate but if you're talking about cysts that doesn't apply. Staphlyococcus, a common skin bacteria, can get caught in all that oil and dead skin. When it does, it will multiply. </p>
<p>When it reaches an appropriate number (quorum sensing itself for an infectious dose), it will begin secreting a fibrinogen. Basically a biochemical that will create a matrix to harden and seal off the skin. This will allow them to create a perfect &quot;bubble&quot; that will give them good growing conditions and prevent your bodies immune response from interfering. Then they will multiple with any and all available resources. </p>
<p>Once they run out of resources, build up too much toxic end product (think bacteria shit), or space, they will secrete a fibrinase that will thin and destroy this wall. When the wall is wrecked, it pops and sprays concentrated bacteria all over the skin, where it hopes to start the cycle all over again.</p>
<p>This is why antibiotics are typically effective against frequent acne sufferers and the main reason they try to encourage you to wash your face &amp; use alcohols is to get the bacteria off of it.</p>

<p>Your body doesn't metabolize them differently, almost no substances change from the original grain, and they are metabolized by the same mechanisms in the body. These mechanisms are known to be useful for almost all kinds of molecules. They are very unspecific.</p>
<p>However the coffee will be absorbed quicker than grains and that changes the amount of substances your body has to deal in a time. That can lead to different metabolic pathways. So in this case yes, they are metabolized differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wire length, wire diameter, and wire material all effect total wire resistance.  If you know the resistance of the cable, r, you can calculate the maximum theoretical power transfer across that cable to a phone, which is a maximum when the phone appears to have the same resistance as the cable (for an ideal power supply, which isn't the case, but we'll ignore that fact.)</p>
<p>Total Power = v*i</p>
<p>Power in device = 1/2 v*i</p>
<p>i = v/(2*r)</p>
<p>power in device = 1/2 [v] <em> [v/(2</em>r)]</p>
<p>power in device = v^2 /(4r)</p>
<p>For a 5v charger, you get</p>
<p>power = 6.25/r</p>
<p>r = 6.25/power</p>
<p>So, if you want to transfer 10 watts to your phone, you need a cable that has no more than 6.25/10 ohms or .625 ohms.</p>
<p>A 1-meter cheap thin cable might have .6 ohms and be able to charge at 10W (slightly more than 2 amps).  A cheap thin 5-meter long cable might have 1.4 ohms and only be able to charge to 4.5 watts. (just over 900ma).</p>
<p>Real power supplies aren't ideal and have an internal resistance that must be added to that of the cable.  That means the situation is a little worse than we just calculated.  The good news is that while their resistance isn't generally published, it is typically small for a good charger.  Also keep in mind that this is the maximum theoretical power, and not all phones can achieve it.  Between the phone and charger and cable, short cheap cables generally work fine, as do longer heavy-duty cables, but cheap cables longer than about .5 meter may restrict your charging rate.</p>
<p>Whether they are generic or not, the main thing to look for in longer cables is thicker wiring (low AWG).  Harder to check, but also important, are the quality of the USB connectors at the ends of the cable and the quality of the soldering that joins them to the wire.</p>
<p>Incidentally, USB-C generally eliminates this problem by adopting higher voltages as part of the official standard.  Higher voltages mean more maximum power for the phone and less wasted power through the cable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Another is to influence politics in the target nation by schmoozing the right people and what not. Most importantly they are also essentially officially sanctioned spies. They pass any and all information they can gather to their home country, and it is extremely common for regular spies to be based out of an embassy or consulate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are several ways that the severing of diplomatic ties is a sanction. On the individual level, the diplomats themselves will not be happy - a posting in the US is generally very prestigious. This may not seem important, but you have to remember that diplomats are members of a quite elite club where people struggle for status and ostracised is never good. </p>
<p>More importantly, however, diplomats serve important functions. Firstly, diplomats are important for promoting and protecting Russian interests in the US, and useful to Russian businesses who operate, who are looking to invest, or are looking for investment from the US. Secondly, they serve an intelligence gathering tool able to keep a finger on the pulse of goings-on in a country. Though this is perhaps less important than it once was given the internet and easy access to media, there is no substitute for having someone on the ground interacting with other diplomats and government officials (as well as perhaps managing covert intelligence gathering). Finally, it’s a punishment because it is intended to demonstrate that the US and the UK are taking a hard line on Russian actions. Reducing diplomatic capacity necessarily reduces Russian influence in forums in the US, for example the UN, and also makes settlement of future disputes through peaceful diplomatic channels. In this sense, it’s as much a warning, as a punishment, which is why people tend to refer to these measures as ‘sanctions’ that incorporate elements of both. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

NASA proposed that placing a surprisingly small magnet at the L1 Lagrange point between Mars and the Sun could shield the planet from solar radiation. This could bea first step toward terraforming. The magnet would only need to be 1 or 2 Tesla (the unit, not the car) which is no bigger than the magnet in a common MRI machine.

While this is true the fact is this would solve immediate problems that make Mars uninhabitable.<br />
It's also been suggested that once a large colony is established on Mars one of the first industries could be manufacturing a large quantity of these magnetic dipole shields (or something similar) and creating a global shield to reduce gamma rays.  </p>
<p>But the main reason that criticism isn't compelling is that once the atmosphere grows and becomes denser it will also act as a barrier to reduce gamma rays.  </p>

Mars' atmosphere was not ionized off by solar radiation (at least not significantly).

<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-12-mars-atmosphere-solar.html" target="_blank">Mars atmosphere already well protected from the solar wind.</a></p>
<p>If you were to release sufficient gasses on Mars today, it's estimated that the atmosphere would remain for several million years (at least).   ...so the only barrier to terraforming is getting sufficient N2 O2, CO2 and H2O gas to Mars.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's a couple of different reasons why we perceive cold water quenches our thirst more, but the honest answer is it's a trick and it doesn't.</p>
<p>To start the cold temperature softens sharp flavors because it dulls our taste buds a little bit.  Sweets become a little less sweet when cold, and tart flavors do the same.  Because of this the flavor isn't as overpowering (compare room temp soda to soda on ice) and it seems more refreshing.</p>
<p>Next the act of drinking is actually a pretty big part of the reason too.  If you had IV fluid, and I drank the same amount of water, I would feel more refreshed because I actually drank the water.  My tongue, mouth, and throat all sent a message to my brain saying &quot;oh snap that was nice&quot;.  Combine this with the fact that cold fluids are more palatable like I mentioned above, and your brain will get more of those signals.</p>
<p>The last part is also the reason why room temperature liquid is the way to go though.  When you drink cold liquid, especially that's been chilled with ice, your body really notices the drastic temperature change, and sends the full/refreshed signal faster. </p>
<p>The thing is though, your body has to warm that liquid to help it digest and break down and that takes calories or energy.  This is why room temperature water will actually allow you to drink more, and require less work to digest.</p>
<p>Tl:dr- Your body tricks you into thinking it is, but it's really all in your head...</p>
<p>Edit:. Everyone is focusing in on the fact I said cold water is heated in the body.  But you're focusing on the wrong paragraph.  Cold water fills you faster because your body reacts to the temperature difference.  The heating is unimportant except for the fact that room temp water is more efficient to drink as you can drink more.</p>
<p>Look at it this way- If you were dehydrated with the flu and the doctor tells you to drink a lot of water, you are better off drinking room temp water over cold water.  The reason is simply because you can drink more of the room temperature water before your body says &quot;ok that's enough&quot;.  It has nothing to do with the 8 calories needed to bring the water upto body temp. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GPS is actually a remarkably simple piece of technology, at least in its concept. You have a series of satellites in known places in orbit equipped with atomic clocks that send out a constant radio signal that simplified is essentially &quot;Hello I'm satellite 3, the current time is XX:XX:XX&quot;</p>
<p>By knowing the current time when the satellite message was sent, and it's position, and the speed at which the message traveled (the speed of light) you can triangulate your position on the earth. The more satellites you get a fix on, the more accurate your position.</p>
<p>But Einstein did contribute one mind blowing thing to the GPS network.</p>
<p>He theorized that time was not a constant, and that the speed of time varies depending on your relativistic speed. The faster you move, the slower time flows for you. And at the speed of light time essentially freezes. To prove this they put two atomic clocks in perfect sync and placed them in a tower. One at ground level, and one up high. Since the second clock is higher off earths surface it's rotating around the earth at a higher speed than the one on the ground.</p>
<p>After a couple of months they checked the clocks and sure enough the clock up in the towers clock had slowed down, not by a lot mind you, but just enough to prove Einstein's theory.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with GPS?</p>
<p>Since the GPS satellites are in <del>Geo-synchronus</del> medium orbit they are very high off the Earth's surface and therefore moving very fast. Since time is critical to the GPS system they have to constantly update the clocks on the satellites to be in sync with themselves and on the ground because for them time moves at a slightly slower rate than those on the ground!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time dilation. Essentially both you and the satellite cannot agree on how time passes without applying Einstein's formulas stipulated in both the Special and General Theories of relativity. Yes there are two effects. Time agreement on when signals leave and arrive is critical to triangulate your position since you are far away from the satellites and they/you are moving all the time. One nanosecond error equals 1ft distance error.</p>
<p>Special Relativity: Because you and any GPS satellite in orbit have a relative velocity (one of you is moving, from the other's perspective), both will observe the other's clock to tick slower. </p>
<p>General Relativity: Because both you and the GPS satellite experience different gravitational accelerations (gravity is higher for you as it is for the satellites), clocks close to you tick slower than clocks close to the satellite.</p>
<p>Both effects counter each other where GPS tech is concerned but not exactly. But accounting for only one of the two is not sufficient. The combined effects add up to clocks drifting apart by 38000 nanoseconds a day if unaccounted for by both theories, making GPS tech impossible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of people talking about how dolphins can get water from their food, however most aquatic lifeforms have blood salt concentrations higher than what's acceptable for a mammal so dolphins have relatively strong kidneys that they use to remove salt from their blood and into their urine. So they literately piss out the extra salt. Other salt water creatures that don't have the same salinity in their blood as in the sea water have other various means to get rid of extra salt such as in the form of salt glands in certain reptiles birds and sharks, so they &quot;cry&quot; out the extra salt instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They get water from their food, and that food is mostly a carnivorous diet perhaps for this reason. Marine herbivores end up taking in a lot more salt and have to have mechanisms in place to deal with this. They also have kidneys that have a better processing system then most so they can pass more salt through their urine but it seems like most of this isn’t well studied and is as of yet mostly theory.   </p>
<p>Some are known to drink fresh water when they can. seals will eat snow for this reason and people in Florida sometimes leave a hose running into the water so manatees will come and drink.</p>
<p>It's a really interesting question and there aren't a lot of solid, one size fits all answers. the best TLDR i could give is, we don't know 100%, but it seems like a lot of them deal with it in different ways, and we don't know all of them yet. </p>
<p>Most of my information is from this article if you want to read more. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason salt can dehydrate things is because fluids always want to be where there's more salt. It's relative, meaning wherever there's more salt, no matter how much it is, the fluid wants to go there. We have a salinity based on our own environment, and higher salinity will dry us out. So simply put, sea animals are more salty than we are. If you put them in fresh water, all the water penetrates their cell membranes, because they are saltuer than the water around them. Their cells burst, and they die. This also happens to us if we drink too much water!</p>
<p>This isn't the entire solution, as fish aren't exactly as salty as the sea though. But they are salty enough to withstand the sea salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their kidneys are better at removing salt from the bloodstream than ours.</p>
<p>This isn't unique, cats can stay hydrated after drinking saltwater due to their kidneys. </p>
<p>With that said, this is hard on their bodies/kidneys, and cats can even experience kidney problems in captivity because they drink the minimum (very small) amount of water to stay hydrated. But in the short-term, they tolerate more salt/less water than humans.</p>
<p>So tolerance for salt varies between &quot;similar&quot; animals (i.e. mammals) which can be shown from many examples other than aquatic mammals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
