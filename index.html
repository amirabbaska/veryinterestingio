How does my folder's data become smaller? Where does the &quot;extra&quot; or non-compressed data go? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compression is a way to more efficiently store data. It's best explained with a simplified example.</p>
<p>Suppose I have a file that contains the string &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot; (w/o quotes). This is 20 characters of data (or 20 bytes using basic ASCII encoding). If I know that files of this type rarely contain anything other than letters, I could replace this string by &quot;20a&quot; and program my software to read this as an instruction to create a string of 20 a's.</p>
<p>But what happens if I want to use the same function for something that does contain a number? Well, I could decide that any number that is to be interpreted literally, rather than as part of an instruction is preceded by a -symbol (and then add the special case of using \ whenever I want to represent a single ).</p>
<p>In certain cases, where the file doesn't contain many numbers or slashes, the size of the file can be reduced by this shorthand notation. In some special cases, the filesize actually increases due to the rules I introduced to properly represent numbers and slashes.</p>
<p>Next up a compression tool might replace recurring pieces of data by a symbol that takes up considerably less space. Suppose a piece of text contains many instances of a certain word, then the software could replace that word by a single character/symbol. In order to ensure that the decompression software knows what's going on, the file format could be such that it first includes a list of these substitutions, followed by a specific symbol (or combination thereof) that marks the actual content.</p>
<p>A practical example. Lets use both of the previous concepts (replacement of repeated data in a sequence by a number and a single instance of that data and replacement of freqeuntly occurring data by a special symbol and a &quot;dictionary&quot; at the start of the file). We use the format &quot;X=word&quot; at the start of the text to define a substitution of &quot;word&quot; by symbol &quot;X&quot;, with the actual text starting with a !. We use the \ to indicate that the following character has no special meaning and should be interpreted literally.</p>
<p>The text is:</p>
<p>I'm going to write Reddit 5 times (RedditRedditRedditRedditReddit) and post it on Reddit.</p>
<p>This line has 90 characters. Applying our compression algorithm, we get:</p>
<p>$=Reddit!I'm going to write $ \5 times (5$) and post it on $.</p>
<p>This line has 62 characters. A reduction of a third. Note that this algorithm is very simplistic and could still be improved.</p>
<p>Another technique that can be used is reducing the size of the alphabet. Using standard ASCII encoding, 1 character uses 1 byte of space, but this 1 byte allows for 256 different characters to be expressed. If I know that a file only contains lowercase letters, I only need 26 different characters, which can be covered with just 5 out of the 8 bits that make up a byte. So for the first character, I don't use the full byte, but rather just the first 5 bits and for the next character, I use 3 remaining bits of the first byte and 2 bits from the next byte, etc...</p>
<p>Now a file like this can only be interpreted correctly if the software on the other end knows it's dealing with a file that uses 5 bits to encode a lowercase letter. This is rather inflexible. So what I can do is to include a special header in the file, a small piece of data that contains the details of the encoding used, in this case it will mention that each character uses 5 bits and then has a list of all the characters that are used. This header takes up some space, so reduces the efficiency of the compression, but it allows the compression software to use any type of character-set that it likes, making it useable for any file.</p>
<p>In reality, ZIP and other compression techniques are considerably more complex than the examples I've demonstrated above. But the basic concepts remains the same: Compression is achieved by storing existing data in a more efficient way using some form of shorthand notation. This shorthand notation is part of the official standard for the compression-system, so developers can create software to follow these rules and correctly decompress a compressed file, recreating the original data.</p>
<p>Just like in my examples, compression works better on some files than on others. A simple text file with a lot of repetition will be very easy to compress, the reduction in file size can be quite large in these cases. On the other hand, a file that contains data that is apparently random in nature will benefit very little, if anything, from compression.</p>
<p>A final remark. All of the above is about &quot;lossless&quot; compression. This form of compression means that the no information is lost during the compression/decompression process. If you compress a file and then decompress it using a lossless algorithm, then the two files will be exactly the same, bit by bit.</p>
<p>Another form of compression is &quot;lossy&quot; compression. Where lossless compression tries to figure out how data can be stored more efficiently, lossy compression tries to figure out what data can be safely discarded without it affecting the purpose of the file. Well known examples of lossy compression are various file formats for images, sound or video.</p>
<p>In the case of images, the JPEG format will try to discard nuances in the image that are not noticable by a regular human observer. For example, if two neighbouring pixels are almost exactly the same colour, you could set both to the same colour value. Most lossy formats have the option to set how aggressive this compression is, which is what the &quot;quality&quot; setting is for when saving JPEG files with any reasonably sophisticated image editor. The more aggressive the compression, the greater the reduction in filesize, but the more data that is discarded. And at some point, this can lead to visible degradation of the image. So-called &quot;JPEG artifacts&quot; are an example of image degradation due to the application of aggressive lossy compression (or the repeat application thereof, the image quality decreases every time a JPEG file is saved).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are already some good explanations of compression.  But that isn't the whole answer to, &quot;what is a zip file&quot;.  </p>
<p>A zip file is  an <em>archive file</em> that also supports compression.  An archive file is a way of storing a collection of files (and directories, file names, and other data necessary to reproduce a subset of a file system) in a single file.  It is a convenient  way of packaging a bunch of files for archiving, sharing, etc.   </p>
<p>Compression is a common feature for archive file formats, but is not required.  Nor is an archive format required for compression.  Classic Unix 'tar' and '.a' files are examples of archive formats that didn't include compression.  And there are a variety of tools in Unix/Linux environments for compressing a single file without any kind of archive file format.</p>
<p>.zip files were the file format for a &quot;shareware&quot; DOS program from <em>1989</em> called pkzip, from a company named pkware.  Because it was functional and effectively free (and maybe because of the catchy name) it quickly grew to be a defacto standard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><code>Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Linguini Pizza Pizza Pizza Sub</code></p>
<p>Let's shorten it by making a code.  We agree that in addition to the regular text we can use % to &quot;signal&quot; that the next value is a number that tells us how many times to repeat the following text in parentheses.  So now we have:</p>
<p><code>%7(Pizza )Linguini %3(Pizza )Sub</code></p>
<p>Much shorter!  We know to repeat Pizza 7 times, then Linguini once, and then another signal to repeat Pizza 3 times.</p>
<p>We can also do:</p>
<p><code>%7(Pizza )%1Linguini %3(Pizza )Sub</code></p>
<p>That's pretty much the concept compression in a nutshell (and I've written code for decoding bzip data).  it is basically agreeing on code forms to shorten stuff, and implementing those tricks and techniques as part of a compression algorithm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>= &quot;ing&quot;<br />

<p>Original:
What is a &quot;zip file&quot; or &quot;compressed file?&quot; How does formatting it that way compress it and what is compressing?</p>
<p>In this compression, 23 characters were replaced by 7, a saving of 16 characters.  Because we chose a single character that never appears in the original text, our compression can be reversed without error.  There is some overhead, however, because we also need to send the translation key along with the message.  In very long messages, there are often large and frequent repetitions that can be squeezed down enough to be worth the overhead.  If the compression / decompression rules are built in to the software, there is no need to transmit the compression key.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  <em>you're changing the primary direction of the cloth's major fibres in the same way vaccuuming a carpet changes its darkness in strips as you go back and forth.</em></p>
<p>The types of fabric like velour or velvet where this is the most apparent have small and short fibres that stand somewhat straight up. These act like millions of tiny springs so they feel soft when you touch them, and they create excellent insulation, so you often find them on baby blankets. </p>
<p>Now say the normal direction of those little fibres is straight &quot;up&quot; from the fabric base. When you run your hand along them in one direction, you're smoothing those fibres so they point flatter and along the direction of your vision. This flat surface &quot;bounces&quot; more of the light to your eye in the same way that looking at a lake's surface in the direction of a sunset bounces light toward you. But go the other direction and now the fibres are pointing in a way that you're looking sideways at them, or the light is hitting their tips rather than a flat part, so they absorb more of the light hitting them rather than reflecting it in your direction. And that makes them look darker.</p>
<p>This can be amplified if the natural fiber direction is normally bent a little downward in some direction rather than completely vertical. In that case, running your hand along that natural smooth direction makes it even smoother and more reflective, but going the other way REALLY roughens it up and allows for much less light to bounce away cleanly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vocabulary time: nap: The rough layer of projecting threads or fibres on the surface of a woollen or other textile fabric. Later also: a special pile given to cloth, esp. velvet, by artificially raising, cutting, and smoothing the short fibres.</p>
<p>Think about a short haired cat or dog. Their fur lies a certain way. Pet it that way, and they look smooth (and enjoy it). Pet them tail to head however, and their fur sticks up weird and they are mad. Their fur has a nap direction.</p>
<p>On a cloth, there is an underlying structure. For wovens (e.g. The pants in the video), the fibers are crossed over like a lattice fence. Now imagine if that fence were laying in the grass - the grass sticks up at a nearly perpendicular angle. Of course in a fabric, it's not grass but that actual woven fibers are either kinda hairy, or it's a special cloth with long parts. Other fabrics are knitted, like tshirts are knits. There are some velours that are knitted and have nap.</p>
<p>So with the cat analogy, we understand that the hairs sticking out can be brushed in different direction. With the fence analogy, we can see that the fence doesn't change regardless of which way we brush the grass. Now if the light source is really low, the grass will look bright on one side and dark if you're looking from the other side. That's pretty much why fibers look different depending on where the light is. The light bounces off the up fibers differently to the down fibers.</p>
<p>When velvet clothes are made, it is so the fibers stick out and trap more light (reflect less light). So a black velvet dress is as black as possible. Jewelry is displayed on black fabric for this reason - so the jewelry can scatter light and sparkle, and you don't get distracted by the background. In photography, black velvet is considered to be the hardest fabric of all to photograph. It's very hard to show the folds and details because the fibers trap all the light.</p>
<p>By the way the pants in the video are made of a &quot;brushed twill&quot;. Aside from velvet and velour, and fur, other things with brushsble nap include cut carpet (not the loopy kind), toweling, snake scales, feathers on a bird, and other fabrics like the new two toned sequinned fabric <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6UBjjZl6wY88GPJu/giphy.gif" target="_blank">see a gif</a>... <a href="https://youtu.be/mY9Ln8zHDBs" target="_blank">or a video</a>. In these sequinned fabrics, the sequin is made with one side that is one color, and the other side another color. Sequins are flat discs with a single hole like a record. The thread holding it down is loose enough that the sequin can be moved to show one side or the other. This is an extreme example - fibers in brushed fabric are all the same color, but behave differently en masse when brushed, because they were manufactured in a certain direction.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short version is their proposed drill sites are in the territorial waters of the US, Costa Rica, and Mexico.  So they need to get permission from whichever government controls the drill site they settle on.</p>
<p>The long is:</p>
<p>The earth is &quot;owned.&quot;  Every government owns (or controls who owns) all of the land directly underneath it.  Obviously this isn't infinite, the nature of the Earth being a sphere means that if you went down deep enough there would be overlapping claims, but present technology doesn't let us drill anywhere close to where that would become an issue. </p>
<p>Governments also own the ocean up to 200 miles off their shore, as well as the land underneath that ocean.  Once you get outside of that 200 mile zone you are in international waters.  Here things start to get unclear.  </p>
<p>Most of the world has agreed to a treaty known as the Law of the Sea Convention.  That convention sets up how things are to function within the 200 mile limit, and created a commission known as the International Seabed Authority (ISA) that is supposed to determine when entities are allowed to conduct undersea drilling in international waters.</p>
<p>The problem here is that the US has agreed to everything in the  Law of the Sea Convention <em>except</em> the provisions creating the ISA.  Since the US doesn't recognize the ISA and the US effectively controls most of the Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans the ISA has very little authority.</p>
<p>As of right now this isn't a problem, because the technology does not exist to drill in international waters and so far the ISA's activities have been limited to authorizing a handful of deep sea surveys that went nowhere.</p>
<p>As to the Japanese company in question - they have 3 proposed drill sites, all of which are within the territorial waters of the US, Costa Rica, or Mexico.  So the answer is simple.  They have to secure permission to drill from the government that controls whatever site they eventually decide to drill at.  </p>
<p>If they were drilling on the land, they would need to comply with whatever regulations were applicable to such drilling in the country where it was being carried out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how many Teraflops (trillion calculations per second) is estimated to be required for that level of realism, but consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>By the previous trend of computing power advancement, we should see GPUs in the 300+ Tflop range by 2027. A GTX 1080 is about 9 Tflops at stock clocks, and 10.5 Tflops with widely achievable overclocks. A Titan Xp is about 14 Tflops, with realistic overclock.</li>
<li>A GTX 580 was about 1.6 Tflops and produced <a href="http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ss/gamefiles/50a6afe1cca73.jpg" target="_blank">graphics like this at high frame rate</a></li>
<li>A GTX 1080 can produce graphics <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SGcbNFJzI6Q/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> or <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PEPICv9g-d0/VX9VwfhhPCI/AAAAAAAASFA/QCzWC42UVs8/s1600/ROTTR6.tif" target="_blank">like this</a> at high frame rate</li>
<li>Do note it's difficult to show a proper comparison between different games, and with compressed screenshots. You can see massive improvements, but there's great improvements in things like realistic faces and animations too.</li>
<li>So we can at least infer that since a ~5.5x increase in processing power from a GTX 580 to GTX 1080 made a massive improvement, a ~30x increase from a GTX 1080 to its equivalent card in 2027 should be extremely substantial.</li>
<li>Game performance has also been limited by inefficiencies in the DX11, and older, graphics APIs. Vulkan and DX12 remove a lot of those inefficiencies, so games could look better even on a current GTX 1080 just by building a game more efficiently.</li>
<li>On the other hand though, we likely need to run games at a minimum resolution of 8K (7680x4320) and framerate of 90 fps in order for our brains to be convinced it's 'real enough'. This is taken from a combination of the resolution the human eye sees in, and the research by many in the VR industry, chiefly Valve, finding that 90 fps is the critical point at which your mind feels 'presence' in VR.</li>
<li>Running something a 8K is 16x harder than running at 1080p (1920x1080), at the same graphics quality and framerate. Though there are potential software 'tricks' and efficiency solutions to bring that 16x down.</li>
<li>Note that if a card ~30x faster than a GTX 1080 is not sufficient, the progress in processing power is multiplicative, so 10 years later (in 2037 now) you'd have a card which was ~900x (30x30) times faster than a GTX 1080. Assuming computing power keeps following its long-term trend. If ~900x the power of a GTX 1080 was not sufficient for completely realistic graphics, I'd be gobsmacked.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Given it looks like a tall order, but we also make relentless progress with processing power, I make the prediction we could see fully realistic graphics at high framerate by 2027-ish. And I'd be 99.99% sure it will happen before 2037.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the more static scenes in recent releases are almost indistinguishable from reality. They do amount to what's practically an architectural render, but it does serve as a proof of concept for what current hardware can handle. </p>
<p>Uncharted 4 is a great example. With some clever lighting and texture mapping,  some of the interior environments look stunningly similar to real life. Strategic / realistic placement of objects in the level design and an attention to imperfections and micro detail also trick us into perceiving a more realistic scene: <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/yZz05" target="_blank">https://www.artstation.com/artwork/yZz05</a></p>
<p>Other tech demos exist, such as the Unreal Engine 4, Paris Apartment. This sterile environment focuses almost entirely on lighting, texture quality and frame rate to produce a realistic scene. All the shadows are 'baked': <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wHjIoyEeCdo" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wHjIoyEeCdo</a></p>
<p>Of course, the challenge is much greater when rendering a dynamic scene, especially when physics are involved...</p>
<p>EDIT: Do to the fact that this thread has blown up, I think that I'll expand a little bit. Anyone who's in the game industry can feel free to correct me -- this is just a personal interest of mine.</p>
<p>In terms of physics and realism, I see several things that were major leaps forward and contributed to the realism that we see today.</p>
<p>Nvidia PhysX in games such as Mirrors Edge introduced a new generation of rudimentary soft body dynamics and fluid physics: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFio7wMTQ2k" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFio7wMTQ2k</a></p>
<p>Crysis 1, the fan favorite, was impressive for a number of reasons. Firstly, the shear number of resources in the open world added a sense of realism. After all, in real life, we're surrounded by millions of particles, plants, trees, etc. Dynamic water caustics were another impressive feat that was added later in the series, however the water in Crysis 1 was still leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. Volumetric lighting created the sun ray effects in the forests, and when you hold your gun in front of the sun. Environmental destruction both included the fun breakable palm trees, but also the completely collapsible huts, filled with physical assets. Texture mapping (parallax) gives the 3d effect that gravel, rocks and dirt have, instead of sharp polygons overlaid with stretched, 2d textures. Impressive texture quality, particle effects, shading and a number of 'fun' additions such as the water which remains on the screen after swimming, also contributed to the realism in Crysis 1. Here are just some of the effects: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2RRkCaTgZM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2RRkCaTgZM</a></p>
<p>Driveclub gives us a perfect example of how small details (the organic / natural way the water moves on the window) and scene atmosphere (lighting differential between the car and the environment, among other things) can contribute to our sense of realism: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hViwrRGfuHU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hViwrRGfuHU</a></p>
<p>Advanced geometry, high texture resolution and subsurface scattering in Star Wars Battlefront: <a href="http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/euclideon-explained/endor.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/euclideon-explained/endor.jpg</a> </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to add that aside from GPU restrictions, there's the aspect of CREATING the assets used in game (models, environments, textures, dynamic and particle simulations, realistic animation movements etc). In general, the more detailed and realistic these become, to some degree, the more man-hours are required at an exponential rate. Despite being considered simply &quot;computer generated&quot; by most of the population, it requires an incredible amount of human input and creation and an ungodly amount of finessing and detail work.</p>
<p>Hence while I see it very possible to have the technology to render very realistic games before long, I believe the true limiting factor will be the ability to produce realistic content to PUT into those render engines.</p>
<p>Just my opinion. I'm a visual effects artist and professional 3d modeller.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people talking about tech requirements when the real issue isn't pure graphical capabilities but an issue of the uncanny valley. The uncanny valley is the idea that the closer you get to truly emulating humanity the more we notice the differences, not necessarily specifics of what is wrong but you can tell something is off and get a distinct creepy feeling from it.</p>
<p>The uncanny valley is primarily an issue of movement and animation not of actual graphical capabilities, so you could 3D model/paint a still scene that looks identical (and it could probably be argued that we already have) but when things move, they simply don't look quite right.</p>
<p>People have tried to fix this by using motion capture which has been very successful for full body movements but the face is where we do just about all of our human recognition. Games like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2YitSqkvJo" target="_blank">LA Noire</a> and more recently <a href="https://youtu.be/kMaxrryH0es?t=223" target="_blank">trailers for Death Stranding</a> put a huge amount of work into facial motion capture but no matter what you do eventually people will see the differences because there is only so much motion capture you can physically do. Did you record someones face moving idly for 10 hours? well some dedicated gamers have played your game for 800 hours and have seen every single facial expression he made in that 10 hours and know exactly when it loops. Did you record someone running? well your fanbase has noticed that they start their stride in one of 18 ways every time. keeping with animation issues, are you going to motion capture grass? how many unique animations are you going to have for each patch of grass moving? how many before someone staring at your grass notices the loop?</p>
<p>since you've specified video games you have the problem of players doing whatever the hell they want and your most important goal is to stop everything from glitching out when that happens, and players will always try to do things that are not physically possible for a normal person (ever made a character repeatedly spin on their axis? people in real life can't do that)</p>
<p>So to answer your question, i'd honestly say they will never be good enough to truly never see the difference. I don't see there ever being a point where creating a true perfect visual copy of our world will be doable, much less economically viable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a breed of goat that does this, no one knows 100% why but the running theory is that they have deficiency in an ion channel. This prevents the &quot;go&quot; signal in neurones connected to muscles from reducing during times of stress. so when the animals are frightened they have constant active muscle neurones and so their muscles all contract at the same time and they seize and fall over.</p>
<p>There are other theories about their muscles not clearing calcium properly however I think there was some group studies showing a link to ion channels in the nerve cells.</p>

I imagine that the interaction between the chemical coating of the paper and the ammonia produced the blue color, but I can't tell you the exact reason for it being blue and not another color.</p>
<p>edit: Here is why they were blue:</p>
<p>In 1861, Alphonse Louis Poitevin, a French chemist, found that ferro-gallate in gum is light sensitive.[4] Light turns this to an insoluble permanent blue. A coating of this chemical on a paper or other base may be used to reproduce an image from a translucent document.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process used to make blueprints is called Cyanotype. It works using a greenish blue solution of ammonium Iron citrate and potassium ferricyanide. These 2 chemicals in solution are painted or soaked in to a surface, usually paper.</p>
<p>Next, the design to be transferred is drawn on to transparent acetate film in black. Back before printers and computers engineers used to draw these by hand. The soaked paper and acetate are placed in an exposure machine which blasts the paper with UV light, but the areas which have been drawn in block the light.</p>
<p>UV light makes the 2 compounds react. The important thing about the reaction is that it makes the parts exposed to the light harden and become insoluble in water. The parts that are covered don't react and can be washed away. </p>
<p>Long story short blueprints are blue because the cyanotype process makes <em>blue prints</em>! Simple as that. Nowadays this process is not used in the engineering world because we have fancy computers to do the work for us, but many artists still use it for a particular a e s t h e t i c.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>1 - when looking at someone you like your brain releases dopamine and dopamine also stimulates eye dilation </p>
<p>2 - people find individuals with dilated pupils to be more attractive, as it demonstrates sexual compatibility, kinda like a peacock's tail, except more low key </p>
<p>3 - pupils tend to dilate more drastically when women ovulate and this can signal fertility to the male </p>
<p>Hopefully that helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is literally almost as old as recorded history, being (to my knowledge) first asked and discussed by Plato, in his <em>Theaetetus</em>, and the answer to this day is still: we don't know.</p>
<p>The reason I refer to philosophy is not just for the sake of historical context, but because the question is necessarily two-fold: on the one hand there is the philosophical perspective, concerned with what it <em>means</em> for the brain to 'reach out' to 'bits' of information that is physically stored somewhere; on the other hand there is the (neuro)physiological perspective, which simply aims to measure what interact at what times and quantities when the brain reaches out to its information.</p>
<p>See, even if we were to identify that part A and part B of the brain are activated when we remember language, and that part X and part Y fire up when we think of imagery or emotions, then we still have no clue what it means to know these things: for example, I know my name is VehaMeursault, but when I'm eating food or doing maths, am I still 'knowing' my name, or do I not know <em>until</em> I actively think about it and retrieve that fact from wherever in my brain it is stored?</p>
<p>Also, although we can identify areas in the brain that pertain to specific types of phenomena (thinking of music light us different part of the brain than thinking of speech or maths), we still cannot perfectly map those thoughts of phenomena, because there are no dedicated particles in play. There is no 'neurone #A018' that is exclusively lit up when you think of 'Careless Whisper', or a 'neurone #X24' when you're having an orgasm. This is because (it seems that) it's not the neurone itself that stores information (like a CD or DVD would) but rather the <em>organisation</em> of neurones. </p>
<p>Think of the alphabet: no letter in itself informs you of anything much, but by organising 26 different letters we can suddenly create entire languages! Even if a language could only use 5-letter words, there would still be 12million unique words one could make with 26 letters!</p>
<p>In a similar way, the organisation of non-specific neurones seems to be what makes 'information'.</p>
<p>Finally: <em>even if we did</em> manage to map it all and to confidently say &quot;this part of the brain does that, and that part does this,&quot; then we would still be stuck at the problem of experience: <em>even if</em> your brain and my brain would light up <em>exactly</em> the same way when you and I both eat chocolate, then we would <em>still</em> not know if you and I are experiencing the same phenomena.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>The question is a tricky one to answer, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>it involves <em>experience</em> (and thus philosophy) on the one hand, and </p>
</li>
<li>because it involves mapping the brain, which consists not of <em>dedicated pieces</em> of matter, but rather of a few types of particles whose <em>organisation</em> seems to hold the key—a fact that would make it only harder because as I said with the language example: 5-letter words of 26 letters already make 12 million permutations possible, let alone hundreds of billions of neurones communicating at the speed of electricity.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't completely understood but we know some things about how it works.  We have 100 billion neurons that any one can connect to multiple others.  Any sensory input we have can make many connections.  But any single neural connection doesn't amount to anything mentally tangible and can be undone (short term memory).  Repetition makes multiple connections that basically maps out some concept in your brain.  Then, as you repeatedly traverse this mapped concept, or map whole other concepts together, the brain also processes these signals to form shortcuts for those &quot;mapped concepts&quot; with even more neural connections, so that accessing that stored information is faster.  The brain is continuously reconfiguring these connections based on the input it receives (what you are doing) so whatever is repeated most could be retrieved the fastest.  Trying to remember something is basically your brain looking for those shortcuts and if you were providing other sensory input, the reconfiguring to optimize whatever you were attentive would have used some of those neurons. Things you remember very easily, the connections were repeated enough to make so many connections that they'd never be completely undone again in your lifetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is soft like porridge, but contains several* thread-like cells called neurons. The neurons are tied together in different circuits. Scientists know that electricity flows through these neurons and can trace the flow. Scientists can also study individual neurons, but because there are so many of them, they can only study a selected few at a single point in time.</p>
<p>One part of the brain contains a special circuit, called the hippocampus. One patient once needed surgery because there was some misswiring of the neurons, which caused epilepsy. Today, this type of surgery is a rare choice of treatment, but the doctors had no better option back then in trying to relieve the patient from the suffering that his epilepsy caused. They removed the hippocampus. The consequence was that the today famous patient - Henry Molaison - could not remember things in the long-term.</p>
<p>Scientists know that the hippocampus is crucial for long-term memories, but despite decades of research, little is known about the nature of the storage of memories. One very likely explanation is the formation of very small proteins that grow on the tree-like part of the neuron - the dendrites. Memories are probably stored like small buds on a tree with many branches and each neuron in the hippocampus has multiple &quot;trees&quot; like this.</p>
<p>The many dendrites of neurons reach out to other neurons and receive electricity from them. This electricity is then passed on to a single branch of the neuron called the axon. In one part of the hippocampus there is a loop between the neurons, which probably means that there is some kind of rehearsal mechanism, as the electricity passes around the loop multiple times. This could strengthen the memories that are important to remember.</p>
<p>Although the hippocampus is very important for creating new memories, other parts of the brain are just as important in recovering stored information. The interaction between the deeply seated hippocampus and the rest of the bark-like part of the brain - the cortex - interact when processing memories, both during storing and retrieval.</p>
<p>When neurons get continuously excited in the same circuit, over and over again, the neurons become trained to give a stronger signal. The result is what we call long-term potentiation (LTP). This is one of the major ways that learning works in the brain. When retrieving memories, the strength of the connections between different neurons could determine what should be remembered. The principle behind the idea that &quot;Neurons that fire together, wire together&quot; is called Hebbian learning.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something to do with synapses + action potentials + repetition = strengthening of occurrence of action potentials + increase in number of synaptic clefts and bonding regions = increasing number of neurons relating to that memory or already established neurons have stronger connections</p>
<p>Memory is &quot;stored&quot; in these neurons and when they are not used often they become weak and recycled so you forget useless stuff, when neurons are damaged physically (ie. Blunt force, concussion) by external force, or physically by internal force (ie. Stroke brain hemorrhage, plaques related to dementia in old age) the neurons die and cannot be regenerated. </p>
<p>I don't know the exact process of the searching part but I imagine when you're searching, you're also recollecting related images, sounds, other related memories of this instance and these processes happen to fire and set off relating nearby neurons and they keep firing off others that are connected until a region is triggered that allows you to recall that desired targeted memory. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in artificial intelligence and I can give you a different perspective on how intelligent systems store memory. In AI we study the brain because it's our best natural example of intelligence. </p>
<p>Let's work through an example. Your intelligent system uses a camera to see with. It sees an apple and an orange. When the light hits the grid of optical sensors, each sensor responds differently. This response signal is then interpreted. You have to somehow get from &quot;this is a pattern of lights&quot; to &quot;this is an apple and an orange&quot;. That's where your memory comes in. Your system has some idea of what an apple is. That idea is called a model and is comprised of the different features of an apple. Apples are red or yellow, have a certain shape, taste, and feel. Your apple model accounts for the variances of size, texture, taste, etc. so you're not keeping a perfect record of every apple you've ever encountered but instead a record of the types of apples and their characteristics. The same is true for an orange. When your system assesses the image, it's not looking for an apple or an orange; it's looking for characteristics that tell them apart. If it sees red instead of orange, it can stop looking for characteristics of an orange. Once it has determined that that portion of the image contains an apple, it updates its apple model to account for the new experience. Sometimes it's a big change but most of the time no change is required. </p>
<p>Your human brain works the same way. When you think of an apple, you think of what sets it apart from everything that's not an apple. Your brain actually takes it a step farther and considers timing as a factor. You recognize dancing as a series of movements for a specific purpose usually to a beat. It's hard to formally define dancing because so many things share the characteristics of dancing (it's that way in all forms of art). One of our biggest strengths is our ability to abstract our own memories so that we can identify both an apple and an orange as fruit and then recognize other fruits without relating them to apples or oranges. </p>
<p>So in summary, you don't remember every little thing you've ever encountered but you remember what makes each type of thing unique. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
