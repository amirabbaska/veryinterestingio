		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, but it's also really tough to answer because any in-depth explanation very quickly ascends to levels of terminology that sound like technobabble. The simplest answer is that the math requires the extra dimensions to explain the interaction of the quantum (subatomic) world with the macro (atoms, molecules and larger) world, to model them and the underlying rules they follow. This is obviously the least satisfying, because it's like a parent saying &quot;because I said so&quot;.</p>
<p>To back up a bit, it's important to redefine the term dimension. We think of dimensions as basically &quot;something you can measure&quot; - length, width, height. In physics terms, they kinda are that, but kinda not. It's easier to think of them as ways of defining a specific parameter or quality of an object. Our main three dimensions define an object's size, which is easy to make sense of. It can also be a way of defining how an object moves through space. With String Theory, you're trying to explain the movement of and interactions with subatomic particles, some of which are very strange. All of these extra dimensions are not physical ones, but are said to be 'wrapped up at the subatomic level', which I think of as meaning they can't be measured with a ruler because they don't define a given space. They're not defining a physical thing, the way length, width and height do. What they do is allow subatomic particles to behave the way they do - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">tunnel through barriers they 'shouldn't' be able to</a>, or the good ol' thing where they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality" target="_blank">act like waves and particles at the same time</a>.</p>
<p>Really, rather than &quot;allow&quot; we should say &quot;explain why&quot;, but then &quot;dimensions&quot; is probably one of the most confusing terms they could have chosen for what was being described, because it relies on a definition of the term is that isn't the way most people think about it.** If a subatomic particle tunnels through a barrier that it shouldn't be able to, but you recognize that there is an additional parameter that applies to both the particle and the barrier - say, they only exist 99.999999% of the time in our universe, but pop out to a higher plane of existence than the physical (for the record, this is an extreme example made to illustrate the point, not what particles necessarily do), then you can say they have a measure of 99.999999 in the 'existence' dimension (again, made up for the explanation). If you combine these two numbers, you get the one-in-a-trillion chance of a particle 'tunneling' through the barrier.</p>
<p>It's also necessary to point out that ten dimensions is just the number that the kaluza-Klein Theory suggested (initially five, later ten). I've seen theories that extend to thirty dimensions.</p>
<p>For the record, I don't believe that String Theory is what it purports to be. I am only a failed physicist, and the people who are working on it are <em>far</em> smarter than I am, so if there is an empirical right and wrong on the issue, you'd be better off betting on them to be right. I come to explain String Theory, not defend it. String Theory fails to simplify the discussion, though, which is what the entire search for the Grand Unified Theory is supposed to be. Ultimately, the answer to the Universe - if we can ever discover it - will never be something you can adequately ELI5. I don't think it will rely on purely mathematical constructs for its explanation, and I think it is the purest of hubris to think that we can go from discovering atoms and nuclear forces to unlocking their underlying principles in (on the scale of the universe) a fraction of a blink of an eye.</p>
<hr />
<p>**Kinda like a scientific theory and a 'real world' theory - same underlying concept defining both terms, but they become very different things within their specific contexts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One very short and unsatisfying ELI5 answer is that if the number of dimensions is anything else, then certain undesirable infinities show up in the theory. Therefore the assumption of extra dimensions is made in order to avoid these bad things from happening. (The harder ELI5 is to explain why this assumption of extra dimensions is much more reasonable than a layperson would assume.)</p>
<p>By the way, just to clarify a point: The number of dimensions depends on certain specifics of the theory. Bosonic string theory requires 26, superstring theory requires 10, and M-theory requires 11. Superstring theory is what most people mean when they simply refer to &quot;string theory,&quot; since bosonic string theory is not realistic. However, superstring theory comes in various flavors, all of which are unified in some sense by M-theory. When we say that superstring theory has 10 dimenions, we mean 1 time dimension and 9 space dimensions, 3 of which are the ones we perceive and 6 of which are tiny, &quot;compactified&quot; spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>Important caveat: I am not even remotely a string theorist. </p>
<p>Edit: Maybe &quot;undesirable infinities&quot; is not the right phrase to use (though I suppose one can probably get away with calling it that). It's more like you need a particular undesirable term that shows up to be zero in order to have the required symmetry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a physicist, but I once asked a physicist to explain to me this very thing. Below is a reformulation of what he told me:</p>
<p>What does it mean that there are more than 3 spatial dimensions, and what does it mean that they are &quot;curled up very small&quot;?</p>
<p>Imagine you're a billiard ball, living on the surface of table where the cover is on. Above you, just barely touching you, is the bottom of the cover. Below you is the felt. You and I know your world is 3D, but you perceive it as 2D, forward/backward and left/right. You and I know that the felt is not evenly compressible, so when a billiard rolls over it in a straight line, the balls moves ever so slightly up and down. This up and down motion though, is too small for you in billiard-ball-world to observe. You don't ever think about this though, because your 2D physics completely explains all interactions between other billiard balls that you observe.</p>
<p>Now let's take it one step further. Imagine you're a billiard ball physicist. Just as before, your 2D physics completely explains all the interactions between billiard balls you observe. Your &quot;bouncing-off-bumpers&quot; theories explain how balls change angle and slow down when they hit a bumper, and your &quot;just-slowing-down&quot; theories explain how balls are always slowing down a little bit, even when they don't hit a bumper. You can very accurately predict where a ball will go by putting these two theories together. Many of your billiard ball colleagues are unsatisfied with this situation though. Both of these theories involve billiard balls slowing down, but the theories themselves are separate. One day, a billiard ball physicist colleague comes to you with a crazy idea. This colleague says that they can unify the two theories of billiard ball movement if you imagine that a ball slowing down results from that ball losing energy to the surface that it's directing a force against. However, this unified theory requires that there is a force pressing balls <em>down</em> against the felt. Down is not a direction that exists! The theory only works if there is a <em>third dimension</em>.</p>
<p>You and I know your world is 3D and has the dimension up and down, but you, as a billiard ball physicist, cannot perceive this dimension. The hypothetical existence of this dimension though, allows for a theory of billiard ball physics that is simpler, more general, more elegant, and thus more appealing than the two separated theories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few &quot;like you're 5&quot; answers available on this topic. I'll take my best swing.</p>
<p>forget what you know about dimensions and think of a video game being played by a kid holding a controller. </p>
<p>The character in the video game can move in all of the spatial dimensions it exists in, like us. Forward, back, side to side, up and down.</p>
<p>So the kid finds a menu option called &quot;timeline&quot; and presses it. Now the kid sees a panorama of events that his character has experienced throughout the game. The difference between the player and the character is that the character has to experience the whole timeline event by event, while the player can see the timeline as a single object.</p>
<p>Now you've moved up a dimension. We've collapsed direction, position, and time into an object that you can hold in your hands and manipulate. If you were able to hold a timeline in your hands like an object, you could change it and affect it like any other object you can interact with. </p>
<p>Being able to interact with an entire 3 dimensional timeline as if it were an object would make the kid playing the game 4 dimensional. </p>
<p>It gets weird when you start to consider that the entire environment that the kid playing the game exists in, must also be made up of existential versions of the ideas of existence similarly to how the character's three dimensional lifespan is simply an object in a fourth dimension.</p>
<p>It is much easier to explain a timeline as a chain of events rather than to try and tell someone that every event in their life exists as a single object in a higher dimension. </p>
<p>This is where math comes in. Mathematics and moreover physics deal with the footprints of these intangible creatures rather than the beasts themselves. And with our current understandings in mathematics, we see footprints which actually call for up to 11 dimensions. (including m-theory, there are 7, 10, or 11 expected dimensions). So it isn't so much that we've seen these 10-dimensional beasts making the footprints, it's more that we've seen footprints that must have been made by a 10-dimensional beast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically, it has to do with group theory, more specifically representation theory of Lie groups. These things are tough to explain to someone without a background in these things, so I'll keep this short and not super precise:</p>
<p>Symmetries are of fundamental relevance in physics for numbers of reasons. This goes so far that you can basically define a symmetry and some other stuff and determine all the physics of the system from that. Large parts of the standard model of particle physics were found this way. Mathemetically, these symmetries are expressed in groups.</p>
<p>Now if we want to create a new, more general theory from our old ones it needs to reproduce all the symmetries the old theory has. So mathematically we are looking for dimensions where there are relatively simple (read: small) symmetry groups that contain all the symmetries we know. It so happens that 10 is the smallest dimension where there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#Terminology_in_physics" target="_blank">Majorana-Weyl spinor</a> which is a good candidate for a number of reasons. Most common string theories use this or related symmetry transformations.</p>
<p>String theories are then sort of constructed such that they have the imposed symmetry. So you start with 10 dimensions because your symmetries are nice there, and build the string theory around it - not the other way round.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Experts aren't really sure, but what happens with ALS is that the neurons that control your movements begin to weaken, and thus you gradually lose the ability to control your muscles.  Typically someone with ALS succumbs to the disease when they lose the ability to breathe or swallow.<br />
In Hawking's case, he has retained the ability to breathe and drink... and with some very attentive care to make sure he doesn't get bedsores from his immobility, this is what has kept him alive.<br />
I'm sure that [retaining the ability to communicate] (<a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-computer.html" target="_blank">http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-computer.html</a>) helps his prognosis from a mental health standpoint, as he controls his speech computer by moving a muscle in his cheek.  To me that is more fascinating than his ability to fight the onset of his ALS.  If that muscle movement were to go... it would be a sad day for all of mankind, as his contributions to the world of physics are nothing short of remarkable.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, an important thing to be noted is you are probably flexing a muscle called the tensor tympani. It is a tiny muscle in your ear that holds onto the bones in your ear which conduct sound. The ear drum kind of works like a hammer beating on a drum and the tensor tympani muscle is like attaching a string to the hammer, which only allows it to hit the drum so hard. The entire purpose of this muscle is to tense up before loud sounds in order to protect the inner workings of your ear. </p>
<p>When you stretch in the morning, this inadvertently tenses this muscle, which you can &quot;hear&quot; as a woosh, or it may just be quieting all other outside sounds. This muscle is usually under involuntary control, however some people can also do it voluntarily. Just like blinking is automatic, but you can also do it if you think about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>However, the noise we make when sneezing is entirely social. We mimic what other peoples sneezes sound like, or at least what we think it should sound like. More than likely if your parents yell loudly when sneezing, you probably do too. </p>
<p>So what sound does a deaf person make when sneezing? Nothing. They don't make a sound. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's certainly a combination of variables. </p>
<p>Social circumstances can affect how obnoxious we are willing to be with our sneezing, or coughing. Either trying to be obnoxious or trying to be stealthier and more controlled.</p>
<p>Then there's the threshold or subjective sensations your body feels when it wants to sneeze. We all feel subjective amounts of tickling on our bodies, the same is true of what our nose can take before it has to release itself. Stuffy nose, runny nose, foreign particles caught in nose hairs, etc. All affect what has to be discharged and how aggressively. </p>
<p>I have read that muting sneezes is bad for you because it's very easy to rupture blood vessels, especially in your eyes. Definitely not a good idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's partly due to biology, like the volume in one's lungs, one's nasal cavity, how strongly one experiences the itchy feeling of a sneeze, etc... but more than any other thing, how you sneeze is due to social conditioning.</p>
<p>If you were conditioned to minimize your sneezes into the most timid, silent things as a kid, then that's probably how you are as an adult. If you thought it was cute to do a little hiccup giggle thing as you cover your face and flutter your eyes, or manly to roar and blink furiously, or <whatever> to sneeze a certain way as a kid, then you probably sneeze that way as an adult. And that makes up the biggest difference for why some people sneeze violently and others seem hardly effected by a sneeze.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your lips lacks sebaceous glands, which means unlike most of your skin it can't keep itself lubricated with natural oils.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> Sebaceous glands are the little oil producing 'pouches' that are at the base of each individual hair inside the hair follicle. The oil comes out of your pores and is there to keep your hair and skin lubricated, conditioned, pliable, and healthy. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong> Several folks have brought up fordyce spots. These <em>are</em> a sort of sebaceous gland associated with the lips, but they're only along the edge of the lips, or what is known as the &quot;vermilion border&quot; (these harmless spots are also found on the penis, scrotum, and labia). I am not a doctor but it doesn't seem like they're <em>as</em> well equipped to keep lips from chapping in many conditions, and the enzymes from our own saliva can override any benefit they may try to contribute if you lick your lips too much. The rest of the lips are high and dry, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong> Some fellas with beards have mentioned not having as much trouble with chapped lips since growing said beard. I'd never even considered this until now (girl here, can't beard) but I would believe that the oils from your beard would make it to your lips and keep them moisturized and happy. </p>
<p>Good discussion, everyone! And thanks for keeping me fact-checking. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The external covering of your lips is essentially a thin layer of skin. Like all skin, it can get dry. Poor hydration, sun exposure, and cold weather can all dry out and irritate your skin, lips included. When you lick your lips, you're rubbing your tongue over that skin and wearing it down through contact and saliva. Do that repeatedly, and your lips will dry out even more since saliva is not moisturizing, but rather is full of enzymes meant to break down food. Stay hydrated and keep chapstick on hand to prevent chapped lips and stay comfortable! :)</p>
<p>EDIT: I realize I made it sound as if saliva can break down skin. It can't. My point was more to note that saliva's purpose is not skin moisturization, but something else entirely. When you lick your lips, you make them wet, but it evaporates quickly. Through evaporation, even more moisture is pulled out of your lips. Don't lick your lips!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As has been noted, licking your lips exacerbates the problem, while a good lip balm helps a great deal. What has not been noted yet, that I have seen, is that a diet high in omega-3 containing fish, or omega 3/fish oil supplements seem to help a noticeably when taken in sufficient quantity - at least 1200mg per day. </p>
<p>I have always had a problem with chapped lips during the winter, but over the past year, I've been very regular in using omega 3 supplements, and my lips have, thus far, done wonderfully during this winter season. Gone from using lip balm 2-3x a day in past winters to less than once a week this winter. Worth a try and tons of other health benefits too! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your lips is thin and sensitive. It prone to drying out when you're dehydrated or when it's licked. The reason licking your lips causes chapping is because your saliva contains digestive enzymes that are designed to break down food and the acidity of saliva can really dry out your lips over time (I chronically lip my lips and I always have dry lips!).</p>
<p>The best way to make sure your lips aren't dry is by drinking plenty of water, moisturizing them, either with a lip balm or something like coconut oil, and stop licking them!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> You well-researched bitches making me look dumb, STOP IT! I now understand that saliva isn't acidic! I just assumed it was because of the digestive enzymes, I made the assumption it was acidic.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/26/140753048/kids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological" target="_blank">Article worth reading about this</a></p>
<p>Scientific evidence shows that children not only have a stronger preference for sugar than adults – but that sweet-tooth is hardwired from Day One.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the newborn can detect sweet and will actually prefer sweeter solutions to less sweet ones. The basic biology of the child is that they don't have to learn to like sweet or salt. It's there from before birth,&quot; explains Julie Mennella of the Monell Chemical Senses Center.</p>
<p>Unlike adults, who often find overly sugary things unpleasant, Mennella says kids are actually living in different sensory worlds than adults when it comes to basic tastes.</p>
<p>&quot;They prefer much more intense sweetness and saltiness than the adult, and it doesn't decrease until late adolescence. And we have some evidence they may be more sensitive to bitter taste,&quot; Mennella says.</p>
<p>A reason for this may be that a preference for sweet, caloric substances during rapid growth may have given children as an evolutionary advantage when calories were scarce. That notion is supported by the fact that sugar doesn't just taste good to children -– it actually makes them feel good, too.</p>
<p>Mennella's research has shown that sugar is a natural pain reliever in children, and many hospitals even put a sweet-tasting liquid in a baby's mouth during circumcisions or heel stick procedures to help lessen the pain.</p>
<p>When researchers gave adults and children water mixed with various amounts of sugar, adults preferred sugar concentrations similar to that of a can of soda, while finding higher concentrations too sweet. By comparison, children preferred at least twice that concentration, and younger children had virtually no limit.</p>
<p>&quot;You can keep putting sugar in to the point where you can't dissolve it in the water anymore and they still like it,&quot; says Sue Coldwell, a researcher at the University of Washington who has studied kids and sweets.</p>
<p>But there seems to be an age limit on the super-sized sugar preference.</p>
<p>Coldwell and her colleagues suspected that sugar preferences changed during adolescence. They checked a bunch of indicators, like body image and hormones, and then they checked bone growth. They gave the sugar-water test to adolescents while simultaneously measuring a marker of bone growth in their urine. What they found was that kids who were still growing preferred sweets. Those whose growth had already stopped –- around age 15 or 16 — had taste preferences similar to adults.</p>
<p>Exactly how this all works is still somewhat of a mystery, but Coldwell says that one important clue lies in the discovery that growing bones actually secrete hormones that can influence metabolism. Other well-known metabolic hormones like leptin and insulin have been shown to act on brain areas that control cravings and appetites, and even directly bind to the tongue, where they affect the preference for sweet tastes. Coldwell suspects that hormones from growing bones may be doing the same thing. In other words, it's not your kid's fault he raided the cookie jar – the hormones from his growing bones made him do it.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know for sure, but I am very suspicious that the bones are somehow telling either the brain or the tongue that there is energy needed for their growth and signaling for that preference to increase,&quot; says Coldwell.</p>
<p>That's not to say a kid can't overdo it. In a modern world of calorie overload and childhood obesity, cravings for sugar are no longer the evolutionary advantage they once might have once been. But if the goal is to get children to reduce their intake of sugar, researchers say understanding the biology behind their cravings is the first step.</p>
<p>TL:DR - They think we're genetically programmed to want sugar and that our intense childhood craving for sugar stops when our bones are finished growing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are some sickeningly sweet artificial candies I don't like, but I'm a 2.5 spoons of sugar in my coffee kind of guy. It frankly <em>baffles</em> my mind that people not only drink but <em>choose</em> to drink dry red wines and pay a lot of money for the privilege. Same with most beers, which are bitter and utterly irredeemable to me.</p>
<p>I once went to a wine tasting with several friends my age, and we all got flights of red wines. There was one that all of them were cooing on about how good it was, whereas to me it tasted just as bitter and tongue-numbing as the other reds. I honest-to-God thought they were fucking with me.  One of those same friends frequently can't stand sweet drinks I like, such as a vanilla cream soda or similar.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few theories. One is that children have less developed palates. Adults are able to appreciate the subtle and savory flavors of bitter foods. Kids dislike them because they can't taste the entire flavor profile, opting for simpler sweet foods. For adults, those sweet foods are overwhelming because they lack subtly. Another theory is that children crave sweets more because the body craves sugar when it's younger, at the point in development when humans need loads of diverse sugars.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In nature the most common sweet foods are fruits, which evolved to be sweet so animals eat them and spread seeds. Most bitter flavors in our food are produced by alkaloids, many of which are poisonous.  Therefore sweet foods are generally safer than bitter foods, because plants don't want to poison the animals that help them propagate.  Since children are smaller than adults and therefore can be poisoned more easily it makes sense for them to avoid bitter foods and be drawn to sweeter and therefore safer foods chemically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine clay, the prevalent soil type in that area, is incredibly fertile. Initially it is indeed salty and can only be used as meadows, but over the years rainfalls flushes the salt out and the land can be used to grow crops.</p>
<p>The quality of soil depends on the size of the particles that form the soil. Loosely speaking, smaller is better (actually medium size is best) and clay is small (still very good). Smaller grain size allows for more nutrients and water to be stored and available for plants. Also being below level has quite a few advantages as it guarantees that there's always sufficient water available. Wheat for instance is affected quite badly if there's a lack of water in certain critical stages of its life cycle.</p>
<p>This is especially obvious when compared to the land prevalent in the rest of the Netherlands which is mostly Geest. The term Geest is derived from Low Saxon and means <em>dry</em> or <em>empty</em> (devoid of plant life) and is <em>much</em> less fertile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thing that several of the other comments are missing is that most land that is now below sealevel was not actually reclaimed from the sea.</p>
<p>These have been swamplands or rather peat bogs for centuries. They would have been around sea level or above and protected by rows of dunes. Floods would have still happened, but that resulted in the deposit of marine or river clay.</p>
<p>In later stages the inhabatants started using these fertile lands for agriculture by draining off water. This resulted in the ground sinking &quot;inklinking&quot; by as many as 3 meters.</p>
<p>That gradually icreased the risk of floods, prompting to people to surround the land by dykes. These are most of the &quot;polders&quot; you see today.</p>
<p>Yet another type of polder - the &quot;droogmakerij&quot; - was land reclaimed from lakes or even later the sea. This started off by building dykes and a surrounding canal. Next the lake was pumped dry by using windmills or steam pumps. Next up were smaller canals inside the droogmakerij to maintain the water level. Schiphol airport is inside a droogmakerij and they are characterized by a square and larger scale layout of infrastructure.</p>
<p>These lakes were mostly man-made. After initially cultivating the land, the dried up peat &quot;turf&quot; proved to be a good fuel. So much of the soil was dug up that large lakes emerged, sometimes threatening or even swallowing villages.</p>
<p>If you fly over Holland you will still see several of these lakes and for some the &quot;ribs&quot; where the peat was dug out and dried can still be seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you go to the NL, try to get to the <a href="http://www.nieuwlanderfgoed.nl/english" target="_blank">Nieuw Land Study Centre and Museum</a>. It looks particularly at the largest project, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee" target="_blank">Zuiderzee reclamation project</a>. They have a wonderful exhibit on this, and it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee_Works" target="_blank">a very long process</a> running from 1919 through 1986 with the polder recovery starting in 30s after the closure of the Zuiderzee. Note that the area was effectively a sea being fed by freshwater from various rivers, opening out in the North Sea. Once enclosed, the freshwater would start to displace the salt water. The sea-bed was sediment/clay. Much of it, the former soil of the surrounding that had been flushed down over the years.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enclose the recovered land</li>
<li>Drain it of sea water</li>
<li>Install drainage canals and pipes - the salt at this point is being slowly washed away by the freshwater, both from the rivers and the rain.</li>
<li>Aerial sowing of reeds (tolerates the salty soil, further evaporates the water, reduces weed growth and conditions the land)</li>
<li>Burning of the reeds, ploughing (with some very serious equipment) and planting of rapeseed</li>
<li>Cycle through various grains, wheat, barley and then oats to further condition the soil</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have good arable land. You just need a lot of time and serious commitment. Now as someone else notes, the land is designed to be &quot;sacrificial&quot; in case of flooding. Roads and settlements are placed on slightly raised areas  so the farm land can be flooded to the depth of a metre or two without destroying roads and homes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obligatorily, pi is not infinite. In fact, it is between 3 and 4 and so it is definitely finite. </p>
<p>But, the decimal expansion of pi is infinitely long. Another number with an infinitely long decimal expansion is 1/3=0.33333... and 1/7=0.142857142857142857..., so it's not a particularly rare property. In fact, the only numbers that have a decimal expansion that ends are fractions whose denominator looks like 2^(n)5^(m), like 7/25=0.28 (25=2^(0)5^(2)) or 9/50 = 0.18 (50=2^(1)5^(2)) etc. So it's a pretty rare thing for a number to <em>not</em> have an infinitely long expansion since only this very small selection of numbers satisfies this criteria.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the decimal expansion for pi is infinitely long and doesn't end up eventually repeating the same pattern over and over again. For instance, 1/7 repeats 142857 endlessly, and 5/28=0.17857142857142857142857142..., which starts off with a 17 but eventually just repeats 857142 endlessly. Even 7/25=0.2800000000... eventually repeats 0 forever. There is no finite pattern that pi eventually repeats endlessly. We know this because the only numbers that eventually repeat a patter are rational numbers, which are fractions of the form A/B where A and B are integers. Though, the important thing about rational numbers is that they are fractions of two integers, not necessarily that their decimal expansion eventually repeats itself, <a href="http://www.skidmore.edu/~adean/MC2151401/Handouts/RationalRepeatingDecimals.pdf" target="_blank">you must <em>prove</em> that a number is rational if and only if its decimal expansion eventually repeats itself</a>.</p>
<p>Numbers that are not rational are called irrational. So a number is irrational if and only if its decimal expansion doesn't eventually repeat itself. This isn't a great way to figure out  if a number is rational or not, though, because we will always only be able to compute finitely many decimal places and so there's always a chance that we just haven't gotten to the part where it eventually repeats. On the other hand, it's not a very good way to check if a number is rational, since even though it may seem to repeat the same pattern over and over, there's no guarantee that it will continue to repeat it past where we can compute.</p>
<p>So, as you noted, we can't compute pi to know that it has this property, we'd never know anything about it if we did that. We must <em>prove</em> it with rigorous math. And there is a relatively <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1947-53-06/S0002-9904-1947-08821-2/S0002-9904-1947-08821-2.pdf" target="_blank">simple proof</a> of it that just requires a bit of calculus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's full of some pretty interesting lay stuff (which is why I enjoyed it) and typical of the genre of books that address key mathematical entities, like pi, e and infinity. David Foster Wallace wrote a short book on infinity, &quot;Everything and More&quot;, which is also a fun read and a good tour of relevant concepts.  Math, logic, philosophy are so tightly bound that it's always a reliable source of mystery to me to ponder math concepts... a peculiar form of engineering meditation, as it were.  It helps actually to have an appreciation of these things as they inform a lot of what makes humans human... our observation, invention, visualization, and creativity, expression and communication.  It's also humbling to know that some truths are so basic that they are still taught with examples and proofs that date from thousands of years ago and which were divined by people without the benefits of zero, positional notation, graphical representations (i.e., like the graph of a function, not a drawing of a triangle), etc.   The same brains as ours, working the same problems, 3000 years ago.   Euclid's Elements were the foundational textbooks of geometry and proof until well into the 1900's in classrooms worldwide.   Kind of amazing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
