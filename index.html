		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals mostly lose their regenerative capabilities once their reproductive success rate is significantly dropped. This is because, there is very little selective pressure on genes required for longevity and tissue regeneration after an animal can no longer reproduce and pass on genes. In other words, you might have a perfect set of genes that allow tissue generation and longevity but if those genes cannot grant you reproductive successes, they won't be selected.</p>
<p>Unlike animals trees do not become less successful in reproduction with age. Actually an older tree is larger and can produce far more offspring. So genes required  for tissue regeneration and longevity are selected for those. This is why many trees can live for thousands of years. Yet again mutation accumulate on DNA with time. This eventually wears them down. As a result they are not immortal. But evolution granted them with very long lifespans.</p>
<p>Edit1;According to the comments I wanted to point out that reproductive success does not only depend on the fertility or the ability to find and compete for mates, it is very strongly correlated to general survivability. For instance life span of rats in wild is about 1 year, as a pet rats can live up to 2-3 years and they are fertile and capable of reproducing during that period. Rats in wild have so short lifespans because they have many predators. So a rat is not likely to live much more than a year in wild due to predation even if it's genes would grant it 10 years lifespan. Since rats rarely live beyond a year in wild, they can only reproduce during that period. As a result, only the genes essential for survivability for the first few years are selected by evolution. Now even when we keep rats as pets, they can only go for 2-3 years at max because they lack the mechanisms that allow longevity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kellyanne Conway is a counselor to the president, who recently in a speech mentioned an event called the bowling green massacre as evidence for the need for more strict immigration rules.</p>
<p>However, there was no such massacre. What <em>actually</em> happened is that in Bowling Green, Kentucky, an FBI agent posing as an Al Qaeda member approached two Iraqi refugees, asking if the two wanted to help him obtain and ship weapons to the extremists back in Iraq. The two men agreed, and obtained weapons illegally, at which point the FBI revealed itself. The two were arrested and the incident prompted a six-month rescreening of all incoming Iraqi refugees. However, it's important to note that at no point was there even a plan or effort to attack US citizens with the weapons, just ship them.</p>
<p>Upon further digging, it's become apparent that Kellyanne Conway has on two other ocassions also referred to this nonexistent massacre, causing people to suspect it was no slip of the tongue but an intentional false presentation of events in order to generate support for President Trump's immigration ban. This is also the same woman who gave us the &quot;altnerative facts&quot; quip, so a lot of the media already considered her a joke. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Conway cited the &quot;massacre&quot; as justification for a travel and immigration ban from seven Muslim-majority countries enacted by United States President Donald Trump. However, no such massacre ever occurred. The next day she said she had misspoken and had actually been talking about the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on terrorism charges.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never happened. Kellyanne Conway, in her zeal to defend the travel ban and &quot;Muslim ban&quot;, said that legislation like this was necessary to prevent another &quot;Bowling Green Massacre&quot;. She's since tried to walk back this claim, stating that she misspoke and meant to say &quot;terrorists&quot;... but it's highly unlikely it was unintentional or just a mere slip of the tongue when you consider this is the same woman who brought us &quot;alternate facts&quot;. She's also made this same claim on at least 2 other occasions, and the word terrorists wouldn't have fit the context of the sentence she was using at the time in this instance. (As far back as 2011, she said in an interview about Obama:  “He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away.” She's also made similar statements on at least 2 other occasions, and has referred more than once to &quot;innocent soldiers&quot; in Bowling Green, KY being killed by terrorists.) </p>
<p>What actually happened was that two potential terrorists (mind you, they had not yet committed any acts of terror on US soil, but they did claim responsibility for attacks on US soldiers in Iraq and were attempting to send money and weapons to Iraq for what we can only presume are the same purposes (attacking US soldiers in Iraq). However, that does not serve to bolster her argument because the ban was purportedly intended to prevent <em>domestic</em> terrorism...so she offered an &quot;alternate facts&quot; version. Which is to say, she lied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Maybe play, especially with smaller dolphins and porpoise. they also swim more efficiently as they jump out of the water, because air has less resistance than water. You often see this when they swim along side boats.</p>
<p>Maybe part of their communication with members of their pod. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's so wide spread, it's probably playfulness, as much as anything. It's stimulating to see outside of the water.</p>
<p>Consider, that most behaviors are least energy. It takes a LOT of energy to jump out of the water. Some feel that flying fish do it to escape predators, but it's still very, very energy costly.</p>
<p>So, the reason is stimulation, very likely. See the world from a new view, literally. The whale breaching, esp. the humpback, makes a HUGE noise, as tons of mass hit the water. It's likely communication in that case, too. But there would be several reasons for it, but getting rid of skin parasites, is simply silly. Scratching up against subsurface rocks would be LOTS more efficient,right? And we've all seen animals doing that, OK?</p>
<p>So, it's stimulation, communication, escaping predators, and just plain ludic behaviors.</p>
<p>They could even be using visible coastal landmarks to figure out where they are for migrating....</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

As for leaping fish like salmon it's to gain advancements up stream, other aquatic animals have ranges of theories depending on the species you're talking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good responses here, but there is one important factor I haven't seen addressed.</p>
<p>Input lag is greater at lower framerates. When you press a button on your input method of choice, the time it takes for the display to reflect that input is determined almost entirely by how long the interval between frames it, because it's usually the slowest thing going on in the computer. At 60FPS, input lag is around 16ms, at 24FPS, input lag jumps to about 42ms, which is definitely noticeable. Your eyes can't detect things changing that fast, but your brain can easily measure the time between your finger moving and the screen updating down to the low tens of milliseconds. It makes you feel like you're moving through water, the lag feels like resistance, and that's annoying as fuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About half due to motion blur, the other half because we've been conditioned since birth to regard 24fps as the natural look for media.  Higher framerates <em>are</em> superior for media - Peter Jackson and James Cameron know this - but it's going to be a long time before general audiences embrace them.</p>
<p>Two experiments to try:</p>
<p>1: Next time you're watching a movie at a genuine 24fps (in a theater or on a TV that is displaying a multiple of said), watch for scenes where the motion is faster than normal, such as fast pans or action.  The limitations of such a low framerate start to stand out as the judder becomes hard to ignore.</p>
<p>2: Play Doom while artificially limiting the framerate to 24.  Doom has the best motion blur ever achieved in a video game, so that is a non-issue.  It should look decidedly cinematic.  (Actually just check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOnVCtwouc" target="_blank">this video</a>.)  Just more evidence that 24fps sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A whole slew of reasons. </p>
<p>1) Movies rarely move the camera. The camera is a fixed point and the actors move. Computer games you are moving the camera. People go to great lengths to plan out how this is going to work. The bullet time for the matrix was conceptualised as a camera on a rocket sled, but in reality was a few hundred still cameras on precise timers. </p>
<p>2) Fixed frame rate. The frame rate on movies is low, but rock steady. Calculations in games are run based on how long the last frame took to render. When frame rate varies those calculations go astray very quickly, especially when physics is involved. </p>
<p>3) Perfect motion blur. Thanks to the fixed frame rate every frame of film is perfectly motion blurred and naturally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Music actually has a funny way of entering the brain, in that it causes most parts of the brain to activate. Because it hits almost every fundamental part of the brain, the neuroplasticity of the cells enable a sort of imprint of the music into our processing. The music becomes part of a fundamental reward pathway of what's pleasant equating to what is good for survival. What's really interesting about this is, because music is one of the most fundamental 'keys' to accessing memory - those with dementia and degenerative mental disorders can actually be treated using music from their childhood. The first places to be hit by music, are also the last to go.</p>

<p>Identity is a major reason. People choose certain music to represent them, to show they can relate to certain other groups of people. </p>
<p>If you go to a country music festival, there's gonna be a lot of people who either do relate or would like to relate to the experience of living in the country or a small town. If you want to appear fearsome, or have a lot of pent up negativity, you might go for music that sounds violent (e.g. metal) or tortured (Nine Inch Nails) or dominating (Gangsta Rap). If you want to fit in, well, there's pop music!</p>
<p>There's also more practical reasons.</p>
<p>If your a professor, you better like something erudite and critically acclaimed like classical, experimental music, jazz, or something obscure but lauded like traditional Indian music (assuming your white).</p>
<p>People listen to happy and sad music for the same reason fundamentally, to feel better. You go for happy if that's your current state and your afraid something will upset it. Sad if you're feeling crappy and want to extinguish the bad emotions. </p>
<p>For most though, fitting in is the most important part. Most people do not especially care for music as art, the same way most people don't have a favorite style of painting or poetry. For them the social aspect of music is above the music itself, which is OK.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There are some problems with it, but the 'spots on a balloon' metaphor is pretty good... the galaxies are moving away from the Big Bang, but space itself is expanding too.</p>
<p>(This has some interesting repercussions.

<p>It's space itself that expand. So the further two object are from each other, the faster they will go away from each other. </p>
<p>So let take two object. The earth and a galaxy. This galaxy is 10 billions years away from us. So in theory a photon will take 10 billions years to reach us. But in practice that's not the case. Space will continue to expand between us so the actual distance that photon will have to travel is actually bigger than the 10 billions years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers thus far have missed a critical element to the real answer to your question: space is <em>accelerating</em> in its expansion. The explanation /u/BennyPendentes gave is correct: space is expanding and has been since the Big Bang. However, the speed with which space has been expanding has not remained constant since the BB. About 2.5 billion years ago, the expansion started to accelerate. This acceleration was first measured accurately by the High Z Supernova Project in the mid 1990s (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe" target="_blank">wiki</a> for details) and was a complete surprise (that's why folks got Nobel Prizes for it).</p>
<p>This acceleration also affects the age of the universe, but in the opposite way. If we use Hubble's law (which assumes a constant expansion rate), then you get an age of the universe of about 14.5 billion years. Including the accelerated expansion, you get the 13.8 Gyrs that is usually quoted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>&quot;There are two entirely different kinds of &quot;minute&quot; or &quot;second&quot;, and
you have to be careful not to confuse them.  In each case, they are
1/60 of some larger unit.  When we measure time, we divide each HOUR
into 60 equal parts called &quot;minutes&quot;, and each minute into 60 equal
&quot;seconds&quot;.  We also do the same thing when we measure angles, so that
each DEGREE is divided into 60 minutes, and each minute OF ANGLE is
divided into 60 seconds.  The units are different; an hour is not the
same as a degree in any sense, and their relationship has nothing to
do with the angle corresponding to a minute on a clock, or in the
earth's rotation.</p>
<p>Here's what happened.  The ancient Babylonians liked the number 60,
and in fact based their number system on it almost the way we base
ours on 10.  So any unit would be divided naturally into 60 equal
parts.  That worked well for various reasons, so early astronomers
used that scheme to measure angles, dividing a circle into 360 parts
(6 times 60), and then dividing each of those parts into 60 minutes,
and then into 60 seconds.  The word &quot;minute&quot; just meant &quot;little
part&quot;, and &quot;second&quot; meant &quot;second division into little parts&quot;!</p>
<p>At some point people started wanting to divide time into smaller parts
too; in ancient times it was hard enough to measure hours, but once
mechanical clocks were invented it became possible to divide hours up.<br />
How many units should there be in each hour?  They might have used 12,
as they had long before divided the day and the night each into 12
parts; but someone felt that 60 parts would be nice (probably an
astronomer!).  So they needed a name for 1/60 of an hour, and since
&quot;minute&quot; already meant &quot;1/60 of something&quot;, they called it a minute.<br />
They probably never considered the confusion it would cause when
someone looked at a clock and asked how far the hand had moved.  If I
say it moved 30 minutes, do I mean 30/60 of an hour on the dial, or
30/60 of a degree of angle?  That's unfortunate; but if you remember
that the size of a degree has nothing to do with the length of an
hour, and that the two kinds of minutes are just 1/60 of an hour or a
degree respectively, then you can see that they just aren't related.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people mention the Sumerians, but they definitely didn't have hours, minutes, and seconds to measure time.</p>
<p>Rather, the answer lies with the Greeks.  In Egypt.  Because Egypt was Greek at one point.  Specifically, the famous 4th century CE astronomer Ptolemy, whose wildly incorrect views of the universe were the basis of modern science until basically Galileo.  In his time, we didn't have decimals.  I mean, we didn't even have <em>digits</em> yet; those came from India a few centuries later.  So we used fractions, and thanks in part to the astronomical traditions inherited from the Babylonians, the common method of approximating numbers was with fractions in base 60.  You had some whole number of a quantity, then some number of minute divisions, and some number of <em>second</em> divisions, <em>third</em> divisions, etc., each of them 1/60 of the previous one.  So degrees were divided into minutes (1/60th of a degree), seconds (1/60th of a minute), thirds (1/60th of a second), and so forth, and that's how Ptolemy did his astronomical calculations in the Almagest.  Since his book was so influential, it's what people continued to use, in Arabia and then Europe, for centuries until Ptolemy's geocentric view was replaced by actual orbital mechanics around the Sun.  Meanwhile, a system of describing time needed to be precise as well for these calculations.  They didn't have <em>clocks</em>.  They had divided the day and the night into 12 hours each, and these were standardized as being all the same length so there'd be 24 equal hours in a day (this was an Egyptian thing too), but there were no clocks so it's not like you could see what time it was.  But the numbers were used in the calculations, so they were divided the same way degrees were, into minutes, seconds, thirds, etc.  Note that even if you assume geocentricity, the Sun still goes around the Earth on a 24-hour cycle, so you could draw that circle of the Sun going around the Earth and use it as a reference point for the other celestial events being modeled.</p>
<p>Well, eventually we got clocks, and since we were already using minutes and seconds as divisions of the hour, those became standard.  Thirds were too small to use, so there was no point.  That's why today we don't bother with thirds, just minutes and seconds, and we use decimals (because they've been invented) to get smaller bits of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it is so stable is because the Si-O bond has a very high bond energy (glass is mainly silicon dioxide), around 600 KJ/Mol. This means it takes a large amount of energy for something to react with glass by breaking this bond. This is also why diatomic nitrogen is used as an inert gas, because the N-N (triple bond) has such a high bond energy (~900KJ/Mol).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lab glass is (from Wikipedia)Borosilicate glass. Borosilicate glass is a type of glass with silica and boron trioxide as the main glass-forming constituents. Borosilicate glasses are known for having very low coefficients of thermal expansion (~3 × 10−6 K−1 at 20 °C), making them resistant to thermal shock, more so than any other common glass. Such glass is less subject to thermal stress and is commonly used for the construction of reagent bottles. </p>
<p>Pyrex used to sell borosilicate glass in the consumer arena, but to dissuade (fatally injure?) home &quot;chemists&quot;, it's now just regular glass, that you can get to shatter if you subject it to thermal shock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but your stomach can absorb water pretty well so the dilution doesn't last long.  Drinking water with your food actually helps digestion because churning food with a liquid breaks it up better than without (your stomach &quot;churns&quot; food to a degree.  The liquid component gives more surface area for enzymes to contact it the food.</p>
<p>This is why liquid diets are preferred for the very very weak and sick; they are absorbed faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in a real day-to-day scenario.</p>
<p>In order to hinder digestion noticeably, you need to raise pH from 2 to 3.5 (at this point digestive enzymes denature). You'd need about half a gallon of water to do this, so you'd be too full to eat anything else way before this happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach has cells that line the outside of it that produce something called &quot;Gastic Hydrogen Potassium ATPase&quot;. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_potassium_ATPase" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_potassium_ATPase</a>) It's essentially just a natural proton pump designed to acidify the contents of the stomach which is mostly just water and whatever you recently ate. </p>
<p>You stomach always has some amount of water in it that is full of these acidic particles. As it fills up from food, more water is pulled in and more acid is produced as it passes through your small intestine (which is really just an extension of your stomach). Then the large intestine pulls most of the water along with nutrients out of there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
