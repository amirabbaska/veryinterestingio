		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>black holes must be significantly heavier than the Planck mass M_P, which is about 22 Î¼g. Anything quite heavier can form a (extremely short-lived unless it is really heavy) black hole, while anything quite lighter cannot. So yes, poppy seed is good, <em>E. coli</em> bacterium doesn't work.</p>
<p>Imagine you have an object lighter than M_P and you're trying to compress it to inside its Schwarzschild radius, which is smaller than the Planck length l_P. In fact, ignoring some pesky numerical factors, you have the formula</p>
<p>M / M_P ~ R / l_P</p>
<p>where R is the Schwarzschild radius of the mass M, the radius in which you'd have to compress M to make it a black hole. Since at the length scale of l_P smooth classical spacetime stops existing to give way to a quantum foam, for R to be smaller than l_P sounds already fishy. </p>
<p>But you try anyway. What you find is that well before your compressing mass even reaches the Planck length, in compressing it you have already given it a lot of energy, which increases its mass (through E = Mc^(2)). In the end, it turns out you have made it into a black hole with M &gt;&gt; M_P and R &gt;&gt; l_P. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes, but it would blow up immediately.</p>
<p>Black holes emit Hawking radiation. The smaller the hole, the stronger the radiation, which makes the hole even smaller, which makes the radiation even stronger... repeat until KABOOM.</p>
<p>A poppy seed is pretty much at the size (I mean mass) where it goes kaboom in an instant. The energy equivalent of the mass of a poppy seed is a small tactical nuke. Do not try this at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a scientist! So let me try to offer my insight:</p>
<p>So first of all, like every other job in the world, scientists need money in order to work on their projects/research. Unlike &quot;regular&quot; companies though, scientists don't really <em>sell</em> anything, so it's going to be hard to go to Wells Fargo and ask for money without being able to show them how you plan on paying them back.</p>
<p>Enter organizations like the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), NASA, the European Commission, and the list goes on. These organizations have many purposes, and one of them is to allocate researching funding to promising projects. What they'll do is, for example, put out a &quot;call for proposals&quot; and then allow scientists to apply for funding. For example, the NSF might put out a call for proposal on the subject of say &quot;childhood education.&quot;</p>
<p>So you're a scientist doing research in &quot;teenage education.&quot; You have a lot of experience on research in education in teenagers, and you think that you might be able to apply your work to education in children as well. You just don't have the time, or money, or staff, to actually do it. But now that there's this call for proposal, it's your chance! So you write a grant proposal which basically outlines what you are going to do, how you are going to do it, why you are going to do it, and a lot of other things are involved. Will your project involve any ethical considerations? You'll need to include documentation showing how you will follow ethical approvals, for example. You'll also need to submit some kind of budget guidelines. If you are requesting $500,000, how will this be used? $500,000 sounds like a lot, but in terms of research it's not really. The NSF might award you the grant for $500,000, but you need to keep in mind that this money is for the duration of the project. Do you need equipment (you will)? Do you need lab space (you do)? Do you need to hire new staff (you might)? New staff could be other researchers or grad students to help you. They need to get paid, after all, and so do you.</p>
<p>In the end: my point is: we <strong>need</strong> money just like everybody else. But unlike Boeing, and unlike Intel, and unlike Apple, or Google, etc... the money that I am asking for to do my project, actually has no promise of monetary return to my investors.</p>
<p>What I promise to return to the NSF, or to NASA, etc, is the promise of advancement in research. I do this by using the money to conduct experiments, and then publishing papers about it or giving talks at conferences. From the journal articles, other scientists will be able to follow my findings and either use it or try to test it etc and build upon their own research. From the conferences, I show things that are essentially &quot;works in progress&quot; but hey, maybe my idea is exactly what someone else was missing, and if they see me talk about it, they might come find me later on (or email) asking to collaborate. These are things that we <em>all</em> benefit from (we as in scientists), and these are essentially the &quot;returns&quot; that I promise to the NSF when I write my proposals.</p>
<p>When I publish or talk at conferences, I am talking to my peers. I am talking to colleagues. I am talking to scientists. When I talk to my peers, I would never make claims like &quot;this line of research can, <strong>will</strong>, definitely improve childhood education by 500%!&quot;</p>
<p>When I talk to my peers I am trying to discuss my work.</p>
<p>But when I am talking to media (be it the press, a TV program/interview, Twitter, my personal website/blog, message boards, or my university's press office, or hell, even my own non-scientist friends and family), I am not trying to discuss my work. <strong>I am trying to sell my work.</strong> I want to sell my work because, like I said, my work is entirely based on receiving money. Without money, there is no research, period. So I might exaggerate a tiny bit, or trump up all the benefits of what I'm doing and then throw in a very minute detail about how those gains are the theoretical maximum assuming that all the planets are aligned. I'm not really lying about anything, I'm just giving a, perhaps very, optimistic view of my research.</p>
<p>(After that, the journalists usually run off with it, and replace words like &quot;could maybe&quot; or &quot;might possibly&quot; into &quot;will definitely&quot; and so on.)</p>
<p>When I apply for funding, I like to think that the system is merit based, as in they'll review my track record and past research and so on. In general this is more or less true. So I'm not actually trying to sell my work to these agencies like NSF etc. Who I'm trying to sell to is to both the tax paying public and to the politicians in charge of appropriating money to the NSF. Since I am not making anything, or selling anything, I need to convince the public that their tax dollars are being used in a productive and/or beneficial manner. I need to convince the politicians not to defund the NSF, because I need that money to do my research. I need to convince the public that my work is crucial, vital even, so that they might complain loudly when a politician decides that they want to cut funding to the NSF.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond what people are writing about the huge investment these things take, the truth is often that these &quot;discoveries&quot; are nonsense.</p>
<p>For example, often you will hear a story about a &quot;miracle cure&quot; for such and such. But if you look deeper, the story is reporting on a lab experiment testing the drug in cells in vitro which may have a novel or promising mechanism of action...but that's a far cry from repeating its success in other studies, much less animals and much less demonstrating effectiveness in treating human diseases. While that does take years and some of these drugs are ultimately successful, the vast majority are abandoned down the pipeline because they aren't as effective as was hoped.</p>
<p>You see another version of this with claims about &quot;new drug treats so and so with virtually no side effects.&quot; That may be true in clinical trials when its given to a limited number of people...but once the drug hits the market, who gets it? Many many more people. Elderly. Children. Pregnant women. People of various ethnicities, not to mention just many more people with varying genetics. Everything has side effects and some of them are pretty darned serious.</p>
<p>You'll see articles about cures for cancer that are developed. But the stories are misleading because they are really talking about preliminary success in developing a new strategy to target one specific type of cancer. Even if it passes muster throughout its years of development its impact is going to be pretty limited. You'll probably never know of its usage unless you or someone you know eventually comes down with that specific disease.</p>
<p>For example, researchers in Glasgow and Hong Kong last year discovered that injecting a protein into mice brains could reduce amyloid plaques. That's important work. It's all well and good. But doctors aren't sure that amyloid plaques cause Alzheimer's or are just another symptom of the disease. In the unlikely event we find a way to increase the expression of this protein in human brains and in the unlikely event it removes 100% of amyloid plaques, it might turn out to have 0% effect on curing Alzheimer's...and it will be years before we find that out.</p>
<p>These stories are amazing because the media wants you to read their website so they publish interesting yet mundane stories in an overly sensational way.</p>
<p>EDIT: I did not mean the discoveries themselves were nonsense. I meant the media is overdrawing the conclusions of preliminary evidence to nonsensical levels. Should have phrased more carefully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a 'journo' I'd use sources like <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/" target="_blank">http://www.eurekalert.org/</a> to find nice stories that I could rewrite so they were unique and then promote them on social media sites.</p>
<p>Eurekalert is already Buzzfeedy in its headlines, and you can tell when you read a little deeper into the article that the research was not as groundbreaking as the headline makes it appear. It might be a mouse model, it might be just a survey of 2000 people, it might be a study involving 20 people. </p>
<p>Then when I wrote it up, I would purposefully try to avoid anything that highlighted how meaningless the study was, and I'd try to write something even more Buzzfeedy than the actual article. AIDS cure 'around the corner', 'Study: AIDS can be cured by bananas'. If I put some of the headline in 'snatch quotes', i.e. apostrophes, or put a colon indicating that someone had said something, i.e. 'Cameron: Fuck Daesh', then I would have covered my ass from misrepresenting the topic, provided I didn't totally misrepresent it.</p>
<p>And I was churning out 5,000 words a day, often researching and spinning a 200-word article in 20 minutes. I would honestly just skimread the original source, I'd only actually read it to fully understand it if I was personally interested in the research. Furthermore, my understanding of complicated science is nowhere near good enough to be able to criticise a scientific study, all I'd do is 'spin' it. Churnalism, it's called.</p>
<p>Shockingly, one of my skills is being able to push things to the top of Google search results. Quite often, when writing something more meaty, my research would be reading whatever was at the top of Google search results, which I know full well is written by someone who's just as big a moron as me and who's just as pressed for time as me.</p>
<p>tldr, the internet is a tapestry of bullshit.</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Here's an example, in fact if I was spending 20 minutes on 200 words I would've spent 5 of them on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-11/aafc-hnc111615.php" target="_blank">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-11/aafc-hnc111615.php</a></p>
<p>See it's all full of confusing stuff but I might think 'this is the kind of thing people will read'. This doesn't comply with all the rules of news writing but it's pretty close:</p>
<p>Could e-cigarette users face a higher cancer risk than smokers?</p>
<p>Alternatives to tobacco, such as e-cigarettes, have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are much-touted for their health benefits.</p>
<p>However, a new study, which found that smokeless tobacco users have higher levels of carcinogens than smokers, could end any claims that alternatives to cigarettes are better for you than cigarettes themselves.</p>
<p>The research, which was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, found people who use smokeless tobacco have higher levels of tobacco constituents cotinine, NNAL and other deadly toxins than people who exclusively smoked cigarettes.</p>
<p>Brian Rostron, PhD, an epidemiologist in the Center for Tobacco Products at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said that these biomarkers show that smokeless tobacco users face &quot;adverse health effects, including cancer&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our findings demonstrate the need for continuing study of the toxic constituents of smokeless tobacco as well as their health effects on the individuals who use them,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>As well as e-cigarettes, other popular nicotine-replacement devices include snus, snuff and chewing tobacco.</p>
<p>PS it's all bullshit man, the study's about smokeless tobacco products, and I strongly assume that this means snuff and snus and chewing tobacco and that ecigs don't even count. But nobody's gonna sue me and it's the kinda thing people would share.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is huge amounts of misreporting in the media of scientific results. Media outlets are interested in sensation and views - actual medical research is incredibly dense, technical and therefore boring to many people. </p>
<p>For example, you often hear about cures for cancer. The problem is that cancers are incredibly complex with a vast variety among them. There maybe thousands of tiny molecules, each with a name and chemical formula, that researchers are studying. The 'breakthrough' may be showing that one of those compounds is elevated in x disease. What actually needs to occur for a real life change? They need to then figure out the causal relationships - I.e. Is the compound elevated as a cause of the disease? Or is it as a result of the disease? If we lower it, does the disease get better? Or is it useful as a marker of disease? If so, how can we measure it in people? Can we use a medicine to improve it?
Once there's finally a possible therapy, it's tested in animals and people and that takes forever. You also often hear about the successes but not the scientific failures (there are more failures than successes).</p>
<p>Other researchers then painstakingly research other compounds, using different methodologies, all in hope of very very slowly piecing together a coherent picture in order to achieve therapy. So basically, medical and scientific research more generally, is akin to carving away a wall with a spoon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacist-in-training here. </p>
<p>At least in the field of medicine, all new methods of treatment must be &quot;evidence based&quot; meaning someone has to take that new thing and compare it to the one currently available. As an example, comparing the how well the $5 epipen works against a typical $30 one. </p>
<p>For this reply, let's ASSUME the $5 epipen actually works and isn't a sham.</p>
<p>This process is called a &quot;Clinical Trial&quot; and often costs millions of dollars because you need to recruit hundreds, if not thousands, of people to use your $5 epipen or the $30 epipen and check back for results and such. This often requires hundreds of staff members, facilities, tools, and even the pens themselves, and if I'm not wrong, not many high-school students or even adults have millions of dollars they can invest into this process.</p>
<p>It's the same for the new omega antibiotic, cure for cancer, or protein to cure Alzheimer's Disease. Regardless of whether it works or not, in order for it to be regularly used, it takes years of work and lots of money, which is why these &quot;amazing discoveries&quot; are rarely followed-up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your brain wants you to do something, it releases <strong>dopamine</strong> to force you to do it. The more dopamine your brain releases, the more you feel compelled to do whatever it is your brain wants you to do.</p>
<p>In other words, dopamine is your brain's &quot;gotta have it&quot; chemical. It is what makes you crave things to varying degrees. And the more dopamine your brain is outputting, the more uneasy and uncomfortable you feel until you act on its urges.</p>
<p>Then when you finally complete that task that dopamine has forced you to act on... and you've gotten whatever &quot;prize&quot; was waiting at the end of that task... your brain releases a rush of <strong>serotonin</strong> to match the dopamine it just outputted.</p>
<p>Serotonin is your brain's &quot;got it&quot; chemical, shutting off the fountain of dopamine that was compelling you to seek out whatever you wanted.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, the <strong>brief combination of high dopamine and high serotonin in your brain</strong> acts as a reward mechanism. It gives you a feeling of immense pleasure.</p>
<p>It's nature's way of rewarding you for taking a specific behavior.</p>
<p>Think about a time when you were a little hungry... then really hungry... then completely starved. It was dopamine being released in varying quantities in your brain that caused to feel those growing levels of hunger.</p>
<p>And think about how relieving it felt when you finally ate. You likely gorged yourself and you felt INCREDIBLE. That was the combo of high dopamine and high serotonin in your brain.</p>
<p>You experience the same thing when you build up the nerve to ask a girl out... and then she says yes. Or when you go on a long run and then make it home, safe and sound. And when you jump out of an airplane (followed by landing safely on the ground). And when you watch scary movies (then go back to &quot;safe&quot; reality).</p>
<p>It's all dopamine making you feel uneasy (escape! eat that food! make it to safety! get out of this awful situation!)... followed by serotonin when you'd achieved your mission... followed by pure unadulterated bliss in the brief moment when your brain was flooded with both chemicals at once.</p>
<p>Long story short, <strong>nicotine &quot;artificially&quot; creates this rush of serotonin in your brain</strong>. So if you're stressed (i.e. you have extremely high dopamine levels from something being incomplete or scary in your life), cigarettes temporarily create the surge of serotonin that turns off dopamine -- and leaves you feeling extreme pleasure.</p>
<p>But, since they're not <em>actually</em> solving the issues causing high dopamine for you, the dopamine just comes back... but eventually comes back at higher, and higher, and higher levels. It acclimates to your &quot;artificial&quot; serotonin source.</p>
<p>So the pleasure and calm you get from cigarettes (and their &quot;artificial&quot; serotonin hit) increases with time -- but your addiction (and stress) also grows.</p>

There's sympathetic (which is fight or flight) and parasympathetic (which is rest and relax). It stimulates the parasympathetic part which gives the relaxing effect. Apart from that it increases blood flow leading to more blood to the brain making you more alert and focused. Hence why people smoke when they are anxious, to be more focused and calm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I started taking Wellbutrin for depression a while ago and the doctor told me that one of the side effects is that it could severely curtail your desire to smoke. He said that Wellbutrin was developed years ago to help people quit smoking but they also found that it could help people with depression, so that became the primary focus of the drug - I still smoked for several months before I decided to quit, but it was like forcing myself to smoke because I lost the desire to do it, the drug is so strong and so good at stopping the urge to smoke (at least for me it was) - In January, 2016 I stopped smoking after over 40 years (and many frustrating years of trying to stop on my own) and I have not had any urge at all to smoke since then and I am very grateful - I feel fantastic now just like everybody said I would. Quitting smoking completely changed my life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of crazy unsubstantiated nonsense posted so far. This is complicated so I'll try to give you a thorough yet layman explanation. Nicotine has different affinities for receptors in the brain versus the peripheral nervous system. It also does not bind all nicotinic receptors equally. What the result of this is: is that nicotine produces both a sympathetic type of effect, due to the actions of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucose released from liver, and also parasympathetic type actions that improve cognition and decrease stress through the actions in the central nervous system, chief among these being the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>In a nutshell it puts your body in fight or flight Mode, while putting your brain in a relaxed state that is better suited to cognition. There is also a weird pharmacokinetic property that the stimulant versus sedative effects reverse based on the level of nicotine in your blood. At a low concentration in your blood it will act as a stimulant, but at a high concentration like a sedative. This effect plays out not only due to the amount of nicotine ingested, but also the distribution of nicotine throughout your different body fluid compartments due to their varying permeability to the molecule.</p>

A chemical's effect on the body can't be adequately explained in one word such as &quot;stimulant&quot; so you're bound to get nuanced effects that require greater understanding to differentiate rather than lumping everything into one category</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It never really was an issue, because every president before Trump has acted as if the rules applied to them, both to avoid political problems and because people who run for president generally have an inherent belief in the country and its institutions.  By leaving the president and vice president out, you avoid having to answer some tricky questions about separation of powers that might tie up the law in court.</p>
<p>But now we're in an unusual situation where the president seems indifferent to ethics norms, and there aren't really any mechanisms to constrain him if Congress abdicates is responsibility as a coequal branch of government.  Buckle your seat belts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If politicians weren't immune from the same laws that government regular citizens, then these laws could be used to game the system. For example, if the police were allowed to detain politicians for question, then they would simply stop their political opponents, delaying them long enough to ensure they missed their chance to vote.</p>
<p>So it's the same with ethics laws. If you allow people to challenge someone for everything they do as an ethics violation, then he will be tied up in court all day answering to these charges and unable to perform his duties. </p>
<p>I mean that's what we're talking about here after all. You're asking how there might be a way to stymie Trump for the next four years by tying him up in court 24/7. Now you might think you're being clever, but you have to remember that when the shoe is on the other foot, your opponents will do the same exact thing to you. </p>
<p>Think of it in the context of executive orders. You hate these things so much when Trump uses, but you never gave a second thought to them before when Obama was doing them. So in this same way, be careful what you wish for, because you might just get it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one is actually stating what should be obvious, our current president is <strong>not</strong> in violation of the Ethics in Government Act. There are only two reasons you would think he would be in violation: you think the act has some generally ethical clause in it, or you think Trump has not disclosed his financial reports.</p>
<p><em>Option 1: you think the act has some generally ethical clause in it.</em> The Ethics in Government Act covers the disclosure of financial reports, a few other technical things, and establishes oversight of this process. That's it. It in no ways says things like &quot;The president must be ethical&quot;. This act is solely about financial disclosure, nothing else. Speaking of that...</p>
<p><em>Option 2: you think Trump has not disclosed his financial reports.</em> Well guess what, he has. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html" target="_blank">Here</a> it is, go read it yourself.</p>
<p>You may have heard that Trump has been refusing to release his tax returns. That is correct, he has refused to do that even though most other Presidents have. <em>But</em> that is not legally required. Trump has done everything he legally had to do to disclose his finances, thus he is not in violation of the Ethics in Government act.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense to you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Poor people are unlikely to be able to afford more effective forms of birth control, especially if they are un- or underinsured. I'm fortunate to have a good-paying job with health insurance that covers HBC and my IUD, which cost $1200. Someone who works a job that pays poorly is unlikely to have these benefits, and is <em>definitely</em> not likely to be able to pay out of pocket.</p>
<p>2) Many poorer communities do not have proper sex education - hell, many schools regardless of socioeconomic status don't. It's difficult to prevent pregnancy if you don't understand how the body works to begin with. That, and many poor communities tend towards more religious/conservative values, which don't often encourage birth control and sex education. It's unlikely that a person who grew up knowing nothing is going to be able offer this crucial knowledge to their offspring. I can only imagine what it'd be like to hear the same bullshit I heard in high school, but with parents who they themselves do not know enough about the subject to correct me.</p>
<p>3) Abortions are not only hella expensive, but very difficult to get in most states - and, you guessed it, even more so in poor communities. I can put in for time off work for a doctor's appointment and use sick time without worrying about being fired. I can call off work if I'm sick without fearing that I'll lose my job. Many poor people, however, may work jobs that do not provide sick time, and there's a very real fear that it would ultimately boil down to wondering if they could truly afford to lose their job over this. An abortion isn't just an in and out visit, in many places.</p>
<p>4) Conservative/religious values that dictate gender roles; for some people, women are inherently meant to be mothers, and bearing children is the greatest, single most important thing a woman can do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a number of factors.</p>
<p>1) Below a certain threshold, even small amounts of money matter.  If I have plenty of money, having a stash of condoms (or if female, taking birth control just in case) is relatively easy to do.  If putting that money towards birth control means I may have to skip a meal, then I may be more likely to risk pregnancy.</p>
<p>2) There tends to be educational gaps, and I've actually known people who honestly didn't understand what causes pregnancy, so them not taking steps to prevent pregnancy makes more sense.</p>
<p>3) Anecdotal, but possibly related.  I've been broke before, and it tends to go hand-in-hand with a &quot;meh, fuck it&quot; attitude, at least for me and a lot of the people I know.  At some point you just expect life to hand you shit, and there's only so much shit-ade you can make, so you stop taking basic measures to prevent bad things</p>
<p>4) Abortions cost money, which ties back into #1.</p>
<p>5) As someone else pointed out &quot;when you're poor, there's not much else to do.&quot;</p>
<p>There's probably a lot more contributing factors, but I suspect the above will account for the majority of the cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I worked for HUD during the late 80s-90s in one of the poorest areas of the nation.  13-year old pregnant girls were brought in by the mothers to apply for housing.  Consider their circumstances, though:  as young, black, under-educated females without transportation or any job opportunities, who already lived in public housing with mothers who survived on welfare and cash gifts from &quot;friends&quot;, a pregnancy/child meant a relative fortune in benefits:  housing rights, Aid to Dependent Children payments, medical care, food stamps (of a sort), etc.  Imagine going from being a poor black teen girl in a depressed rural area, with absolutely NO HOPE of anything better, and then the question is not WHY have children, but WHY NOT?  As a normal human being with normal desires for intimacy, love, and family, this situation, no matter how abhorrent to someone in different circumstances, becomes the norm.</p>
<p>Edit:  should add that the area this took place in also had the highest per capita number of churches, and ZERO sex ed, and limited contraceptive availability, even if the girls had been educated about how to prevent pregnancy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Archimedes knew the volumes of cylinders and cones. He then argued that the volume of a cylinder of height <em>r</em> and base radius <em>r</em>, minus the volume of a cone of height <em>r</em> and base radius <em>r</em>, equals the volume of a half-sphere of radius <em>r</em>. [See below for the argument.] From this, our modern formula for the volume of the half-sphere follows:  <em>r</em> * <em>r^(2) Ï - 1/3</em> * <em>r</em> * <em>r^(2) Ï</em> = <em>2/3</em> * <em>Ï</em> * <em>r^(3)</em> and by doubling this you get the volume of a sphere.</p>
<p>Now, the core of his argument goes like this: consider a solid cylinder of base radius <em>r</em> and height <em>r</em>, sitting on a horizontal plane. Inside of it, carve out a cone of height <em>r</em> and base radius <em>r</em>, but in such a fashion that the base of the carved-out cone is at the top, and the tip of the carved-out cone is at the center of the cylinder's bottom base. This object we will now compare to a half-sphere of radius <em>r</em>, sitting with its base circle on the same horizontal plane. [See <a href="https://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/maths-learning/2014/07/24/archimedess-integrals/" target="_blank">here</a> for pictures of the situation.]</p>
<p>The two objects have the same volume, because at height <em>y</em> they have the same horizontal cross-sectional area: the first object has cross-sectional area <em>r^(2) Ï - y^(2) Ï</em> (the first term from the cylinder, the second from the carved-out cone), while the half-sphere has cross-sectional area <em>(r^(2)-y^(2))Ï</em> (using the Pythagorean theorem to figure out the radius of the cross-sectional circle).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus</a></p>
<p>As far as Pi was concerned the Egyptians knew that to at least 3-4 decimal places tho they used integral fractions to express it. They used 4 (8/9 sq.) as a computational approximation, giving about 3.16... for pi. And so did the Greeks!!!</p>
<p>If the ancients knew this answer, so did Archimedes. So he was arguing and creating an answer which he already knew. Knowing the answer already is highly influential upon one's methods.</p>
<p>That fact must also be considered very seriously in this case.</p>
<p>the values which could NOT be exactly computed without the calculus are the cross sections, volumes of parabolas  and conic sections. That's the real addition to math which Archimedes' palimpsest has shown, as well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Archimedes, like all the other Greeks, did not know the concept of infinity, or number like we do today. For the greeks numbers were always &quot;lengths&quot; of a side and 2*3 for example would be the area (which is why they also never went above 3 dimensions). The greeks could only calculate what was real, what existed and what they could see. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Archimedes can not have used limit in the modern sense, because limits require the usage of infinity. The greeks already had problems accepting and understanding irrational numbers , anything resembling &quot;infinite&quot; would have seemed foreign to them. </p>
</li>
<li>They also didnt have the concept of the number 0 - so comparing Archimedes to Riemann sums is very lacking, since Riemann sums depend heavily on the difference becoming 0 - while greeks are generally lauded as excellent real geometers, our modern functional mathematics originates in India (where we find the oldest abstract notions of 0 , variables etc.) </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basis for saying alcohol destroys brain cells was from a man applying alcohol directly to brain cells in a Pitre dish. Drinking doesn't actually kill brain cells when people drink, because it's not coming into direct contact in such a high concentration. If it actually acted like that, people would be severely mentally impaired (and permanently so) after just a few visits to the bar, especially the way some do on their 21st birthday.</p>
<p>Also, when people get so drunk that they don't remember what they did, it's not that they can't remember their actions, but rather at that point of drunkenness their brain simply stops recording memories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the idea that alcohol destroys brain cells is entirely a myth propagated by the temperance movement in the early 19th century. Alcohol doesn't destroy brain cells, even though shitfaced drunks might <em>look</em> braindead.</p>
<p>Chronic alcohol abuse may result in WernickeâKorsakoff syndrome, which is a severe, potentially fatal, neurological condition with symptoms like amnesia, confusion, and confabulation. To the untrained eye, this makes an alcoholic look like a bumbling idiot. It's important to note alcohol itself doesn't cause WKS, rather, it's a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B^1) which alcoholics frequently encounter as A) their diets are usually very poor and B) alcohol inhibits the body's ability to absorb B vitamins. That's why alcoholics (such as myself) often take vitamin supplements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is classified as a depressant.  If enough alcohol is taken, the effects will be slowed down communication in the brain leading to slurred speech, impaired motor control, and other effects.  Taken in high enough levels it is toxic leading to effects such as black outs, passing out, and potentially even death at high enough levels.</p>
<p>There effects are generally short term, but they can be complicated if someone is a chronic drinker particularly if chronic usage is long term.  There is also the possibility of both psychological and physical addiction which distorts behavior.</p>
<p>So in my opinion, the loss of memory and slowed thinking is a yes since this opinion is based on personal experience and that of a general consensus of anyone that has drank to get drunk.  I'd say the IQ loss is possible but only is those cases where the usage was chronic and long term.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a book about New Haven pizza- New Haven is considered by many as the birthplace of American pizza. Pizza was seemingly always delivered since it came to America in the early 20th century. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<p>&quot;...pizza was largely popularized starting in the 1910s when it was sold on the street and delivered to the factories and the Market Exchange, an important regional farmer's market.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the most famous pizza places/owners is even credited as the inventor of the pizza box to facilitate delivery. About Frank Pepe's:</p>
<p>&quot;(Pepe) continued to deliver pies...but he employed a new method to package them, the pizza box. The National Folding Box Co., a local firm, began making them, creating the oldest record of a pizza box in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>So again, to reiterate what I stated above- Pizza seems to have started in America as a food that was typically delivered. The tradition was just copied and continued from these original locations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three factors: the nature of pizza production, the physical and financial infrastructure available for that production in the United States after World War II, and the portable nature of pizza itself.</p>
<p>First, production: a pizza parlor needs only two pieces of specialized equipment, a heavy stand mixer for the dough and an oven that will hold temperatures over 700F. If you are handy, you can build the oven yourself with brick and pipe. So long as you aren't trying to open a full-service restaurant with lots of seating and a varied menu, the only expensive piece of equipment you have to acquire is that stand mixer. </p>
<p>Second, infrastructure: after World War II, the US government had a lot of surplus items they were selling cheap: jeeps, canteens, army boots,... and huge Hobart stand mixers. The Hobart mixers were big enough to mix a battalion's bread, and they were going cheap. A veteran could get a small business loan from the GI bill, buy his mixer, rent a small storefront, build his oven, and boom, he was in the restaurant business. It's a restaurant that can make a lot of pizza efficiently, but it can't make much else. You aren't going to get a lot of sit-down trade. People want to take what you make to eat someplace else. </p>
<p>This brings us to the third item: pizza is a perfectly portable food. It doesn't need a knife and fork. It can be reheated multiple times without a discernable loss in quality. By varying the toppings of vegetables and meat, it can easily be a single-dish meal that makes the entire family happy. As pizza parlors spread from urban centers, owners realized there was a limit to the walk-in traffic they could expect. They knew from their urban experience many customers were taking the pizza home. How could they replicate that trade in the suburbs? By offering a new service: pizza delivered to the customer's house. </p>
<p>Edit: something I forgot, which added steam to the spread of pizza delivery in the 1950's, particularly in the midwest: narcotics. Suppose you are an Italian organized crime boss in Chicago or Kansas City and you want to distribute narcotics in Lincoln, Nebraska. You can't just send a couple of Sicilian nephews to hang out on a street corner. Two Italian guys just stopping to buy gas in Lincoln would attract attention in the 1950's. People would notice. If the same two guys open a pizza parlor, however, no one cares. They can hire compromised people down on their luck as delivery men. They will learn soon enough who can move and consume their product. They have the perfect cover business: all cash, deliveries going all over the city, and open late. I don't know how much this happened in the East, and I don't think it happened at all out West, but I know this happened around KC and Chicago a lot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had a concrete source to provide you with, but in searching the internet for the history of pizza delivery I did come across a few connections that may be helpful:</p>
<p>Pizza as a food took off in American following WWII, when soldiers returning from overseas found themselves wanting that delicious pizza they ate while in Italy.  During this time, car culture also began to pick up, with more people having access to a car, which is important to note for the whole &quot;delivery&quot; part.</p>
<p>Moving forward into the middle of the century: work/life shifts that found both men and women in the workplace and spending more time traveling to get to their jobs found people with less time to cook dinner and greater interest in dining out or getting take out dinner.  Around this time somebody also figured out the better design for the pizza box, which made it easier to transport.</p>
<p>One other important thing for you factor in in regards to why more restaurants don't deliver is demand and profitability, etc.  If you live in an area that isn't densely populated, it may not be worth the time for a business to offer delivery if each delivery takes the person 45 minutes one direction for order number 1 and another 30 minutes another direction to drop off order number 2.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen a sign on the wall of a shop that says something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Cheap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pick Two</strong></p>
<p>That's essentially what's going on with our brains. A human brain uses up about 20% of the food we eat everyday, which is a lot for something that doesn't have to move us around or pump blood or anything 'strenuous' like that - but they could use a lot more. A computer that could do what our brains do would be enormous and would use thousands or millions of kWh of electricity. So, our brains are actually pretty efficient or &quot;cheap&quot; for what they do, which includes things like figuring out the right things to say and how to pronounce each word whenever we have to talk.</p>
<p>So, if they're &quot;cheap&quot; that means that they can't be as good and fast as we'd like. They're going to make mistakes sometimes. It's better to get the words right 99% of the time and be pretty fast and efficient, then it is to get the words right 100% of the time and be huge and use way more calories all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> - For a non ELI5 way to think of it we can <a href="http://www.definitionsblog.com/2017/01/animal-learning.html" target="_blank">think of our brains as lossy compression of things we've learned</a>. Instead of perfectly mapping inputs to outputs we map the responses on top of each other where possible, which results in a network. This saves a ton of space and energy, but it means that often our responses are &quot;good enough&quot; instead of being exactly what we might've wanted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brains are hardwired in a way where each cell (neuron) is connected to many other cells. It's like a computer where one wire connects to other ports and wires to create a while computer. Once in a while, a neuron will fire when we are speaking but will go down a little different path which our brains are not used to. This will cause some lag just like a computer program that was not used in a while. This can ultimately lead to a stutter. To my knowledge, this occurs randomly and unpredictably. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering the same thing when I was talking to my brother in-law about camera equipment and gear (he wants to buy my sister a camera for her birthday). Photography is a nice hobby of mine which I am passionate about. When I was telling him all about it, I was getting out of breath and was stumbling with my words a lot. I had to stop talking and take a few deep breaths in the middle of the conversation to recollect myself and catch my breath. I think I was just too excited to talk, and wasn't thinking about breathing and exactly how I was going to word something. I had too many thoughts in my head at once and wanted to say it all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can control it to a certain extent if you can control your breathing.
Cross your arms in front of you and notice how you breathe into your chest, stretch your arms to the sides and notice how you breathe down into your belly.
When you stutter or mispronounce your words it's because you get excited, nervous or wound up in some other way, you're almost always breathing with your chest.
This is your body's emergency breathing system, and using it also produces cortisol, the stress-hormone causing you to loose full perspective on what you want to say and be more focused on 'getting the sentence out' (often because people think the listeners will lose attention if they talk normally) leading to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2127686/How-stress-shut-command-centre-brain.htm" target="_blank">frontal lobe shut-down</a> essentially shutting down your capacity to think broadly.</p>
<p>Our brain talks to our nervous system but our nervous system also talks back, if you can force yourself to breathe right you won't fumble words that way. Also, people will perceive you as more confident if you do this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was also wondering, don't know if allowed, what it is when you're talking but then your airway seizes up and you can't finish the word? It happens when you're trying not to cry most frequently. its like a spasm in your throat or something. never understood what it was</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
