		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found this question so interesting, and the answers so inadequate (Come on guys! Explaining the neurobiology is like saying men get erections because their penis fills with blood. True: but not illuminating) that I did a little digging myself. After finding nothing very helpful in my old neuro books, I found <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-are-cold-chills" target="_blank">this</a> answer on Quora, which was written so well I'll just quote </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thrill-induced chills are a physiological response to a number of seemingly unrelated types of emotional stimuli. The exact mechanism is still the subject of scientific investigation.</p>
<p>Thrill-induced &quot;chills&quot; are a physiological response that is called &quot;frisson&quot; by researchers. The main effect is &quot;goose bumps&quot; or &quot;hair standing up&quot; (piloerecetion), which is caused by contraction of tiny muscles around the hair folicles. There is also the full-body shudder, which is related to shivering and is caused by rhythmic oscillating contractions of the major skeletal muscle groups, most likely controlled at the level of the brain stem and spinal cord. Shivers are normally intended to generate warmth through physical exertion of the muscles.</p>
<p>The interesting questions are: 1) why is the sensation pleasurable? and 2) why can this response be induced by stimuli unrelated to cold (music, aesthetic awe, primal scream, threat of loss, certain physical and tactile sensations)?</p>
<p>On the first question, a PET scan study at McGill university looked at the effect of frisson in response to peak experience while listening to music (&quot;musical frisson&quot;). (<a href="http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/media/n" target="_blank">http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/media/n</a>...). They found that dopamine was released during this peak experience. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with &quot;reward&quot; which are positive experiences that the brain attempts to repeat in the future. [1]</p>
<p>On the evolutionary origin or purpose of chills, David Huron argues that they come from our instinctual reaction to human screams, which is an alert and orienting reaction. Human screams are audible at a longer distance than any other sound, and are critical for avoiding danger (warnings) and protecting infants (distress calls). So a scream is an important sound that completely consumes attention.</p>
<p>Huron argues that in music, certain sound elements may trigger the alert reaction (causing the chills effect), but then are realized to be harmless, inducing the pleasurable response. The musical features invoking the sensation often involve a sudden increase in loudness which might normally be a signal of surprise and danger. (<a href="http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/20" target="_blank">http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/20</a>...)</p>
<p>Grewe et al (2010) argue that chills have many unrelated causes including &quot;fight and flight reactions, aesthetic awe or social loss&quot; and so may not have a single explanation or evolutionary origin. [2]</p>
<p>Overall, chills may be an ancient physiological response that has been (accidentally?) co-opted by evolution for new purposes, such as social danger alert. Art forms such as music and painting have found clever ways of activating this response.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, the current tuning system we use in the Western World (and basically anywhere else outside of tribal, colloquial, folkway or other regional music) is the tonal system. This system was set up to give notes (or pitches, actually) the same equidistant relationships between each other within a tuning system known as equal temperament. That is to say, within any octave of an instrument or an instrument tuned to another instrument, there will always be 12 equally separated pitches, what we musicians know as half-steps or semitones, these pitches are always 100 cents (just a division of frequencies) apart from one another. If a pitch is played or sung that is even a few cents off from the tuning pitch as written or perceived, our ears perceive the sound as being dissonant or &quot;off-key.&quot; </p>
<p>To answer your second question, because of equal temperament's hold on music today, the human ear has become used to its clarity within music. If a note is sounded that doesn't fit into the system, our ears know what's up. </p>
<p>TL;DR - Because of a system called equal temperament which standardizes which pitches sound &quot;correct&quot; to the human ear.</p>

Deeper in this is what our ear is accustomed to with Western music. When a note doesn't fit or go the right way, we can pick up on it. The concept of what is right is based off what we are used to hearing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to contribute by saying that you probably mean western music, where 12 separated pitches are used. This is to say that there are different systems in the world where many more pitches are used. A song doesn't nessecarily have to sound off-pitch, if the listener comes from a culture where many more pitches are used in their music. </p>
<p>It isn't the pitch itself, but rather the interval between them that makes them sound &quot;off&quot;. We clearly pick up on a perfect fifth, because of it's properties of sounding very clean, compared to a major third, which sounds more muddled and it colours the music very well. </p>
<p>The western pitch system as explained very well by @nathan594 is rationally divided, which makes the frequencies to be more in line with eachother. </p>
<p>Now that you have some meat on your bones, the answer to your question is basically that notes that sound &quot;off&quot; are dependent on what we are used to hearing. Someone who listens mainly to pop music, might not expect a minor second interval between instruments as much as a musical conductor might, because of the majorly different styles. So, even in our own culture we have major differences when it comes to what's determined &quot;off-pitch&quot; by our ears!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a science behind it that explains harmonics.  Most sounds are comprised of a combination of 'notes' at different frequencies, which define their sound. For instance, bass is typically somewhere in the 20-200hz range (hertz=cycles per second)</p>
<p>So at 1hz, you hear on tone per second.
If you couple this with another tone, the must align to be in 'key'.
The human voice projects different notes simultaneously.<br />
So lets say a person sings a note, it will have a bass property and an alto property.<br />
The bass is at 60hz, so the alto needs to be at a multiple of this harmonic range, let's call it 60Mhz.    </p>
<p>If the bass note was at 60Hz, and there was another bass notes at 100hz, they would not be aligned and would be noticeably crappy.<br />
The second bass note would need to be at 120hz, or 180hz, etc. </p>
<p>TL;DR
tones together need to be mathematically compliant<br />
look up harmonics</p>
<p>edit: harmonics has nothing to due with a 'system' ... it's math</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>cnn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's going on? A range of experts made clear to me that there isn't any one factor to explain the increase, but a number of issues, including obesity-related complications such as hypertension and diabetes, the dramatic increase in the number of cesarean section births, a lack of access to affordable, quality health care and more women giving birth at older ages. </p>
<p>Record-keeping changes might also explain some of the upward trend, experts say.
...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CNN article completely avoids mentioning what's going on in Texas, whereas,</p>
<p>time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Access is inconsistent: Between 2000 to 2015, Texas saw a spike in maternal mortality while the state also underwent changes to reproductive health services, including the closure of several clinics offering abortions and other services. In 2011, the state’s family planning budget was cut by two-thirds. Experts say the lack of access is probably not solely responsible for the state’s dramatic spike in deaths, but as The Texas Tribune reports, it may have exacerbated the issue. “I’ve done my best to try to investigate this as a data error and I can’t find any changes to account for it,” says MacDorman. “It’s very concerning what’s happening in Texas.”</p>

<p>Eclampsia is the onset of seizures (convulsions) in a woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction. Onset may be before, during, or after delivery. Most often it is during the second half of pregnancy. The seizures are of the tonic–clonic type and typically last about a minute. Following the seizure there is typically either a period of confusion or coma. Complications include aspiration pneumonia, cerebral hemorrhage, kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are part of a larger group of conditions known as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</p>

<p><a href="http://eol.org/pages/2924326/details" target="_blank">Japanese Spider crab <em>Macrocheira kaempferi</em></a>: 18-feet across.</p>

<p>It is very likely that new animals will be found in the under-explored deep sea.

<p>As an example we know that there is a beaked whale, the spade toothed whale, that does definitely exist. Until 2013 it was only known from certain partial skeletons found around the Pacific. In 2013 a mother and calf were washed up dead in New Zealand. They were at first misidentified and buried.  They  have since been dug up for examination. They are the only full specimens in the world of a species noone has ever seen alive. </p>
<p>If we can know nothing about a large animal (the mother was like 6.5m) like this that surfaces at least every hour then it is more than feasible to assume there are large animals we dont even have hints about yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large reduction in the cost came from the price of the active material used in the cells. The industry has traditionally been dominated by silicon panels and creating high quality crystalline silicon had been a pretty expensive process. What happened in recent years is summarized <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eHJPpcn.png" target="_blank">in this chart</a>. As the production volume spiked, the the price of panels based on c-Si eventually plummeted. This relationship is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson's_law" target="_blank">Swanson's Law</a>. In fact, prices have dropped so much that now the silicon only accounts for less than half the price of typical modules. </p>
<p>As for what may reduce the price even further, that gets more speculative. A key short-term goal is to cut down on soft costs associated with installing and maintaining the cells. These costs are often lumped together as balance of system (BOS) costs. Here again, a key factor that can reduce these costs is the scale and maturity of the industry. For example, Germany which has been at this game longer already than the US has significantly lower BOS costs (e.g. see <a href="http://blog.rmi.org/blog_2013_12_05_can_usa_solar_cost_compete_with_germany" target="_blank">this article</a>). </p>
<p>edit: To move further out in the long term, things get even more speculative. It is possible that eventually that a new kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_solar_cell" target="_blank">thin film PV technology</a> will complement or supplant silicon PV. The advantage of such cells is that they could be flexible and more lightweight than silicon panels. These benefits in turn could potentially cut down on material and installation costs yet further. For example, so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite_solar_cell" target="_blank">perovskite PV cells</a> have shown promise in recent years in terms of efficiency, although stability remains a major concern. In addition to the active material itself, storage is still a huge stumbling block for solar energy to gain an increasingly larger share of the grid. Better and cheaper storage is key to deliver a steady supply to the grid in spite of daily and seasonal fluctuations in how much light we get from the Sun <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZLmlPZt.gif" target="_blank">e.g. shown here for Golden, Co.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not so much smarter as simply one that allow for much longer distance power transfer/markets via more high voltage lines.  This allows you to build solar in places where it's very sunny but there are few people nearby which makes it cheaper.  Same with wind.  It allows stabilizes both power sources since as you increase the area of your sample, the average power from solar and wind together is much more stable.  This is because weather generally travels in bands and averages out over distance, and wind and solar are somewhat negatively-correlated (it's generally sunny when it's not windy, and the reverse).</p>
<p>(Example from Britain of anti-negatively: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277334313_The_climatological_relationships_between_wind_and_solar_energy_supply_in_Britain" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277334313_The_climatological_relationships_between_wind_and_solar_energy_supply_in_Britain</a>)</p>
<p>High voltage power lines are not a technology that needs to be invented and obstacles are mostly political.  Example: A state doesn't want to buy all their power from a windier state next door, they'd much rather buy wind from less-windy and efficient sites in their own state for the tax revenue and jobs.</p>
<p>Longer distance power markets benefits nuclear as well as it opens up more possible locations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that solar energy depends on solar technology -- and like all electronic-based technologies, it continues to become more efficient and less expensive. </p>
<p>Bloomberg just posted <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels" target="_blank">a really informative article</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>A couple of money quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason solar-power generation will increasingly dominate: <strong>It’s a technology, not a fuel.</strong> As such, efficiency increases and prices fall as time goes on. What's more, the price of batteries to store solar power when the sun isn't shining is falling in a similarly stunning arc. </p>
<p>Just since 2000, the amount of global electricity produced by solar power has doubled seven times over. Even wind power, which was already established, doubled four times over the same period. For the first time, the two forms of renewable energy are beginning to compete head-to-head on price and annual investment.</p>
<p>... Government subsidies have helped wind and solar get a foothold in global power markets, but economies of scale are the true driver of falling prices: <strong>The cost of solar power has fallen to 1/150th of its level in the 1970s, while the total amount of installed solar has soared 115,000-fold.</strong>   [Emphasis added.]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>actually, clicking the box is a rather trivial part of what those CAPTCHAs are looking for.  What they're actually looking for are things like:</p>
<p>did the 'user' instantly move their mouse to the exact coordinates of the box, or did they traverse thru the page like a human would?  </p>
<p>is the user scrolling to the box, or are they remotely executing javascript to trigger a scroll to the box?</p>
<p>how long after page load did the user find the box? Too quickly is obviously a red flag, but taking too long is also. commonly, to get around reCAPTCHA you'll need to find out 4-5 areas to click in addition to the initial click. The way that most people do this is using CAPTCHA services, which are real people solving them and returning the answer to you (i.e. for a text captcha, you'd send them the image and they'd send back the letters/numbers).  The way you do this with reCAPTCHA is sending a screenshot of the computer, and you are returned the coords that you're supposed to click on to answer the question properly. [e: apparently this method is old, and a new method where the CAPTCHA is actually served up to the person within the service that will solve it for you!] However, it usually doesn't take a legitimate human 5 minutes to answer a few questions about 9 images.  if you take too long, they'll make you do another image check challenge.</p>
<p>basically, it's really, really difficult to make a bot move the mouse, scroll, and react naturally to a page load. and even if you do manage to fool reCAPTCHA, you'll be thrown to a few image tasks which may serve to block you out from the website completely, due to the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>e: as others have mentioned, this type of stuff is only part of what reCAPTCHA relies on to determine human/non-human - particularly, your referring information &amp; whether or not you have a logged in Google account.</p>
<p>e2: there are a bunch of people claiming that mouse movement tracking is impossible to do. in chrome, hit ctrl+shift+j, paste</p>
<blockquote>
<p>onmousemove = function(e){console.log(&quot;mouse location:&quot;, e.clientX, e.clientY)}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in, and hit enter. then move the mouse. it's easily done.</p>
<p>e3: there are <em>still</em> a ton of people claiming that I just made up the ability to track end user mouse movements. <a href="http://www.javascriptsource.com/page-details/mouse-coordinates.html" target="_blank">http://www.javascriptsource.com/page-details/mouse-coordinates.html</a> is another example</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google is great at keeping its algorithms a secret, so we'll probably never know for sure, but we can make some guesses. </p>
<p>One thought is to track a users mouse and keyboard actions and see if that is consistent with a human, but I'm not entirely sure this is the system that it uses since it would be easy to replicate such actions with a simple bot.</p>
<p>I'm partial to the idea that Google is taking advantage of it's massive database of what you've been doing on the web the last few minutes. Have you checked your GMail? Made some Google searches for a new cat sweater? That's all stuff a human would do, and I am able to associate your captcha request with your previous internet requests and see you're probably human.</p>
<p>Of course, if this is a brand new computer connecting from an IP that has just been assigned, you probably don't have the sufficient background for Google to think you're human, so you'll receive a more difficult captcha to solve.</p>
<p>This means that if a bot was to check off that box, it wouldn't follow the history pattern we associate with a human and Google would return a further captcha check which the bot would fail. Usually these secondary captchas are going to be some sort of computer vision problems that would involve far too much resource intensive computing to solve.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a Google blog that gives you a bit of info (but of course nothing particularly useful) <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html" target="_blank">https://security.googleblog.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html</a></p>
<p>Edit2: Somebody tried to see if they can pretend to be a bot and see what would happen. Turns out that without having sufficient history, he was blocked out of a site he could normal access without captcha: <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/101906" target="_blank">http://security.stackexchange.com/a/101906</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As far as I've heard, Google is able to replace an actual CAPTCHA with this simple textbox only if they know enough stuff about you - This little checkbox is basically a plugin from google, thus (via cookies, sessions, knowing your IP etc) google knows on what pages you surfed in the time before arriving at that CAPTCHA. Knowing that you surfed for dank memes for the past 3 hours, Google can be pretty sure you're not a robot - having to actually click on that box is basically only for &quot;enabling&quot; that plugin.</p>
<p>If google doesn't know enough about you, they will by the way simply show the original reCAPTCHA, where you solve OCR (or street number recognition) tasks for Google (Streetview). You can simply test that by restarting your router, using incognito mode and going to a website using reCAPTCHA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I DO know that specifically for the Google CAPTCHAs, it checks if you're logged in to a Google account and if your account has had suspicious activity recently. If no suspicious activity has been logged, you'll simply receive the check box, if there has, or you're not logged in, you'll get a more difficult prompt, such as the picture matching. </p>
<p>Try going to a site with a check box in an incognito tab and you'll see for yourself! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually read a paper about fooling the recaptcha system awhile ago.</p>
<p>When you get the check box you're getting one of several possible &quot;challenges&quot;. To get the box challenges you must pass automated tests such as checks for common frameworks commonly used with bots, not being from an IP that's failed a challenge or answered too many boxes on other web sites among other things. As mentioned above once the chance of you being a bot is assessed to be low before page loads then you get a simple challenge. Depending on these pre assessed factors (some which are only known to google) the difficulty of the captcha is determined.</p>
<p>So as mentioned above clicking the check box is easy and there are minimal protections such as mouse movement patterns and timings however, by the time you get the check box challenge it's been determined that the odds of you being a bit are so low that the test it's self can afford to be weak.</p>
<p>In this case text is the hardest challenge, images the medium challenge and the check box the minimal challenge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you solve this for the size of a telescope for the size a human in the visible light you get a telescope size of around 100m.

If you place two telescopes a kilometer apart and mathematically &quot;interfere&quot; what they're seeing (I believe it involves Fourier transforms), you'll end up with a single telescope with an effective aperture width of 1 km, thus giving you way sharper resolution.</p>
<p>Adaptive optics can also be used to cancel out atmospheric turbulence.</p>
<p>Theoretically, I'm quite sure interferometry could be used to see Armstrong and the lander. I don't believe it was possible in 1969, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
