		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your lips lacks sebaceous glands, which means unlike most of your skin it can't keep itself lubricated with natural oils.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> Sebaceous glands are the little oil producing 'pouches' that are at the base of each individual hair inside the hair follicle. The oil comes out of your pores and is there to keep your hair and skin lubricated, conditioned, pliable, and healthy. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong> Several folks have brought up fordyce spots. These <em>are</em> a sort of sebaceous gland associated with the lips, but they're only along the edge of the lips, or what is known as the &quot;vermilion border&quot; (these harmless spots are also found on the penis, scrotum, and labia). I am not a doctor but it doesn't seem like they're <em>as</em> well equipped to keep lips from chapping in many conditions, and the enzymes from our own saliva can override any benefit they may try to contribute if you lick your lips too much. The rest of the lips are high and dry, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong> Some fellas with beards have mentioned not having as much trouble with chapped lips since growing said beard. I'd never even considered this until now (girl here, can't beard) but I would believe that the oils from your beard would make it to your lips and keep them moisturized and happy. </p>
<p>Good discussion, everyone! And thanks for keeping me fact-checking. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The external covering of your lips is essentially a thin layer of skin. Like all skin, it can get dry. Poor hydration, sun exposure, and cold weather can all dry out and irritate your skin, lips included. When you lick your lips, you're rubbing your tongue over that skin and wearing it down through contact and saliva. Do that repeatedly, and your lips will dry out even more since saliva is not moisturizing, but rather is full of enzymes meant to break down food. Stay hydrated and keep chapstick on hand to prevent chapped lips and stay comfortable! :)</p>
<p>EDIT: I realize I made it sound as if saliva can break down skin. It can't. My point was more to note that saliva's purpose is not skin moisturization, but something else entirely. When you lick your lips, you make them wet, but it evaporates quickly. Through evaporation, even more moisture is pulled out of your lips. Don't lick your lips!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lips get chapped when they become dehydrated, or sun burnt, or go through too many hot/cold cycles (anecdotal). As has been noted, licking your lips exacerbates the problem, while a good lip balm helps a great deal. What has not been noted yet, that I have seen, is that a diet high in omega-3 containing fish, or omega 3/fish oil supplements seem to help a noticeably when taken in sufficient quantity - at least 1200mg per day. </p>
<p>I have always had a problem with chapped lips during the winter, but over the past year, I've been very regular in using omega 3 supplements, and my lips have, thus far, done wonderfully during this winter season. Gone from using lip balm 2-3x a day in past winters to less than once a week this winter. Worth a try and tons of other health benefits too! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your lips is thin and sensitive. It prone to drying out when you're dehydrated or when it's licked. The reason licking your lips causes chapping is because your saliva contains digestive enzymes that are designed to break down food and the acidity of saliva can really dry out your lips over time (I chronically lip my lips and I always have dry lips!).</p>
<p>The best way to make sure your lips aren't dry is by drinking plenty of water, moisturizing them, either with a lip balm or something like coconut oil, and stop licking them!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> You well-researched bitches making me look dumb, STOP IT! I now understand that saliva isn't acidic! I just assumed it was because of the digestive enzymes, I made the assumption it was acidic.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/26/140753048/kids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological" target="_blank">Article worth reading about this</a></p>
<p>Scientific evidence shows that children not only have a stronger preference for sugar than adults – but that sweet-tooth is hardwired from Day One.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the newborn can detect sweet and will actually prefer sweeter solutions to less sweet ones. The basic biology of the child is that they don't have to learn to like sweet or salt. It's there from before birth,&quot; explains Julie Mennella of the Monell Chemical Senses Center.</p>
<p>Unlike adults, who often find overly sugary things unpleasant, Mennella says kids are actually living in different sensory worlds than adults when it comes to basic tastes.</p>
<p>&quot;They prefer much more intense sweetness and saltiness than the adult, and it doesn't decrease until late adolescence. And we have some evidence they may be more sensitive to bitter taste,&quot; Mennella says.</p>
<p>A reason for this may be that a preference for sweet, caloric substances during rapid growth may have given children as an evolutionary advantage when calories were scarce. That notion is supported by the fact that sugar doesn't just taste good to children -– it actually makes them feel good, too.</p>
<p>Mennella's research has shown that sugar is a natural pain reliever in children, and many hospitals even put a sweet-tasting liquid in a baby's mouth during circumcisions or heel stick procedures to help lessen the pain.</p>
<p>When researchers gave adults and children water mixed with various amounts of sugar, adults preferred sugar concentrations similar to that of a can of soda, while finding higher concentrations too sweet. By comparison, children preferred at least twice that concentration, and younger children had virtually no limit.</p>
<p>&quot;You can keep putting sugar in to the point where you can't dissolve it in the water anymore and they still like it,&quot; says Sue Coldwell, a researcher at the University of Washington who has studied kids and sweets.</p>
<p>But there seems to be an age limit on the super-sized sugar preference.</p>
<p>Coldwell and her colleagues suspected that sugar preferences changed during adolescence. They checked a bunch of indicators, like body image and hormones, and then they checked bone growth. They gave the sugar-water test to adolescents while simultaneously measuring a marker of bone growth in their urine. What they found was that kids who were still growing preferred sweets. Those whose growth had already stopped –- around age 15 or 16 — had taste preferences similar to adults.</p>
<p>Exactly how this all works is still somewhat of a mystery, but Coldwell says that one important clue lies in the discovery that growing bones actually secrete hormones that can influence metabolism. Other well-known metabolic hormones like leptin and insulin have been shown to act on brain areas that control cravings and appetites, and even directly bind to the tongue, where they affect the preference for sweet tastes. Coldwell suspects that hormones from growing bones may be doing the same thing. In other words, it's not your kid's fault he raided the cookie jar – the hormones from his growing bones made him do it.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know for sure, but I am very suspicious that the bones are somehow telling either the brain or the tongue that there is energy needed for their growth and signaling for that preference to increase,&quot; says Coldwell.</p>
<p>That's not to say a kid can't overdo it. In a modern world of calorie overload and childhood obesity, cravings for sugar are no longer the evolutionary advantage they once might have once been. But if the goal is to get children to reduce their intake of sugar, researchers say understanding the biology behind their cravings is the first step.</p>
<p>TL:DR - They think we're genetically programmed to want sugar and that our intense childhood craving for sugar stops when our bones are finished growing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are some sickeningly sweet artificial candies I don't like, but I'm a 2.5 spoons of sugar in my coffee kind of guy. It frankly <em>baffles</em> my mind that people not only drink but <em>choose</em> to drink dry red wines and pay a lot of money for the privilege. Same with most beers, which are bitter and utterly irredeemable to me.</p>
<p>I once went to a wine tasting with several friends my age, and we all got flights of red wines. There was one that all of them were cooing on about how good it was, whereas to me it tasted just as bitter and tongue-numbing as the other reds. I honest-to-God thought they were fucking with me.  One of those same friends frequently can't stand sweet drinks I like, such as a vanilla cream soda or similar.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few theories. One is that children have less developed palates. Adults are able to appreciate the subtle and savory flavors of bitter foods. Kids dislike them because they can't taste the entire flavor profile, opting for simpler sweet foods. For adults, those sweet foods are overwhelming because they lack subtly. Another theory is that children crave sweets more because the body craves sugar when it's younger, at the point in development when humans need loads of diverse sugars.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In nature the most common sweet foods are fruits, which evolved to be sweet so animals eat them and spread seeds. Most bitter flavors in our food are produced by alkaloids, many of which are poisonous.  Therefore sweet foods are generally safer than bitter foods, because plants don't want to poison the animals that help them propagate.  Since children are smaller than adults and therefore can be poisoned more easily it makes sense for them to avoid bitter foods and be drawn to sweeter and therefore safer foods chemically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine clay, the prevalent soil type in that area, is incredibly fertile. Initially it is indeed salty and can only be used as meadows, but over the years rainfalls flushes the salt out and the land can be used to grow crops.</p>
<p>The quality of soil depends on the size of the particles that form the soil. Loosely speaking, smaller is better (actually medium size is best) and clay is small (still very good). Smaller grain size allows for more nutrients and water to be stored and available for plants. Also being below level has quite a few advantages as it guarantees that there's always sufficient water available. Wheat for instance is affected quite badly if there's a lack of water in certain critical stages of its life cycle.</p>
<p>This is especially obvious when compared to the land prevalent in the rest of the Netherlands which is mostly Geest. The term Geest is derived from Low Saxon and means <em>dry</em> or <em>empty</em> (devoid of plant life) and is <em>much</em> less fertile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thing that several of the other comments are missing is that most land that is now below sealevel was not actually reclaimed from the sea.</p>
<p>These have been swamplands or rather peat bogs for centuries. They would have been around sea level or above and protected by rows of dunes. Floods would have still happened, but that resulted in the deposit of marine or river clay.</p>
<p>In later stages the inhabatants started using these fertile lands for agriculture by draining off water. This resulted in the ground sinking &quot;inklinking&quot; by as many as 3 meters.</p>
<p>That gradually icreased the risk of floods, prompting to people to surround the land by dykes. These are most of the &quot;polders&quot; you see today.</p>
<p>Yet another type of polder - the &quot;droogmakerij&quot; - was land reclaimed from lakes or even later the sea. This started off by building dykes and a surrounding canal. Next the lake was pumped dry by using windmills or steam pumps. Next up were smaller canals inside the droogmakerij to maintain the water level. Schiphol airport is inside a droogmakerij and they are characterized by a square and larger scale layout of infrastructure.</p>
<p>These lakes were mostly man-made. After initially cultivating the land, the dried up peat &quot;turf&quot; proved to be a good fuel. So much of the soil was dug up that large lakes emerged, sometimes threatening or even swallowing villages.</p>
<p>If you fly over Holland you will still see several of these lakes and for some the &quot;ribs&quot; where the peat was dug out and dried can still be seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>Enclose the recovered land</li>
<li>Drain it of sea water</li>
<li>Install drainage canals and pipes - the salt at this point is being slowly washed away by the freshwater, both from the rivers and the rain.</li>
<li>Aerial sowing of reeds (tolerates the salty soil, further evaporates the water, reduces weed growth and conditions the land)</li>
<li>Burning of the reeds, ploughing (with some very serious equipment) and planting of rapeseed</li>
<li>Cycle through various grains, wheat, barley and then oats to further condition the soil</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have good arable land. You just need a lot of time and serious commitment. Now as someone else notes, the land is designed to be &quot;sacrificial&quot; in case of flooding. Roads and settlements are placed on slightly raised areas  so the farm land can be flooded to the depth of a metre or two without destroying roads and homes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obligatorily, pi is not infinite. In fact, it is between 3 and 4 and so it is definitely finite. </p>
<p>But, the decimal expansion of pi is infinitely long. Another number with an infinitely long decimal expansion is 1/3=0.33333... and 1/7=0.142857142857142857..., so it's not a particularly rare property. In fact, the only numbers that have a decimal expansion that ends are fractions whose denominator looks like 2^(n)5^(m), like 7/25=0.28 (25=2^(0)5^(2)) or 9/50 = 0.18 (50=2^(1)5^(2)) etc. So it's a pretty rare thing for a number to <em>not</em> have an infinitely long expansion since only this very small selection of numbers satisfies this criteria.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the decimal expansion for pi is infinitely long and doesn't end up eventually repeating the same pattern over and over again. For instance, 1/7 repeats 142857 endlessly, and 5/28=0.17857142857142857142857142..., which starts off with a 17 but eventually just repeats 857142 endlessly. Even 7/25=0.2800000000... eventually repeats 0 forever. There is no finite pattern that pi eventually repeats endlessly. We know this because the only numbers that eventually repeat a patter are rational numbers, which are fractions of the form A/B where A and B are integers. Though, the important thing about rational numbers is that they are fractions of two integers, not necessarily that their decimal expansion eventually repeats itself, <a href="http://www.skidmore.edu/~adean/MC2151401/Handouts/RationalRepeatingDecimals.pdf" target="_blank">you must <em>prove</em> that a number is rational if and only if its decimal expansion eventually repeats itself</a>.</p>
<p>Numbers that are not rational are called irrational. So a number is irrational if and only if its decimal expansion doesn't eventually repeat itself. This isn't a great way to figure out  if a number is rational or not, though, because we will always only be able to compute finitely many decimal places and so there's always a chance that we just haven't gotten to the part where it eventually repeats. On the other hand, it's not a very good way to check if a number is rational, since even though it may seem to repeat the same pattern over and over, there's no guarantee that it will continue to repeat it past where we can compute.</p>
<p>So, as you noted, we can't compute pi to know that it has this property, we'd never know anything about it if we did that. We must <em>prove</em> it with rigorous math. And there is a relatively <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1947-53-06/S0002-9904-1947-08821-2/S0002-9904-1947-08821-2.pdf" target="_blank">simple proof</a> of it that just requires a bit of calculus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a direct answer, but you might enjoy reading the brief book, &quot;A history of Pi&quot; by Beckman.  It's full of some pretty interesting lay stuff (which is why I enjoyed it) and typical of the genre of books that address key mathematical entities, like pi, e and infinity. David Foster Wallace wrote a short book on infinity, &quot;Everything and More&quot;, which is also a fun read and a good tour of relevant concepts.  Math, logic, philosophy are so tightly bound that it's always a reliable source of mystery to me to ponder math concepts... a peculiar form of engineering meditation, as it were.  It helps actually to have an appreciation of these things as they inform a lot of what makes humans human... our observation, invention, visualization, and creativity, expression and communication.  It's also humbling to know that some truths are so basic that they are still taught with examples and proofs that date from thousands of years ago and which were divined by people without the benefits of zero, positional notation, graphical representations (i.e., like the graph of a function, not a drawing of a triangle), etc.   The same brains as ours, working the same problems, 3000 years ago.   Euclid's Elements were the foundational textbooks of geometry and proof until well into the 1900's in classrooms worldwide.   Kind of amazing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Schmidt deceived American regulators “by offering reasons for the discrepancy other than the fact that VW was intentionally cheating on U.S. emissions tests, in order to allow VW to continue to sell diesel vehicles in the United States,” the affidavit said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said a different way, Schmidt actively lied and hid information from the US government. With the bankers intimately involved with the housing crash, there wasn't enough evidence to prove criminal wrong doing on their part. Their basic defense was that the they didn't think the toxic assets were actually toxic, instead relying on the professional opinions of credit rating agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify for all the replies, I personally think it's extremely likely that there was at least one banking executive that knowingly sold toxic assets. Furthermore, such people <em>should</em> be held responsibile. A big difference between the VW scandal and the housing bust is that the diffusion of responsibility was larger for the banks involved, whereas it was harder for VW.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The VW execs committed fraud (basically knowingly lying). Even worse, they lied to the government. If you commit fraud, it's a jailable offense. There was also a lot of proof. It's hard to accidentally design a system that just so happens to turn on during regulation testing. Can't really &quot;oops&quot; that.</p>
<p>What the bankers did was more complex. They didn't necessarily commit fraud, rather they were being kind of &quot;dumb&quot;(or if you prefer, risky). Being dumb isn't a crime. However, if everyone is dumb, it can really screw up the market when people start realizing it was dumb, even if it wasn't intentional.</p>
<p>It's possible that some did it knowing they were taking risk, but that's very hard to prove unless they were dumb enough to put it down on paper/email.</p>
<p>However, big banks have compliance offices. Basically they're the private &quot;police&quot; for the bank. They're supposed to make sure people who work at the bank don't go doing dumb stuff (but again, it can be hard to find. there's a lot of people involved, and judgement calls).</p>
<p>So what the SEC <em>can</em> do, is fine the bank itself, and say &quot;those guys were dumb. we can't tell (or care) if it was intentional, but you're supposed to make sure they don't take on too much risk&quot;.</p>
<p>In addition, when the SEC fines banks for being &quot;dumb&quot;, there is a lot of subjectivity for the prosecutor and judges to decide what is actually too dumb to be reasonable.</p>
<p>If everyone is buying something that is worthless, how do you prove that they're buying stuff that's worthless knowingly, to rip people off? Maybe they just think it's good.Everyone else is buying it,you know?</p>
<p>It's hard! And for the most part, a lot of banks didn't intentionally do risky stuff. It was an &quot;oops, hey guys, we just realized we're screwed.&quot;. It was an honest mistake. However, if enough banks all make the same mistake and go out of business, it can really mess with the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>The bankers who were dumb enough to say &quot;we know this is crap but we're selling it anyway&quot; did go to jail. For obvious reasons this is fairly rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with most white-collar crime is that it's often very hard to prove, not only who is responsible, but even that there was a crime at all.  The line between &quot;shady but legal&quot; and &quot;fucking criminal&quot; is extremely blurry.  It can be as tiny a difference as &quot;did you know that what you said was untrue?&quot;  If it was actually lying then it's fraud, a crime; if you simply didn't know and were bullshitting to make a sale, it's impossible to prove that there was any fraud; and if you just handed off responsibility and read the company line, it's shitty but legal.</p>
<p>In the case of the housing crash there's a large legal difference between fraud and incompetence.  When the bubble burst everyone washed their hands of responsibility, pointing the blame everywhere else.  It was impossible to say who had actually &quot;committed fraud&quot; and who was just going along with the prevailing culture.  That culture created a strong pressure not to look too closely at what was going on.  The people selling mortgages weren't the people selling the bonds, who weren't the people rating those bonds, who weren't the people repackaging those bonds, who weren't the people gambling on those bonds, etc.  People upstairs blamed the people downstairs, people downstairs blamed the people upstairs, they both blamed people outside, people outside blamed people inside....</p>
<p>Most of the people responsible for the crash were &quot;knowingly ignorant&quot; of the issues at hand.  It's almost impossible to believe they couldn't see the risks, but they also didn't care to actually look for them.  It's like covering your ears and singing when someone tells you bad news.  If you didn't hear it you're not lying when you don't repeat it, but at the same time you kinda know you're wrong.  After the crash we couldn't prove who had heard the bad news and lied about it and who had covered their ears and pretended everything was still okay.  Both are shitty, but only one is illegal.</p>
<p>Ultimately the issue isn't a lack of punishment after the fact.  It was a lack of oversight and regulation before the fact.  Oversight and regulation that haven't come and aren't likely to.  Just because nobody did anything illegal doesn't mean that what they did should have been legal.  And just because we can't now prove that there was anything illegal now doesn't mean that if we'd been watching more carefully we couldn't have spotted illegal behavior then.</p>
<p>With VW it was much easier to pinpoint who was lying.  That lie was what meant fraud, which meant jailtime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people here are commenting that Bankers did not commit any crimes.  This is incorrect.  A big example of this is how credit ratings agencies (S&amp;P, Moody's, etc) knowingly rated financial instruments as very secure investments when they knew those instruments were worthless.  You can read about this in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-sues-standard-poor-s-fraud-rating-mortgage-backed-securities-years-leading" target="_blank">civil lawsuit</a> filed by the justice department.</p>
<p>Why was this merely a civil lawsuit, and not criminal prosecution?  Quite simply, many wall street banks are &quot;Too big to jail.&quot;  Eric Holder testified about this in congress when referencing the HSBC scandal:</p>
<p>The report is available <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/07072016_oi_tbtj_sr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am concerned that the size of some of these [financial] institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy. And I think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large . . . I think it has an inhibiting influence—[an] impact on our ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate.9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at that, the ample evidence available to the justice department, and the lack of criminal prosecutions from the 2008 scandal, it's possible to connect the dots about what happened here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different ways of rating octane. The fuel is the same. </p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Research Octane Number (RON)
The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane.</p>
<p>Motor Octane Number (MON)
Another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), is determined at 900 rpm engine speed instead of the 600 rpm for RON.[1] MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, higher engine speed, and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel's knock resistance. Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern pump gasoline will be about 8 to 12 octane lower than the RON, but there is no direct link between RON and MON. Pump gasoline specifications typically require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Anti-Knock Index (AKI) or (R+M)/2
In most countries, including Australia, New Zealand and all of those in Europe,[citation needed] the &quot;headline&quot; octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and some other countries, the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI), and often written on pumps as (R+M)/2). It may also sometimes be called the Posted Octane Number (PON).</p>
<p>Difference between RON, MON, and AKI
Because of the 8 to 12 octane number difference between RON and MON noted above, the AKI shown in Canada and the United States is 4 to 6 octane numbers lower than elsewhere in the world for the same fuel. This difference between RON and MON is known as the fuel's Sensitivity,[4] and is not typically published for those countries that use the Anti-Knock Index labelling system.</p>
<p>See the table in the following section for a comparison.</p>
<p>Observed Road Octane Number (RdON)
Another type of octane rating, called Observed Road Octane Number (RdON), is derived from testing gasolines in real world multi-cylinder engines, normally at wide open throttle. It was developed in the 1920s and is still reliable today. The original testing was done in cars on the road but as technology developed the testing was moved to chassis dynamometers with environmental controls to improve consistency.[5]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your octane numbers and our octane numbers don't mean the same thing. From an engineering perspective the octane number is actually a kind of hilariously arbitrary number that basically boils down a bunch of different fuel qualities, that all both individually <em>and</em> collectively control a fuel's likelihood to knock, all into a single number, and because of that the precise testing for octane numbers changes depending on the body doing the regulation. So it would be entirely possible for two utterly identical batches of fuel to get different octane ratings when tested by different countries.</p>
<p>However, our fuels are also slightly different, as Europe is going to have a slightly different set of additives than we get in the US, but that doesn't really account for most of the difference; the differing standards do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What this does is show a &quot;lower&quot; octane rating for US gas in general compared to EU countries because in Europe they only calculate octane once (no /2).</p>
<p>As for WHY we don't make more other octane levels rather than the &quot;standard&quot; 87/89/91 is because of cost.</p>
<p>Not long ago I could go to <em>some</em> gas stations and fill up with 95 octane (Sunoco for example 20 years ago) if I so chose, but those days are long gone because no cars sold in the US require that much octane and nobody wants to spend extra money filling up with more octane than is required.</p>
<p>You CAN however go buy cans of octane boost if you choose at pretty much any auto store which advertise up to 101 octane per tank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Lower octane fuel will self ignite (without a spark) at lower pressure than higher octane fuel. Cars with engines that operate with high compression ratios (mostly turbo charged and otherwise high performance engines) need higher octane fuel so that the gas doesn't pre-ignite and screw up engine timing/efficiency/performance. Because if it pre-ignites the fuel in the cylinder, not all of the gas will burn off, so the exhaust mix is screwed up, which makes the sensors angry, and you use more fuel than you should, and you lose some output power. </p>
<p>As someone who has almost exclusively had German cars, and a former employee of a Volkswagen/Audi/Porsche dealer, I can tell you that there are very few German cars produced in the last 25 years or so that don't require high octane fuel, because of high compression. So this is a factor, as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, Netflix has quantified viewer interest. They've found a way to use the staggering amount of information gathered from their viewers over the years to pinpoint story concepts, genres, plot elements, directing and cinematic styles that have the best chance of success among their viewers. All of the star ratings, viewing habits, customer demographics, reviews, binge-watching habits for TV shows (and so, measurements of which TV shows keep your attention for the longest span of time), ALL of these factors have been meticulously collected and studied, and they've resulting in some of the biggest hits on &quot;TV&quot; such as Orange in the New Black, Stranger Things, House of Cards, etc.</p>
<p>This doesn't so much answer the question of how they figure how much money each TV shows has made them, but it does give you insight on how they meticulously calculate the financial impact of a TV/movie idea before producing it and releasing it as a Netflix original. Their models have been fairly accurate between projected and actual revenue generated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As they're always adding and removing and rotating content, they'll measure what's currently available or not available on its library (or things like what's recently been added or removed) against its current subscriber level (is it increasing or is it slowing down, or is there a big spike?). They'll be able to gauge data such as that to see what is making people sign up, cancel, stay a member for a short time, or stay for longer periods.</p>
<p>They test so much stuff that you don't realise. Changing little things like the description or thumbnail image of each movie or show across different users to see which are clicked and viewed most.</p>
<p>It's important to note with the subscription model that it's all about keeping customers for as long as possible, as obvious as that sounds. $10 a month for a subscription account doesn't sound like much but it's £120 a year. It's exactly why so many companies, such as Microsoft with its Office suite, or Adobe with their editing suites, have switched to the monthly subscription model.</p>
<p>For any company, all new customers take at least a small amount of time, resources or effort to acquire. It might cost Netflix an average of $10 to attract each new subscriber, so they need to get them to sign up for more than the initial month for that to be profitable for them (just basic example numbers). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HBO and Netflix do not have the same models, and that is important to understand. Netflix has direct subscribers who pull data (videos and playlist) directly from their servers. By categorizing all content and tracking viewer time in each content, they can know what kinds of things you like. This is the same as amazon being able to suggest things to you based on how you use the website and what you actually buy.</p>
<p>HBO, on the other hand, primarily has cable subscribers, where HBO is offered as part of larger packages. Thus, there is an interplay between the cable retailers who bundle and market channels into premium packages, and companies like HBO that actually package the viewing content.</p>
<p>That said, HBO, and all TV station, primarily are informed through home surveys, the Neilson ratings. These can be automated or paper, but basically a sample of the public is always being taken and comments on what they like and do not like. HBO also gets some data such as subscription rates and viewer statistics from regional cable companies, but this is nowhere near as detailed or accurate as what Netflix gets.</p>
<p>These days, the easiest way for HBO (and most companies without the advantage of netflix) to learn what people really like is to data mine the internet. They hire specialist to spend time on social media, figuring out what is popular, which of their products are popular, and also manipulating the market by being part of the conversation and/or inserting advertising.</p>
<p>This strategy works well as the target demographic are more tech savvy. HBO isn't advertising to 70 year olds, and now the average 50 year old can facebook. Still, the use of social media is much more limited in older demographics, so for those, more traditional data collection methods are more appropriate. A show aimed at 40 and younger, internet works very well.</p>
<p>HBO doesn't earn money per show, but rather per subscriber. So, a general sense of popularity is accurate enough. HBO also is realizing the power of content generation, which was not where they started. But in generating content, there certainly are risk. When a a show becomes populary, HBO will milk it for all it is worth, generating long running series. This mitigates the risk of creating or showing less popular material. </p>
<p>Predicting popularity is key, because your investment into building a show is heavily front laoded. So you do lots of research and testing and run ideas and scripts and sample performances by steadily larger samples. This is generalyl never public (sometimes seen on dvd extra material). In any case, once it is broadcast, the question becomes, is the show as popular with everyone as it was with our test audiences. If not, then they will just air the first few episodes (which are generally all paid for and with mostly sunk expenses by the time any announcement of an upcoming show is made.) If it seems popular (lots of people tuning into HBO, lots of talk on the internet) then they run with it. This is also why shows tend to jump the shark. It is easy to run with positive news, but very difficult to catch drops in interest and correct or end a series.  Netflix can more precisely measure interest and so do this a bit better, but they also can simply recommend whatever you like at that day, HBO can not know this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation/abuse where you deceive someone to the point where they begin to question their own reality and sanity. It is probably better explained via an example.</p>
<p>Let's say you had a brother growing up. Then, one day, you came home, and there was no trace of him. He isn't in any pictures, all of this things are gone, and no one you talk to recalls him.</p>
<p>Let's also say that this is a big deception. Everyone is in on the conspiracy. Your brother has moved away, your parents replaced all the pictures and got rid of all of his stuff, and everyone else is feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>But the deception is so thorough, and they are so adamant about the lie and stick to it so well that you begin to question your own memories of your brother to the point where you begin to consider not that everyone is lying to you, but that they are right and you are just crazy.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Some people are getting this confused with the Mandela Effect. I'll admit they are similar but there are some crucial differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They both involve questioning ones memories, but in the Mandela effect the memories are false, with Gas Lighting the memories are true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandela effect originates with the person experiencing the effect when confronted with a contrary but true reality. It is not fully understood and is a psychological phenomenon. Gas Lighting is a form of psychological abuse that originates externally, from the person presenting the false reality.</p>
</li>
<li>The Mandela effect is unintentional whereas Gas Lighting is malicious and deliberate.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT2:</p>
<p>Yes, the Asian-Jim joke in the Office is a humorous example of Gas Lighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to use a more feasible example than some of the ones above. Let's say you see your wife kissing a coworker at your office Christmas party. You're shocked and hurt, and don't know how to react, so you just stand there stunned for a second. Your coworker sees you and pulls your wife out of your sight line and into a room with people.</p>
<p>You follow and tell your wife you two need to talk. You ask her what's going on. She pretends she doesn't know what you're talking about. You say that you caught her kissing your coworker.</p>
<p>Then she says she's been in that common room with the large group of people all night. You must have seen him kissing someone else. Also, haven't you had a few drinks? And weren't you smoking a cigarette while some other coworkers were hitting a joint outside? Maybe that joint was laced with something weird, that one coworker is kind of sketchy. It feels like maybe you aren't in the best place to be <em>sure</em> that was her you saw. You two should go home, she'll drive since you're a little drunk. You aren't a little drunk, but you're mad and also want to leave, so you can talk about this more.</p>
<p>All night you argue, and all night she denies. You talk about breaking up, she calls you crazy and gets angry. You're angry too, but eventually you decide to sleep on the couch and deal with the logistics of probably breaking up the next day.</p>
<p>At first you're so sure. But then...you aren't. The next day, the memory is a little more faded. It was dark in that side room. If you ask your coworker, he'll probably deny too. So there's no point in asking him. Should you ask some other people that were in the common room? But then if you're wrong, or they didn't see, you'll look like kind of a crazy person in front of other coworkers.</p>
<p>Behind all of this, there's a big part of you that doesn't <em>want</em> this to be happening. Deep down, you kind of hope you're wrong. And eventually, you start to believe it. The more time passes, the more the memory fades, the less certain you can be. Your wife, meanwhile, is steadfast and resolute in her rightness, and angry at you for questioning her fidelity. Maybe you'll always sort of know what you saw, but you'll never be able to really talk about it without sounding crazy and you'll never act on it.</p>
<p>This is gaslighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was in a relationship with a guy who gaslighted me constantly for almost two years. It would range from small things like he would ask for a cup of tea and then when brought it deny he ever asked for one. We would argue about things and he would say the most horrible, malicious things to me, but when I brought them up later he would twist everything to make it seem like I was the sole aggressor in the argument so I would end up apologising to him instead of getting the apology from him that I needed. We would make plans together but then when it came to it he would deny any knowledge of it. One time we were out with friends and I gave a guy he didn't like a hug/said hello, and he later accused me of kissing this person (which I absolutely did not and would not do), insisting that I was drunk and I didn't remember and that all of our friends witnessed it. This blew into a huge argument and he kept making up more elaborate scenarios and continuing to insist I was so drunk I didn't remember (I wasn't that drunk and I remembered everything, though by the end of the argument I started to believe him). One of the most bizarre instances was that he got a couple of books for Christmas once, and when I was gathering my books from the house to move out he insisted that they were my books so I should take them, and began to get angry, which led me to question my sanity even as I was moving out and so I took the books, but that was one of the most fucking weird occurrences in the entire relationship. He was also repeatedly physically aggressive, often for no apparent reason, but afterwards would claim that I started the fight, that he never hit me, that I needed help/I was making it up/was losing my mind. </p>
<p>When I first met him I was quite confident, outgoing, fun-loving. After two years I was an agitated nervous wreck, having regular panic attacks, in a pit of despair and depression, genuinely believing that maybe he's right, maybe I am crazy, questioning all my friendships (because he did a very good job at making other people believe I was crazy as well as myself) which led to me pushing many of my friends away because I didn't trust them anymore, blaming myself for every argument we had and desperately seeking forgiveness because I believed he was the only person I had left. It's a process of slowly chipping away at a persons sense of self and their sanity until they no longer even believe or trust their own thoughts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia: &quot;Gaslighting is a form of manipulation through persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying in an attempt to destabilize or delegitimize a target. Its intent is to sow seeds of doubt in their targets, hoping to make them question their own perception, memory, and sanity.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a common tactic used by abusers. </p>
<p>In simpler terms: Person A (usually a narcissist or sociopath) does something harmful or wrong to another, often dependent/trusting Person B. When B tries to call out A or question them concerning the wrongful act, A insists that B was misunderstanding or misremembering the situation and blowing things out of proportion, even though B was really in the right. Over a period of time, B will begin to doubt themselves and will be less capable of addressing any abusive or harmful situations because, after all, they have a history of &quot;blowing things out of proportion.&quot; Person A is now free to continue to harm B and get away with it so long as no outside party that has not been gaslit notices what's going on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.&quot;</p>
<p>In your opinion, SHOULD we bring back a dinosaur? And more broadly, what are the most significant ethical dilemmas associated with that kind of endeavor?</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Pilcher! This is coming at it from an odd angle, but your self description intrigued me. I'm a high school senior who's about to go into college, with a STEM education background and a love for writing and comedy. I'm struggling to balance a &quot;safer&quot; science career with a much riskier desire to write or perform comedy. </p>
<p>My question(s): How did you get into science writing? What tips would you have for someone looking into science writing and/or writing comedy? What's been your experience in balancing arts and sciences?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we are crying, our body is essentially in a state of stress. Stress activates our sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for the fight or fli8ght response. This increases blood flow and respiration. To allow for the extra respiration, a muscle called the glottis opens up for more air to pass through. Now when you need to swallow it creates tension in this muscle, resulting in that lump-like sensation.
Edit: Spelling</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I looked it up for you OP! According to <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/a-lump-in-your-throat/" target="_blank">this website</a>, the autonomous nervous system helps deal with emotions and stress. Part of its job is to help us breath more easily (in case we need fight/flight reflex) by opening up your throat. When we swallow, it is an opposing motion that registers as a 'lump'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the autonomic nervous system which deals with non conscious actions. It's just the way it responds to emotional stress, it stretches the grottos and when you try to swallow it causes the lump feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
