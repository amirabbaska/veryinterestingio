		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can easily cultivate many mushrooms, like the common button mushrooms, oyster and shiitakes, and even psychedelic ones like liberty caps or cubensis.  What makes these mushrooms easy to cultivate is that they are happy living in their preferred medium: soil for some, like the buttons or liberty caps, or on dead wood like oysters and shiitake.</p>
<p>Truffles are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza" target="_blank">mycorrhizal</a>, which means they are dependent on a symbiotic relationship with the roots of specific plants, in this case trees.  While we can certainly spread truffle spores in areas where the right trees grow, that relationship can't be forced, and it can take years for the mycelium to intergrow with the tree roots to the point that the mycelium is healthy and strong enough to fruit.</p>
<p>Even if this condition is met, most mushrooms require specific environmental conditions in order to fruit, so you've got to have the right climate, altitude, seasonal amounts of moisture, etc.  </p>
<p>This is the same reason that other mycorrhizal mushrooms like chanterelles are not cultivated on a large scale: they require very specific symbiotic relationships that cannot be forced or rushed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		</h2>
		<!--<span class="date">2017-05-14</span>-->
		<span class="is-new">NEW</span>
	</div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a guy on reddit who insists that the Lense-Thirring effect (L-T) somehow causes the orbital plane of a planet to align with the equatorial plane of the (rotating) star about which the planet orbits. Similarly, the orbital plane of a moon would align itself with the equatorial plane of its host planet, assuming the planet is spinning. He cites <a href="http://philica.com/display_article.php?article_id=281" target="_blank">this paper</a> to support his thesis.</p>
<p>From what I've read about L-T, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9704065.pdf" target="_blank">this is not the case</a>: the orbital inclination, or the angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane, remains the same. However, the orbital plane precesses about the axis of rotation of the star. And there's also nodal precession, too, but that also doesn't affect the angle of the orbital plane.</p>
<p>The one case where L-T <em>does</em> result in something aligning itself with the equatorial plane is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1975ApJ...195L..65B" target="_blank">in the accretion disks of Kerr black holes</a>: if (for some reason) an accretion disk forms that is out of alignment with a fast-rotating black hole, L-T causes the the orbital planes at different distances to precess at different rates, which causes shearing in the viscous mass of the accretion disk, and as the disk relaxes into a lower energy state, it will end up in the same plane as the plane of rotation of the black hole. But this is due to internal friction within the disk, and that is not a significant factor in ordinary orbital mechanics involving stars, planets, moons, and even rings.</p>
<p>Is he right, or am I? Or are we both wrong?</p>
<p>Edit: concise answers such as &quot;you are right&quot;, although appreciated, tend to be too short and will be pruned by automod unless there is some additional supporting argument. Let's not be lazy!</p></div></div>

<p>That is not a paper, that is a text published on something similar to a web forum, by <a href="http://philica.com/advancedsearch.php?author=4682" target="_blank">an author</a> who posted various nonsense articles there.

<p>&quot;Your surgery will be done by our new surgeon. Don't worry, he never did surgery before, but he finished all his college biology courses!&quot;</p>
<p>Lense-Thirring does not change the inclination, and even the precession effect is negligible for the solar system. It is of the order GS/(c^2 r^(3)) where S is the angular momentum of the central mass. For the Sun and Mercury, we get a time scale of 100 billion years (<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+pi*((speed+of+light\)%5E2+*+(58+million+km\)%5E3\" target="_blank">calculation</a>)%2F((gravitational+constant)<em>2</em>10%5E41+kg+m%5E2%2Fs))).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Since the moon doesn't align with earth's equatorial plane, then the L-T effect doesn't require moons to orbit on the equatorial planes of their planets.</p>
<p>There might be something to the idea that the L-T effect caused the  early sun's accretion disk to orbit on its equatorial plane, which is why the planets tend to orbit very close to the ecliptic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently doing a masters astrophysics course where we touched on the L-T effect during a black holes module. I am inclined to agree that you are correct (in fact, your explanation is a nice clear one). </p>
<p>Though just to clarify: the L-T effect causes a precession of the plane of an inclined orbit, like a spinning coin on a table top. The inclination is affected by dissipation of energy in the disc (from different orbital radii precessing at different rates). In our coin analogy, though it is spinning, it only falls down because of friction dissipating energy.</p>
<p>So, the L-T effect may have had some impact in the early solar system with regards to the protoplanetary dust disc. But without a source of dissipation, the L-T can do nothing more than precess an orbit, not change the inclination. Does it precess the moon? Yes, it probably does on some level. However the masses of the Earth and the Moon are so tiny that the L-T effect may as well not exist (especially when compared with the much more important tidal forces present in planetary systems). </p>
<p>I've had a quick look through the first paper, and I don't really trust any of it at all. It doesn't seem to have been referenced by anyone and the whole thing seems off. The arguments they've used don't seem to add up either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1: There are plenty of people who are first generation legal immigrants, you can't go by appearance, language, or mannerisms.</p>
<p>2: companies hiring illegals tend to do so in to positions that are not exactly customer facing (ie: farming, janitorial work, construction, factory workers, etc.) so you probably wouldn't see them anyway.</p>
<p>3: Some illegals use falsified information to appear to be citizens, so even the companies don't necessarily know they hired illegals either.</p>
<p>If it ever comes in to the news that a company has been using illegal labor, it's usually as part of a story where they were caught and the government is either detaining the illegal immigrants for deportation proceedings, or investigating the company in question to see if they can be fined(or both) so there's little point in further punishing them via boycotts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In pre-relativistic gravity, the gravitational field due to a single point mass is non-zero everywhere the field is defined. So the gravitational force on some test mess is never zero.</p>
<p>However, for an extended gravitating mass, there is <em>always</em> at least one point where the gravitational field is exactly <strong>0</strong>. Precisely, if ϱ(<strong>r</strong>) is some mass distribution with ϱ continuous and compactly supported (the latter means that ϱ = 0 for |<strong>r</strong>| &gt; <em>R</em> for some <em>R</em>), then there exists at least one point <strong>r**<em><em>0</em></em> where </strong>g<strong>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>0</em></em>) = </strong>0<strong>. For the case where ϱ is spherically symmetric, one such point is </strong>r<strong> = </strong>0** (e.g., the center of a spherically symmetric planet).</p>
<p>In general relativity, there is no such thing as the gravitational field and thus no such thing as the gravitational potential. There are only some inexact analogues (e.g., Christoffel symbols and metric tensor components, respectively). It's always possible in some frame to set up coordinates in such a way that a particular point the metric tensor components are the same as those of the flat Minkowski metric and the Christoffel symbols vanish at that point. So in that sense, the &quot;gravitational field&quot; is zero. This can even be done so that a free-falling observer always observes &quot;zero gravitational field&quot; along his worldline. This is just a locally inertial frame.</p>
<p>So what does that mean for the latter part of your question? Your argument goes something along the following lines. &quot;The gravitational force between two particles is never zero. So if the universe is infinite, how is it also expanding? If the universe is finite, how can it expand it forever?&quot; This reasoning erroneously mixes concepts from both pre-relativistic gravity and general relativity, so, of course, there is a contradiction. The two theories are already known not to be compatible anyway. The point is that there really is no good way to explain why the equations of GR give us an expanding universe.</p>
<p>If the universe is filled with some homogeneous matter field, then in pre-relativistic gravity, there is actually no solution to the Poisson equation. If you want to be very technical, I suppose the gravitational field would actually be <strong>0</strong> everywhere because if we assume the mass distribution is fixed, then any test mass will feel no force. Any force it feels in any particular direction is canceled by an equal force in the opposite direction. The problem with this reasoning is that the mass distribution is <em>not</em> fixed. Even in Newtonian gravity, the mass distribution will interact with itself. So the problem of a space filled homogeneously with matter is ill-defined in Newtonian gravity.</p>
<p>In GR, however, a homogeneous matter field <em>does</em> lead to a well-defined problem. The solution is the well-studied FLRW mertic. In fact, the prediction of metric expansion is very surprising since there is no analagous problem in Newtonian gravity, or, at best, the solution is very unstable. But, again, there's no reason to have expected the relativistic problem to have anything whatsoever to do with the ill-defined problem in Newtonian gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;public&quot; numbers are estimates, not firm numbers. In the case of public companies' founders, CEO's, etc. there are public disclosures of share ownership and that typically accounts for the vast majority of their net worth so it's used as proxy. There are also public disclosures like stock sales, there might be records of other investments they've made, etc. and the pieces are cobbled together to get an estimate.</p>
<p>For example, if billionaire X owns 50 million shares in the company he founded and it's trading at $100 then we know they are worth at least $5 billion. Maybe they've sold off 10 million shares over the years for living expenses and diversification clearing $600 million, and they've also bought 2 houses worth $20 million, a plane worth $50 million, invested $100 million in other companies and those holdings are now worth $400 million, etc. So they're worth an estimated $6 billion. Maybe it's off -- maybe they blew hundreds of millions gambling, or maybe they invested in Apple options and made a couple extra billion. So it's just an estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In other cases a lot of their net worth comes from owning publicly traded stocks, and if you own enough stock in a publicly traded company then that is public information. Sometimes the wealth is also tied up in charitable foundations (like with Bill Gates) and those organizations' finances are public if they're non-profits. For wealthy people who own privately held companies, reporters interview people and get access to what information they can (property owned by them, companies owned by them, etc) to make an educated guess.</p>

<p>However, that leaves out private holdings such as partnerships or stock that is not publicly traded. In such cases, not only do we not know a person's percentage of ownership but we have to estimate the value of the holding.</p>
<p>It also leaves out any debt. Generally speaking that isn't required to be disclosed since it's a personal relationship with the creditor.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is a good example of someone whose wealth has always been hard to estimate with any real confidence because he has always had plenty of both private holdings and debt. He probably doesn't know his own net worth with any precision to speak of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Professional sports players salaries are public. A CEO has stock, it is disclosed in SEC filings and has to be disclosed when it is sold too.

The information is public because there is a public interest to prevent insider trading in the stock market. </p>
<p>If you work for the state many will also have publicly available records for teacher salaries listed by employee name. So if you know where to look, you can actually find out the information for average joe as well. If you know what job a person has at a certain employer, and you look at job sites that list average salaries for the position you can generally figure out what an average person makes too.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;bait car&quot; is indistinguishable from a regular car as far as any passer-by can determine. So it doesn't entice or deter any more or less than any other car. It just happens to be being watched and may have a trap. This is &quot;fair game&quot; in every sense.</p>
<p>If the cop handed someone some keys and said go get that car for me, strongly implying that the car belonged to them and that they were authorizing its retrieval, then &quot;sprung the trap&quot; then they've done more than set out bait... they've shoved someone into the trap under pretense of permission.</p>
<p>Same as well if the car had a sign on its roof that said &quot;Free Car&quot; or &quot;Ride-share Experiment, drive me&quot;.</p>
<p>Same as well if the cop shoved the person into the car from off-camera and then locked the doors.</p>
<p>Crime is about motive.</p>
<p>If the bait doesn't induce, if it doesn't provide motive beyond innocent circumstance, then it's fine.</p>
<p>Something that spurs motive or acts as coercion or inducement is unfair for inserting motive that wasn't there before.</p>
<p>Similarly if you steal a car because it's your only means of escaping a pursuing axe-murderer then it stops being a real theft because the motive wasn't to deprive someone of their property, it was an exigent attempt to escape immanent threat.</p>
<p>Now if you steal my car and lock me out and drive off while we are <em>both</em> fleeing the axe murderer then things get complicated. Did you know I was there? Did you have reason to believe I'd already been axed? Did you throw me under the bus as bait? Did I say &quot;go on without me!&quot; or did someone else say that and you thought it was me? Were you &quot;no longer in your right mind&quot; because of fear or blood loss (maybe you got lightly axed earlier)? Did you have reason to believe that I'm the axe murderer or that I was working in league with him?</p>
<p>Which is why we have trials where facts and circumstances and motives and such must be weighed.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the much more egregious problem of plea bargaining, which replaces the measure of facts, circumstances, and motives with a game of chicken between an individual and the entire weight of government prosecution.</p>
<p>But that's a completely different and more important question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You've pointed out how poorly worded the phrase &quot;bait car&quot; is. The police identify areas with high car theft rates and the types of cars the thieves target. Then they place cars based on this profile, and wait until a thief breaks into it. They are indistinguishable from just a regular car in the neighborhood. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Entrapment means that they offered a crime to someone, which is inadmissible in a court of law. It is unfair because someone might not have committed a crime if it were not for the offer. If a cop walks up to someone and say, &quot;would you like to buy drugs&quot;, the person may not be a criminal, not looking for drugs, and might be intimidated by the offer and pay the money to not get harrassed by what he believes is a drug dealer. Same like if a cop comes up to someone and says, &quot;Lets go steal a car&quot;, the other person will be going along with the crime that was offered to them.</p>
<p>Bait on the other hand catches people who are looking to commit a crime. A female police officer dresses up like a hot chick and stands on the corner with known prostitutes. She is not offering sex for money, just dressed like everyone else and standing around.   When a person approaches her and offers money for sex, that person is actively seeking a prostitute, not being coerced into it. </p>
<p>A car parked on the side of the road is just that, a car on the side of the road. Whether police put it there, or the average citizen, it is still ultimately just a car sitting there. If someone comes by and tries to steal it, then the intent is on the person stealing the car.</p>
<p>If a cop dresses up like a stoner and hangs out, he is not offering anybody drugs, he is not enticing anyone, he is just dressed a certain way in a certain place. When someone tries to buy weed off him, they are committing a crime by trying to purchase drugs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/gordonmessmer gets the &quot;what&quot; down, but misses some of the &quot;why&quot;.</p>
<p>Microsoft's strategy to keep customers captured in &quot;The Microsoft Ecosystem&quot; was &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot;. They used (and still use) it to insert themselves into other positions and then compel upgrades and bankruptcies.</p>
<p>So, for example, Microsoft would often give free versions of MS Office to the president of a company. Then none of his underlings could read his output unless he used &quot;save as -&gt; older version&quot;. This would frustrate the boss so eventually he'd demand to know how to &quot;fix this problem&quot;, but wouldn't want to downgrade himself. Downgrades would feel so last-year and all his stuff would have to be systematically opened and re-saved with that save as older version. So eventually the boss would order an expensive upgrade of the whole company.</p>
<p>Now there is no reason that Office had to work this way. With a little planning the &quot;doc file&quot; format could have been reasonably future-proofed into a forward/backward compatible core. But this was a useful strategy.</p>
<p>Now expand that across businesses. If I can get your biggest customer to upgrade, then either you have to upgrade or you have to keep telling your customer to go back and save as -&gt; older format everything they send you. And now you look hopelessly out of date. So now you have to upgrade.</p>
<p>Also include the fact that &quot;forward thinking&quot; Bill Gates famously declared that the internet would never happen in any meaningful scale. (He really wasn't particularly smart about technology, he was just one of the bastards that knew how to manipulate people.) So Microsoft was <em>very</em> late to the party. (EDIT: On looking for citations, this Bill Gates comment may be apocryphal. Microsoft was very late to the internet party, having just hoovered up Berkeley sockets and TCP/IP stack already developed by Berkeley and Apple under the BSD license. Windows had Server Message Block &quot;SMB&quot; networking, but that was premises only and could not be routed in any meaningful way. So windows did networking early, but it was very late in terms of any kind of Internet Protocols.)</p>
<p>So HTML is, among other things, a document format. It can pretty much display any document you can imagine. Not decode any save file, but produce the formats and layouts of an intended vision.</p>
<p>The actual intent of this vision, this HTML format, was to make document storage universal and accessible. It just so happened to &quot;also&quot; let documents refer to each other. But the true goal was to make the &quot;doc format&quot; obsolete.</p>
<p>The internal layout of all document data would be controlled by a data file format that was controlled by public committee and that <em>anybody</em> - company or individual - could write a word processor to manipulate equally.</p>
<p>What a disaster for Microsoft!</p>
<p>This would completely invalidate the whole MS Office model. There'd be no way to control who used what version of who's word processor, or spreadsheet, or whatever if everyone knew exactly what every byte of every data file meant.</p>
<p>With no &quot;secret sauce&quot; there was no need to buy Microsoft at all.</p>
<p>So, late to the game, MS did whatever it could to get <em>any</em> browser. They gave it away for free - not just to screw Spyglass, which was a bonus, but to make sure that everybody would &quot;suddenly&quot; have <em>their</em> browser.</p>
<p>Then MS integrated &quot;explorer&quot; and &quot;internet explorer&quot; into all their applications so that you literally could not remove their browser without rendering your system basically useless.</p>
<p>Then, having pulled &quot;market dominance&quot; out of their collective ass, they started making Internet Explorer &quot;Work Different&quot; than the standard. IF you pulled up anything in IE, compared to any other browser, you wouldn't see the same result.</p>
<p>The implication there would be that the other browser was &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>
<p>Nobody could afford to go into for-profit business against MS' deep pockets and free price tag. (This is why Mozilla is a not-for-profit foundation instead of a business. etc.)</p>
<p>Nobody could do anything but <em>guess</em> about the secret alterations that I.E. used.</p>
<p>Everybody who used a standards compliant browser would get different results than all the people using I.E.</p>
<p>This <em>almost</em> gave Microsoft defacto control over the internet. It <em>almost</em> worked.</p>
<p>Then Microsoft released some really atrocious and really insecure stuff for authoring web pages that were, in turn, really atrocious and insecure. Their I.E. gambit opened a gaping pipeline from &quot;the internet&quot; to the heart of windows and so your data.</p>
<p>One could craft internet URLs to delete files, install software, and do all sorts of harmful things.</p>
<p>The very ubiquity and thoughtless integration that worked as the sharp edge of the wedge in Microsoft's strategy to control the internet through shear numbers was basically thwarted by the fact that the internet is full of assholes. And thank god for those assholes really, we wouldn't have the internet of today if Microsoft had &quot;won&quot;.</p>
<p>So the Price and Penetration were there, and the war seemed all but over, and then the worms came to eat the dead flesh from Microsoft's scheme. (That's what scavengers are for.) The completely insecure Windows platform with I.E. which gave any remote actor control of the Windows kernel at the load of a page, was just <em>too</em> juicy a target.</p>
<p>So people started losing whole hard drives when their friends didn't and they asked how and why. Well the users of the not integrated browsers were not anywhere near as susceptible to penetration.</p>
<p>Which is sort of funny. Those other browsers were struggling to be just as bad as I.E. Their developers <em>wanted</em> to offer &quot;ActiveX&quot; and the undocumented OLE extensions and match the &quot;special&quot; formatting rules but those were secret. So Microsoft had literally locked their opponents out of the chance to make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>So at that point Microsoft is playing catch-up in the security realm. Trying all they could to turn the inherently insecure Windows into something that wouldn't burst into flames the instant it went online.</p>
<p>And the other browser makers are trying to get their products to burn exactly the same way I.E. did because they were seen as failing to do what I.E. did -- e.g. break the rules in those secret ways and open all those convenient security holes.</p>
<p>But the users were switching away to Mozilla, and eventually FireFox and such, because it was <em>safer</em>.</p>
<p>Once enough people were using &quot;not I.E&quot; the differences between I.E. and the rest of the world were finally seen as true flaws in I.E. That is, with Mozilla, FireFox, Safari, Opera, Konqueror, and all the rest showing results one way, and poor old Microsoft showing them some other way, the user base started to understand that it was I.E. that was broken.</p>
<p>Soon there were &quot;I.E. emulation&quot; check boxes and extensions in other browsers one could click to best-guess emulate the broken behavior of I.E. and now Microsoft was suddenly the one limping along. They needed to both fix the security holes <em>and</em> fix their implementation to meet the open and published standards. They also had to do it in a way that didn't break their whole operating system. So for more than half it's life (from IE 5 until now, which is IE 12 or 13) Microsoft's browser has been trying to recover from their own attempt to steal and lock-down the internet behind a wall of secrets.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if they'd succeeded then they could pull out patents to kill anybody who lived through the wars. Once Microsoft had &quot;extended&quot; the internet with their secrets, they could &quot;extinguish&quot; anybody who dared to make a compatible browser.</p>
<hr />
<p>As an aside, these wars are not over. We've still got the Word/Office problem. Microsoft still has their secret sauce strategy at work.</p>
<p>When governments started to demand open document formats so that they could use any software they wanted Microsoft paid a bunch of people to join the <del>IEEE</del> ISO so that they could control the Open Document Formats and inject proprietary vendor extensions tags.</p>
<p>So Microsoft's &quot;.docx&quot; format is just as bad as &quot;.doc&quot; for having secret sauce. There is a &quot;vendor extension tag&quot; (or set there-of) that lets Microsoft say &quot;sure, we store our documents in the standard format like your law requires&quot; but if you say &quot;so how do we read that chunk there?&quot; they can say &quot;that's private&quot;.</p>
<p>It's the same bullshit of embrace, extend, extinguish but it turns out that you can only cram so much stupidity into those little chunks so it's a slog.</p>
<hr />
<p>So the browser wars was all about whether one company would be able to dictate what software you could use on the internet, first by subterfuge and then second by patent law. They were stopped at &quot;first&quot; because the internet is not just full of assholes, but some of those assholes had a sense of the stakes at hand.</p>
<p>This didn't save the best of the best (WordPerfect) or let innovation flourish (Quatro Pro) in all areas, but it did stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>So like any war, it was an attempt by the powerful to take land and things from people who had worked to create them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some useful perspective can be gained by looking at when the browsers were originally released, and considering the context that provides.</p>
<p>Netscape Navigator, December 1994:  Navigator was a commercial product, sold for profit.  A number of developers of NCSA Mosaic (which was mostly free of charge) left NCSA in order to capitalize on the commercial opportunities in developing Internet software.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer, August 1995: Microsoft licensed the Spyglass browser (a descendant of NCSA Mosaic) for inclusion in Windows.  According to internal memos, Bill Gates was concerned that the spread of networked content rendered in a standard fashion threatened to &quot;commoditize the underlying operating system.&quot;  That is, if information could be viewed equally well on any platform, revenue for Windows was threatened.  As an interesting note, Microsoft licensed the browser from Spyglass in exchange for a percentage of their profits.  Microsof then gave away the browser, cheating Spyglass of any revenue.  Spyglass sued them, and won a pittance.  Early versions of IE were a stop-gap while Microsoft wrote their own browser that wouldn't be subject to license terms with Spyglass.  All of this, more than anything else, is the essential reason for the browser wars.</p>
<p>Tangentially related, and also of interest, perhaps, are the Halloween documents: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents</a></p>
<p>KHTML (Konqueror), November 1998: Free Software (Linux and BSD) desktops did have access to Netscape, but didn't have good Free browsers.  The KDE project set out to produce a usable mostly-Free desktop (they used a proprietary graphics library), including a web browser.</p>
<p>Safari, January 2003: Before Safari, Mac OS was dependent on Microsoft to provide IE.  At this point, Internet access was essential for any computer, and reliance on IE meant that Apple was dependent on their primary competitor, which was leverage that Microsoft could use against them in any negotiations.  Apple forked the Free Software KHTML components and used them to make Safari and WebKit.</p>
<p>Firefox, November 2004: After AOL acquired Netscape, various changes were made to the browser in an attempt to drive revenue for AOL projects.  The AOL Instant Messenger was bundled, for example, and Netscape's pop-up blocking (which served to block advertisements) was very briefly removed before outrage from users brought it back.  Several developers forked a new code branch to build a new light-weight browser that was focused on user needs rather than driving revenue for the parent company.</p>
<p>Chrome, September 2008: Google derives most of its revenue in whole or in part using advertising in search results, or ads that are targeted based on information they gather from what users search for.  It is vital to them that they are the default search engine in most browsers, and they release a new browser of their own (also descended from WebKit, and hence, KHTML).  That browser is highly standards compliant, and being an advertising agency, Google is in an excellent position to market it to a broad internet base.</p>
<p>As a Free Software advocate, I like to point out from time to time that while GNU/Linux still has a relatively small market share, software originally written for GNU/Linux systems powers virtually all of the browsers people use on a regular basis: Chrome, Safari, Android's browser, and iOS's browser all descend from KHTML.  The only other brower that matters, Firefox, wasn't GNU/Linux specifically, but was Free Software since </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're free, but they can still make the parent money, or serve some purpose.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer</strong> - only available on Windows. Windows costs money, even if it comes with the computer the manufacturer had to pay for it. So if IE is a preferred browser, people need to give Microsoft money to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Chrome</strong> - Chrome reports usage statistics back to Google, and ties very conveniently into lots of other Google products and services. Google makes most of its money on ads, and the more data they have about people the more relevant ads they can show.</p>
<p><strong>Firefox</strong> - probably the most altruistic of the browsers. Mozilla Foundation is nonprofit, and it's original drive of creation of FF was to break the IE stranglehold of the 90s and provide a free, standards-compliant browser that'd behave consistently on any OS.</p>
<p><strong>Safari</strong> - no idea, but they must be making it for some reason. Anyone else wanna chime in?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short: Dominance. </p>
<p>Microsoft made it to monopoly with this strategy: Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. They want to dominate the market so they are the only one who offers a service, and by default they can decide what happens and furthermore, what other products work in which way.</p>
<p>If you do business you <em>need</em> Office. You need to buy it. For that you <em>need</em> Windows. There simply is no alternative. </p>
<p>MS tried and tries the same with the browser market and as such with the internet, they want to dominiate all and everything, so anything that is sold is by them or through their policies. Achieving the same dominance on the net-market the same as they have with desktops failed, but they are big enough to keep trying.</p>
<p>The same worked for Apple very well. If you are in the Apple world, you are in a golden cage. No matter what one thinks about it, it is financially very good for Apple. </p>
<p>In a way it is the same with google, they want internet-world-domination, as that increases they ability to control what you see (ads), which is financially very good for them. </p>
<p>Add a few odd competitors who do it for &quot;ideology&quot;, as Firefox.</p>
<p>The question &quot;Why is the browser war waged?&quot; is basically the question &quot;Why want companies utterly dominate your access to the internet?&quot; and the answer to that is &quot;To press everyone else out and finally make all the money&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was because Microsoft tried very hard and pulled some dirty tricks to get a monopoly.</p>
<p>So to build web pages it should be an open standard meaning if you coded a web page in HTML it really shouldn't matter what web browser you use or even what Operating system you use.</p>
<p>Microsoft saw this as a threat , looking ahead tons of people use their computer as just a web browser machine. If all you do on a computer is open a web browser and browse the web, Microsoft loses its dominance. You can use Apple, or Linux, of FreeBSD or andriod to do that.</p>
<p>So back in the day Microsoft tried to do several things that made it so web browsers would only work in IE, if all webpages only work in IE Linux, android and even apple could be crippled .</p>
<p>So lots of people fought really hard for open web standards . Open web standards would allow any web browser running any OS to work.</p>
<p>Microsoft tried really hard  to make it so lots of web pages would only render correctly in IE or use activeX what would force people to use IE what would force people to use windows.</p>
<p>If they would have succeeded Android or linux would have been crippled. Would anyone use an O/S that you couldn't browse the web in?</p>
<p>Also apply would be at their mercy , all they would have to do is pull IE from apple  and they would be crippled</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't possible with passive optics. You can see this by appealing to entropy. Unpolarized light is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state#Mixed_states" target="_blank">mixed state</a>, while polarized light, whether linear or circular, is a pure state. The entropy of a pure state is always lower than the entropy for a mixed state. </p>
<p>So to go from unpolarized light (a mixed state) to polarized light (a pure state) at the same intensity, you would need to decrease entropy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
