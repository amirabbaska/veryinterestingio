		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>remember there is <em>no such thing as absolute speed</em> - <em>except for the speed of light</em></p>
<p>things only move at some speed <em>relative to an imaginary reference point in space</em></p>
<p>for example, how fast are you moving <em>right now</em>?</p>
<p>you're sitting in an office chair, so your speed is 0, right?  only relative to the ground</p>
<p>the ground is actually spinning about the Earth's axis, so that's your actual speed, right?  only relative to the axis</p>
<p>the entire Earth is flying around the Sun, so that's your true speed, right?  only relative to the Sun</p>
<p>the Sun is circling the galactic core at tremendous speeds (dragging the Earth and you with it) so finally we've found your true speed?  only relative to the galactic core</p>
<p>the entire galaxy is hurtling through space, dragging with it the Sun, which is dragging the Earth, which is dragging you, so there is our true speed?  only relative to other galaxies nearby</p>
<p>our local cluster of galaxies is moving together through space.  but only relative to some other cluster of galaxies.</p>
<p>there is no &quot;center&quot; to the universe, there is no fixed reference point anywhere, so if I fly <em>away</em> from the galaxy at some tremendous speed, then the galaxy <em>seems</em> to be moving faster.  but if I move <em>within</em> the galaxy at the same speed, then that galaxy <em>seems</em> to be stationary.</p>
<p>we can define the &quot;center&quot; of the universe as any arbitrary point, and all the math still works out the same.  if we want, we can make our galactic core the &quot;center&quot; of the universe, and then all the other galaxies are flying away from us.  or we can make our Earth the &quot;center&quot;, or any other galaxy - it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>if we calculate the speed our galaxy is moving relative to the closest galaxy, then we are moving at x km/s.  but if we calculate the speed of our galaxy relative to a galaxy 4 billion light years away, then our speed is x + y km/s.  which speed is our &quot;true&quot; speed?  both.  neither.</p>
<p>when you understand the idea that <em>all ideas of speed</em> are <em>relative</em> and, in a real way, <em>imaginary</em> and that <em>everything is moving</em> and <em>nothing is moving</em> all at the same time, then it will start to make sense to you why the &quot;speed&quot; of the object emitting a photon has no effect on the speed of the photon itself.  you might say that object is moving at 1,000 km/h, another person might say 1,000km/s, and another might say it is stationary.  the object has no true, absolute, speed.  </p>
<p>in a way, you can think of photons <em>as the only things in the universe that actually have a true speed</em>!  from a photon's &quot;perspective&quot; <em>everything is moving at the</em> <strong>same</strong> <em>speed</em>, which is <em>not moving at all</em>!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the core question that prompted Einstein to come up with Relativity.</p>
<p>Previous to Einstein, Maxwell's laws had already established that the maximum speed of light is always constant.  But of course that immediately prompts the question:  how can it remain constant if the emitter is also moving?</p>
<p>Speed is defined as distance (space) divided by time.  If the speed is held constant, that means something <em>else</em> must change for the emitter as it moves.  In this case, Einstein realized that both space and time must change instead.</p>
<p>As the emitter gets faster and faster, its sense of time slows down.  Its length in the direction of movement also shortens.  This allows the speed of the emitted light to remain constant from its frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no they wouldn't.</p>
<p>The long answer is a bit more complicated. Basically one of the implications of Einstein's relativity is that light is moving at the speed of light, relative to everything, all the time. Trying to explain why that is the case is like trying to explain why gravity exists, some things are just rules that exist in the universe.</p>
<p>The reason this is even able to happen is because of time dilation. Which is a science term for saying the faster something is traveling relative to you, the slower it's clock appears to be ticking.</p>
<p>There's actually quite a lot to unpack from that last sentence, I'll try to explain some important points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The only speeds that matter in the universe are relative speeds, so the speed of one object compared to another. There is no universal reference point, or grid that you can use to measure an absolute speed relative to empty space.</p>
</li>
<li>Time dilation doesn't make sense in respect to your everyday experiences of Earth. Why should time move slower if you are going faster? At the end of the day the fact that light is always moving at the speed relative to everything means it has to exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the equation for velocity is: velocity=distance/time</p>
<p>The equations we came up for time dilation are a result of the fact that light needs to be moving at the same velocity, relative to objects that are moving at different velocities. The only way that can happen is if distances between you and everything else change as you move faster, or if time does.</p>
<p>Obviously distances don't larger between you and something as it moves faster, so the rate at which time flows must.</p>
<p>Working on the assumption that light moving at the same speed all the time is just a fundamental fact of the universe, we can do a little visualization of why time dilation works (and why it's only really noticeable at high speeds/relativistic speeds/&gt;~60% speed of light).</p>
<p>Imagine there is a spaceship with a photon of light bouncing between two mirrors placed on the floor and ceiling of a spaceship. You are standing on earth, when the spaceship isn't moving (relative to earth) there is no time dilation (not entirely true because gravity, but we can ignore that here). At that point from the perspective of you and someone of the ship, the light is moving up and down, the exact same movement for both observers. When the ship is moving however, this changes.</p>
<p>To the person on the ship, the photon is still traveling straight up and down. But to you, it is moving in a zigzagging pattern through space. This is because it is both bouncing up and down, and in a ship that is moving forward. Because the speed of light has to be constant, something has to change here, since the photon is traveling a longer distance in the same amount of time. The distance it is traveling won't shrink to compensate (the ship doesn't get smaller, well not really anyway), so instead time has to pass more slowly from where you are observing the ship in order for the speed of light to be constant. </p>
<p>For example, if the ship was moving at half the speed of light, the photon would be bouncing at 45° angles from your perspective, and time would be moving at 87% of its normal speed relative to you in order to compensate.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note here is that you are moving more slowly relative to the people on this ship too. Which sounds like it shouldn't be able to happen, but the difference in time is made up when the ship decelerates back down to your speed. This is getting into general relativity though, which is beyond me, I have only learned special relativity so far, which in relativity for objects that aren't accelerating (or decelerating). General relativity covers acceleration and its effect on time.</p>
<p>TLDR: Relativity is weird, and light is always moving at the speed of light</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly differences in perceived loudness of given stimuli between animals, but that is not necessarily tied to ‘better’ hearing. Hearing can be ‘better’ or ‘worse’ in many ways. In terms of the evolutionary advantages of hearing, detecting very quiet sounds, subtle differences between two detectable sounds in both frequency and intensity, and the range of frequency response of the organism are quite important. A given stimuli evoking a ‘louder’ percept is probably much less important. However, an animal with lower absolute thresholds for hearing sounds (that is, they can hear very quiet stimuli) would also typically have lower pain thresholds at a given frequency (suggesting, though not definitely demonstrating, that they hear it as ‘louder’). </p>
<p>If you are interested in more detail, especially links to more reading and thoughts on some of the methodological intricacies that would enable answering this question more definitively:</p>
<p>Loudness is a psychological phenomenon that can't be measured with nearly the sort of precision as sound pressure level (in dB) or sound intensity (in pascals or other units), but there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics" target="_blank">psychophysical</a> studies quantifying loudness using self-report, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold" target="_blank">detection thresholds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain" target="_blank">pain thresholds</a>, and many other methods. In humans, these methods can yield well-characterized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" target="_blank">equal loudness contours</a> that describe the relationship of loudness and sound pressure at various frequencies.</p>
<p>While the self-report measures of many psychophysical studies may seem 'soft' as a metric to many scientists, they are extremely well-studied and, while much noisier than most methods of 'harder' sciences, highly reliable if done properly. In non-human animals, this practice can be significantly more difficult. Typical methods include using response latency (or reaction time) as a substitute measure for loudness, which has been shown reliable in some studies like [this one]( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4955967" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4955967</a>). There is also [a fascinating study]( <a href="http://asa.scitation.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/doi/10.1121/1.3641449" target="_blank">http://asa.scitation.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/doi/10.1121/1.3641449</a>) on dolphins that trained the animals to discrimate sounds based on loudness. </p>
<p>Using methods like this, one could operationalize the definition of ‘better’ hearing (for example, lower absolute threshold at frequency X), you could quantify relationship between that definition of good hearing in different species capable of being trained to discriminate loudness, and then see if that measure of ‘good’ hearing correlated with hearing sounds of a given sound pressure level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually has to do more with physics. 'Loudness' can't exactly be measured as it is a unique experience to the individual. What can be measure however and is often what certain animals have over humans is the ability to detect different levels of Hertz (Hz). Humans hear the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz, while dogs as an example hear from 67 to 45,000 Hz (or 45 kHz). Dog whistles are just above human hearing at about 23,000 Hz to 54,000 Hz (Which is why some don't work: dogs can't hear them too).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an anthropologist, I’ve always thought the answer to this stems from one of our closest evolutionary relatives, the Bonobo.  Bonobos are also sexual throughout their entire lifespan, and juvenile sexual “play” happens quite a lot.  Like us, Bonobos have sex frequently, in a variety of positions, engage in homosexual behavior, and seem to enjoy themselves quite a lot.  However, <em>also like us, sex seems to serve a different purpose in Bonobo society than pure reproduction.</em>  In Bonobos, it functions to soothe aggressions between individuals.  Someone’s upset? Have sex with them.  Want someone’s banana? Don’t just take it and beat them up, have a little sex with them.  Infant is fussing? Masturbate them a bit to calm them down.</p>
<p>Flip to humans.  We also engage in a diversity of sexual acts (unlike other primates), and sexuality also serves a different purpose in our society than just pure reproduction.  It’s not mitigate aggression, but it probably evolved in its current state to form bonds between two individuals or a group of individuals (not saying that’s how we always use it, but that’s probably what it evolved for).  </p>
<p>In short, in evolution, moving sex out of a purely reproductive context has had all sorts of downstream effects, including high levels of sexuality, even when reproduction is taken off the table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I think one needs to unpick several assumptions about sex to find an answer.
Couldn't all creatures be called 'sexual' because of reproduction? When does the sexual nature of animals start and finish? Does life span play a part? What about social taboos and the effect of sexual practice? Does level of consciousness play a part on sexuality? Do animals in the wild have different sexual drives to human animals? Would we behave more animal like if our society was different? Why are we more organised and discreet about sex compared to animals on the wild? Do survival and hygiene have anything to do with our sexual behaviour?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, having an erection or being <em>capable</em> of climax is not the same as 'being sexual'.  Some of that is just &quot;being biological&quot;.</p>
<p>That aside, we can imagine all sorts of benefial aspects with regards to survival of humans.  Firstly, we used to die a lot younger so being sexual all your life likely connected a lot more to the time period when you could reproduce.  That's probably pretty important!</p>
<p>Additionally, maintaining familial bonds - of which partner-sex is a part - has probably been beneficial to survival of family and community and a key advantage the world.</p>
<p>For me, the ability to continue to provide sperm as long as possible has also probably been better than an alternative - more sperm supply = good (old man sperm! yay!).</p>
<p>There are monkeys that have casual sex and that have non-reproductive sex, child &quot;sex play&quot;, and post menopausal sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read that the ability to have sex all year long, which is especially special for human females, makes it possible for a female and a male to stay in a relationship for a while, which increase the probability of survivance for their child. Since males are using less energy to have babies because to make them it only really requires to have sex, while for females (at least for most primates) it involves pregnancy and nurturing the baby, it makes males more likely to try to have more sex than females. As human's evolution made them more and more social animals and smart, it increased a lot how much care a human needs to fully grow up. It then became less good evolutionary wise for males to just have tones of babies. So females ended up evolving to have sex all year long, which is kind of an evolutionary compromise since males already had those genes. </p>

<p>For males, it's simply because since they don't loose a lot of energy, it's just more worthy to take a chance to have a baby, even if there is less say 1 chance out of 10 that he doesn't survive. Most animals actually can reproduce all their adults life, and if they can't, they die really soon after. There is little evolutionary reason for an animal to survive if they don't reproduce. </p>
<p>For females though, the question isn't really why they can have sex, but more why can't they actually reproduce? Or why didn't they evolved to have more ovules? Enough till they die? Well, a teacher of mine said that it's because since it takes so much care for humans to raise babies, it's evolutionary more worthy for females, once old, to take care of their grandchildren more than having a baby on their own. For an old woman, having a baby on her own would mean both big probability to have a sick baby (since older people have bigger chances to have an unhealthy baby) and big probability to don't have that many years to take care of it too, since they can get sick, and/or die since they're old. So, as their grandchildren are also their own DNA, it's worthy.
Then, why is it like that for females, more than males? Because females are always sure it's their own children and grandchildren since they get pregnant. While males sometimes, raise some other's man children, which means that them taking care of &quot;<em>their</em>&quot; grandchildren must be less worthy than keep trying to have children on their own. </p>
<p>(P.S. sorry for the poor English.)</p>
<p>Tltr; humans take so much energy to raise that it's more worthy for people to have just a few and to actually make sure they fully grow up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, some people are throwing words around however not knowing quite how to use them correctly. First of all it needs to be established that, despite what people say, 4chan is heavily liberal. That's a fact. However where it gets confusing is in defining Liberal. 4chan subscribes to classical liberalism, which is essentially freedom above all else. And that is 4chans main driving force (or was, some say it became to moderated so 8chan became a thing, but that's besides the point). However done confuse that with being altright. There is a large socially right wing faction on 4chan (different to economically right), which opposes socially progressive.</p>
<p>As to how this happened, it is partially due to simple politics. To understand 4chan you must understand it's antithesis, Tumblr. Tumblr represents the far left side of the internet (socially speaking) where as 4chan are the far right. This is largley why 4chan and Tumblr are what they are, they stand tonoppsoe each other. That is not to say that they could not exist without each other, however they both grow due to their reactions with each other, and both attract people who oppose what the other site believes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a user of several 4chan boards, I reject the premise of the question. Crazy I know, but allow me to explain.</p>
<p>4chan is likely not significantly more conservative than other social media platforms,</p>
<p>The right are more vocal than the left, or at least they are recently. 4chan gives equal footing to all posts, where on reddit and Facebook there is an echo chamber effect, meaning if you're not a trump supporter, you're generally less likely to see pro trump posts.</p>
<p>/pol/ is the alt right board of 4chan, and they have a tendency to post political posts on other boards such as /trv/, making them seem more numerous than they really are. If you want to see more left oriented discussions, check out /news/.</p>
<p>I'll also point out here that the lack of an echo chamber means the alt right is challenged on their beliefs on 4chan, where on reddit and Facebook they spend their time constructing strawmen.</p>
<p>In short, 4chan makes it easier to make more noise as one person, but demographically, 4chan is likely not much different than reddit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a semi-regular 4chan poster for about 10 years now and it really hasn't changed all that much in that time.  There are ever more boards, but /b/ is still /b/ and /v/ is still /v/ and so on.  Some people come and go, however, the general place stays the same.</p>
<p>When the whole &quot;Anonymous&quot; hacker thing happened nothing changed on 4chan.  It was still the same groups of people hanging out there that had always been there.  With the creation of a collective name though it gave a small sub-set of people an easy way to coalesce.  Suddenly 4chan hacker &quot;Anonymous&quot; became a thing everywhere even though it was no more or less of a thing on the site than it had been before.</p>
<p>The only thing that has changed on 4chan is the creation of the term &quot;alt-right&quot;.  Now all the little bigots have a common name to collect themselves around.  With a name, cause, and rules they seem like a bigger group to outsiders.  To those of us who have been there a long time it is the same group as always.  No more.  No less.</p>
<p>Honestly, if somebody came up with a name for it you could just as easily make 4chan out to be the home of an open progressive sexuality movement.  An active /lgbt/ board, /soc/'s nebulous sexuality, and /b/ &amp; /v/ love of transporn would make the perfect examples.  Just give it a good name to gather around and watch it take off as the next group defining 4chan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like, ten years ago, 4chan was a novelty because of you could make any dumb post you wanted and never worry about it again. This was the genesis of modern shitposting. On the /b/ forum, which famously has no rules except &quot;Don't post anything illegal,&quot; ironically posting racist shit became a fun thing to do, but even on /b/, at the time, far-right bullcrap was the subject of mockery. See also their raid on white supremacist talk show host Hal Turner.</p>
<p>The original owner of 4chan, created /n/, a board for discussing news and current events. Stormfront, a racist website that /b/ would often raid at the time, moved in and started posting unironically. The board was closed, and eventually reopened as /pol/ and /int/ - Politically Incorrect and International. Stormfront returned and continued to be awful. This time they weren't stopped, because it was funny, at first, to see white supremacists from the previous generation being all &quot;HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDS, THE BLACKS SURE ARE UPPITY AREN'T THEY HA HA HA.&quot; It became less funny when they snared angry young people that were better able to fit in and spread their toxic beliefs to other popular, loosely-moderated boards like /v/. This eventually resulted in shenanigans like gamergate.</p>
<p>tl;dr Any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe that they're in good company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting a lot of different answers here, and most are correct but people here are talking about cash donations.  There's another big type of donation that rich people make too and that's in illiquid/non-marketable assets such as real estate and/or shares in private companies.</p>
<p>The ELI5 is a little difficult, but the gist is that for private companies, getting a 'value' is about 99% art and 1% science.  Accounting is a lot more assumptions and guess work than people would like to publicly acknowledge.  </p>
<p>So what an individual can do is offer to donate, say, 10% of his company to a charity.  Let's say that the company did really well last year so that guy can easily find an accountant to say that 10% is worth $10M. So the guy has a $10M tax deduction he can use as he sees fit (subject to AMT and other shit, but you get the point).  The guy also knows that last year's performance was a blip and if he repeated that 10% donation this year, he'd only get a valuation of $5M.  In effect he's got an extra $5M from the valuation.  </p>
<p>When I was younger, I was on the young alumni board for the university I went to for undergrad and we used to see this all the time.  Someone would donate property/illiquid securities/art/etc with an 'assessed' value of (say) $10M, but when the school went to sell it, they'd only realize (say) $3M in cash.  But the guy would still get to keep the $10M tax deduction. To a guy like that, a $10M tax deduction could be worth $4m to $5M easily.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're wondering, and yes this is in that 'gray zone' that's just millimeters from being tax fraud.  However, the IRS rarely pursues these cases 1) because they are <em>really</em> hard to win, 2) the school doesn't really care b/c they still just got a $3M donation, and 3) the school isn't going to 'help' the IRS (beyond bare minimum compliance) b/c the school would have to give up the $3M.</p>
<p>A similar, but different, application of this idea is where Mitt Romney reported a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/whats-really-going-on-with-mitt-romneys-102-million-ira/261500/" target="_blank">$102M IRA</a> by having accounts toy with the value/valuation of the assets within the IRA.  There's no reasonable way you could ever get that much into an IRA....unless you got your accountants to depress the value first then re-value later.</p>
<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> I'm getting a lot of questions about how this worked for Romney.  Here is a <em>purely hypothetical</em> example based loosely on when Bain Capital took out Domino's Pizza that I put in a lower comment - I'm putting it here so more people see it:</p>
<p>I'm going to make up the exact numbers, but this is the mechanics: Romney had a type of retirement account where you could but $30K cash per year in the account tax free. He also had a private equity firm invested in private companies.</p>
<p>Romney took $30K cash, put it in the retirement account each year - tax free. Each year, his accountants would say, 0.X% of your portfolio companies is magically equal to $30K, so Romney would take the $30K cash in the tax-sheltered IRA and buy 0.X% of his companies personally. He did this for about (I think) 15 years. After a while, he converted it to a ROTH IRA meaning that he'd pay a small one-time tax hit but withdrawals are tax free.</p>
<p>Later on, his private equity company would sell the individual companies that it owned (or take them public). When they were sold, Romney would recognize the gain BUT it was now within the tax-sheltered IRA he'd pay no taxes and because he converted to a ROTH IRA, he pays no taxes on withdrawals. Genius.</p>
<p>Here's a sort of hypothetical example. In 1998, Bain (Romney's PE company) bought Dominos Pizza for $1.1B. They probably used a standard PE structure meaning that they borrowed $1.0B and put down cash for $100M. So the company is $1.0B debt and $100M equity. Romney puts in $30K each year to buy some of Dominos ($30K/$100M = .03%/year). He buys .03% per year, for a total of .45% of Dominos after 15 years. At this point, he converts from a traditional IRA to a ROTH IRA paying roughly $100K in taxes ($450K in contributions multiplied by his tax rate at the time of the conversion - maybe a little more or less than $100K, but in the neighborhood).</p>
<p>Then they take Dominos public, which they did. Dominos is worth $10B as of right now, so Romney's 0.45% of Dominos would be worth $45M. <strong><em>All completely tax free</em></strong> because its in a ROTH.</p>
<p>In reality, he has an IRA worth $102M, so my example is off by about half, but you get the basic mechanics. The IRS looked at it and said it was aggressive but not illegal when he ran for president in 2012.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of things to consider here.  I can tell you how <em>I</em> manage this.  But...firstly, yes...in the end if how you receive &quot;value&quot; is cash-this-year then keeping it rather than donating it almost always better.</p>
<p>Couple o' things I do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>donating appreciated assets vs. cash.  If i have a stock that is worth $100,000 more than when I bought it, I could sell it and pay taxes on that 100k and then donate it and get a tax-brackets-worth of deduction (plus this income will influence my tax bracket potentially).  But..if I donate the asset I avoid the taxes associated with that 100K appreciation and then get the 100K tax deduction.  So...if that asset is the the thing I can live without this year I can give 100K by donating the appreciated asset vs. $60K if I sell, pay taxes on it and then donate it.  So...this strategy allows me <em>do more good</em>.  </p>
</li>
<li>I have a small foundation (which I've converted now to a much simpler donor advised fund that is easy and everyone should do!).  This allows me to donate money <em>when I have it</em>, but give it to charities <em>when I want to</em>.  This works by having the donor advised fund (or the foundation) itself be a charitable organization.  So...the tax deduction date/event is putting the money in that fund (you can never get it back).  Then you actually have the money distributed to charities when you want to.  For me this means I can support some organizations every year even though some years it's either less tax advantageous to do so (e.g. a generally down year) or I'm just not comfortable giving up the money that year.    </li>
</ol>
<p>(combine 1 and 2 together and what I generally <em>really do</em> is donate appreciated assets to my foundation / donor-advised-fund).</p>
<ol>
<li>There is &quot;soft value&quot; that comes from being able to make charitable donations.  These are undoubtedly create indirect economic return to the donor.  </li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the day, when people say they are avoiding taxes with charitable donations they are not keeping more money, but they are <em>controlling the use of more of their money</em>.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that you can't &quot;make money&quot; by donating cash and writing it off, though, as others have mentioned, donating other assets can result in a net gain.</p>
<p>However, there a few other circumstances where it make economic sense:</p>
<p>1) The donation gets you something that you would have purchased anyway, but now you can write-off the cost. Examples could be as small as swag from your local public radio station or as large as a year of tuition or even a building named after you. I'm not saying that people reap a profit from this, but they get the benefit (which may be worth alot to them) AND they get it at a reduced price because they can deduct it.</p>
<p>2) If they donate it to a non-profit which they control. They can then set their friends and family up as employees and pay the money to them and also write it off as a deduction. This happens pretty often with athletes and celebrities. Hopefully they are also doing some charitable good, but it's often pretty sketchy and there are some high profile cases where it looks like almost nothing charitable was happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, the average person doesn't really understand accounting/taxes that well and will just repeat information they don't understand. I've seen redditors downplaying donations to charities from wealthy individuals as if it's nothing because &quot;it's just a write off.&quot; </p>
<p>In general, when donating money or items you just reduce your income by the amount of money donated or the value of the item donated. If you made $10,000,000 in a year and donated $9,000,000 to charity during the same year, you'd essentially be taxed as if you made $1,000,000. Considering that someone who made $10,000,000 would only pay at most ~$4,000,000 in Federal Income Taxes on that amount, donating $9,000,000 to reduce your taxes by $4,000,000 obviously costs more than simply paying the taxes.</p>
<p>Additionally, lot of people here have already explained some &quot;loopholes.&quot; A couple I've seen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Donating a cheap piece of art and inflating it's value. This is 100% tax fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donating assets that have appreciated in value. E.g., you paid $1,000 for stock that is now worth $1,000,000. While this is a valid tax strategy, you are still not coming out ahead by donating. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donating shares of a private company (so the market value is unclear) and having an accountant inflate the value is also tax fraud. Just because the IRS won't go after you does not mean that something is &quot;gray area.&quot; </p>
</li>
<li>Donating $5 worth of clothes to Goodwill and saying you donated $500 worth is tax fraud.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not something the truly rich do, but us middle to upper middle class do this sort of thing:</p>
<p>If you are donating goods, say, used furniture, you can write off the value of the furniture.  The IRS does not question values under $500.  So, rather than sell that couch on Craigslist for $50, you donate it and write off some semi-realistic value close to but under $500 for it.  Tax on $500 of your income is more than the $50 you would have made selling it.</p>
<p>Bag of old clothes?  $5 at a yard sale or say $400 in reslae value donated and deducted.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Do this a lot, and you actually can save a decent chunk on your taxes, plus your donations can hopefully do some good.  You can donate items under $500 multiple times without proving value.  However, if you abuse this I'm sure the IRS will abuse you.  We do donate stuff probably 10 times a year as we tend to purge regularly and have a kid who outgrows clothes constantly.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I'm not advocating or engaging in illegal activity.  This is perfectly legal so long as you actually donate the goods, get an actual receipt from the charity, and deduct fair market value.  All of which I do every time.  There are plenty of tools out there to determine FMV if you cannot do so yourself or if you want to err on the side of caution.  </p>
<p>Further EDIT:  IRS Rules, specifically mentions the $500 thing on stating you need to file forms demonstrating value over $500 where appropriate: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trade for the most part is not between nations but between companies and people.</p>
<p>Governments don't really get all that much involved much at all on trade inside the EU anymore than US states would be involved in intrastate commerce in the US.</p>
<p>The EU as a whole negotiates deals with other countries or unions of countries. for the most part those aren't deals like selling a certain quantity of some product, but setting down the rules by which corporations and people in the countries can trade with each other.</p>
<p>Agreements are between the EU and foreign countries are negotiated as a whole because there is strength in numbers.</p>
<p>The EU collects due from its members and uses that money for various projects in the EU. The poorer countries in the EU mostly get more money invested into them locally by the EU than they pay into it.</p>
<p>As for defence, the majority of EU nations are also in NATO and the EU treaty itself has mutual defence clause in Article 42.7. If a member country gets attacked and invokes this article the rest of the EU would support them. A war that was waged offensively by an EU member would more ambiguous but also far less likely.</p>
<p>There are currently movements in progress to further unite and integrate the militaries of the countries with one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>How does trade work between the 28 members of the European Union internally...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EU is considered a &quot;single market&quot;. This means everyone uses the same rules and standards, and there are absolutely no trade restrictions or barriers between EU members. Everyone can trade with everyone at all times.</p>
<p>In many respects this is just like how US trade works between states.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and (more importantly) as a group with the rest of the world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trade agreements with other countries (or trading blocs) only need to happen one time. The EU negotiates as a single trading bloc (again the &quot;single market&quot;).</p>
<p>While the initial negotiations are more complex (since all 28 members must agree to the same deal) - once you have the agreement, you can trade freely with all 28 EU members.</p>
<p>The upside is of course since the EU is such a massive market, it can negotiate favorable trade deals (since few if any countries want to be left out). It also simplifies trade with the EU in the long run, because you only have to negotiate it once (rather than 28 times) and you only have to meet the one common standard (for example safety regulations) rather than 28 different sets of regulations.</p>
<p>It also greatly benefits smaller countries, since they can all go &quot;to the front of the line&quot; along with all the other members. So Estonia gets the same great deal as Germany, but Germany also gets a better deal because everyone combines their economic clout as one entity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who contributes which goods/services and how much?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no such agreement on specific goods and services - it's a free trade agreement. Anyone can produce something, and sell it to another EU member as if it was their own country. The differences in production really come down to differences in cost of labor, infrastructure quality and capacity, local environment, and various other factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who makes proposals and agreements and who can shoot them down?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EU does, or at least its institutions, one of the most important being the European Comission.</p>
<p>Also any single member can shoot it down. Everyone has to agree on new rules and agreements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are resources pooled between the 28 countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All members contribute a percentage of their GNI (gross national income) which is around 1% - and this is used to fund EU activities. Larger economies obviously pay more, and less developed countries may receive more funding in return than their contribution. The general idea being that all of Europe is better off if we help make sure development across the bloc proceeds more rapidly than if left alone to their own devices.</p>
<p>Other than that, all countries keep their own taxes / funds / resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would a war between one of the 28 and another nation (say spain/argentina) effect how the other 27 trade with either?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that defeats the purpose of the single market. For example, if you recall the 2nd gulf war - the UK and Poland were official belligerents against Iraq - yet intra-EU trade did not stop or even get reduced at all. Despite protests from other EU members</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the 28 countries function as a union with a pre agreed tariff free access to each other's markets. By doing this they are able to regulate and streamline the process. What this means inflation is under control among those countries and market are efficient. Now as a union of 28 countries trade, internationally is much simpler than having individual trade agreements. It's a win win situation, where the union manages to get a good deal as they are a bigger organisation and the exporters get to export and take part in 28 countries as opposed to just one :) hope I have answered your question </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many insects, and I believe flies and bees are in this group, use &quot;indirect&quot; flight muscles. Basically, the muscles that control the wings connect to the exoskeleton of the upper thorax, rather than the wings directly. When they contract, they cause the thorax to vibrate back and forth like a guitar string. Each vibration is beats the wings, but only the initial contraction requires an action potential. So the nervous system is operating many many times more slowly than the wings are beating. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: Entomology was a long time ago, so that may be a bit off on on the specifics. I invite any entomologists around to correct me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is important because wings can either flap in-phase (up and down together) or anti-phase (one goes up, another goes down), and I'm not sure if there's any other weird phase mappings other than 0 and 180 deg relative phase.<br />

<p>His explanation was that the signal the key, or antenna, generates radiates omnidirectionally, or in a sphere centered around the key.  By placing it under your chin, you alter the way the radio antenna behaves, changing it from omnidirectional to a directional antenna, so that the waves bounce off our body and merge with the waves going away from our body in one direction, effectively funneling them further away than they could reach just going out in all directions.  The shape of the waves goes from a sphere to more of an oblong shape facing one way.  We aren't adding any power to the strength of the signal, just altering the direction the signal travels in.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The statement that the photon is the mediating particle of the electromagnetic force means that the electromagnetic field which causes that force can be decomposed into objects called photons.</p>
<p>This is not something easy to see in quantum mechanics--one needs to use quantum field theory to treat photons mathematically. This is because the wavefunction is a function of the positions of a predefined set of objects being treated in a problem. In such a context, the reaction between two objects can only involve those objects themselves--because there is no way to directly compare the wavefunction of  two systems with a different number of particles.</p>
<p>The mediation of the electromagnetic force by photons requires creating and destroying photons--an electron emits a photon and another electron absorbs it. Quantum field theory is a framework that allows that allows particles to be created and destroyed, and so describes the mediation process. This works because as a field theory, QFT describes the state of a set of fields defined over space-time, rather than as a function of a discrete number of points.</p>
<p>However, the notion of mediation is a bit, shall we say, loose. The coulomb force is an effect that arises because of &quot;virtual photons&quot;-- as someone else said, these are not real particles because their properties are dependent on how the calculation is done (for those seeking deeper, read about electromagnetic gauge) and by their nature are not experimentally observable--so they are a way of a mathematical book-keeping. Pinning down in a very precise way what mediation means requires some non physical philosophy of QFT. But what's definitely true is this: There is an electromagnetic field that causes the force between electrons. Because there is a field, there is a particle associated with that field. If there were no electromagnetic force, there would be no photons--and vise versa; the two are inextricable.</p>
<p>The term &quot;mediates&quot; is used because the calculations involve photons that communicate the necessary information between elections.</p>
<p>Feynman wrote a really great and accessible book called QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, that gives the reader a surprisingly accurate qualitative description of what is going on in quantum electrodynamics without introducing the (extensive) math required to actually carry out calculations in QFT. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in quantum field theory- be them a hobbyist, a dedicated student of physics, or even a researcher who might like to think about how to communicate core concepts to laymen of QFT.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens is that you expand the S-matrix in powers of the coupling constant. The S-matrix elements are matrix elements of the time-ordered exponential of the interaction Lagrangian, which for QED contains terms like Ψ^(T)A^(μ)γ<em><em>μ</em></em>Ψ, where Ψ represents a fermion field and A represents the photon field.</p>
<p>The various terms in this power series look like a bunch of intermediate particles being created and destroyed, linking the same initial and final states. These intermediate particles are called &quot;virtual particles&quot;, and they only <em>seem</em> to exist because of how you've chosen to do your calculation. They do not literally exist.</p>
<p>If you look at Feynman diagrams like the ones shown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Møller_scattering" target="_blank">here</a>, these represent the lowest-order terms in that series expansion for the case of electron-electron scattering.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested in an answer in terms of quantum mechanics:
To describe particle interactions we use Quantum Field Theory. It is a theory which brings together field theory and quantum mechanics. One uses something called second quantization to also quantize the fields(f.i. the wave function of the photon) in stead of only quantizing the usual observables like x, p, etc.. It is a many particle system in which we can create and destroy particles, as has been mentioned already.</p>
<p>Now usually in QFT's (within the Standard Model) we are only interested in asymptotic states. That is; we want to conduct an experiment with some particles going in and some particles coming out. This can be efficiently calculated perturbutively using something called the S matrix. The fundamental interpretational issue here is that this is defined in terms of the asymptotic states only. Basically we're putting the interaction in a black box, and calculate then what could possibly come out. This method works really well for usual particle physics since these perturbative methods can be applied.</p>
<p>Returning to your question about what happens quantum mechanically: This is not well understood. The whole framework had been built around asymptotic states. If you know what a Hilbert space is (which you probably should if you know quantum mechanics); we only have a well-defined Hilbert space for the asymptotic states. The Hilbert space within the actual interaction is not well known, so describing what's actually going on is way harder. The Feynmann diagrams in that sense are only a tool which works because we can perturbatively calculate this interaction within the Hilbert space of asymptotic states.</p>
<p>This is also the struggle of Canonical Quantum Gravity. Since gravity cannot be perturbatively analyzed we cannot use these diagrams, so we need to find out exactly what happens during this interaction: we need to find a Hilbert space for the full Hamiltonian. This is way more difficult then just using perturbation theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi ... I am a general and emergency pediatrician ... the answer is absolutely, children's growth is affected by chronic illness.  The mechanisms aren't clear (to me) but probably include a change in calorie consumption.  Best examples: those kids with Chron's disease who are short, thin and have delayed puberty, or those infants with significant cardiac disease who develop &quot;cardiac cachexia&quot;).  Growth hormone metabolism may also be involved ... best example of this are those kids who are short following cranial radiation therapy, which may affect the pituitary gland products.  In fact, looking for poor growth and development is a key clinical activity in identifying significant chronic disease.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, energy that would go to growth is instead expended fighting disease. However, if the child recovers and thereafter has access to good nutrition, growth will proceed faster than normal for a time. This catch-up growth can erase some or even all of the deficit caused during the period of sickness. Catch up growth has been observed in children adopted from poor developing countries into wealthy societies, and was discovered from plantation records to occur to a remarkable degree in slaves (slave children were considered unproductive and fed inadequate protein, once they were capable of working their diets improved). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very complicated subject. I don't know specifically about cancer medication, but the human growth hormone (hGH), produced by the pituitary gland, is the responsible for children growth. In adulthood the production of hGH slows down greatly (unless there is a tumor in said gland). hGH production peaks mainly during rest/sleep periods. A boy that is sick with, typically, a fever will be in bed for several days, sleeping most of the time, and if he's well fed, he might actually end up being taller than his identical twin brother that didn't get sick.</p>
<p>So there are many factors to take into account: proper nutrition, resting, interaction of the drugs with hGH production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
