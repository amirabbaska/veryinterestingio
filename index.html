		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small chargers today are switch mode power supplies.</p>
<p>They work, simply said, by first rectifying the alternating mains current to direct current, then chopping it up again to pulses at a much higher frequency, transforming it down and rectifying it again. </p>
<p>That sounds overcomplicated, but transformers for high frequencies are WAY smaller, cheaper and more efficient, which is worth the hassle.</p>
<p>The transformer tends to make a sound, just like the &quot;normal&quot; ones make that familiar hum. It's depending on quality, cheap ones tend to have loose parts which vibrate and make them louder .. but normally the used frequency is way beyond our hearing range, so it seems dead quiet. </p>
<p>If the device is charging and needs less and less power to do that as the battery fills up, the power supply has to reduce the power it delivers to held the output voltage at the same level. This is done by making the pulses of the primary voltage shorter and shorter. </p>
<p>If the device is fully charged and in standby, it needs almost no power, but there is a lower limit how short the pulses can be, so the only choice the charger has is to drop (e.g., very simplfied) every 5th pulse completely or the output voltage would climb too high.</p>
<p>But THAT introduces an additional frequency component at (in that case 1/5th) the normal switching frequency, which you can hear. Since the amout of dropped pulses is varying much with load, the sound tends to be quite irregulary and if you pick it your device to use it, while still connected to the charger, you can often even &quot;hear&quot; the fluctuating current consumption by listening to the changing sound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're hearing is coils expanding and contracting of a buck converter, which is just a fancy way of saying a voltage converter that uses pulses(high voltage to low voltage probably). Basically what happens is that the correct voltage is generated by turning on the current to the coil for a certain amount of time and then turning it off at a certain(audible, if you can hear it) frequency. This causes the wire in a coil to expand from the heat that the current is generating and upon turning it off it shrinks again. This causes vibration in the air which is just soundwaves at that point. This frequency also varies depending on the current level of charge in your battery and how fast it's getting charged.</p>
<p>Imagine the coil being a balloon where you fill it with such a frequency that you can vibrate the air and produce sound. That's what happens with a coil.</p>
<p>edit: there is also a bit of magnetism involved in higher currents where the coil gets pushed apart when current is flowing. However I don't know how relevant this part is for small electronics. For superconductors one of the challenges is to keep the coil together because the magnetic field inside the coil can get strong enough to rip the coil apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the supply usually operates waaayy above your hearing range. At low loads, we have to employ tricks like pulse skipping or burst mode operaton so that it turns on and off at a lower frequency. (This is done for boring reasons like avoiding discontinuous conduction in magnetics, outside the realm of an eli5) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can hear that slower operaton. It's still actually really doing everything at that high frequency you can't usually hear, but it's turning on and off slow enough that it introduces stuff you can hear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

</blockquote>
<p>This is mostly for incandescent light bulbs. Changing the temperature of materials causes them to expand and contract. Generally making them colder causes them to contract and heating them cause expansion. A prime example is a hot air balloon where heating air causes it to expand and become less dense. (An example of a rare exception is water ice expanding compared to liquid water.)</p>
<p>Incandescent lights work by heating a very thin wire until it glows brightly. This causes it to expand slightly and when power is removed it will contract again as it cools. When these cycles happen it causes fatigue in the material and it is much more likely to break at this point. Turning a bulb on or off is the most stressful part of its operation.</p>
<p>So switching a light rapidly on and off is basically the worst thing you can do to an incandescent light bulb. On the other hand an LED bulb wouldn't care in the slightest, so it really depends on the technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you actuate a mechanical switch, you'll create a bit of a spark that can scorch the material.  Over time, this can theoretically damage the switch.  However, for the power levels you use in your house and the materials you're using for the switch, you're unlikely to cause much harm.  This effect is more of a concern for your power company.</p>
<p>In terms of what that switch is powering, there is a potential for harm but usually not much.  For electronics, you'll normally have a great deal of capacitance involved in transforming the AC from your wall socket into the DC used by the electronics.  For motors, you'll need a control board that likewise insulates them from direct connection to the power.</p>
<p>A purely resistive circuit - such as an incandescent bulb - is already dealing just fine with voltage fluctuating back and forth.  However, the mechanical nature of the switch does allow for the possibility of a spike in voltage beyond the normal limitations.  This will probably only happen if you've worn down the mechanical switch (see above).  More modern bulbs tend not to have this sort of problem due to the more complex circuitry.</p>
<p>So the problem you're describing does exist, but it's a bit obsolete with modern equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Automation engineer here:</p>
<p>Put your head up close to your light switch and look through the crack, make sure the room is completely dark, slowly turn it on and off, you might (depending on your countries voltage etc) see small sparks in the crack (it works a lot better with something that pulls a lot of power, like a heater, or a kettle). </p>
<p>Sparks damage contacts, over time the contact in the switch can become pitted and will either just break off or possibly weld itself shut, that'll take a <strong>lot</strong> of on/off cycles. </p>
<p>An example I can give you are the contactors at work which we use to switch conveyoring on and off (contactors use 24v to turn on a magnet, which moves bigger contactors together completing a circuit - a contactor is basically using low voltage to turn on higher voltage - in our case it's 415vac 3phase - but it's just a switch). One of those contactors failed the other day and welded two phases together leaving a piece of machinery turned on permanently (phasing). That contactor has been in that cabinet switching on and off day and night for 20 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually an area of ongoing debate. In the past, it has generally been assumed that Britain was largely covered by forest - primarily because forest is seen as the inevitable result of succession given the ecological conditions in Britain. Note that in most of Britain this climax community is temperate broadleaf or mixed woodland, where as your vision of Canada and Scandanvia might well be of boreal coniferous forest.</p>
<p>However, in 2000 Frans Vera published a book called &quot;Grazing ecology and forest history&quot; which suggested that prior to human arrival and dominance, large grazing herbivores (e.g. aurochs, the extinct ancestors of domestic cattle) would have had a strong effect on the landscape by browsing on trees and shrubs and hence preventing succession from occuring. This, coupled with other disturbance forces such as wildfires, storms, diseases and pests, and floods, with have lead to a relatively open park-like mosaic of wood and grassland. One question that this hypothesis answers is: where did all the open-country species live? Many species in Britain (noteable many butterflies and wildflowers) are strongly associated with open landscapes and direct sunlight, and would not be found in continuous woodland.</p>
<p>So, how can we find out? One of the most common techniques is to analyse long term sediment cores from lakes. Pollen is trapped in the sediment, and changes in the presence and relative abundance of different species' pollen can indicate changing plant communities. Furthermore, sediment also contain fungal spores; certain spores are associated with herbivore dung, and therefore the abundance of these spores can be used as an indicator of the abundance of herbivores and hence infer the grazing pressure. Another technique is to use ecological inferrence - we can use exclosure or introduction experiments to try and understand the impact that the presence or abscence of large mammals would have had on the vegetation, and then try and estimate which situation is most applicable to Britain.</p>
<p>However, part of the reason that this debate is still ongoing is that the arrival of humans into Northern Europe coincided with the end of most recent glacial period; as such the impact of human arrival is confounded with changing climatic conditions and natural recolonisation of species into previously ice-covered areas.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Britain was mostly forests and marshes. In fact, nearly the entire eastern coast of England was marshland and the coastline itself actually looked quite a bit different before the Romans (and later Saxons) came and cleared all the marshes. Ireland was mostly bogs and oak/hazel forests. Most of the forests were cleared for farmland or timber, much of which was used to build and maintain ships for the Royal Navy during the English settlement/occupation (like what happened in England). And the bogs were (and continue to be) cut for turf to be used as fuel. Ireland has even fewer &quot;natural&quot; forests left than Britain. Apart from some very small national parks, most of the forests in Ireland today are made up of non-native coniferous trees mainly used for timber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ecologist here. Some answers are good, but I'd chime in that the most probable answer would come from matching climate classifications and biome distribution patterns with Gulf Stream-corrected latitude. Because of the UKs position on a northern hemisphere west coast at sub-boreal maritime-influenced latitudes, I'd probably pin it as looking like puget sound or Vancouver island. The Southern Hemisphere equivalent would be Southern chile, or maybe Tasmania. </p>
<p>I don't think megafauna would be a very significant contributor to ecosystem structure - ice age retreat lets forests grow back, and megafauna don't do so hot there, especially in conifer dominated sustems. They can structure ecosystems, sure, but to an extent that's still largely influenced by climate (cf. woods bison vs. Great Plains bison, or African vs asiatic elephant).</p>
<p>BUT - much of ecology, especially biogeography, is essentially chaotic. That's part of the trouble with predicting what's going to happen under climate change - this is a pretty novel set of initial conditions for a trajectory we don't know much about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts that explored the solar system and now interstellar space are powered indirectly by weak force. They put around 13kg of plutonium. The weak force interaction makes beta decay happen and this generates a lot of heat which is then converted to 470W of electricity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">RTG</a>. This is needed because going away from the sun means you don't have enough sunlight to generate power thru the solar panel array.</p>
<p>It has been 39 years since launch, 17 light-hours away in pitch darkness, and weak force still generates enough power to run the spacecraft instruments. It's incredible that a man made object is so far away from man that it takes 17 hours for light from earth to reach it. Yet, it's still being controlled by man and still sending scientific data back home, all thanks to the weak force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>on a very simple level - they move around money. and they move this money between things which are all the time changing in value.</p>
<p>so if $100 is moved over into the form of a share in a company, the next day (or the next minute..) that money could now be worth something else.</p>
<p>given the size of wall st, we are talking about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars. and when an investment goes badly and $100 million becomes $50 million, or vice versa, and when this happens all the time with BILLIONS of dollars - it effects the economy.</p>
<p>So what purpose does it serve society..? Not too much really... but what effect does it have? HUGE</p>
<p>Edit: i have received some flack for my last line saying Wall St does not do much to serve society. What I meant by this is to be neutral - Wall St certainly has its benefits, but was also the cause of the global financial crisis in 2008. But I think its effects are more interesting to discuss then what purpose it serves society.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I am receiving more and more aggressive messages about how wrong my post is, followed by long complicated answers which simply expand on exactly what I said - Wall St moves money around. And by moving it around, it causes ripple effects across the economy. I apologise for not being able to explain the ins and outs of Wall st in less than 100 words - shout out to SteelGun for his great response below</p>
<p>Edit 3 (and final edit): HOLY CRAP REDDIT YOU'RE SO MEAN. While I am getting abused to death I still have not had ANYONE disagree with my fundamental explanation of what the people on Wall St actually do. I have however mislead people into believing that Wall St serves no purpose to society - I accept that this was written extremely poorly, and not meant to come out that way. Never have I even thought that Wall St is just a thing that's there that serves no purpose.. and you shouldn't either. I wanted to edit the post when it was on like 20 likes but only bad redditors remove things they said that people didn't agree with, so I'll leave it but yes that last line was fucking dumb. HOWEVER I have also received messages from many people backing me up and saying my answer was pretty well written for such a massive question in ELI5 terms. If you are new to this thread please read many of the long well written posts below for <em>other</em> good answers too. peace</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1><strong>First lets define wall street</strong></h1>
<p>If by &quot;wall street&quot;, you mean the general financial institutions and markets around the world including in the United States, then this is a <em>very</em> broad question.</p>
<h2>With that being said, I will give it my best shot.</h2>
<hr />
<p>We have three basic divisions of the financial industry. This theory on the financial industry I learned when getting both of my undergrads is not all encompassing, and obviously one could come up with other divisions that would equally describe the market. Neither description would be wrong and this will suffice.</p>
<h1><strong>Financial institutions</strong></h1>
<p>These are (generally) the regulatory agencies that intervene in the market for various purposes. Examples include the SEC, the Federal reserve and so on. These (mostly) government institutions help regulate the market, provide various services (like issuing money), and pursue legal action against criminals. </p>
<p><em>example</em></p>
<p>The federal reserve may raise interest rates to stop or curtail inflation or it may increase reserve requirements for banks for a variety of reasons. </p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Financial markets</strong></h1>
<p>These are the physical and virtual (ie: internet) meeting places where the various parties meet up to conduct business. In the same way you and I have a market to pick up our groceries or buy a car, markets in the financial industry are set up to reduce the cost of doing business and to allow for interested parties to conduct said business. </p>
<p><em>Example</em></p>
<p>A farmer wants to sell an options contract on the bushels of wheat he is growing for harvest. In order to meet with potential buyers, this farmer sells options contracts for a specified price on the Options market. He may do this at the Chicago Mercantile exchange, which was famous for exactly this kind of transaction. Without the Chicago Mercantile exchange it would be nearly impossible for prospective sellers and buyers of the options contracts to meet and conduct business. </p>
<p>Another example may include a company looking to raise revenue for planned business expansion by listing shares in the company on a market (through a broker, which we will discuss below). Without being able to have buyers and sellers meet, this task is made nearly impossible, and the benefits to this transaction would not occur, namely the business would be much less likely to expand and at the same amount, and investors would have less avenues for wealth creation. </p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Financial Brokers</strong></h1>
<p>This is a lot easier to explain. The brokers are the various clearing house associations and stock market intermediaries that facilitate these market transactions. To use the brief example I gave above about going to the store to buy groceries, if grocery stores <em>as a whole</em> are the market, then the Shop and Save company would be a broker in this analogy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now that we have a Very^very^very basic understanding of the background information needed to understand the financial industry, lets start answering your questions. Keep in mind, I answer these as someone with two 4 year degrees, one in Business, and the other in Economics, both with a focus on finance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do create anything?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply, yes.</p>
<p>Types of services offered include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading risk from risk averse to risk takers, like in our options contract example above</li>
<li>Allowing groups of people, like corporations, to raise funds, including but not limited to debt and equity issuance</li>
<li>Investment banks provide a wide array of services like business appraisal, Mergers and Acquisitions, and identifying market trends.</li>
<li>engineering complex financial instruments (usually a type of derivative) to meet some kind of goal EG: collateralized debt obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc</p>
<p>From an economic standpoint, one might distill it down to simply this saying, That the financial industry allows &quot;Net-Savers&quot; (used broadly) to lend funds to &quot;Net-spenders&quot; for a return, who then generally use the funds for some end. These transaction <em>generally</em> only occur when both parties benefit more than they lose out, and everyone is left better off. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are they just playing with everybody's money</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No serious person who has studied the financial industry believes this. There are <em>real</em> socially beneficial services provided by this industry. Furthermore competition in finance is intense, and those companies and individuals that are not serious about providing value for stakeholders are ushered out or lose money quite fast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really have no idea</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fear not, most people have no clue. In a similar fashion to medicine, or physics, Finance is a highly specialized field with professionals that often need bachelors degree or higher to break into entry level positions. There is industry specific jargon, lots of math (which the general population has issues with), and abstract concepts that take awhile to truly understand on the second level.</p>
<p>It took me about a year of undergrad finance courses to really <em>truly</em> understand what the heck is going on in finance. </p>
<p>I hope that helps, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask, and if I have the knowledge, I will answer to the best of my abilities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, 15 years in an investment bank here, and I'm slightly disappointed with the top answers I'm reading, so here is my version. </p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street&quot; is a pretty broad term and most of the big firms do a lot of things, however I'll broadly split them up as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1) Corporate Banking / Advisory</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Providing advice, lending, and all kinds of services to big companies, ranging from multi-billion dollar merger/acquisition to day-to-day payment processing</p>
<p><strong>Who benefits?</strong> This one is easy... the big companies benefit, or they wouldn't pay the fees. Every big multinational operating in different countries relies on the services the big banks provide.</p>
<p><strong>Why do they get paid so much?</strong> At the top end, the biggest transactions (e.g. the $85 billion merger between AT&amp;T / Time Warner last year) are worth so much that the advisor's fee is like an afterthought. If you believe some good advice will get even 0.5% difference on the price paid, that's still almost half a billion dollars. Which makes a $50 million fee look like great value.</p>
<p><strong>2) Sales &amp; trading / intermediary services</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> This is probably the most complex to explain. Broadly it is buying and selling shares and other securities on behalf of other people, either private individuals or professional investors. That includes offering advice to and making purcheses on behalf of buyers (Broking), as well as advising issuers, creating derivatives, and marketing financial products on behalf of sellers (Sales). Finally there are pure intermediary services where a firm acts as &quot;market maker&quot; in other words offers to act as buyer or seller for anyone in the market to speed up the operation and avoid having to individually pair up every buyer/seller who wants to exchange their shares/securities. The market maker gets paid from the small difference (&quot;spread&quot;) between buy price and the sell price. </p>
<p><strong>Who benefits?</strong> As before, many services have a direct fee that the client pays - so it is the client who benefits. In many cases the client is another bank or a professional investor.  Ultimately, any company that relies on the markets for funding, or any individual who has investments or pensions, will benefit from markets operating efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Why do they get paid so much?</strong> In a word, volume. Not many companies can provide these complex services, and the amount of money that goes through big banks' trading floors is immense, so even small percentages or spreads add up quickly. It's not just traders on phones buying and selling, there are large numbers of mathematicians, lawyers, IT people, researchers and so on making sure the services are efficient, legal, and the advice is the best available. </p>
<p><strong>3) Professional Investors</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Operating funds and making investments. This is often what people think about when the term &quot;casino banking&quot; comes up. Fund managers operate funds with other peoples money, such as pension and investment funds. Proprietary traders use a bank's own money, but they often have to try and manage the bank's own risk to ensure it has a stable overall risk profile and is less likely to fail if there is a big shock or crash. Hedge funds use a combination of their own money and other (generally large) investors to borrow money and invest it, with higher risk but higher chances for rewards too.</p>
<p><strong>Who benefits?</strong> The investors, clearly, if the fund is successful. Everyone's savings and investments are likely managed by one of these fund managers and we all rely on them doing a good job for our own prosperity and retirement prospects. </p>
<p><strong>Why do they get paid so much?</strong> They manage large amounts of money and when they get it right, they make huge sums for their investors. The rewards follow the performance of the fund and it's a cut-throat world if you fail. </p>
<p>Overall, the answer to the question of &quot;who benefits&quot; comes down to &quot;money makes the world go round&quot;. There are people with money to invest (savers, pension funds, big companies with cash reserves) and many people who want access to that money (startups, governments, major corporations wanting to invest, individual borrowers). Banks help put two and two together, in all the hugely complicated ways that a modern economy operates. Everyone who needs money, who wants to borrow or invest or even just store and move money benefits from the banks doing their job properly, in all the different ways I outlined above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a big variety of roles in Finance. At a high level, financial institutions essentially facilitate the growth of literally every other industry there is by finding someone with money to invest in someone with a plan/project. Think small business going to a bank for a loan, but it gets scaled up and more complex with huge companies.</p>
<p>In more detail, you have the &quot;sell-side&quot; and the &quot;buy-side.&quot; The sell-side is what you think of as Investment Banks. These are the companies like Morgan Stanley, Citi, JP Morgan, Goldman, etc. that work with institutional clients. This mainly happens through advisory and trading functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advisory is what is &quot;Investment Banking,&quot; think analysts grinding away for 100 hours a week. Let's say a client retail company comes to a bank and wants to raise money/acquire a company/get sold. Let's say raise money for now, and they want to do that by selling equity (i.e. ownership stakes). First, the industry coverage group for retail learns everything about the company, and uses their expertise in this industry to put a value on the company. Once they do a lot of that, they hand it off to a market facing product group called Equity Capital Markets (the product meaning equity). This group sees what the market will accept and finishes pricing and marketing these new shares in the company. Let's say selling these shares raises $100 million. The advisory group earns a fee for doing this, as a percentage of the amount raised.</p>
</li>
<li>Sales and Trading. This is what you'd see in Wolf of Wall Street. Trading teams are called &quot;market makers.&quot; Someone wants to buy a stock/bond, someone wants to sell, they're in the middle. They buy the security from the seller and sell it to the buyer and a SLIGHTLY higher price and make a spread. They are out of the door at 5 PM and don't work weekends. Clients are large asset management funds (see below) and hedge funds and shit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The buy-side is actual investing. You have things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutual funds: Pretty standard funds of stocks and bonds and shit</li>
<li>Large asset managers: Think Blackrock. Has many mutual funds and other strategies</li>
<li>Alternatives: Real estate investors, private equity investors (buy a whole company, grow it for a few years, sell it for profit), and hedge funds (similar to Sales and Trading but they're the ones actually buying and selling stocks/bonds)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's an awesome question, but unfortunately it doesn't have a clear answer, as there are so many variables that can change the response.</p>
<p>There are 2 components to your immune system: the innate and adaptive. The innate just travels around and freaks out at everything it doesn't recognize. It doesn't matter if it's the common cold or anthrax. (slight exaggeration, since it does matter if it's bacterial or viral). It's going to react the same way. These are responsible for fever, phlegm, swelling, etc.  These happen within hours of being infected. The end goal here isn't to kill the infection. It's to fight until your adaptive cells can bring reinforcements.</p>
<p>You also have an adaptive immune system. These are (primarily) your T and B cells, which take time. They have to 'study' the infection, find a good way to kill it, and then mass produce the antibodies. This can take anywhere from hours (if you've already made antibodies) or days-weeks (if it's something brand new).</p>
<p>Let's say you get an infection that you've seen before. Your innate system attacks right away, and you start to notice those general signs of being sick. But then, your pre-formed antibodies quickly kill it. </p>
<p>Or maybe it's a brand new infection, but for some reason, they don't trigger your innate system as strongly as hers. Therefore, you only get mild symptoms until your adaptive* system kills it. It's also possible that your innate response being smaller actually lets the infection grow, causing you to be sick for a longer period of time</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you can't really say your system is stronger or weaker. The real question is whether it's good enough, and it sounds like both of yours works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question, but it's complicated, because different infections trigger the immune system to different amounts.  Sometimes, what kills a person isn't the infection itself, but the immune response to that infection.  In those cases, it's better to have a slightly weaker immune response; the response will still be strong enough to fight the infection, but not so strong as to cause you harm.</p>
<p>Another thing that will make a difference is how severe the infection gets.  A minor infection will trigger a lesser response, but if those bacteria or viruses grow out of control, this will trigger a big response, with worse symptoms.  You could be experiencing milder symptoms because you're controlling the infection at an earlier stage...or because your body is taking a more measured, less aggressive response to controlling the infection.</p>
<p>It's hard for me to say without samples.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hers is better, because it's reacting more strongly. However, a little known fact, the great Influenza epidemic of 1918 (a.k.a. H1N1) was unusual because its morbidity rate was so much higher in people who were in the &quot;prime of their lives&quot;. Older people and children didn't die in such high numbers.
This is thought to be because the young, strong adults had the best immune systems, and they died because they drowned in their bodies' own fluids, which were much less plentiful in older or younger people with weaker immune responses.
But that's a pretty freaky response. Usually the stronger immune system wins.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So different system respond to different bacteria and trigger different symptoms.</p>
<p>I'll touch on one, fever.</p>
<p>Bacteria and viruses are surprisingly temperature sensitive. They have no way good to regulate the temperature inside their cells. So in this case they are dependent on the temperature of the host.</p>
<p>let's take everyone's least favorite dumpster-diver, the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Opossum_2.jpg" target="_blank">Opossum</a>.</p>
<p>Opossums are largely not susceptible to the rabies virus, as many people think. </p>
<h1>DISCLAIMER: They can still carry it, as well as other diseases, seek medical attention if bitten / scratched.</h1>
<p>This is because their body temperature is low when compared to other mammals, generally around 90-93 <em>F. The rabies virus cannot sustain itself in this lower temperature, as compared to everyone's <a href="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/17/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-6715-1445290091-1.jpg" target="_blank">favorite</a> dumpster diver, whose body temp averages closer to 100 </em>F.</p>
<p>Now what does this have to do with fever? Well evolution. If a bacteria, or virus thrives at 98.6 <em>F, but cannot survive temperatures of 100-101</em>F well it would do your body good to &quot;sweat it out&quot;.</p>
<p>So somewhere way way way back one of your ancestors immune responses caused them to heat up. This killed a bacterial or viral infection, and kept them alive to procreate, and thus the trait was passed along, and spread.</p>
<p>So now fever is a common symptom. Though it is not so much the infection, as it is the body trying to cook out the infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't notice it when you're not sick, but your nostril actually do this all the time. It's just exaggerated when you're sick. It's called the nasal cycle. At any given time, one of your nostrils is doing most of the work and is clear, while the other one is &quot;resting&quot; and is more congested. It's managed by your autonomic nervous system so you can't control it and most of the time don't notice it. There are two reasons for this. The first is that it gives the cilia and mucous membranes a chance to rest so they can better filter and humidify when they're doing the work. The second is that it helps you smell better. Some smells are better detected in fast-moving air, and some are better detected in slow moving air. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

At any given time even without a cold if you put your hand under your nose, you may be able to feel that more air is coming out of one side than the other. This helps us smell better by giving each nostril a break once in a while. So when you are congested the nasal cycle continues and the side that is getting more air flow will be less stuffed up than the side that is taking a break. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
