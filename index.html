<p>This seems to indicate that a decision to choose a supplier with 100% renewables may not have any meaningful market impact, and may simply be a &quot;feel good&quot; purchasing choice.   Is this a problem of scale, with not enough homeowners voluntarily opting to purchase from renewable suppliers? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you choose to pay for renewables then you will be directly paying for that many kilowatt hours of energy from renewables. Most people don't care enough to do so, and residential power usage accounts for something like less than 20% of total electric use over a 24 hour period. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=86&amp;t=1" target="_blank">60% is used in industrial processes, and the remaining 40% is split between Commercial and Residential.</a> Residential being the smaller portion thereof.</p>
<p>Last time I checked people who voluntarily paid extra to get renewable energy accounted for less than 1% in my state. So we're talking like 0.2% of all electric use. That's just not a meaningful portion of the demand.</p>
<p>That being said, most electric utilities have some renewables generation in their portfolio these days, even if it's just for feel good stories in the local paper it still accounts for more generation than there is demand from people willing to pay extra.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in energy efficiency products sector and spend the majority of my time working with utilities to reduce the grid demand from consumers and business. While I don't work directly in the energy purchase agreement side of things, I know and work with a lot who do so this is my take away.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is now way to buy 100% renewable power from a utility as the grid is like a big bowl with a lot of different power sources poured into it, and you get some of the mixed power out.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.there is (currently) no feasible (read: cost effective) way to create a 100% renewable grids as all of our renewable power sources are pretty temperamental and are not very good at producing the baseline amount of power a utility needs through a day. E.g the sun doesn't always shine and it's not always windy, but people always need power.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Battery storage is nowhere near as effective as it needs to be in order to store the quantity of power needed to support our communities. It's very very cost prohibitive. This is why people like Elon Musk are dedicating the majority of their wealth and skill towards fixing this issue, as the inefficiency of batteries is the single biggest thing holding back human advancement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need for baseline demand for power is filled by legacy technologies like nuclear, and hydro electric and short term demand being filled by burning natural gas and coal with wind and solar falling somewhere in the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growth of personal solar has lead to some big issues for utilities for utilities as they build a forecast for the power will be needed and occasionally if amount of power being put on the grid comes from outside sources it can disrupt those plans. Think of the bowl metaphor again, utilities plan to keep the bowl filled to the level needed, but occasionally the personal solar pours too much in the bowl and it overflows (very very dangerous thing) and the utility needs to pay people to use their bowls. When this happens the cost of power becomes negative which is why a lot of utilities are being more restrictive with solar.</p>
</li>
<li>When utilities cannot find the extra bowls for the power they are forced to just release the energy which we know is a mix of types of power. </li>
</ol>
<p>When you buy 100% renewable you are often buying demand not from your utility but from a third party provider. This puts the pressure on utilities to buy more power from solar farms which in turn helps to drive down solar cost but also incentivizes utilities to invest in better battery tech in order to capture the benefit of solar power. It's also makes them build solar into the standard and peak demand modeling which helps to reduce dependence on other less effective sources. While a single person is not much of a difference maker, the tens of thousands making the switch it becomes pretty influential.</p>
<p>So I would say it is a net good, but you need to determine if the additional cost to you is worth it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In reality, we experienced roughly a doubling of our electric rates.  </p>
<p>BUT we can chose to have our electricity provided by renewable sources, which is largely a scam.   First off, you really can't select the source of your power, only the company you pay for it.  SO 100% of your power could easily be coming from coal but you're paying your renewable energy company to put an equal amount of power on the grid.  It would be like having five water companies dump water into a lake and you dip in your cup and pay the company with the cleanest water for the drink.  </p>
<p>All of us use electricity from renewable energy companies (assuming you're not off the grid).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Thus, they will be dead when you try to thaw them.  Methods for preventing this have been developed over the last few decades, including: rate of freezing, thawing procedure, and the inclusion of cryoprotectants.  Cryoprotectants are compounds which have the ability to prevent the formation of large intracellular ice crystals.  The most common one used in the lab is DMSO, but it looks like glycerol is the most popular for freezing clinical specimens.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've done some research, here is what I've found:</p>
<p>Epitaxy, for those unaware, is a crystalline growth on top of a substrate (think seed). This also requires it to be grown with regard to the growths orientation, as opposed to free- forming non-epitaxal growth. There are four sub- groupings of this, depending on whether the substrate is the same as the crystalline growth, and whether you're making a mono-layer growth (often used in making silicon wafers for semiconductors) or 3d structure similar to what you'd imagine when thinking of a standard crystal growth in nature. </p>
<p>There are many ways of accomplishing this, using a vapor,  liquid, or even an amorphous solid. Vapor is the most common (in industrial usage) and is what we care about here. Note that when making a silicon layer, they use a compound such as silicon tetrachloride and hydrogen as a &quot;doping&quot; agent (what the vapor they're intending to grow with is comprised of) at a high temperature (1200-1250C). This chemical process depends highly on the proportions of the amount of each chemical compound present, as having too much of the hydrogen chloride (the result of having the silicon deposit itself) will begin reversing the process.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only way to create a silicon wafer, which is important when answering your question. Quartz is made up of silicon dioxide, and is the most abundant mineral on Earth. When creating a wafer with SiH4 instead,  it creates an oxidizing species which can contaminate the intended pure silicon with SiO2. (Quartz.)</p>
<p>When looking at examples of Quartz from nature, you see the primary difference is that the branches of growth are not properly aligned to become epitaxial. If you were to cleave a substrate into a flat plane, leave it in a suitable environment for growth to germinate, and didn't have any outside interference, you would likely get symmetrical even growth above it, which by definition is epitaxal.</p>
<p>You could do this in a lab in the same way as you make silicon wafers. Use a chemical compound to dope a substrate with silicon, allow it to oxidize into quartz, and viola. Ultimately we do not do this because there is no demand for it. We are already capable of obtaining quartz naturally very easily. (Again, most common mineral on Earth)</p>
<p>Also interesting to note is there is a product called &quot;liquid glass&quot; which actually sprays a very fine layer of Quartz onto products as a way of keeping them sterile/clean since the crystalline layer inhibits bacterial growth and makes cleaning easier. </p>
<p>Tl,dr: You can, but there is no real reason to. </p>

<p>The cheapest Toyota is going to be &quot;better&quot; than any bespoke car in terms of overall quality, assuming we define quality to be &quot;leaves the factory as the engineers intended it to leave the factory.&quot;  Robots and scaled production let you achieve error rates on the order of one-in-a-million in a best case. </p>
<p>Humans will never get there.  If something is hand made, a HUGE amount of extremely expensive post-production quality assurance is necessary to make sure the product is good to go.  For low production volume/high profit products, that's a fair tradeoff.  It's cheaper to do that expensive quality assurance at the end of manufacturing than it is to spend hundreds of millions &quot;front loading&quot; quality by creating a really great production system.  </p>
<p>And because the per-unit profit is so high, you can make a &quot;really good&quot; cars by over-engineering them to account for variation in the production process and such.  Toyota doesn't over-engineer things.   There isn't a lot of extra material in a Camry.  Instead, they figure out exactly how much material is necessary to make that car last 10-20 years with x number of failures, and that's how much material they put in.</p>
<p>And, as /u/cantab314 suggests, there are materials that resist automation because they aren't uniform or predictable.  </p>

<p>One thing I would like to point out is that &quot;handmade&quot; may not mean what you would assume.  These days most of the time it's means that most of the assembly work is done by hand rather than robots.  In modern luxury niche handed vehicles, the majority of what you see is production scale parts covered by hand with leather.  Everything behind it will be made on a large injection moulding, milling, or casting scale. </p>
<p>These days, &quot;handmade&quot; refers largely to the assembly method as opposed to the production method.  It's there because as someone else mentioned, if you're making low volume high profit products it's hard to front the cash for big production systems, especially when you can use it as a selling point.  If you can pay someone a low-medium hourly rate to assemble a car you can then sell for a higher price, why wouldn't you?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can give my 2 cents here. I'm a robotics engineer for automotive companies. Also, I've been to where some Rolls are built. Very skilled workers are much better than robots in certain areas. I'm saying better in the sense of quality.  I'll use an example I'm familiar with. It's applying sealer to various seams of the car where metal comes together. If you open your hood or trunk you can probably see some a bead of sealer around the edges. They're applied everywhere almost and on a Rolls they have to be absolutely perfect. Robots can do this but they are used for speed and quantity. Compared to a skilled human the seams a robot applies are just ok. Humans have an instant feedback loop that robots do not. Many variables like humidity, changing viscosity of material, metal fit tolerances affect the quality of the seam. Humans can feel it, see it as it's happening and adjust their application on the fly. A robot is just going to lay it down the same no matter what. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Very very good for them.</p>
<p>Eating or drinking it (via water or table salt) helps to increase your teeths lifespan, and prevent cavities.</p>
<p>Smearing it on your teeth (via toothpaste) also helps to fight off cavities, (it's a slightly different kind of flouride).</p>
<p>The amount of flouride required before it becomes toxic is multiple times what you get from either source, so having it in both water and toothpaste ensures that most people get enough of it, generally without the danger of it becoming toxic. </p>
<p>(You would need to drink some 10 litres of average fliuridated water in one day before it started to become toxic) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To build on some other comments - fluoride can actually help to harden the structure on your teeth. It is believed that the fluoride can replace some of the hydroxyapatite structure in enamel with fluroapatite which is a harder compound that is more difficult to erode.</p>
<p>The level of fluoride in drinking water is quite low. To get the maximal benefit it would be better to use toothpaste or mouthwash which have much higher concentrations of fluoride (all of which are safely below concerning concentrations). These levels are highly regulated by the FDA in the US, as you will see most toothpastes will deliver similar amounts of total fluoride. In addition, fluoride uptake is not 100% efficient so the amount you see on the tube is likely not the amount your mouth will absorb.</p>
<p>The fluoride delivery itself is typically through three common ingredients- sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, and stannous fluoride. Changing the source of fluoride can potentially have additional benefits for your oral health (e.g. stannous fluoride is known to have some degree of sensitivity benefit). This can also influence the total fluoride uptake in your mouth.</p>
<p>One final note is that fluoride is so important for oral health that it's very rare you will find a toothpaste without it that bears the symbol of the ADA. As a previous oral care researcher who worked with fluoride on a daily basis, I believe many of the concerns around fluoride are misguided due to the relatively low exposure levels we actually experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Iodine/iodide is vital for thyroid hormone. That's one of the primary question marks. Iodide would actually be a safer and healthier substitute to fluoride as it's something our body wants. Fluoride is a cheap alternative as it's mass produced as an industry waste product. I don't say that to demonize it. There's room for plenty of research in this area with a lot less done than most would think. Having this discussion with anyone is near impossible though because 99% of people don't have knowledge of chemistry and just act scornful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is obviously a gross generalization, but it seems like the &quot;old world&quot; shows this pattern as well.  The middle east has a society that is many millennia old, and the social controls there are quite strong.  Western Europe likewise has stronger social expectations than he US, and is a place that has ancient roots.  The euro-american society in North America is only a few hundred years old by comparison.  The west coast did not have american cities established with significant population until the industrial age.  Therefore the founding principles of these places are newer, and based more on innovation and ingenuity than on religious conformity or political fealty.  Likewise, as a geographically remote part of the continent, it required a certain adventure seeking mentality to get out here for a very long time.  And even in the 20th century, it was often a risky economic proposition to relocate to California when the east coast and upper mid-west were still economically strong.  Therefore California has been populated by folks seeking a new life far from the restrictions of their more conservative eastern hometowns.  I think, given enough time however, California will begin to show more of an East-coast style unfriendliness and work-ethic.  But it'll probably be another few generations.  Like I said however, this stuff is pretty much speculation and observation, I'm no PhD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would gather it has more to do with the cultural differences than anything.  Weather, though some may argue that it isn't cultural, leads to a more laid back environment due to less strain on the body to adapt to varying temperatures and weather patterns.  People spend more time away from their immediate stressors (e.g. Bills, broken pipes, etc.) by going out into the fair weather.  They aren't restricted to their homes, which may cause them to go &quot;stir crazy&quot;.  Another may be a &quot;perceived&quot; laid back environment do to mass media.  A lot of the movies made make California more fun, while making New York more stressful.
In my experience, there are two immediately noticeable factors in the east that aren't as prevalent in the west.  One, the weather is unpredictable and quite miserable sometimes.  The winters are generally very cold, and the summers are extremely humid and hot.  This causes people to stay at home, away from external stimulation, which causes increasing stress.  The second cause could be a heavy presence of religion in the east (especially the southeast).  Religion requires people to constantly restrain themselves from some of the joys in life.  I am not speaking of immoral things (like sexual deviance), but more like enjoying a beer with a friend, or going to a rock concert, or even enjoying an occasional &quot;R&quot; rated movie.  I am sure there are other factors I am missing, but from my perspective, those seem to be some of the glaring differences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personal debt and national debts aren't really the same thing. Governmental debt is typically issued through things called bonds. When a bond is bought, the government guarantees that the owner of the bond will be paid interest for their investment into the government. Most of this 'debt' is owned by the public. So in this way, national debt is more analogous to a a stock: People will buy bonds (like they buy shares of a company) and get paid in interest (like some companies issue dividends to shareholders) over a period of time, usually 10+ years. However, interest rates for these bonds are typically very low, right now a 30 year bond has interest rates of 3.1%, which is far below what you would expect to average on the stock market. So why would anybody purchase a treasury note or bond? Because you are essentially guaranteed your interest payments; the US has <em>never</em> defaulted on a single payment like this. So it becomes very attractive to people, countries, or organizations that want an extremely safe place to stash their money and have it grow. Of course, it's entirely possible for countries to default on this stuff, it happened to Greece a couple years back. As I said before, the US has never defaulted, and if they do start defaulting, you probably have more to worry about than getting paid your 3% interest rate.</p>
<p>So the TL;DR is: People investing in the government is what generally creates national debt. Investing in the US government through bonds and notes is essentially the safest place you can put your money and still earn reasonable interest on it, as it has never failed to make a payment. Though it's possible for countries to default on their payments, creditors can't simply walk up and demand all of their owed money.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1>Core Answer</h1>
<p>Taxation cannot quickly adjust to momentary financial demands. Changing the tax rate typically requires an act of governance. Changes in economic output happen based on uncontrolable market forces - and wars, and weather, not just locally but around the world.</p>
<p>In short, taxation is not like salary, it defies close prediction.</p>
<p>So any given year (or quarter, or whatever the monetary collection cycle is) the taxation received is either equal to, more than, or less than the expenses. Equal too is basically unheard of so that leaves one to assume that every period one will either be over or under funded.</p>
<p>When over funded, the government coffers experience a surplus.</p>
<p>When under-funded, the government must take out a loan.</p>
<p>Those loans are the deficit and they typically have a repayment period of years, like five or ten, to smooth over predicted variations in income.</p>
<p>Basically the revolving credit of the government is used to smooth over the ups-and-downs of its income. </p>

<p>The Republicans tend to &quot;Borrow and Spend&quot;, and the Democrats tend to &quot;Tax and Spend&quot;. One of the things the higher Democratic taxation has paid for is buying off the Republican debt.</p>
<p>Now all administrations take out <em>some</em> debt, particularly because our taxation scheme is resistant to change and our populace doesn't pay attention to our budget.</p>
<p>The american people are like the flighty children of rich parents. They want their services and they want them now, but they don't want to contribute to the family effort if it can be avoided.</p>
<p>So the cycle is thus:</p>
<p>Republicans get elected on &quot;small government and lower taxes&quot;.</p>
<p>Republicans &quot;reduce the budget and lower taxes&quot; but they do this understating or not including entire budget line items. For instance the entire &quot;Iraq War&quot; of the G.W. Bush administration was financed as &quot;emergency spending&quot; instead of budget items. This means that they've created debt but they can <em>publish</em> &quot;visibly smaller&quot; budgets.</p>
<p>This shell game includes cutting social programs because the average american citizen thinks twenty-million dollars is &quot;a lot of money&quot;. It's a lot of money for a family of four, but for the total cash flow of 2/3rds of a continent it's peanuts.</p>
<p>With the Republican &quot;more cops, less aid&quot; programs in force the tax base tends to shrink and the total taxable income goes down.</p>
<p>With Republican &quot;trickle down&quot; policies, which have <em>NEVER</em> worked, the tax income from businesses and rich folks goes down.</p>
<p>So with crappy job numbers and breaks for the rich the actual deficit spikes even as the rhetoric promises that the deficit should be going down. The representatives all shrug like &quot;nobody could have known this would happen&quot; even though it's happened every time.</p>
<p>Then we get a Democratic administration. It includes the current loan repayments in the budget and restores the funding of cut programs. This involves cutting things like military spending to reapportion the money into the previously cut social programs. That twenty-million is huge in food stamp terms, but peanuts to the line items like military spending.</p>
<p>With socially conscious programs restored the income tax basis rises.</p>
<p>With the expiration of tax breaks for the rich and corporations, the tax basis rises again.</p>
<p>Democrats budget for what they <em>really</em> spend, so the budget expenses &quot;visibly rise&quot;.</p>
<p>The people get all pissed off because the Democrats raised revenue, while ignoring the fact that they, the individuals, just returned to status quo after the little debt-induced spending spree.</p>
<p>So at the end of the Democratic dominance we've got surplesses and a shrinking deficit... which the Republicans characterize as &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;high taxes&quot; and the pendulum swings back for another go.</p>
<h1>Systems Theory Analysis</h1>
<p>The cycle isn't really caused by taxes and jobs, it's caused by mathematical problems with the U.S. voting system.</p>
<ol>
<li>We lack plurality voting</li>
<li>We have a 50% plus one guy requirement to win the presidency.</li>
<li>We lack mandatory voting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of these three failings we have &quot;cicada voters&quot; who only show up once every four or eight years to vote when the presidency is at stake. Then they just disappear again.</p>
<p>These cicada largely just vote for &quot;whichever party doesn't hold the presidency&quot; because nobody fixed their entire life for them in the last four years.</p>
<p>These cicada just vote for &quot;different&quot; or &quot;in protest&quot;, so we get the &quot;I voted for Brexit because I knew it would never pass but I wanted someone to listen to <em>me</em> for a change&quot; effect. But we get it every four or eight damn years.</p>
<p>So we are stuck vacillating between two stupid extremes with no chance of moderation because our system <strong><em>mathematically</em> <em>requires</em></strong> the pendulum to swing from Coke to Pepsi and back, and none of the other sodas get a chance to break into the big leagues.</p>
<p>If voting were mandatory...</p>
<p>If there was more than two <em>workable</em> choices...</p>
<p>If a three-way split for president could be resolved without simply handing the decision to whichever party was in control of the House of Representatives...</p>
<p>Then the &quot;two party system&quot; wouldn't be mathematically required and the polar oscillations would be dampened instead of amplified.</p>
<h1>Back on Topic</h1>
<p>So all governments need credit/debt to function.</p>
<p>And no government generates sufficient surplus to repay loans early as they typically have a backlog of things that need money spent on them.</p>
<p>The question is one of equilibrium between the demands for taxation, usually lower taxes; increased or improved services; and the waste expense of paying interest on the loans.</p>
<p>TL;DR :: Economics is tricky shit. People want governments to do magic without cost. Debt lets things be smoothed out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but this has two parts. </p>
<p>Debt, in the US for example,  is mostly owed by the government to it's own citizens.  </p>
<p>Also,  a country can have debt owed and owned at the same time, even to the same country.  The US government could owe a German company money while a different company owes our government. </p>
<p>Debt can be a good thing.  It allows you to create opportunities now that will create more cash flow.  It can certainly backfire if you owe to much.  But at this point,  US debt is only a concern.  Not a crisis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers are in part right, but there's more to it.  This isn't ELI5 - more like ELI15 (some of this is copy/paste from other comments I've made):</p>
<p>The way a government uses debt is very very different from the way you and I use debt. Regular people use debt to change the timing of when you buy something. Take a house (and this is a huge simplification): you save for 30 years and buy the house in cash in the year 2047 OR you get a mortgage today, buy the house today and pay off the mortgage in 2047. What you've done is shifted time. Debt, to an individual, is basically the ability to separate acquisition of something and the payment for the something.</p>
<p>For a national government that controls its own currency, increasing the debt is the most efficient way to <strong>increase its monetary base</strong>. A US Treasury Note/Bond is fully exchangeable for a $100 bill, and from an economic/finance perspective <em>they are identical</em> (eg 'print' a $100 bill or create a bond - it doesn't matter). The only real argument comes in the practical application (good luck paying for your mocha frappachino with a 30yr US treasury bond). </p>
<p>The interchangeability of bonds/cash means that the inflationary impact from printing cash is identical to printing a bond. There is a concept called 'moment of inflation' (eg when inflation hits an economy) and the moment of inflation for cash and bonds are identical - its the second that cash/bond enters general circulation. </p>
<p><strong>So the TL;DR here is:</strong> countries run debts b/c its an extremely efficient way to expand their monetary base to fit the economy (eg an economy of size X needs a monetary base of size Y).  When countries need a bigger monetary base, they print bonds (eg debt) they are never going to payoff.  </p>
<p>When you expand that base too far too fast, you run into trouble; however, debt in the right ratio is perfectly healthy and, in many ways, necessary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Manufacturers (or more accurately their marketing departments) sometimes use the terms interchangeably but in the most common usage, AWD is safe to use on dry pavement and 4wd is not.  The reason for this is the <a href="http://www.cars.com/go/advice/vpedia/center_differential_popup.jsp" target="_blank">center differential</a>, a set of gears that allows the front wheels and rear wheels to turn at different speeds when turning.  You have a differential between the two drive wheels of a 2wd car or truck as well, if you didn't, your drivetrain would wear out extremely quickly as the inner wheel needs to turn slower than the outer wheel during any kind of turn.</p>
<p>In a typical 4wd truck or jeep with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_case" target="_blank">transfer case</a> you have essentially a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with an extra gearbox that allows you to engage another driveshaft to power the front wheels. (and also typically a gear reduction so you can put both driveshafts in low range.)  It's a better system for hardcore offroading and simpler to manufacture, but it has the limitation on dry pavement that both driveshafts are mechanically linked together, putting a similar strain on the drivetrain as a 2wd car with no differential. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are technical differences between the 2, but the core is this.</p>
<p>AWD is intended for use 100% of the time.  Most AWD vehicles do not include the ability to turn it on or off.</p>
<p>4wd vehicles are normally RWD unless 4WD is engaged.  It is not considered a good idea to engage 4wd on dry pavement or at normal driving speeds.  4wd is intended for use in off road type situations only, not in normal day to day driving. </p>
<p>Normally 4wd is only offered on trucks or vehicles that are based on trucks.  AWD is a much newer technology that's often available on smaller SUVs or cars. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One large benefit to this is to measure if someone is actually engaging with your content on a page. When a person lands on your page, then leaves without interacting with anything, many analytics libraries will consider that a bounce, even if the user reads some or all of the content.  However, if they click something, that's considered an action, and that graduates you to a non bounce visitor - you didn't just land on the page and navigate away, you expressed interest in the content. This lets you do  content optimization - if you are getting a lot of non bounce visitors on certain pieces of content, you can promote that content more heavily, which in turn leads to more visitors to your site, as opposed to content that causes people to bounce which should be promoted less.</p>
<p>Other answers mention bandwidth conservation which may be a factor as well.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since a lot of comments are talking about ads I will amend my answer to address that as well. My answer alludes to the fact that with content optimization, if you can drive more people to your site, more ads are served which can increase ad revenue. There are a lot of payment models for ads, but generally, you might get paid a very small amount for an impression (which is just loading and showing an ad on your site), but you will get paid a lot more if someone actually clicks the ad and follows through to the content behind it (as such, the companies that are paying for the ads also pay per impression and per click, and clicks are much more expensive - there's a common metric called &quot;cost per click&quot; which measures how much you are paying for each click, so you can assess your return on investment). </p>
<p>With the 'continue reading' button, you could slap more ads below, but (and I'm speculating here) I'd expect if that 'continue reading' button was not there the ad would be there regardless. As such, I'm not certain it'd be a factor in generating more ad revenue, if you didn't have the 'continue reading', you'd get the impression and possible click as soon as the user viewed the ad (which would require one less click). The only counter argument to this I can think of is if ad serving companies require user interaction before you display more ads - but I don't know if that's true. </p>
<p>I also found this asked on stackexchange that had a few other good reasons as well: <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/82914/whats-the-point-of-a-read-full-story-button" target="_blank">https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/82914/whats-the-point-of-a-read-full-story-button</a></p>
<p>EDIT 2: A number of people are citing a lot of extra reasons below that can all be valid as well. This is not the end-all-be-all answer, which is why I said &quot;one large benefit&quot; to talk about how this is one of many. There are a ton of different reasons to design your content to have this - my example is just the most common one I've seen, but world of web advertising is very complex, with ad providers imposing rules and rapid policy changes as sites try to optimize their ad revenue within those rules! This is a simple question with a myriad of complex possible answers - I just gave one :).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
