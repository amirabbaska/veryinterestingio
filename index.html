		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As any barista will explain coffee is a delicate balance of quality beans, quality equipment and a stedy hand. </p>
<p>Good beans means that they are fresh, roasted to the correct point in a uniform manner and ground in a quality grinder creating a uniform powder at the correct calibre for the application (the faster the extraction method, the finer the coffee more or less)</p>
<p>Good equipment means having a good burr grinder thats mantained clean and produces a consistant grind, and a coffee machine that mantains consistant pressure and temperature during extraction. </p>
<p>And a Stedy hand to know how to correctly tamper the coffee, how to wet it a bit before hand, how to time the extraction correctly and how to judge the extraction depending on flow and color. </p>
<p>TL;DR making good coffee requires good equipment, skill and decent coffee beans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my time in specialty coffee, it takes some experimenting with grind size/brew time/bean-water ratio before you hit that range of flavor you want. </p>
<p>The biggest advice on making a perfect cup at home is to play to your water: Every time I move to a new city/state, the change in water alone is enough to have to change up my brewing methods.
Going from well-filtered water at a shop to the higher solute content of city tap water required me to adjust my grind/temp/time accordingly to achieve similar taste profiles from the same coffee at home.</p>
<p>An adjustable burr grinder and fresh(~&lt;30 days old, imo) is almost completely necessary for great coffee. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>May I recommend trying to cold brew your coffee? I found cold brewing to be common at coffee places and restaurants and reduces a lot of bitter flavor from coffee. This could explain the better taste.</p>
<p>One ounce ground coffee to two cups water, let then sit in the fridge for 24 hours. This makes the cold brew concentrate. Pour concentrate into French press to filter and remove grounds (cheese cloth also works).</p>
<p>Depending on your tastes, fill your cup 1/4 to 1/2 way with concentrate, the rest with water (and ice if you prefer cold coffee).</p>
<p>Best way I've ever found to make non bitter coffee like you'd get at a nice place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Unless you spent a lot of money on yours, you probably don't have one. Pod coffee machines won't really come close.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may have not popped because there may not be a bubble there at all.  A bubble, by definition, happens when some good/service sees unsubstantiated and artificial increases in price, usually due to manipulation by financial markets.  But the earnings premium for a college degree is higher than it has ever been before, and it continues to increase. <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/job-skill-trendsthe-college-wage-premium/27091" target="_blank">source</a>.  </p>
<p>Whereas in 1980 college graduates only make 40% more than non-grads, today the number is around 85%. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/earnings.htm#education" target="_blank">source</a></p>
<p>The ROI for college is higher than the stock market, bonds, real estate, and private equity. Unlike the housing bubble, a college degree’s increase in value over the years is very real and substantiated by data. </p>
<p>Even if there is a bubble, there are key differences between the housing crash and student loans. With a house, there’s an actual tangible asset that can reduce in market price very quickly when there’s an abrupt selling of houses. With higher education, there is nothing to be resold after it was bought. </p>
<p>While it might be sort of similar if many people defaulted on their loans at the same time and tax payers had to bail them out, this is not what is occurring. Even if it did, people would still have their degrees (unlike defaulting on a mortgage where your house gets taken). In fact, default rates have declined since the late 80s/early 90s. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2011-09-student-loan-default.html" target="_blank">source</a>. Most people end up paying their loans, many times over throughout their lives, and benefit greatly from having a degree. </p>
<p>And even if they didn’t, there still is very much “consumption” value in college, in the form of intellectual growth, social experience, etc. This would be impossible to repossess as well. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there needs to be MUCH reform. I think guaranteed federal loans are bad policy. But I don't expect to see a massive financial fallout from student loans. </p>
<p>TL; DR... Your original post assumes a bubble exists.  It might not, and even if it did, there are key differences between student loans and housing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Very few of these equations can be solved exactly and the math gets pretty hairy at points but things you wouldn't expect can be modeled as plasma.  Electrons in room temperature metals are often modeled as plasma because they behave like fluids.  If you're interested in thiskind if modeling I'd suggest chen's introduction to plasma physics.  You can find a pdf online for free pretty easily and it's pretty interesting even though it's pretty dense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A different way of looking at this than the answer already given (which is correct), transport of any quantity are generally modeled  by:</p>
<ul>
<li>local time variation + transport by bulk motion = external source + internal source + dissipation</li>
</ul>
<p>with the necessary closure equations. You can use this frame work to describe any conserved quantity (mass, momentum, angular momentum, energy, charge, etc.). Anyways, if there are results from fluid mechanics that are similar to your system you can just map one set of solutions to the other. This often works because the dissipation and bulk transport are similar for different phenomena but can fall apart because the external and internal sources are qualitatively different.</p>
<p>More generally (and more usefully) you can also map solution <em>methods</em> from one domain to the other. For example, your particular transport equation has bulk transport by fluid motion and dissipation, you can use models from CFD or integral methods etc. to find an approximate solution. Or maybe your problem is closer to a stress-strain problem so you can use methods from FEA to approximate a solution. It all depends on the system you are studying.</p>
<p>Note the method I laid out had continuum mechanics in mind. For something more akin to particle dynamics the approach would be different (solving the Boltzmann equation for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, except that you need to also take into account that electrons are charged. When your fluid is charged we call fluid dynamics &quot;Magnetohydrodynamics&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics</a>).</p>
<p>This is important when you want to model plasmas, for example in fusion reactors or in stars.</p>
<p>A few responses so far are addressing the question of whether notions useful for studying simple circuits are useful for studying certain fluid dynamics problems. There will be a certain regime where this can be useful, because of the underlying fact that electrons in a wire are a fluid. The problem is that the fluid of electrons is not like the usual fluids we have in pipes. In particular, it is more like a gas (low number density compared to self interactions). The technical name for the model used to describe electrons in a metal is as a &quot;Fermi gas&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your body releases adrenaline it's because your brain has sent out an alert that you need to prepare to either stay and fight or run to safety (flight). You brain prepares your body by increasing your heart rate, so that your core organs are functioning at their highest level of performance. Your brain will also increase your vision to be focused on what is straight ahead of you (tunnel vision). Also, your brain increases your respirations to increase oxygen flow to your brain and organs.
It's interesting to note that when this fight or flight trigger is misfired from your brain, when there is no need to fight or flee, it is was millions experience as a panic attack. The physical symptoms you experience during a panic attack are due to the adrenaline released by your brain to prepare for fight or flight. Beta blockers have been found to assist in decreasing the amount and frequency of adrenaline in people who suffer from panic attacks.</p>
<p>Oh and the sharper vision is to assist you in your escape. For those in the panic attack category, they report feeling as though they have tunnel vision or that things appear dreamlike or surreal.</p>
<p>Hope that helps to answer your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Postal service is the best analogy here.  Your house address is how people send letters to you.    Each up address can be broken down into street and house number but for this example let's just says it's your whole address.  </p>
<p>Routers/firewalls are like post offices, they may not have anyone there who knows where 12345 easy lane is, but it knows where the post office in Simple, TX is, so it sends it there. </p>
<p>In the mean time while it passes through some of these routers/firewalls the traffic gets monitored and logged. </p>
<p>Apartments are more like dynamic ips, it's a temporary address assigned to a large group of dwellings.  This is most of us who have home internet connections.  The apt complex knows who has what address, and when questioned they know who had apt 987 in June of 2008.  </p>

<p>As for tracing online activities - it becomes a little bit more hairy. Say you are at campus and connect through the same router as all the other students. Then the router is the only thing with a global IP address. Everyone else connecting through that router will identify as the same IP (it's called NAT if you want to read further)</p>
<p>Your home connection may or may not be a fixed IP. There is a limited number of IP addresses so most ISP's use dynamic IP's. This means that your IP of today may be your neighbors tomorrow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Computers and routers don't send data to host names, they need something that's easier for computers to understand. Every computer and router connected to the internet has a numeric address, the IP address. There's a process that converts names like www.reddit.com to addresses and your computer does that and sends the request to the address. </p>
<p>Now, to get the response back your computer needs to have an address. I'm going to gloss over some details you can google if you're interested (rfc1918, nat, dhcp) but your computer gets an IP address from your ISP automatically and when you send a request to a server that request includes your address so the server knows where to send the reply. </p>
<p>Now, your address uniquely identifies your computer on the internet, so if someone does something on the internet the server they talked to has a record of what IP address made the request. From that people know which ISP issues that address to a user and then they can ask the ISP which customer had that address. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever been in a group with two people that have the same first name? Someone might say &quot;Hey John&quot; or whatever name, and both look up and wonder if you mean them or the other John. Usually this problem is solved by adding more information that only applies to one of them, like their last name, or simply calling them by their last name to begin with. </p>
<p>Computers have this problem when they try to talk to each other too, especially now that we've connected thousands of them together on the Internet. This problem is solved by giving each computer that connects to the Internet a number that only they have, an IP address. </p>
<p>Since the Internet got way bigger than anyone had thought of back when they chose the numbers used for IP addresses, they divided them into public and private IP addresses. The private ones can't connect to the Internet, so they don't need to be unique. Each home or business has at least one router, which is a special type of computer with both a private IP address and a public IP address, the latter being assigned to it by their Internet service provider, like Comcast or CenturyLink. Computers and game consoles and tablets and stuff use their private IP addresses to talk to the router on its private IP address, which then uses its public IP address to talk to other computers on the Internet. </p>
<p>So people on the Internet can sometimes see the public IP address and can look up what Internet service provider it is from, and find the city and state it's in. Unless the customer posts it somewhere, only your Internet service provider knows the actual address of the house or business behind an IP address. A government or a hacker may be able to get that information from the Internet service provider, but is usually very difficult and rarely happens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Websites are just computers with their own phone numbers: Reddit, Google, Facebook, all have their own numbers. When you want to visit a website, your computer uses a service akin to the YellowPages to find the phone number for that service. This is called DNS.</p>
<p>So your computer looks up the records for whichever site you're visiting and connects to that service and you can now talk to each other. The internet providers around the world all have the physical infrastructure in place to route all traffic from everyone in the world.</p>
<p>You can be traced the same way as you can by your phone number. If you prank call someone, your number will show up on their caller ID. Someone only has to look up your number (IP) to find out who your provider is, call your provider, and request your account holder information.</p>
<p>When you connect to a website or service, they can see your IP address in their logs. There are ways around this, called proxies. These are just middle-men which route your connections.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, what you see in the movies is fake although this used to work back in the 60s.</p>
<p>On old cars, the ignition key just worked a switch. You had a switch for &quot;on&quot; which activated electrical circuits like the fuel pump and the spark ignition system. Then, there was a second switch which activates an electric motor which starts the engine turning. Once the engine is turning, and assuming it's OK, then as long as the engine has fuel and power to the spark system, it'll keep running.</p>
<p>So, a thief could break into the car, look under the dash for the wires to the ignition switch, and activate the circuits by touching the wires together. You'd have to tie the main power circuit &quot;on&quot;, and then you could run the starter motor by touching the start wires together.</p>
<p>By the 70s, the car manufacturers had learned that this wasn't particularly secure, so they put a backup system. The ignition key lock wouldn't just work the switch, but it would also mechanically block the steering wheel so you couldn't actually drive it. </p>
<p>My dad had an old toyota, and the ignition key wore out while we were on vacation hundreds of miles from home. The key just wouldn't turn enough to start the car. We called the local recovery guy, who worked out that the key would turn just enough to unlock the steering wheel, but not enough to work the switch. So, he pulled out the wires from the dash, and showed us how to hotwire it so that the engine would run. This allowed us to get home, and book it into the dealer for a proper repair at a more convenient time.</p>
<p>By the late 90s, computers had developed enough that engine spark and fuel systems could be electronically controlled, rather than controlled by complicated mechanisms of rotating shafts, gears, cams and switches. As a computer was running the engine, it wasn't that much more complicated to add computer security.</p>
<p>Since the late 90s, most cars have a chip in the key, which listens for a radio signal, and when it gets the signal it transmits a password. The ignition key barrel has an antenna in it, and when the engine control computer sees the start switch is active, it transmits a &quot;login password&quot; signal from the antenna to the key. The key responds, and if the computer gets the correct password, it activates the fuel and spark. If the password is wrong or missing, then the fuel and spark systems don't work. The engine will turn on the starter motor, but it won't actually start.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most cars without modern theft protection could still be STARTED but not DRIVEN by twisting the right wires together (First, twist an ignition+ source to +12V, then touch a starter+ wire to +12v until engine is running). But you couldn't drive the car.</p>
<p>What they never account for are the mechanical lockouts tied to the ignition switch. When you turn the key, a physical lockout releases the steering wheel lock and allows it to turn. Without physically turning the key, the steering wheel would remain locked, even with the engine running, hence making the car undrivable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You could see the two wires that you needed immediately.  Almost all of the other things that are now in the steering column were also separate switches arranged on the dashboard.</p>
<p>Now the necessary wires are bound up in a harness that goes up into the steering column.  Along with the ignition wires, you have the turn signals, wipers, headlights, airbag, parking lights, horn, and probably cruise, and radio.  There are probably twenty wires to sort out now, and since you can no longer see the back of the ignition switch, you may not know what color the ones you want are.  Just cutting that bundle apart without cutting wires can be five minutes work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a lot easier to think when body is in relaxed state and the more upward blood flow goes to brain. Resting chin on head reduces supporting neck muscles using up the blood flowing upwards, hence more blood for brain; additionally by sitting down more blood is available for upper body as the lower body is not as active. So generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker" target="_blank">the thinking man</a> pose is optimal for active brain.</p>
<p>We subconsciously do this when thinking deeply, and has become an evolutionary trait. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirshasana#Contraindications_and_cautions" target="_blank">other ways</a> to increase blood flow to brain, but that benefit maybe countered by discomfort.</p>
<p>Edit: Minor word correction as I was not resting my chin on hand
Update: Speaking from experience, not research based</p>
<p>Update2: Queries on source? Peer reviewed research will be hard to come by given the topic (medically mundane/commercially not valuable)..but it is evident from experience that thinking capacity is diminished after heavy food or we feel light headed when getting up suddenly–both corresponding to redirection of blood supply while heart rate has not caught up. Once the heart rate has caught-up, there's more overall circulation, so mild activity works. Heavy activity, however, counters the benefit of circulation with lower blood oxygen level. Easy way for focused thinking—sit down after drinking ginkgo tea followed by a brisk walk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it's related, but the reason people rub their neck when they are really anxious is that the Vagus nerve runs right through there. Stimulating your Vagus nerve gives a pretty large response of the Parasympathetic nervous system which calms you (slows heart rate, slows respiratory rate, drops blood pressure, etc...). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_activity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_activity</a></p>
<p>Basicially if you have 2 conflicting behaviours (so thinking about which of the 2 pizzas you are about to order) it can lead you to express a third one that is unrelated to them(Scratching head).</p>
<p>This can be seen in a lot of other animals.</p>
<p>Buuut there may be other reasons, like having physical stimulation increase the stimulation of your brain whilst thinking about an answer.</p>
<p>Maybe someone else here has a cited resource on chin scratching :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In &quot;Seeing Through Clothes,&quot; a book by Anne Hollander, she talks about generations and their learned gestures. The touching of the chin is sort of a gestural convention that has been with us for a while. I can't say if there's a sort of a predisposition for the pose, but there's definitely a learned component. That's why it's so amusing to look at little kids because they learn these gestures so quickly, like the indignant downward tilting of the head and folding of the arms to show when they're upset. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If so, would the universe be expected to eventually randomly reach a sufficiently low energy state that stars, galaxies, and planets could reform?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The probability for a fluctuation (quantum or otherwise) that decreases entropy is on the order of exp(- ΔS / k_B), where ΔS is the entropy variation and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. This is unimaginably small even for very little entropy variations. Let me make a little example:</p>
<p>Trouton's rule tells you the entropy of vaporization of most fluids is about 86 J/K per mole at standard pressure. So the vaporization of a mole of water (~18 ml) at standard pressure involves an entropy increase of ΔS ~ 86 J/K = 6.2 * 10^(24) k_B. This means the probability of just 18 ml of water spontaneously condensing back into liquid is of the order of exp(-10^(24)). </p>
<p>That's about zero point, about 10^(23) zeroes, then one. The time you need to wait for this to happen through fluctuations is equally huge. As a comparison, the time it takes for even the largest black holes to evaporate and heat death to be truly reached is incredibly smaller than this.</p>
<p>Now there is no certainty on whether the Universe will last <em>forever</em> forever. This amount of time is so large that hoping we can extrapolating the physics we know is ridiculous. But I mean, if you do, and you also assume no big crunch (so negative spatial curvature) then sure, the total probability is 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
