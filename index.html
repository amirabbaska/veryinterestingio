		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well if you have a really large military, thats a pretty big deterrent for anyone to go to war against you. You have a huge military, ready to go and kick some ass.</p>
<p>If you have a large military and someone else doesn't if you choose to go to war, you can smash them. You're ready to go, you can get in tons and tons of sucker punches, if not a knockout, before the other side can even get into the game.</p>
<p>So two things: Having a large military is as much about NOT going to war as it is about the potential to win one if it ever does happen, both outcomes are good.</p>
<p>to further add on, since at least the late 1800s &quot;mobilization&quot; was one of the most important aspect of a military.  That is the first country to be able to get their military together, ready, and in the action, has a decisive advantage.  Spending large amounts of money and having a large ready to go military provides that. This was a huge lesson of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War" target="_blank">Franco-Prussian War</a>, and WWI, and after how effective and mandatory military planners saw it in those conflicts, the thought of not being very very ready is just wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because otherwise if and when you do go to war, it would take months to mobilize troops. Even with a draft, you need to provide basic train and equipment to your troops. If you don't have it already, it has to be done, which takes time. Additionally, if you don't maintain dedicated manufacturing facilities for war equipment, you have to spend time creating them and/or converting civilian factories to that purpose. It took many months after the declaration of war in WWI and WWII for the US to be fully ready for combat. Where as for the Korean war, the US was able to respond much more quickly to the North's invasion.</p>
<p>On top of that, billions today isn't even that much relative to the size of global economies. Granted the US spends more per GDP than most Western countries, but it's nominal spending only seems wildly inflated because its economy is so much larger than other countries who dedicated more of their economy to military spending.</p>
<p>Additionally, have a strong military deters aggressors from engaging in war with you and your allies in the first place. The Cold War was filled with proxy wars in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, instead of in North America and Europe because NATO and the USSR maintained large militaries and nuclear stock piles to deter such conflicts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A country can't just &quot;buy&quot; a military, it's something that takes decades to build.  Experienced soldiers are not easy to come by, commanders even less so.  A good battlefield commander might take 2 decades of experience before they are competent so it's not like you can just hire one off the street. </p>
<p>Military tech is unique.  Procurement is often complex and maintenance requires special training.  The equipment is often cutting edge and needs to be developed so can't just be purchased as is.  It's the kind of stuff that needs to be developed and built specifically for your country. </p>
<p>So you can't just decide one day that you want to buy some fighter jets.  Sometimes you might be able to buy them from a friendly country that has already done the development, but if everyone follows the &quot;spend only during times of war&quot; methods then that option won't exist. </p>
<p>In addition, most modern militaries are not only used in war but also have significant peacetime responsibilities.  The main responsibility of the western militaries is maintaining international commerce abilities, particularly shipping.  In today's modern word of globalization, why do you think we don't have a HUGE piracy problem.  Sure there are pockets of problems but it's not like container ships are getting jacked left and right. It's because the Navy's of the world shut that shit down and fast. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To give an example of just one small part of ATLAS (which is only one of several detectors): The Pixel Detector consists of 1744 modules arranged in cylindrical layers around one of the collision points. Each of those modules contains 47,000 pixels (so 80 million total). The beams are manipulated so that they collide with each other 40 million times a second, so all 80 million pixels must be read 40 million times a second. </p>
<p>Most of these readings are actually analyzed and thrown away in hardware, then there is a large computing cluster that does more analysis and discards even more data, but even after all that they store upwards of 100 megabytes per second while the beam is active.</p>
<p>This is all needed because we are looking for very rare particles, and we want to observe them many times in order for our measurements to gain sufficient statistical certainty. Having lots of pixels in the detector means their track can be observed more closely, which gives information as to their mass and charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In our systems we would mount a single crystal which held an unknown protein. The sample would be mounted on something that rotated 360 degrees while an x-ray beam was shot at it and a detector collected the scatter of xrays that were emitted from the crystal. Each image was around 16Mb. Imagine the amount of data collected when the collection is set up to take one image every half of a degree for 360 degrees. They do this every few days for an entire year...that is a shit ton of data that takes massive clustered servers to process.</p>
<p>I'd imagine that since the Hadron has mere nanoseconds to collect the data they have a massive number of very high resolution detectors &quot;watching&quot; the reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

This is full of sensors  to track wehre the particle goes. lots of sensor --&gt; lots of data.
In fact most of the data are trown away in real time (you don't care about part which haven't been touched by particles for example). But particule physics is about finding rare phenomenon in a big set of phenomena we understand so a big part of the work is about producing a lot of &quot;events&quot; (beam side) being able to detect them (detector side) and to process them (software side).<br />
If you wonder why there are so many authors in these LHC experiment it's because you need all these people working together to be able to have enough good data to do some science with it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are looking for a special process with a low crosssection (which basically means it's just rare to happen), you want to have a high amount of processes to start with (high luminosity). So you'll end up with lots of data.<br />
This is not only to actually record the special process that you are looking for (eg. Higgs-&gt;2x Photons), but also to record enough to separate it from the underlying signal. No detector is perfect and hence some recorded process, particles, energys etc. will be miss identified. So any process that will produce any number of photons could be miss identified as a Higgs decay as in my example (Photons could 'overlap' (pile up) with each other or other particles resulting in the detector to answer with a signal looking like a high energy photon just like the one you are looking for). There are endless possible process that will contribute as underlying signal to the signal you are looking for, so you need some way to make sure it's the real deal. </p>
<p>The approach is to work with a high confidence level aka 'x sigma' (6 for particle identification). Basically a way to tell you how sure you are that your signal is no random signal due to bad luck. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The expansion of the universe is easiest to understand at cosmic scales. In that case you can take all the matter and energy and treat it like a homogeneous sheet with some average densities. You then use Einstein's field equations to see how much this tarp will stretch, i.e. expand. </p>
<p>However, locally the story is different. On smaller scales gravitational attraction can dominate, preventing objects from expanding away from each other. For example, that is the story in our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group" target="_blank">Local Group</a> that includes the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies. In fact, in our cosmic neighborhood, the gravitational attraction is strong enough that eventually these two galaxies will collide. Of course, it will take another 4 billion years for this drawn out merger to kick in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you are standing 10 feet apart, a second later each foot between you will become 1.1 and you'll be 11 feet apart.  You separated at a rate of 1 foot per second.</p>
<p>But if you were 100 feet apart, each of those became 1.1 foot and you would be 110 feet apart after 1 second.  So by being 100 feet apart, you separated at a rate of 10 feet per second.  And if you were 1000 feet apart at the start, you'd be separating at 100 feet per second and so on.</p>
<p>So as you can see, if you're close together there is little growth between you and you could easily walk up to each other.  But if you were far apart, even running top speed you couldn't get to your friend, they would just be getting farther and farther apart.</p>
<p>This is an analogy to the expansion of the universe.  Things that are close enough together can be pulled together because the expansion between them isn't fast enough to overcome gravity.  As things get farther apart though, the expansion between them increases while the gravity between them decreases.  So expansion doesn't pull apart solar systems, galaxies, or even galaxy clusters.  But on larger scales expansion wins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can still go down an escalator the wrong way.  You're just slowed up a bit.</p>
<p>The expansion of the universe is tricky, because it seems to be expanding at all points.  So the further apart two objects are, the faster they're pushed apart.</p>
<p>Two objects are floating 1000 meters apart.  Let's divide that into 1000 1-meter squares.  Every 1000 second, each square expands and duplicates itself, and pushes the space apart.  After 1000 second, there will now be 2000 1-meter blocks between them.  So the objects are expanding apart at 1000 meters per 1000 seconds, or 1m/s.  Now at 2000 meters apart, there are 2000 blocks duplicating themselves.  So after 1000 more seconds, there will be 4000 blocks in between.  So the two objects are expanding apart at 2 m/s.</p>
<p>If the two objects started only 10 meters apart, then they'd be 20 meters apart after 1000 seconds, or be flying apart at .01m/s.</p>
<p>So the further apart two points in space are, the faster they're moving away from each other (due the expansion of space).</p>
<p>However, if two objects are moving towards each other at a speed greater than the space between them is expanding, they'll still close the gap.</p>
<p>This gives rise to an interesting phenomenon, where two objects separated by a lot of space will expand apart at a rate faster than the speed of light.  As a result, information between those two objects can never be received - no object or force will ever interact between them.  This can be said to be 'the edge of the observable universe' not because space ends at that point, but because we can never and will never see anything beyond that point.  It's basically an inverted black-hole.  It's an expansion, rather than an attraction, powerful enough that light cannot escape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get migraines and cluster headaches. First off there are different types and different causes. The type that makes you want to drill into your head is usually due to sinus pressure. it feels like something is pushing against your skull and opening a hole will release the pressure. Now, noone really wants to drill into their head literally they just want the pain to stop. Generally putting counter pressure on the sinus will numb the pain.</p>
<p>Also interesting fact. there are migraines that don't involve any pain. Extremely photosensitive people in certain light can't focus their eyes, may loose balance, or get nauseous. All of this and no headache.</p>
<p>Other causes include constricted veins. High blood pressure. Injury or tightness in the upper neck muscles. And concussion history.</p>
<p>If you never had a history of migraine and suddenly get them get in touch with your doctor asap. They could be the sign of something more serious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Migraines have a bunch of causes. Making a list of recent foods/events/weather/etc and seeing a migraine specialist should help her narrow down what triggers hers.</p>
<p>Mine usually come from a swift change in air pressure, because I got three concussions in college (jujitsu weapon work, etc). You know how old guys say that their bad knee can predict the weather? Same deal, except it's my skull, which brings on a migraine as its predictive element. </p>
<p>I'm also sensitive to some chemicals which can give me migraines too, and I've had two--count 'em, two--pillows that have managed it. One was made of memory foam. A couple hours near that stuff will trigger a migraine. The other was supposedly allergen free, but the filling had been washed with a chemical that some people react to, and I was one of them. It's worth it to read the tag on her pillow and google all its ingredients. I used to buy cheap polyester pillows from Wal-Mart, but now I have one of those barley-hull pillows. Heavy as fuck, but great for my neck and doesn't give me migraines.</p>
<p>Nausea is a thing that comes with some migraines. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. But snacking helps. A trick I learned when I was pregnant is that a little food in the stomach keeps it from freaking out as much as it does when it's all full or all empty. Same works for migraine nausea.</p>
<p>Other triggers can be hormones, foods, pollen, meds, and other allergies. It can be a lot of work to write down anything that <em>might</em> be related, but once you know what the actual trigger is, it's such a relief, because then you can work to minimize that or combat it.</p>
<p>I can't really avoid the weather. Treatments I do include wearing sunglasses like I partied way too hard the night before, heating pad or ice pack on my head, hot showers where I just stand there and sway with my head in the stream, drinking a lot of liquid, very warm socks (these last 3 help open blood vessels and spread blood out more, lowing bp eases the throbbing in the head), drugs, darkness, and distraction. When it gets really bad, I'll put on my sleep mask and stick in some earbuds, and listen to a podcast or a fave movie just to keep my mind off the fact that I'm facing an unknown number of hours in agony and isolation. And I sleep propped up. </p>
<p>Also, at least for me, I get kind of a hangover afterward. My head doesn't hurt, but my brain kind of feels scraped raw. So I like things quiet and calm for a few hours before I feel like myself again. I'll often wear the sunglasses just to keep a sudden flash of light or too-bright screen from re-triggering a migraine.</p>
<p>For your SO, I'd suggest keeping a list of things to do, use, or try, and offer to help her with one or another of them. She may be in too much agony to remember them when she's having a migraine. I've had these migraines for over a decade, and my husband still has to remind me to put on socks or guzzle a Gatorade. He'll literally put the drink in my hand, and I'm all, why couldn't I remember that? So if you can be her mental backup, and remind her that there are things she can do to feel better, and even physically hand her stuff, it'll help her feel cared for as well as feeling better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>As mammals we react to other mammals is a somewhat positive manner on average, particularly ones with &quot;baby&quot; features.</p>
<p>Most mammals also have an instinctual fear of spiders or snakes. Just watch a cat encounter an unexpected belt if you need evidence. Even if they have never seen a snake before, they are &quot;pre-programmed&quot; to fear or be wary of the shape.</p>
<p>As far as socially conditioning a child to fear other things, and exposing them heavily to others so they do not? Sure you can do that. Cause enough trauma and a person could fear anything. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having run a tanning salon for 5 years, can tell you it all comes down to your skin type!  Each type has successfully more melanocytes (pigment cells) .  I'm a type three, black hair, hazel- green eyes and CAUCASIAN+American indian heritage and I tan almost the instant my skin is exposed due to  any amount of sunlight hitting the pale melanocytes in my skin - though my legs remain bright white year round unless I work to darken them.  I work in my garden every day and by summer's end I'll be very dark usually - though have never had any skin issues and normally use a very cheap Curel skin lotion right after showering.  This year for th first time in my life I've seen a couple of old age spot on my mid back - old age barnacles!   I removed them at home using Apple Cider Vinegar over a few days period, the skin under was very pale when I got done.   Human skin has specific cells place in specific areas where it is most useful to protect your body from UV harm;  like faces, shoulders, and back of arms and tops of feet.  Imagine the sun shining down directly on you from over your head... each place normally exposed to the direct UV light is where you'll tan or get burned most often. (You don't need special tanning cells under your boobs or between your legs.)   So, people tend to work on those areas in tanning salons.  Our salon recommends slow steady tanning... a burn is to be avoided, and skin checks are mandatory  WE cannot tan anyone under age 18 by state law.<br />
Skin types:    Type one is usually a fair or red head, blue eyes and few freckles and type five is usually negro with almost black skin, brow hair and eyes.<br />
yes, negro's do go to get tanned,  especially if they have low Vit D naturally in their blood.... they need more sunlight than I do to keep my Vit D levels up.  Our black ladies would come in if they have a farmer's tan from wearing shirts And shorts in the sunlight and want to be tanned all over EQUALLY. (and IN places where the sun don't shine... I've even done spray tans on these ladies with excellent results on legs, bellies, you name it.  Where ever they wanted darker or more even skin.  When I ran my salon I had the reputation as doing the best spray tans in the area... my best clients were strippers (we'd minimize some contours by reducing the liquid and maximize areas needed the most - if they had cellulite we'd work on darkening the skin (white skin shows bumps more under stage lights than dark skin)  We'd do sample testing  to see how much chemical to use  (liquid sun tan takes 4-6 hours to develop.)  I&quot;d end up doing spray tans for my clients  by appointment only.    I even had a few gay guys coming in for spray tans.   $50.00 a pop!<br />
UV radiation penetrates the tissues of our skin and can damage (mutate) the DNA of our cells. Our bodies are usually very good at repairing any DNA damage, but lengthy and regular exposure to UV can cause more damage than the body can cope with. If mutations to the DNA are left unchecked, this may change the way in which the cells behave, and they can become cancerous.  this is why we never suggest a person tan over an area that has been burned - it damages it further.
We also offered a chemical that prevented a burn from peeling! iT's not a secret...  you just have to be very careful and proceed very slowly to keep the tan, keeping the skin moisturized to prevent peeling helps.    The secret in this is citric acid.(used for canning.)<br />
I've worked with some type one's using a low pressure bed slowing increasing duration of exposure to the UV bulbs on a daily basis with a &quot;cold start&quot; bed  and these people slowly were able to get a slight tan without burning. (we also did a UV skin test with them, before starting... putting a sheet of paper with holes on it, slowly exposing the holes one at a time in sequence so that the first hole opened got the maximum time and the last hole only got 30 seconds of UV exposure.) I've seen type one's burn at 2 min's of UV exposure from hand held bulb at 12&quot; at full blast.<br />
We'd have the customers apply a tanning booster to the skin in areas they wanted to be darkest.  and a sun block to areas they wanted to protect.
Even hair can be damaged by UV rays.<br />
Seriously you know you can still get a tan thru your clothing - if your skin is moist from regular lotion.  Dry skin tends to allow the light to bounce off somewhat while tanning lotion promotes the full effect of the UV light.  Sun penetrates to the skin at about 35% depending on the fabric.  I've gotten burned thru a T-Shirt in the past and had it peel on me within a day or so after I applied an aspirin based topical to the burn area.
I've had my run-ins with people bad mouthing the tanning industry - but the almighty buck kept my business afloat at that time - I eventually sold the business at double my original costs and took a low pressure bed home with me for occasional use.  The money represents my retirement!      </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Evolutionarily, it all comes down to how certain shades helped individuals based on their location.  It's beneficial for someone who is closer to the equator to be darker and absorb less sunlight since it's almost always readily available. In comparison to places further away from that center point where sunlight isn't as abundant throughout the day. A more pale complexion would allow you to maximize the amount of sun you take in. </p>
<p>So if your genes originated from a place where absorbing the maximum amount of sun is best and you're out in the sun for extended periods of time, you'll eventually end up burning simply because that's what the sun does when you have little protection. While others who's genes may have originated from a place with varying degrees of the sun, will be able to tan. That may be why we lose tans in the winter. Evolutionarily, tanning would be to increase your protection against the sun to not burn. The best catalyst for this reaction would of course be prolonged exposure to the sun which would be signaling extra protection needed. You would then lose this tan in the winter, or when you stop being in the sun as much, since you would need to absorb more. </p>
<p>Extra information: Since Humans as a species have been fairly good at adapting as needed, this may explain why we have lighter people in places where it'd make sense for everyone to be darker toned. Things such as umbrellas, sun block and houses would allow those with little natural protection to the sun to easily live in places where it is over abundant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The color in skin is from a pigment called melanin. Melanin protects the skin from UV rays in sunlight. Too much UV causes a sunburn. Depending on your genes, you make a mix of eumelanin (brown color) and pheomelanin (red color). The brown blocks UV best. The red can actually make the UV do more damage. Fair skinned people all look pale, but those with more pheomelanin will burn more.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the functional information we have about genes comes from mutational analyses in invertebrates.  In fruit flies for example, melanin and pigmentation has been pretty extensively studied.  The problem is 2-fold when it comes to humans:  first humans can have anywhere from two to four copies of every gene present in the &quot;blueprint genome&quot; (the fly genome), because there have been genomic duplications (i.e., duplication of the entire genome) twice throught evolution:  once before teleost fishes evolved and once after.  So there is a lot of genetic complexity involved.  And it's hard to tease apart gene function without mutational analysis, traditionally difficult in mammals with long generation times.  The second problem is that skin pigmentation is also tied to metabolic skin function.  Vitamin D production for example (critical for calcium absorption).  In warmer climates (e.g., most of Africa), skin is exposed to sunlight, and therefore able to utilize the UV irradiation of the sun for the final step of vitamin D production.  There's a tradeoff though ---- that extra sun exposure also acts as a strong selection pressure to keep melanin around, to ward off skin cancers (melanin's chief function in the skin).  In northern European populations, where climates mean the skin is doing minimal skin synthesis of Vitamin D because the sun disappears abd because clothing protects against cold---- populations have adapted by maintaining lactose tolerance beyond childhood (vitamin D is present in high concentrations in dairy products).  And because there is so much less UV irradiation, the selection pressure for maintaining upregulation of melanin disappears.  So so far, we are seeing melanin involved in protection against UV irradiation, but it is also involved in dopamine production and metabolism in the brain.  So that adds ANOTHER layer of complexity to the puzzle.  </p>
<p>In other words, it's clear that there are a lot of unanswered questions because the complexity of the issue makes it hard to get a big-picture handle on it all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure on the scientific research behind this, but this is the theory I have heard. </p>
<p>The idea is that it triggers the same sensation in the body as if we are being hugged. In social animals, a sense of security/safeness is primarily attained (especially in the younger years) by physical proximity to others in the pack (hugging or touching). It triggers the attachment system, which is basically our &quot;cool down&quot; system. There are different groups of 'happy' or 'pleasant' emotions. There are the stimulating ones (excitement, accomplishment, pride), which feel good but also make us feel more energetic rather than relaxed. All those &quot;uppers&quot; are the ones that motivate us to go out and <em>do</em>. And then there are the soothing ones that promote a sense of security (warmth, connection, belonging, togetherness - which are all to do with our social needs and generally promote a 'relaxed' sense of being rather than an energetic sense of being). So we rely on this affiliation system to calm down and relax - these are essentially our inbuilt &quot;downers&quot;. The reason we don't literally need other people around all the time as we grow (unlike as a young child) is because we internalise the sense that we have people behind us (as in others care about us) and use this felt sense of connection to soothe us. Therefore, simulating the sensation of being hugged triggers the 'calm down' emotions, as does hugging a pillow or a soft toy.</p>
<p>Based on this theory there have been weighted blankets created for people with depression and anxiety as the extra pressure/sensation promotes better sleep and more of a sense of security.</p>
<p>As I say, this is the theory I have heard but I am not a scientist and have no actual expertise, so if someone else knows this to be bullshit, please do let me know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I suspect it mainly has to do with our evolution from very small furry mammals that were always fearful of predators.  Small creatures like that instinctively hide in tight little holes where bigger things can't get them, and feel terribly exposed when not covered.  Those instincts are not necessarily lost simply because you evolve to be larger.</p>
<p>I read an article once about a study on people's limbic system, which is a very primitive area of your brain, wherein resides the fear emotion.  By showing images of things to people and monitoring the response of their limbic system, scientists could see what triggered the most fear.  They found humans were by and large most instinctively frightened of (1) snakes and (2) spiders.  The scientists theorized that there was a time our evolutionary ancestors were being eaten by those things, and so those creatures evolved an instinctive fear of them.  That instinctive fear remains with us, even though snakes and spiders pose very little threat to us now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
