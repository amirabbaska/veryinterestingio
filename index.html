Elements are defined by the number of protons in the nucleus, and larger nuclei are unstable and quickly decay (the biggest synthesized nuclei decay in fractions of a second). Eventually it is thought that instead of briefly forming a nucleus and decaying, really big nuclei will just have protons and neutrons &quot;drip&quot; away. Instead of being comparatively little <a href="http://klotza.blogspot.com/2016/01/cool-calculation-minimum-neutron-star.html" target="_blank">nuclear binding energy</a>, there will be none.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer is more nuanced than a simple yes or no. Theoretically there should be no limit, you keep smashing nuclei together to form higher and higher number elements which will decay faster than we would ever hope to detect them.</p>
<p>A more appropriate question would be, would we still consider it to be an element if it didn't stick around long enough to be detected, measured etc. for example if you scattered a proton off a Pb atom, for the fraction of a second which the proton interacts with the Pb nucleus (through elastic/inelastic scattering), would you consider it to be a Bi isotope or just a proton scattering off a Pb nucleus?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For example</p>
<p>Begin quote</p>
<p>In 1965, an extremely obese 27-year-old male, weighing in at 456 pounds fasted for 382 days (one year and 17 days) and lost 275.5 pounds.</p>
<p>Doctors from the University of Dundee monitored his condition throughout his fast. During his fast, he obese man recorded low glucose levels for 100 days and defecated every 40 to 50 days. He was given potassium tablets to keep his heart healthy and multi-vitamins every day.</p>
<p>According to ABC.au, the man was able to fast for over a year due to these factors:A year without food</p>
<p>Extreme weightloss: treating obesity by total starvation can be dangerous

Audio: A year without food (Science Online Audio)
Back in June of 1965, a Scotsman weighing 207 kilograms, described as &quot;grossly obese&quot; and hereafter known only as Mr A B, turned up at the Department of Medicine at the Royal Infirmary in Dundee.</p>
<p>He was sick of being fat and wanted to lose weight by eating nothing and living off his body fat. He told the hospital staff he was going to fast flat out, whatever they said, so they may as well monitor him along the way.</p>
<p>He ended up fasting for one year and 17 days — that's right, he ate no food at all for over a year. He lived entirely off his copious body fat, in the end losing about 125 kilograms of weight.</p>
<p>Treating obesity by total starvation can be dangerous. There are many reports of total starvation leading to death. For example, some people have died of heart failure during the fast, while another died on the 13th day of his fast from small bowel obstruction. Some people have died during the re-feeding period after the fast — one from lactic acidosis.</p>
<p>But to counter this, going hungry is natural. Humans like us (that's Homo sapiens) have been around for the last 200,000 years and for most of that time, food was not always at hand. We evolved to survive with not enough food. Some studies actually show that fasting (or at least, calorie restriction) can have health benefits under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Once you stop eating, your body gets its energy from the glucose in your bloodstream and liver, thanks to your last meal. You carry a semipermanent 0.5 to 1 kilogram of solids in your gut. The glucose from this runs out after about eight hours.</p>
<p>Then you start burning up a chemical called glycogen. Glycogen is simply a whole bunch of glucose molecules loosely stuck together. It's stored in your liver and muscles. Glycogen is really easy to break down into the individual glucose molecules from which it was made. You can burn glycogen to get the glucose you need for about another 36 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>After two or three days of fasting, you get your energy from two different sources simultaneously. A very small part of your energy comes from breaking down your muscles — but you can avoid this by doing some resistance training, otherwise known as pumping iron. The majority of your energy comes from breaking down fat.</p>
<p>But very soon, you move into getting all your energy from the breakdown of fat. The fat molecules break down into two separate chemicals — glycerol (which can be converted into glucose) and free fatty acids (which can be converted into other chemicals called ketones). Your body, including your brain, can run on this glucose and ketones until you finally run out of fat.</p>
<p>The average non-obese 70-kilogram male carries about 8,000 kilojoules of energy in glycogen, and about 400,000 kilojoules in his body fat.</p>
<p>In the case of our big Scotsman, Mr A B, the staff in the medical school at the University of Dundee kept a close eye on him. He did not eat any food, but the staff gave him yeast for the first 10 months and multi-vitamins every day. Potassium is essential for the proper working of the heart, and when his potassium levels got a little low around the 100-day mark, he was given potassium tablets for about 70 days. He defaecated infrequently, roughly every 40 to 50 days.</p>
<p>Blood samples were taken every fortnight, and his carbohydrate metabolism was checked on nine occasions during the 382 days of his fast. Surprisingly, for the last eight months of his fast, his blood glucose levels were consistently very low. They were around two millimoles, which is about half of the bottom end of the normal range. Even so, he did not suffer clinically from this abnormally low blood glucose level.</p>
<p>His weight dropped from 207 kilograms to 82 kilograms. Some five years later, he had regained only 7 kilograms.</p>
<p>In humans, fasting seems to have health benefits for high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma and epilepsy in children. In animals, fasting seems to reduce the cognitive decline that happens in conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>One problem with fasting is that you can get cranky and irritable (and sometimes hungry). Another is the lack of companionship with your fellow humans. After all, the word 'companion' comes from the roots 'com' meaning 'with' and 'panis' meaning 'bread'. If you spend lots of time not sharing meals with your kith and kin, you run the risk of becoming an outsider.</p>
<p>So to keep your friends, continue breaking bread — just don't eat it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't.  There isn't a huge body of research on this, simply because it's not ethical to starve research subjects to death.</p>
<p>If someone starves to death, they will be extremely skinny when they die.  (See pictures of famine victims).  Being in a state of starvation is high stress on the body though, and people that are in poor health (Obesity does not promote good health) are at a higher risk of dying for tertiary reasons.</p>
<p>If you took 100 people at 10% body fat, 100 at 23%, and 100 at 35%, and put them all on water fasting, the average survival time before death is likely to be highest in those with more body fat, given the same relative health levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like some others said, size has a lot to do with it. Also, so does your enzyme balance. Alcohol gets broken down in your body by enzymes and eventually is used to make or store energy (as fat cells or for production of ATP). Someone who's body regularly deals with larger quantities of alcohol has their cells making more of those enzymes so that they can break the alcohol down faster. That doesn't mean it's healthier for them though, because all that effort is a huge strain on the liver, which not only filters impurities but also plays an important role in metabolism regulation.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tolerance.</p>
<p>Size in both height and weight do factor into it, but in most cases it's all just a matter of tolerance.</p>
<p>Normal people don't need to hit around the 8-10 standard drinks mark just to feel an effect.  If a normal person that hasn't got a daily or even weekly drinking habit tried to skull a bottle of spirits(hard liquor) it will very likely kill them, because it's just too much too fast. </p>
<p>Think of it like running a marathon.  If you practice everyday your tolerance for pain increases. Meaning you can push yourself further before you feel like you are on the edge of dying.  If you have ever tried running long distances without that training you would know very well that simply a few hundred meters can be enough for your body to give out. </p>
<p>Tolerance in this sense is a form of conditioning. In a way alcoholics condition themselves to ingest larger quantities of alcohol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: body mass and fat do have a lot to do with it but mostly only as a beginner. Ive seen thin/low body fat people drink like a pro and larger people get stupid with a couple drinks.

<p>2) There are always more questions than clear answers. This is a significant problem when lives are at stake, but I do believe that, given the research over the last century or so, we have a fairly reasonable idea.</p>
<p>The single sentence answer, which necessarily needs to be broken down into a thousand different pieces, is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>The vast majority of terrorism in the last two centuries has been committed due to the political interaction of identity and the state</strong></p>
<p>To understand this completely, we have to understand the concept of the nation. Most people around the world feel nationality in at least three levels:</p>
<p>1) Lowest level - The state as a function of nation
2) Mid level - the Ethnic group as a nation
3) Highest level - Religious group as a nation</p>
<p>There are other &quot;nations&quot; as well, but these three are the most common. Now, the marriage of Westphalian peace that designated  (theoretically) standard borders and the increased centralization and power of governments, the challenge became to somehow synthesize these three. The idea of a political &quot;people&quot; is born. The most cohesive state, then, was one where people shared all three national identities. The least cohesive state was one that had neither 2nd or 3rd, and thus even the function of the state as a nation fall into peril. </p>
<p>Following the peace at Westphalia, Europe was consumed by violence which was primarily nationalistic violence. Between revolutions, revolts, genocides, and ethnic cleansing, Europe was a blood bath from 1648 to 1945. When one portion of Europe reached stability, another portion was lit ablaze by nationalist politics.</p>
<p>The Arab world never had that moment. Even after the fall of colonial powers in the Arab world, the cold war politics of the US and Russia necessitated that the Middle East, a key region in the cold war, could not suffer the instability like that of Europe after Westphalia. So strong men were put in place who clamped down on the political negotiations which are required for the long term stability of a state which functions as a nation (A nation state).</p>
<p>Now, fast forward to today. The strong men of the Arab world collapse (Saddam and Yemen forcefully, Mubarak, Qadhafi, and Assad by public pressure). This unleashes a huge tide of suppressed nationalist politics, which is always, always, always both disastrously bloody and excessively violent. Add in the Western exploitation of Pan-Islamism for combating the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, which leads to 9/11 (once the Soviets were defeated in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda and other mujahideen groups focused on two other Empires encroaching on &quot;Muslim sovereignty,&quot; the US (Iraq, Palestine, the Gulf) and Russia (Chechnya)).</p>
<p>Now, how does this lead to terrorism against the West? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The West obviously has a terrible reputation in the Middle East, going back two centuries. But <strong>America's</strong> bad reputation starts in the 50s, with the opposition of the United States to Mossadeq, the United States propping up of Israel, the US opposition to Nasser (who was extremely popular in the Arab world), and the United States support of dictators. Now, add the Iraq sanctions and the Iraq War II, and you get just flaming hatred for the West.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That hatred is used by the Pan-Islamists in fighting the US wherever it has presence in the Muslim world. But, for nationalists like ISIS, it has a much more sinister use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacking &quot;the West&quot; creates legitimacy for ISIS. Due to the involvement of the US during the cold war (and after) in the Middle East, hatred for the West is immense in the Arab world. Attacks against the &quot;oppressors,&quot; then, serves as a legitimizing tool in a fight where manpower is at a premium. </p>
</li>
<li>This leads us to ISIS of today. It is a nationalist movement which gains legitimacy for showing how it is fighting the historic oppressors by bringing the war to them. &quot;We are doing to them what they have been doing to us&quot; is the line they use consistently in their recruitment material. The goal, though, is to swell their ranks LOCALLY, not to actually harm the west in any way. No one seriously thinks ISIS is creating any real national security risk for Western nation -- not ISIS, and not Western nations. This is just a really great propaganda tool for them. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now, given all the above, why is ISIS so difficult to defeat:</p>
<p>The reason why ISIS in particular has not been defeated, is, primarily power politics:</p>
<p><strong>1) Power politics between nations always supersedes the threat of terrorist organizations</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) ISIS is not the main concern of Middle Eastern nations. The power imbalance and vacuum between Iran, the Gulf allies, and Turkey is</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) The Syrian civil war adds to those complications significantly</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) Nations are more focused on fighting for power balance than against ISIS</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) In managing the power politics in the Middle East, ISIS is actually useful for most if not all powers in the area</strong></p>
<p>Let's give a couple examples:</p>
<p>1) Turkey: </p>
<p>Turkey was fighting Assad in Syria, but the Kurds to the north were a serious threat to their territorial integrity. As such, they helped ISIS fight the kurds to the north as well. But to assuage Western powers, they made a show of fighting ISIS as well.</p>
<p>2) Saudi:</p>
<p>Saudi is actively funding ISIS to push back Iranian allied Syria and Iraq and force Iran into a perpetual war with ISIS. This is because the Gulf allies are terrified of being surrounded by the Iranian led alliance of Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. It therefore needs to ally with groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda to force Iran into perpetual war and keep it from cementing that alliance.</p>
<p>3) Iran:</p>
<p>Iran wants to fight ISIS. It really does. It's probably the most active in fighting ISIS. But it can't make a death blow to ISIS yet, because of Iraq and Russia.</p>
<p>4) Russia:</p>
<p>ISIS is extremely useful to Russia. As long as ISIS remains a force, it provides Russia diplomatic cover for its activities in support of Assad as long as it can shove a few bombs towards ISIS and say that it's there for terrorism. Therefore, Russia NEEDS ISIS to assist its ally Assad.</p>
<p>5) Iraq:</p>
<p>Iraq is a key ally to Iran, and ISIS is an existential threat to the Shia regime there. BUT airpower is extremely limited in efficacy, Iraq doesn't have a strong enough ground force to take ISIS on itself, the US won't allow the only other real enemy of ISIS (Iran) into Iraq en masse to defeat ISIS, and the other members of the anti-ISIS coalition see ISIS as to useful to destroy just yet</p>
<p>6) The US and the Western Allies:</p>
<p>This is where things get really fun. The West wants to defeat ISIS. But to do so would effectively hand Syria to Russia\ and Iraq to Iran, making a giant power block from Iran to Syria and Yemen to the south. So it wants to use Iraqi ground forces to force ISIS into Syria  and let them fight it out in the Syrian civil war, while putting diplo pressure on Iraq to break its ties with Iran and try to isolate Iran diplomatically. </p>
<p>The key to defeating ISIS:</p>
<p>1) End the Syrian civil war
2) Bring about political reproachment in Iraq and Yemen
3) The powers in the area will crush ISIS in a day</p>
<p>Edit: All the above is an interpretation consistent with the theories of the school of realism in international relations. For more information about the realist school, read &quot;The Man, the State, and War&quot; by Kenneth Waltz, &quot;Theory of International Politics,&quot; by Waltz again. For my favorite sub school, offensive realism, read &quot;Tragedy of Great Power Politics&quot; by John Mearsheimer. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radical ideology is really what we are fighting here and every time collateral damage occurs it undermines our ability to fight radical ideas further. It actually helps spread the ideas. It's like carpet bombing a forest fire. </p>
<p>For some context, I was in Iraq in 2009. As you would imagine, most the destruction had already taken place by then. So I got to see the aftermath of our invasion. There was no open resistance when I was there. No one tried to fight us. They just watched us roll down the roads for the most part. </p>
<p>Now imagine if you were say, 5 years old, and your home was destroyed by a bomb. Maybe someone from your family was killed. But it left you without anything to call your own. No one to call in case of an emergency. No one to call if your sibling falls ill. Not even a nation to call home. Not even shelter, except for what you can literally build from the rubble. </p>
<p>Now imagine, little you sponging up all the info you can, all this has taken place around you, without you having any idea why. You see these foreigners who don't speak like you or look like you, you don't understand them, and you're told &quot;that's who did this to us&quot;.  Those <em>people</em>.   No matter how bad someone tells you it was before, you can never feel like it could be any worse than it is now. </p>
<p><strong>The enemy we are fighting now, is an enemy we created</strong>. </p>
<p>It's no longer an abstract idea. The kids that grew up amongst the rubble that we prepared for them are now fighting age. Radical ideology spreads through the oppressed like a plague and those people will forever fight. It's not that I sympathize with them. I just understand the anger. Isis is just one of the many names that this ideology has fallen under(Boko Haram, Mujahadeen, Janjaweed, Al Qaeda) and it's not the only kind of radical ideology. </p>
<p>The difference is the amount of time, space, and motivation that's been necessary to breed. All of this is compounded by hostiles never being a uniformed enemy. They always wear civilian clothing. </p>
<p>Here are some <del>pics</del> really incredible photos taken by a soldier in my platoon. These were taken during one of many humanitarian missions we ran while we were there. This shanty town was built in the protective area right outside our FOBs gates. This should help you understand what I mean. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to ISIS being a guerrilla army, there are a few other reasons...</p>
<p>They are not only fighting to gain territory, but in order to control it they also need to act like a government for the people living there under their rule.  When organizations like this succeed in providing electricity, food and water for their people, they gain some legitimacy and sympathy from people in the region.  (Surely they're not doing a great job, given the circumstances, but I'm sure their followers are giving them some leeway.)  This is how the Taliban is still in power in parts of Afghanistan, because they do make efforts to keep the people fed, employed and somewhat protected.  </p>
<p>ISIS has been well funded, and this is a major reason why they're still surviving.  They have hijacked oil fields and sell that oil on the black market.  They are also secretly funded through unknown supporters, likely to be Saudis who share their religious ideals and support the growth of Salafism/Wahhabism in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The long term strategy of the Obama admin, from my understanding, was that they would eventually run out of funds, and once they did that they would begin to see fractures in the morale of their fighters, and a general diminishing of local support as they fail to keep their promises to the people in their &quot;caliphate&quot;.</p>
<p>So airstrikes have been targeting their shipments of oil and illicit funds, cutting off their supplies which has led to a <a href="http://deadstate.org/u-s-airstrikes-drive-isis-recruitment-down-to-just-200-new-fighters-a-month/" target="_blank">reduction in their recruitment efforts and an increase in defections.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you agitate them, don't work well with them etc. They turn on you and just see you as an outside threat. They recruit people easily becasue there are so many people who have been directly affected by a bombing. Put yourself in their position, you live in the middle of a desert, you believe in an afterlife and an all powerful creator. Then some guy comes along and kills your niece with a rocket. You are now incredibly mad. Then this other guy in your village says it's from the terrible west, (which it generally is), and says that if you help him you can get back at the people who did this. He says there are people in the community who are working with the people who killed your niece. And we need to find them and kill them before more people die. Then a big rebel force rolls into your village, parading around with flags, makeshift military armored trucks, etc. They are saying they are going to go fight back against the people who are bombing them. Now after all this your family has fallen apart, maybe you are watching day in day out as your city gets bombed, maybe it's just the radical interpretations of holy books that eventually gets to you. Either way you are hopped up on religious koolaid, you are incredibly pissed off, and someone just gave you the means to get back at the people who have more or less destroyed your life. And all you have to do is join us. That is how people get radicalized, war after war after war for decades. I'm going to say this as non politically as possible. The US is very heavily indirectly funding ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The US provides a massive amount of funding and weapons to Saudi Arabia.

It's very very hard to do so without creating a power vacuum and making things worse in the process. Source: the current state of the middle east and the war in Iraq. Historically there have been two ways to deal with a problem like this. One you go in and kill literally everyone, civilians, military and take the rest as slaves, and destroy every memory and building made by the people you are against. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Carthage_\(c._149_BC\)" target="_blank">See the annihilation of Carthage, third Punic war.</a> The second is a far far better solution. You withdraw your military, set up a border make sure they can't invade you. Then wait for a while. From this point three things might happen. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revolutions_and_rebellions" target="_blank">One the people themselves with rise up and put an end to the current rule.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union" target="_blank">Two the economy will collapse and a new government will form.</a> or three <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/11/22/obama-strengthens-iran-deal-over-gop-outcry/94286304/" target="_blank">the established government or your own government will try and make economic ties with the country to try and persuade them to change themselves through trade deals, or other kinds of deals</a>. Keep in mind the second of the two options might well fail and you are back to the beginning. However it's the best option for reducing loss of life. That is just looking at how things have played out in history, it very well might be that none of those things happen and something else that no one has yet thought of will happen. Only time will tell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this case, the use, threat, and utility of force are not effective deterrents or solutions to psuedo-organizations like ISIS.  These types of organizations are bound by a similar ideological belief, which makes waging traditional war against them incredibly difficult, if not impossible.  </p>
<p>While a lot of responses here are partially right, I have to say that the situations in the Middle East and North Africa are a lot more complicated than starving them of money, supporters, leaders, or having a strong military presence on the ground.  If things were that simple, we would have solved the issues in the Bush years, or during Obama's troop surge and increased drone strikes.</p>
<p>But, why is ISIS so hard to defeat?  Because ISIS can be boiled down to a combination of fringe religious ideology, long-standing cultural identity that goes back hundreds to thousands of years that Western powers tend to choose not to fully understand, and the economic + governmental damage Western powers initially caused dating back to the raping and pillaging of the area back during the the era of global European colonialism (that this region still hasn't recovered from).</p>
<p>Quick Edit:  I see a lot of people throwing Vietnam in as a parallel.  Truth is, there are very little parallels to Vietnam and ISIS outside of guerrilla warfare.  The manner in which we waged war in Vietnam was wholly ineffective for a variety of different reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Several medications can be used to reduce fever and/or inflammation, for example paracetamol (tylenol in the US) or NSAIDs (ibuprofen and others). But as I understood it, fever and inflammation are mechanisms the body uses to boost the effectiveness of the immune system. Does the use of medications therefore reduce the effectiveness of the immune system in combatting an infection? If so, has this effect been quantified (e.g. &quot;on average recovery time for infection X is Y% longer with a daily dose of Z&quot;)?</p>
<p>And is there any effect when these medications are used when there is no infection (wounds, headaches, etc...)?</p></div></div>

<li>
<p>Tylenol/paracetamol is not an NSAID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long term use of NSAIDs has been shown to lead to an increased incidence of non-union in orthopedic surgery so many/most orthos limit NSAID use to a few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is some low-level evidence that NSAIDs IMPROVE outcome in hypothermic sepsis</p>
</li>
<li>As with everything else in medicine we know very little.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: based on commentary I want to clarify that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259713/" target="_blank">the data for point two is poor</a>, mostly in animals, and taken as an article of faith by many orthopods who are very serious about it and make trauma rounds a daily argument. But it's getting better.</p>
<p>Edit #2: Non-union means that the fracture fails to heal</p>
<p>Edit #3: Tylenol is a weak COX-2 inhibitor and therefore has anti-inflammatory effects and multiple commenters have argued that it is, in fact an NSAID. I would argue that it does not share most of the clinical characteristics that people lump under &quot;NSAID&quot; and therefore to most clinicians it is in a separate category. For example, its pain control mechanism is different, in clinical use it is not ulcerogenic or nephrotoxic, it has no platelet effect and it is hepatotoxic. It can be used at the same time as classic NSAIDs with no decrease in dose necessary in either medication. </p>
<p>Edit #4: Thanks for the gold and I appreciate the discussion and education.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes, inflammatory mediators are there for a reason, inflammation is the method the body uses to repair damage and fight infection.  Hindering the COX 1,2 enzymes (as NSAIDS do) will slow down recovery times. The question is however how measureable a difference there is. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allow to explain few immunological concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflammation is an immune response tissue damage whether to infection, autoimmune (Lupus for example), burns, radiation injury, and chemical exposure. the list goes on but im gonna keep it short.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Infection is the presence of invasive pathogen as in bacteria, parasite, fungi that entered the body, it could be localized infection causing an abscess, more invasive causing, for example, narcotizing fasciitis, or in the blood stream causing septicemia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paracetamol isnt a NSAID, it possesses analgesic effect but little anti-inflammatory properties so it wont actually affect the immune response to inflammation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen, etc) will inhibit COX (cyclo-oxygenase) enzyme which utilizes Arachidonic Acid to produce prostaglandins and leukotriens, both are potent inflammatory mediators. These two agents will promote an immune response called chemotaxis which attracts immune cells to site of inflammation. So, NSAIDs could reduce or influence the immune response but not completely stop it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a hypnic jerk, and I only know of a theory, as it is poorly understood. So, you're lying down, feeling sleepy, you've had a rough day, your body tries to rush you into sleeping, instead of going through all sleep phases, it skips them and goes directly to REM sleep (rapid eye movement - this is when you usually start dreaming). When your brain does that, it didn't give your systems enough time to cool off, so instead of a gradual lowering of temperature(T) , heart beat(HR) and respiration rate(RR) , there's a sudden low T, HR, &amp; RR, your brain then thinks yours systems are failing, and sends a signal, a twitch throughout your body to jump start them again.
Again, this is one of the suggested theories as it's still a poorly understood phenomenon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

During that period, the body starts to block some sensations and slow down bodily processes. The reason you feel like you are falling is because your body has desensitized the sensation of pressure from the bed, so you panic and reach out to grab something, which brings you back awake to realize you were just in your bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Remember no income qualifying, interest only loans? Yeah, you could qualify someone for that, bury the details in paperwork, sell it to someone who doesn't fully understand what they just signed, and in three years when their interest rate adjusts they can't afford it. They go late on payments &amp; get foreclosed.</p>
<p>That's not even the worst type of shit. Imagine a loan that can actually get bigger over time rather than smaller. They're basically foreclosure machines. Those existed, they're finally almost gone, but they're probably coming back. </p>
<p>Who protects consumers from stuff like that? The CFPB, created by Dodd Frank. They make sure mortgage companies follow the new laws meant to prevent loans like that which caused the foreclosures that caused the financial crash.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fun one.</p>
<p>In the 1990s to 2000s, we had the rise of a type of financial instrument called a derivative. Clinton's administration, then Bush's administration, flat out refused to regulate them because banks were making money on them. If you haven't noticed, the department of the Treasury and sometimes the SEC are revolving doors for bank executives. Many of these derivatives had complicated names and lengthy legal contracts, but on the surface they were just banks gambling with your money, <em>e.g.</em> if the price of this commodity I don't own goes down to this value, you give me this much money, but if it goes up to this value, I owe you money.</p>
<p>These derivatives were mostly unregulated and opaque to the consumer or regulatory agencies, but they played a large role in the financial crisis through swaps. Swaps are generally a way of gambling to reduce risk by trying to offset the risk to others. The party who is doing something risky offers a monthly contract to another party who, if the risky thing they're doing falls apart, agrees to pay for the original party's losses. The other party gets paid to assume this risk, but sometimes the other party doesn't even have the money to pay the original party back for the failure of the bank's risky gamble (2008).</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank sought to regulate these to make sure that the issuance of these derivatives was clear to the government and public, and that people weren't gambling more money than they possibly could have in them (margin requirements). They also added a lot of new rules to help prevent banks from gambling with your money. Unfortunately for the banks, this all ends up being very expensive.</p>
<p>Trump wants to tear out all the requirements of Dodd-Frank that make banking expensive. Banks like it because it gives them greater profit margins. People like it because they make more money in their investments. The risk is that the banks will start gambling too much and lose more money.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One aspect that stemmed from Dodd-frank was the department of labor's ruling that investment advisors have to act in their clients best interest. More often than not, advisors do act in their clients' best interest, but there are several that do not.
One example is qualified annuities. Annuities are a very expensive investment that serve a very specific purpose. They are a tax deferred investment, similar to an IRA. Advisors were selling annuities inside IRAs, which often doesn't make sense because it does not add any tax benefit. It isn't always the right or wrong thing to do, but it is one of the most expensive investments that pays the advisor the most money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Once we had rules banks had to follow. Those were repealed, and in not following the rules the banks causes the 2008 recession.</p>
<p>New rules were put into place to prevent the same kind of stuff from happening again.</p>
<p>Now, they want to take those rules away. It's likely going to cause another recession, but these people don't care, because they will make a lot of money in the process.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is evolution. As /u/friend1949 said it's all about perspective and what we are used too seeing. The deep ocean is an environment totally unlike anything we experience on a day to day basis, and life has evolved to survive in those conditions; Lack of sunlight means skin pigments become pointless to protect the skin, meaning most deep see animals are full or partly translucent; Why would a fish need bones or a tough exoskeleton when it spends it's life floating in water and not coming into contact with a hard physical surface it's entire life; They develop big eyes and bioluminescence to hunt and evade prey/predators. There's nothing about the deep ocean that creates monsters, it's purely a very different environment that we are not used too. If humanity had evolved to live underground in cave systems instead of the surface we would look and act very different to how we do now, and wouldn't consider monsters of the deep so strange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They look like monstrosities to you because they're very different from what you're used to. They look very different because they live in conditions that are very different to the ones you're familiar with. The deep sea is dark, cold but most of all it's a desert. Very little nutrients make it all the way down there before being snatched up by other life.</p>
<p>For starters that means life has to be very energy efficient because very little new energy comes into this system. Which is why a lot of deep sea life are either filter feeders or ambush predators.</p>
<p>Most predators fail more often during hunts than they succeed, simple fact of life. Down there, hunters can't afford to fail too often. Every failure expends energy without getting a return. So a lot of the monstrous looking adaptations deal with successfully catching any and all prey that comes within reach. Numerous long fangs intended to catch slippery prey and hold them successfully. Oversized mouths or even stretchy bodies so a predator doesn't have to pass up prey because it's too big for it's mouth. Some deep sea fish can eat prey larger than themselves.</p>
<p>Along the same lines in such utter darkness light becomes everything. Oversized eyes for seeing every scrap of detail they can manage. Some predators use light to lure prey. Some life forms use light to disorientate the hyper sensitive eyes of predators or to communicate and actually find a mate in the deep, dark emptiness.</p>
<p>Finding friendly faces is such a big challenge down there that some fish simply won't let a partner go once they found one. When the male angler fish finds a female, he bites into her body and their bodies slowly fuse together. He'll receive nutrition through their now shared bloodstream and she'll receive his seed for fertilising her eggs. Eventually the male will atrophy into little more than a pair of testicles attached to the female.</p>
<p>Light can even be camouflage. In the deep sea above is brighter than below. Some fish use weak bioluminescence on their bellies to make themselves invisible against the light coming in from above. While at the same time having dark backs to disappear against the inky depths when seen from below.</p>
<p>And the differences go well beyond what you'd expect. Bright red for instance is a perfect camouflage color down there. Have you ever noticed how things tend to look a little greenish or blueish underwater? Water acts as a filter to light. Colours with a higher wavelength like red get filtered out first while colours with a shorter wavelength get filtered out last (same reason tv's in living rooms look bluish when you look in from the outside at night).</p>
<p>Without any red light to reflect down there, red is a perfect camouflage color and many fish have a creepy reddish skin color. Of course for every defense there's weapons that counter that defense. Since there's no red light down there, most deep sea fish eyes can't even detect right light, their eyes evolved a sensitivity to other wavelengths. </p>
<p>So one fish in particular evolved eyes that <em>can</em> see red light... because it has a bioluminescent light that emits red light specifically. Effectively it gives him a search light that highlights red fish yet at the same time no fish can see it's searchlight.</p>
<p>Anyway in short deep sea life looks radically different because they're dealing with radically different challenges than the rest of the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) here.  The best way to find this dose would be with a Survey Meter at or near the locations of the patient/owner's hands, body, and eyes to get a good representation of the exposures commonly measured for the purposes of radiation safety per the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  But even just a survey of the hands alone, assuming the beam of radiation is coming within the closest proximity to these extremities, would be enough to allow a very good representation of dosage.  Unfortunately, to estimate your machines output would require knowing the output plot of your specific machine at a controlled mAs setting, controlled distance, and across the range of kVp used, or at least having a survey at any distance from the machine while it is in normal (the kVp &amp; mAs setting you want the numbers for) usage.  But, I did find this study of situations like the one you are describing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17555048" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17555048</a></p>
<p>It's not much, but it does reiterate a very common theme amongst veterinary specific Radiation Safety documents: there is not much risk involved for customers/patients' owners in routine X-ray usage in veterinary medicine as long as the federally regulated safety requirements are met.  I do, however, think you should talk with your practice's RSO about it since they would have the best ability to provide you with actual dosage estimates based on the technique/rate chart for your machine's output and would have the survey equipment needed to calculate actual dosage rates at specific distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Patients owners: There are specific surgical gloves that block radiological x-rays. You can offer these to your patient's owners.</p>
<p>In addition, you can offer them a lead apron. We use these, as well as thyroid shields routinely in the OR (they are required by law actually).</p>
<p>For you, I would recommend the same. I would also consider leaded eye glasses as long term exposure can cause cataracts.</p>
<p>In addition, you should have a dosimeter for yourself and any staff that routinely assist you in x-ray procedures.</p>
<p>The dosimeter gets turned in to the company that checks them every month and after 12 months you get an assessment of yearly exposure.</p>
<p>The dosimeter is worn on the outside of the lead shielding.</p>
<p>This can be expensive but I think it's an OSHA requirement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I don't think it would be a great idea to have people try and provide estimates over the internet for your decision making.  There are health physics and diagnostic medical physics consulting services which could help you out with this kind of thing, it's their specialty.</p>
<p>Another point is that if you or your staff are primarily having their hands irradiated, they should be wearing ring dosimeters in addition to their torso badges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also a veterinarian. The owner should not be holding the patient for radiographs! This is a huge liability! The most of obvious thing wrong with this is what if an owner was pregnant and didn't know yet?  Yes the exposure might be small but it puts you at a liability that you don't need. Also patients often freak out during rads... I've been bit (when I was an assistant years ago) by a cat that was calm and nice but either didn't like the way I was holding him or the sound of the machine. So that's another liability you don't need. (I also wonder what OSHA says about clients having unneeded exposure.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit - a lot of posts on here are saying that there is an evolutionary advantage to having an animal scream out because it warns the other members of the tribe, and, though it may lead to the animal being killed, it's better for the tribe as a whole. </p>
<p>I'm fairly sure that can't be true. Evolution only works in the interests of the individual, not the group (at least, not if it means sacrificing the individual). Evolution is about passing on your genes to the next generation. That's all it is. If the individual dies, they can't pass them on. That's survival of the fittest. True - screaming out may help the tribe, but if it leads to those genes dying, they don't get passed on.</p>
<p>Editing my edit - apparently I'm wrong. Some know-it-all named Richard Dawkins wrote a book about how sometimes evolution can work for the interests of the group rather than the individual. Learned something new. That's what I love about reddit.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are communal animals. Screaming alerts the rest of the tribe to the danger. It may or may not save the injured individual, but it definitely helps the group as a whole. Since genes are what matters, not individual survival, behavior that makes other close relatives more likely to survive is more likely to get passed on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see a very high level post addressing this but being under attack isn't the only time we cry out.  Imagine you get injured in a ditch or between rocks or something.  Crying out loudly will more likely get you saved than a more quiet response.  Same with a predator attack if you're around other armed humans.  You will be more likely to survive if you get help fast.  Food for thought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know with puppies and kittens,  they learn how to coexist peacefully by responding to their parents' and littermates' cries.  Puppies and kittens who are separated from their litters too early often have issues recognizing other animals (and even people's) boundaries.  So when a puppy is playing with its littermate and bites too hard,  the other pup squeals to let him know that it's inappropriate play.  Obviously this doesn't quite fit for instances where the animal is being attacked,  but it is still an important function of communicating pain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing you want to do is alert everyone else. One of two things will happen, which is either that the other humans come and save you, or they run and at least some of the tribe survives. Same with other animals. If one deer makes noise when bitten it might scare off the predator, and it also lets the other deer in the area GTFO so that they can live.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
