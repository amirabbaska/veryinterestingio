		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple reasons:</p>
<p>The exoskeleton of the ant distributes the force more quickly across its entire body (due to being more stiff than fluffy human tissue), protecting more vulnerable parts.</p>
<p>The small size makes it more resistant to blows - this is because volume (and mass) scales faster than surface area (r^3 instead of r^2). So smaller objects have a larger surface area per unit mass, which makes them move more easily even with light forces (like wind). The mass is what causes inertia (&quot;pushing back&quot; against your finger while you apply the force) and the force is distributed over its surface area. So your applied force is distributed across a relatively large (compared to its volume) surface area (leading to a relatively low pressure), while the low mass (very low, due to aforementioned scaling) makes it easy to move. This means you won't be applying your force for more than a fraction of a second before the ant is moving along with your finger, no longer receiving any significant force. Since you're not applying this force over any time (or distance), the total energy transferred into the ant is very small. This, combined with the effective armor exoskeleton, is why it's difficult to kill insects by swatting them into empty space, but if you push them against a solid object, they squash easily.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Resistant exoskeletons and general properties of small objects make them less likely to be crushed by an outside force.</p>
<p>True ELI5: It's like trying to break a balloon by punching it in midair. The punch is certainly hard enough, but the balloon just kind of gets pushed away.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The square-cube law means that smaller objects are stronger.  Hit a car with a wrecking ball and it's crushed; hit a toy car with a ball bearing and nothing happens.  Strength scales with the square of an object's size but mass scales with the cube so the toy car might be 100 times smaller and 10&#8239;000 times weaker, but the ball bearing weighs 1&#8239;000&#8239;000 times less than the wrecking ball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ant doesn't have enough mass or area to absorb the energy from you flicking - the force you're pushing is extremely spread out. If you could concentrate the energy into the area of a knife blade, you would cut it. It's like hitting that car with the moon. It won't be 100% fine, but mostly the moon will just push the car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the mention of overdosing on Vitamin D for typical adults...</p>
<p>Overdose causing some noticeable symptoms and negative effects, can occur if you take 60,000 IU per day. </p>
<p>Since many Vitamin-D bottles contain 1000 IU per capsule... </p>
<p>you'd have to take like 60 pills per day, over the course of many weeks, or a few months to experience an over dosage! </p>
<hr />
<p>For a more dangerous overdose you'd have to consume 1,000,000 IU per day, over the course of several days... </p>
<p>which is like 1000 pills per day! (so several bottles PER DAY worth). </p>
<hr />
<p>NOTE: </p>
<p>Some people react strongly to certain vitamins in ways that others do not. So if you notice any ill effects what-so-ever, obviously you will want to lower the dosage, or stop it all together. </p>
<p>But in general, from what I've read, it is recommended that you do NOT exceed 10,000 IU (10 pills) per day, just to be on the safe side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you do not have working kidneys, there is no difference since the body cannot convert Vitamin D to a usable form; that process takes place in the kidneys. Thus you must take a Vitamin D analog - prescription only - that is the usable form.</p>
<p>It's not an exact science. Vitamin D allows the absorption of calcium but if your serum calcium is already high you can run into hypercalcemia, though you'll likely get sick before that happens and adjust your dose downward. Any kind of Vitamin D supplementation - whether prescription or OTC, such as D3 - is going to affect three things: your calcium, your phosphorus and your parathyroid hormone (PTH). These are all minerals associated with bone metabolism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orally supplemented Vitamin D usually comes in a D2 and D3 mixture. D2 (ergocalciferol) usually comes from plants, and D3 (cholecalciferol) is what our body &amp; skin makes and what we get from meat/fish/milk.</p>
<p>Both are absorbed, activated, and used by the body in the same way. So to answer your question specifically: They both affect the body the same way.</p>
<p>The difference is just that oral supplementation comes with the risk of overdose. which would result in several symptoms associated increased calcium in the blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Vitamin d is nothing more than a chemical that we have since learned to synthesise so that if you are ever in a situation where you can't be exposed to a sufficient amount of solar radiation to meet your vitamin d quota or your body has a problem creating a sufficient amount of vitamin d then an oral supliment just introduces the same chemical your body would have created on its own, just without the radiation </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you mean exhausted, tired and 'depressed' then <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/here-s-why-you-feel-so-crummy-when-you-re-sick" target="_blank">there is a study on rats</a> which demonstrated that proteins called Interferons appeared to be responsible for most of their &quot;feeling sick&quot; behavior.   Interferons are released by cells under attack to alert the immune system to an infection.  They're like a smoke signal to let the city know that an invading army is coming and rally the troops.   The side effect is that the interferons impair brain function.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god, I've been googling this so bloody often and was never able to find a satisfactory explanation. I have this too and for me, feeling sick from lack of sleep feels nothing short of a bomb going off within me. Immediately after waking up too early, I always feel flu-like symptoms (even when I don't actually end up having a cold or the flu), get a migraine, feel dizzy and dehydrated, nauseous, stuffy in my nose, overheated, feverish, all at once. Nothing can alleviate that except going back to sleep. The problem for me is, I get this reaction if I sleep for anything less than 10 hours. 8 hours, and I feel like absolute shit. 5 hours, and there will be a big chance that not only I will feel shit like that but on top of that get actually sick (with a virus or so) in the following days because my immune system appears to completely shut down if I get too little sleep, even if it happens just once. I eat healthy, work out and am quite resilient overall, but as soon as I don't get my 10 hours just once, I'm wrecked. I suffer from Chronic Fatigue on top of that and it's really quite debilitating to need at least 10 hours sleep a night and on top of that still suffer general fatigue throughout the day. :/</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Carryin &quot;wood&quot; further, it decomposes into gas and ash, ash is mostly calcium carbonate, which has no boiling point because IT decomposes first into solid quicklime and CO2 gas, at about 840 °C.  This is not &quot;burning away&quot;, no oxygen is used.  The calcium carbonate just splits by itself, you can't stop it.</p>
<p>Quicklime (calcium oxide) boils at 2,850 °C.  So, THAT.  If you heat wood to 2,850°C in a vacuum, you will get nothing but gas- first flammable woodgas and ash, then the ash becomes CO2 leaving calcium oxide, then calcium oxide becomes gas, leaving.... nothing solid at all.</p>
<p>Uranium boils to a gas at 4131°C, btw.</p>
<p>Also, there may be a limit on calling it a &quot;gas&quot; in that before it gets hot enough to be a gas, it self-ionizes and becomes a plasma first.  Which is like a gas in many ways, but defined differently.</p>
<p>Also, like CO2, pretty sure if it's hot enough the carbon and oxygen don't stay together as CO2. </p>
<p>Carbon burns to CO2 if you have oxygen.  But if you don't have oxygen, it evaporates to a carbon gas at 3915 K.  There is no liquid stage.  It sublimates. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main reasons. First, glasses are generally worse heat conductors than metals and second metals tend to be ductile while glasses are generally brittle.</p>
<p>So let's step back a second. The reason that glass shatters when rapidly cooled is usually because of heat gradients in the material. These variations in temperature create stresses at different points in the material. If the stress is large enough it can then lead the glass to shatter. So what's different in metals? To start off metals are much better conductors so that such heat gradients can more quickly dissipate.</p>
<p>But just as important is the fact that metals also tend to be much more ductile. The reason is twofold: 1) metals tend to be crystalline and 2) they are connected through metallic bonding. These properties allow metals to relieve stress through dislocations where planes of atoms slide past each other. As a result the material can easily deform in the presence of a stress without cracking, which is what makes crystalline metals rather soft.</p>
<p>If you move away from these conditions you tend to reduce the ductility of the material. So for example if you move away from metallic bonding to ionic or covalent bonding the materials tend to become quite a bit more brittle. The reason is that now the directional bonding makes it much harder to slide atoms around in order to relax. It's for this reason that quartz (the crystalline form of common glass) is pretty brittle. Likewise if you move away <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RqBqCYW.gif" target="_blank">from a crystalline structure to an amorphous structure</a> you again prevent atoms from being able to slide away from each other in an orderly way. As a result it's much likely for cracks to develop and propagate, which leads to materials shattering. For this reason, even metallic glasses can be quite brittle.  </p>
<p>As a final note, in some cases even crystalline metals can shatter. Certain metals exhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility#Ductile%E2%80%93brittle_transition_temperature" target="_blank">a ductile-to-brittle transition</a> in a given temperature range. At those temperatures if you apply a strong enough stress the metal will also develop cracks like glass and shatter.</p>
<p>edit: I added a more thorough discussion on the effect of the type of bonding per the point raised by /u/Narwhal_Jesus </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually can shatter depending on the type of metal it is.  Regular high carbon steel (used for making knives) is really susceptible to cracking and breaking if you quench if in water.  It has to do with the metal crystals themselves during the quenching process.  When you quench steel slowly i.e. in oil the metal cools slowly (relatively) and the crystals are larger and adhere to each other better.  Fast quenching produces small, not very well bonded crystals that are brittle and susceptible to cracking and breaking.  Metals ability to expand and shrink keeps if from shattering like glass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just took materials science last semester, this was a pretty basic concept through the class. Quickly reducing temperature causes the total mass to change temperature at different rates, so while the outside is cooled, the inside is still very hot. Materials contract when they cool, so the outside squeezes the inside, and the inside pushes on the outside: the inside is under compression and the outside under tension. Metals can handle compressive and tensile stresses really well and we typically want those traits in metal: in ancient metallurgy blacksmiths have quenched tools in water and oil. (It’s more in depth but that’s the general idea for metals) Glass (or in general, ceramics) doesnt handle tension well at all, but it’s amazing at compression. The tension it makes on its own is enough to shatter itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass is an extremely good insulator as opposed to metal which is a good conductor so temperature flux can be distributed more easily throughout the entire piece of metal. This will more easily allow the coefficient of thermal expansion to occur more evenly whereas with glass a sudden change in heat will cause sudden changes in the size of various parts of the glass so it may expand or shrink without anywhere to go causing it to crack. This still CAN happen with metal but it’s ability to bend and compensate for temperature change makes it more difficult </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of two major factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ice cream has a lot of surface area, which means more nucleation points. More nucleation points mean more bubbles.</p>
</li>
<li>Milk and cream have a higher surface tension than water. This means the bubbles are stronger.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The reason why Mentos in soda makes it fizz is because all the pits and holes means the surface area is <strong><em>huge</em></strong> compared to the volume. You could get similar effects from a spoonful of sugar or sand.</p>
<p>Easy experiment: Get a bottle of seltzer or clear soda. Get it nice and cold before opening and pour it into a glass. Pour slow so it doesn't fizz too much. Wait for the bubbles to stop and drop in a few grains of sugar or salt. You will see that the bubbles will form around the granules until they dissolve. Use a few grains of sand and it the bubbles will keep forming until there is none left, which will probably be longer than you are willing to sit around.</p>
<hr />
<p>/u/GaidinBDJ has the dissolved gases issue backwards.</p>
<p>Hot liquids will hold more solids (salt, sugar, minerals, etc.) while cold liquids will hold more gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, etc.) </p>
<p>One of the worries with global warming is the amount of methane dissolved in the ocean. Warm up the ocean and the methane comes out. Methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. If enough methane gets into the upper atmosphere, the global temperature will skyrocket in a runaway reaction and life as we know it is <strong><em>fucked</em></strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>911 is always a local call.  You dial 911 and it goes to your nearest emergency call center.  The operator there relies on the information you give them for the location of the emergency.  If no address is given, they can do a lot to track down the location, since the incoming call was local.  </p>
<p>When 911 was first implemented, landlines were the thing, and emergency operators were provided with a database to match a phone number to the address (like a phone book did, but this database also included the unlisted numbers).  Local phone providers were also required to set up a contact point for the local emergency center, so blocked numbers could be identified and the location of the emergency found.</p>
<p>Then, mobile phones became big, and in the early 2000's, U.S. legislation required cellular service providers to implement a system to route a 911 call to the emergency call center closest to the tower serving the call.  This same legislation required providers and phone manufacturers to implement technology enabling them to calculate the location of the handset in case of an emergency call.</p>
<p>However, these systems aren't perfect, and they're slower, so operators rely on the location given to them by the caller if they have the option.</p>
<p>Obviously, swatters can't actually dial 911 - it would go to their own local emergency center instead of the one they want to mobilize.  So instead they dial a direct number for the call center they want.  Because their phone is usually not in the area that center covers, the automatic systems to track down a location fail.  This leaves the emergency operator no option but to send units to the address the caller provided.</p>
<p>A swatter may take further steps to hide their location, such as using a spoofing service, but that is really only useful to forestall investigation after the event.  </p>
<p>Source:  I worked in tech support for a major mobile provider at the time the legislation passed and was implemented throughout the industry.</p>
<p>Edit: Just re-read OP's question &amp; realized misunderstood, &amp; so didn't address it at all. Oh well. Somebody thought it was useful. I'll leave it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if anyone has touched on the “arrested and charged” portion yet. 1- it’s uncommon for someone who accidentally calls 911 to get charged with misuse of 911 unless they repeatedly do it and refuse to take steps remedy the problem. 2- Prank 911 (people who are local to the 911 call center) do get charged, because it’s a bonafide misuse of 911 and ties up emergency lines and first responders. 3- SWATers get charged less  often because they are generally not local to the 911 call center. While they are identified regularly by law enforcement- the problem is location. Generally- prosecutors will issue a local warrant for someone, but will not extradite that warrant (nationwide extradition is quite expensive). That means that if someone in NYC SWATs a person in Sacramento, CA prosecutors might issue a warrant only enforceable in CA. So if the dude from NYC ever goes to CA and gets contacted by the 5-0 he would be charged, otherwise he never answers for the crime. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a cop and a certified dispatcher. I had to cover dispatch often enough. If a landline is entered into our 911 system, we have the exact address. Cell phones are trickier. We can ping the location, but it takes some time and it's not 100% precise. The longer I could keep someone on the phone, the more accurate I could ping their location.</p>
<p>There are probably more accurate systems out there than what I worked with. But there are probably less sophisticated ones, or no systems in place at all. It all depends on whatever budget that particular agency has to work with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former 911 operator here.</p>
<p>When you call us from a landline, we get something called ANI/ALI (Automated Number ID and Automated Location ID, which was originally invented for billing purposes, fun fact). The ANI/ALI data is tied to your billing address and is managed at the phone company. It's different from caller ID and is much, much harder to spoof since it's not generated on-the-fly like caller ID is.</p>
<p>When you call us from a VoIP phone, our ANI/ALI data we get may not be accurate, since not every VoIP provider actually verifies the subscriber's information. SWATters know this, and exploit it. They set their target's address as their subscriber address and it rings into the target's local 911 center.</p>
<p>Cell phones only provide us with the physical location of the tower it came in on, a directional bearing, and most of the time coordinates that may be wildly inaccurate or spot-on, depending on a wide range of conditions.</p>
<p>If someone's life is in immediate danger, I can call a special number at the phone company and get the phone pinged. This gives me the most recent coordinates that were logged, in addition to a billing address if available. It's not something we take lightly and I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to do it.</p>
<p>The entire center I work at has only had 2 false SWAT calls since 1996. It's a big issue when it happens, but it doesn't happen often. If I get a call that sounds fake, I still dispatch it as received. Stress affects people differently, and someone might just be in shock when it's a real emergency.</p>
<p>SWATters may also use something called a TDD (telecommunications device for the deaf) that is like a rudimentary texting system. That way, they can avoid having to speak, which means less chance of them getting caught through voice analysis.</p>
<p>Our infrastructure is incredibly old and most centers don't even support true text-to-911, let alone encrypted radio communications. SWATters use high-tech methods to fool our low-tech equipment.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> They use VoIP and spoof their address. Our equipment is old as shit and that helps them, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Imagine you have two lasers that are perfectly parallel to each other. In a flat universe, they will behave as we expect and remain parallel forever. In a curved universe, on the other hand, the lasers would actually start to bend towards or away from each other. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The famous image of the CMB is supposed to represent microwaves coming towards Earth from all directions. The images you see of the CMB are displayed usually on screen or on paper, which is of course flat. This can be misleading. A more accurate way of showing the CMB would be a globe. <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/poor-mans-cmb-primer-part-0-orientation/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example. You are floating in the middle of this  globe, and the colours you see on the globe surrounding you represents the temperature of the microwaves coming towards you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Metal detectors don't detect metal directly.  They detect changes is magnetic permeability.  They send out a magnetic signal and measure how the surroundings effect it.  Sure, many parts like the arm are metal, but they don't move relative to the sensor.  You use the detector by sweeping it from side to side.  If there is a metal object, the magnetic permeability is different and when you sweep the sensor through the space around the metal object, it beeps.  Only change in metal-i-ness around the sensor makes it beep, and the metal arm doesn't change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
