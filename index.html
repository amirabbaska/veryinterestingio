<p>However, the Panama Canal connects two salt water bodies together with roughly 40 miles of freshwater.</p>
<p>So, while the fish could physically traverse the locks and canal, it is unlikely that they would survive the 40 miles of freshwater travel needed to pass through the canal.</p>
<p>There have been multiple studies as this question is not uncommon, but I believe it is still not known of any marine life that has successfully passed the entire canal from one ocean to the next.</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> I should clarify I was speaking to larger marine life. /u/datums brings up a very good point for smaller marine life. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7q6d25/eli5how_has_the_panama_canal_effected_fish_and/dsmrgpa/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7q6d25/eli5how_has_the_panama_canal_effected_fish_and/dsmrgpa/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of different ways to answer this question. One answer could be that single neurons cannot store any information, that information storage is based on the state of a group of neurons in a system. In that context, we could say that a single neuron in a group of neurons is acting as a container for a single bit - each neuron is an on/off switch, but thinking of neurons as digital (0/1) is problematic because it makes the assumption that the state of a neuron is binary.</p>
<p>This is where the concept of an action potential becomes important. So each neuron in this memory system we are talking about has a non-binary amount of electrical energy stored in its membrane, and when the membrane reaches a certain threshold potential, this triggers a chain reaction that sends an action potential along an axon. This action potential might carry some encoded information along to another neuron, and trigger another action potential, so on and so forth, until many neurons have been triggered by this initial reaction.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t exactly a cut and dry, “Neurons store 10 bytes of data” answer that you might have been looking for, but at least these are some ideas to think about in regards to how it’s really a more difficult/complex question to ask than it might seem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The neuron itself does not &quot;store information&quot;, but its interaction with other neurons can be represented by weights, i.e. once it fires, how it increases \ decreases the polarization of the neurons at the end of its synapses.</p>
<p>One neuron in the human brain is directly &quot;connected&quot;, on average to 7000 other neurons. These connections excite or inhibit the activities of the neurons at the receiving end to a varying degree determined by the type of synapse (what neurotransmitter is user, how many vesicles are secreted, how many neurotransmitters molecules per vesicle, how many receptors are present at the receiving end and what's the uptake time). </p>
<p>The resolution needed to describe the weight, then, is roughly the max number of vesicles it is possible to emit to the synaptic gap, times the number of different neurotransmitters, times the range of molecules per vesicle, times the max number of receptors on the receiving end times the max number of re-uptake-responsible contraptions in the synaptic gap.</p>
<p>The lower bound limit I can give on this resolution is about 10^15 , but it's probably much higher.</p>
<p>Thus a lower bound of the information encoded in the activation of a neuron would contain about 10^15*7000 possible stages, or roughly 348802 bit, or about 43kB.</p>
<p>So a neuron contains at least 43 kilobytes, but it probably contains much more than that. I haven't even touched upon the possible time dynamic of the neuron (which may fire in bursts, with varying number of activations and varying time gaps between each activation). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

(Neuron, 2004) they provide an estimate of 5Kb for a Purkinje cell. Note that these cells are somehow special, however: they are located in the cerebellum, rather than the cortex, and they have ~15x the number of synapses of a more common pyramidal neuron found in the cortex.</p>
<p>Also, the method used is reasonable, but (obviously) questionable. Without getting into too much detail: there could be alternative ways of computing the storage capacity of a neuron, for example (basically, depending on the neural code, which we don't know really). Some of the assumptions made in the paper may not hold. Surely, the &quot;arrangement&quot; of the network stores information as well, somehow. Etc. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the computations performed to derive the 5Kb figure of the paper are already quite hard and involved, and the accompanying experiments required to feed the parameters into the equations require extraordinary technical skills. (Basically, these scientists are among the best in their fields, is what I'm saying.) So having a better estimate is going to take a while, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>A perfect fifth is nearly 3/2, a perfect fourth is nearly 4/3, a major third is nearly 5/4, and they all have consonance. A major second is close to 9/8, which isn't all that small of integer. A minor second is not close to anything nicer than 16/15, but it is still useful in music.</p>

<p>That's not close to anything! It transcends dissonance, it is &quot;ambiguous&quot; because there is no closeness to any small close-integer ratio on which to evaluate it.</p>
<p>If you use a tritone, a diminished fifth, an augmented fourth, it will make the listener uncomfortable. You'd better be going for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In music, the “pitch” of a note refers to how “high” or “low” it sounds. Pitch corresponds to the frequency of a note (although the exact relationship has a couple of caveats).</p>
<p>We say that two pitches are “consonant” if the ratio of their frequencies is a simple fraction, and “dissonant” if the ratio is not a simple fraction. We care about this because our <em>brains</em> do — consonance might sound nice, stable, or pleasant, while dissonance may sound tense, unstable, or grating. In music, we use both of these effects.</p>
<p>In music, we call the ratio between the frequencies of two pitches the “interval” between the pitches. The simplest fraction (other than 1/1) is 1/2. We call the interval corresponding to this ratio the “octave”. Our brain likes octaves so much that two pitches separated by an octave sound very similar, though we can tell that one is higher and the other is lower.</p>
<p>In music, we say that pitches separated by octaves are in the same “pitch class”. In Western music, we use twelve different pitch classes. (The reason for this is interesting, but it's outside the scope of this answer.) In modern times, we consider all twelve of these pitch classes to be equally spaced.</p>
<p>With twelve pitch classes, we can form twelve different intervals. The smallest (other than the unison) is the “semitone”. An example of a semitone is the interval from C to C♯ (or, equivalently, to D♭. Another example is the interval from E to F. Other intervals can be represented as multiples of a semitone: from zero semitones (a unison) to twelve semitones (a full octave, which is equivalent to a unison when talking about pitch classes).</p>
<p>Some of these intervals are very consonant. The most consonant is the unison/octave, followed by the “perfect fourth” (five semitones) and “perfect fifth” (seven semitones). Other intervals are very dissonant, including the semitone itself (also called the “minor second”) and the “tritone” (six semitones, also called an “augmented fourth” or “diminished fifth” based on context). Because the tritone is so dissonant, it often sticks out to the listener. It should be used judiciously (which does not always mean sparingly!).</p>
<p>If you ever take a course in music theory, you'll hear about many “rules” to obey when writing music. These rules, prohibiting things like “parallel fifths”, are really practical guidelines; breaking them thoughtlessly will likely sound bad. The tritone itself has sometimes been fancifully called “the devil's interval”, although what was surely a hyperbolic description of its dissonance has taken a life of its own over the years. There is no evidence that this moniker was ever taken seriously in a religious sense, or that use of the interval was outlawed. It is, on the other hand, absolutely true that our standards of consonance and dissonance have mellowed over the years and that a listener from the year 1600 would likely have found the tritone interval much more grating than we do today — and that, therefore, a composer from that time would have used many fewer of them.</p>
<p>An important counterexample illustrates the point. One of the most important chords in common practice western music is the “dominant seventh chord”. This chord contains four notes, and two of them are separated by a tritone. The dissonance of this interval gives the chord a certain “tension”, and this tension is “resolved” when the dominant seventh chord is followed by a more consonant “tonic” chord. The most traditional, conservative way of ending a piece of music is with an “authentic cadence”, which often includes a dominant seventh chord. The lesson here is that even early composers did not avoid the tritone or dissonance in general; rather, they respected and often relied upon them.</p>
<p>Now, the disclaimer: I'm not an expert on early music (especially pre-Renaissance), so I'm open to input from someone with more specific expertise in that subject. Maybe there is some priest somewhere who once forbid the tritone in his church or something. Stranger things have happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, ignoring survival conditions, staying where you are should increase your odds of being found. A search party will systematically rule out locations where you are not, and you risk moving into a previously searched area or even away from the search party.
There is always a chance you will head towards the search party, or even back towards safety, but assuming there only a handful of directions that lead to safety (an entrance to the area you're lost in for example) then you have a low probability of heading in that direction.
If you can't be sure that a search party is coming, it changes things a bit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you realize you are lost the best thing to do is stop, do not keep wandering aimlessly. Take a look around, calmly, and try to determine the best area for some sort of shelter. Look around you for open areas, you want to be seen from the air. Make a big 'X' on the ground using contrasting color material (ie: green branches on snow). Also make something that you can wave in the air. Contrast and movement are the keys here. The international signs of distress are X's and anything in 3's (three lines, three fires, etc.). </p>
<p>The search teams will begin at your last known place (car) or place last seen (someone saw you on a trail) and work out from there. If you keep wandering around you are expanding the search area and decreasing your chances of a quicker rescue. Most searches, weather permitting, are started with a quick air search, followed by a hasty ground search using vehicles, followed by ground search teams. If you can find an open area or a trail, fire road, logging road nearby stay near those. If nothing like that is near you find the nearest 'open' area you can and park yourself there. If you have to relocate to a better position (necessary resources) leave obvious 'sign'. Broken branches, arrows made using rocks or sticks, showing which direction you went will help searchers looking for you. Be obvious and large with your 'sign', don't assume someone will see it, make it large enough that someone can't possibly miss it.</p>
<p>Anything reflective (mirror, watch, cell phone glass screen) can flash sunlight for miles. At night, anything than can create light (lighter, flashlight, glow stick) can also be seen for long distances. The thing to remember is people will be looking for you so make it easier for them to find you. Shout, wave something colorful, smack rocks together, anything...just don't sit around and play 'hide and seek'. </p>

Consequently, ill-prepared hikers who wander off marked trails and get themselves lost, or worse yet too injured to backtrack, are very common. </p>
<p>A large preponderance of those needing to be rescued are visitors who incorrectly assume the local mountains are just tamed urban parks, because they look so benign and inviting from the highrise hotel window. Not so; once an unaware or inexperienced person steps off the parking lot gravel and into the treeline, things can start going wrong for them very, <em>very</em> quickly - especially if they head out in flipflops and shorts, as some actually do. But to be fair, locals in Goretex and trail boots also need to be retrieved, sometimes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.northshorerescue.com/" target="_blank">North Shore Rescue</a>, one of the world's busiest volunteer rescue organizations, gets nearly 3 calls a week, year round, to find or rescue people stuck in the bush, and will field as many as five calls a <em>day</em> over some summer weekends. Last year they spent over 10,000 rescuer hours on searches and recoveries. Often these SAR callouts require multi-day searches by a dozen or more highly trained and well-equipped volunteers; reports of missing hikers are typically made late in the day, often leaving only a few crucial hours to rally and search before nightfall requires ops to be suspended until first light. In short, these guys and gals are world experts at finding people in technically challenging, very dangerous terrain that is often heavily overgrown and lethally steep, then getting them out safely.</p>

The faces of these blocks are so flat, that they stick together if you stick them together in a certain way.<br />
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lOOl3VxOtE" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice video about that).<br />
However, if you &quot;stick&quot; two of those together and leave them for a few weeks/month/years (depends on the temperature) they actually weld together.<br />
Since a good set of gauge blocks is expensive as hell, be sure to always put them away separated from each other.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Particles must always move, no matter what the conditions due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which states one may not know the exact velocity and position of a particle.

<p>This means that no particle may be completely motionless, as we would then know the position and the velocity simultaneously.</p>
<p>Even at absolute zero, particles still move, even if it's the slightest movement. I believe Feynman called it the &quot;quantum jitters,&quot; but the technical name for this phenomenon is &quot;zero point motion.&quot;</p>
<p>So yes, particles must move in a solid. To answer your second question, atoms are so attracted to each other that they vibrate, but don't move past each other. Atoms in liquids move much more freely amongst each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the reason why substances in gaseous and liquid states flow and move around is they have enough kinetic energy (per particle) to resist the inter-particular forces (dipole bonding, hydrogen bonding etc). When they have this amount of kinetic energy behind them, if they bump into another particle, the momentum continues to carry them along and they overcome the sticky bonding forces.</p>
<p>However, as we cool a gas down, and it condenses into a liquid, we see particles having more interactions; their volume decreases because the particles have less energy, and they interact with the attractive forces of other particles more. Not enough to make them stick, but enough to contain them in a definite volume at a constant pressure. They still flow and hold the shape of their container but they do not expand to fit the whole thing.</p>
<p>If we continue to cool this substance below the fusion/freezing point, the kinetic energy of the particles ceases to carry enough momentum to overcome the sticking forces of other particles. H-bonding, ionic crystallization or induced dipole-dipole interactions, etc all occur at this point, and the substance becomes rigid - the particles are more strongly attracted to one another and the particles are no longer free to move about. They become stuck in place as interactions occur between more and more particles. They still vibrate in place, but do not have enough energy to break free from those bonds formed within their network of bonds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Antifreeze prevents the formation of these ice crystals, or at least keeps them limited in some way that they do less or no damage to the cell membranes. This is actually used in microbiological labs; if you want to freeze your cells or bacteria, you put them with a bit of some specific antifreeze component.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has more to do with the size of the animal, and protection it may have from damage caused by freezing. </p>
<p>It takes longer to freeze a pound of meat, than a hot dog due to mass and how thick it is affects length of time for the center to cool. A gentleman by the name of Birdseye discovered that food frozen in the beginning of winter, often preserved worse than food frozen during the  height of winter. He came up with the concept of flash freezing produce to ship from farm to peoples homes. </p>
<p>What they found was that the faster something freezes, the smaller the ice crystals are, which limits cellular damage. Freeze a frog, or an ear of corn, slowly, and ice crystals turn the flesh to mush. Flash freeze them, and they are still 'fresh' when thawed, and crisp and intact. </p>
<p>the frogs that can freeze and thaw,  have very small bodies, so that helps with time it takes to freeze, but it also helps with time it takes to thaw. The limbs of the frog will thaw first, while the center of it's body will still be frozen. Limbs without a beating heart will quickly begin to suffocate so thawing requires this doesn't go on too long. The physical size of the frog helps with that and it tends to thaw pretty evenly. </p>
<p>A mammal could similarly survive a freeze but it would have to be small enough to freeze quickly, much smaller than a mouse, and it would benefit from cellular antifreeze which is seen in some reptiles and fish, but not mammals yet. Not that it wouldn't work in mammals, just that mammals evolutionary niche is to go into low energy mode during winter, or hibernate, rather than to freeze, so evolution hasn't really selected for it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The redshift caused by gravity is called gravitational redshift, which is different than the better known cosmological redshift caused by the expansion of space itself. To answer your first question, yes, gravity wells do create their own redshift! For example, a photon leaving the surface of, say, a white dwarf star will lose energy as it climbs out of the gravitational potential well. As the light loses energy, it will decrease in frequency and be redshifted when observed. Moreover, gravitational redshift is only significant for massive and compact objects (black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs) and not really for the sun since gas motions near the surface of the sun cause a Doppler shift in the frequency of departing light that is larger than the gravitational redshift. </p>
<p>I’ll refrain from answering your second question since the posts above answered it well enough!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It doesn’t matter much. At distances where this is a large effect the random motion of galaxies is still important. At distances where you get nice measurements the redshift is so large the gravity wells don’t have a large impact any more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, but other effects end up being much larger - namely the expansion of space itself. Also, because black holes do not emit light, they end up not having much net effect on photons, as much of the blueshift cause while approaching is lost after it passes the black hole. The same is true for smaller gravity wells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To jump on to this with a general relativity related question I've been pondering for a while.</p>
<p>When we're tracking the movements of probes and spacecraft as they move through the solar system, do we have to account for the effects of general (and possibly special) relativity in maintaining accurate knowledge of their positions and to manage maintaining a signal with them?</p>
<p>With the Juno probe for example. Does it's movement <em>away</em> from the Sun, or the Earth for that matter have to be factored into calculations which tell us exactly where it is, and what exact time its transmissions are sent? Similarly when it approaches a large body like Jupiter?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bartonski, I don't think anyone has satisfactorily answered your question.  If gravity creates time dilation, any photons traveling through a high-gravity zone near a black hole should be slowed down and red shifted.  May be a different cause from ordinary red shift, but seems like the effect should be to lower the wavelength.   If this is not happening, you have to question why. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Both parts are sluffing (losing skin cells) at similar rates, and then replacing those cells at similar rates. So the shape and structure of moles might change overtime, but on average they don’t change much because they are “in sync” with the growth/loss of the cells around them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main layers of skin:
1-Epidermis (outermost layer)
2-Dermis
3-Hypodermis
The epidermis contains no blood vessels, and is nourished by diffusion from the dermis.The outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells, which sheds.</p>
<p>The dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that consists of connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane. It contains the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels.This layer does not have the property of shedding off. Birthmarks are present in this layer as birthmarks are caused by overgrowth of blood vessels, melanocytes, smooth muscle, fat, fibroblasts, or keratinocytes.
Therefore, birthmark don't go away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not true for every phone but in general:</p>
<p>Charger gives you 5V 1-2A over usb</p>
<p>Charging circuit in phone reads battery decides how much current to pull</p>
<p>Charging circuit feeds the battery at around 4V because Li-Ion is fully charged around 4ish volts.</p>
<p>This brings us to relevant bit number one. The phone doesn't run on 5V 1-2A directly, it runs on the battery, which is less than 5V. To run directly on the 5V input the manufacturer would have needed to plan ahead, which costs money, so most don't.</p>
<p>The second point is if you yank out the battery in most phones the charging circuit isn't even connected to the main power, it just runs through the battery typically, so you can't even feed charge to the device without running it through the battery.</p>
<p>Third point is retarded charging circuit might say &quot;hey no battery no phone&quot; regardless of if it can run or not.</p>
<p>So the answer is it depends. It possible to run right off the charger, but it's cheaper and easier to pass through the battery. A few phones will run with the battery pulled out. Some will run if you take a 4-pin adapter and stick where the battery is supposed to be to connect charge circuit and main power. Some phones probably do this already by having a bypass inside the battery itself, but to be honest manufacturers seem to prefer that your battery die earlier.</p>
<p>Maybe the most salient point is that Li-Ion don't like being plugged in all day. Li-Ion batteries are happiest when hovering around 40% charge, in general they suffer the least degradation if they are used from around 30-80%. If longevity is your concern the primary ways to keep your battery are 1) never go below 20%, 2) limit the amount of time spent near full charge, 3) always use the slowest wired charger you have. Basically trickle charging throughout the day. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wHg8Q" target="_blank">Here's</a> my Axon 7 after about 1.5 years. 50 hours on battery with light use, still another 25 hours left. I get up to 5 days sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Should be the power adapter, but may, in some case, use a bit of the battery.</p>
<p>A common power circuit is a T. power on the left, battery on the right, load at the bottom. It should in theory take the power from the side with the highest voltage. 5V supply, 3-4.4V battery.</p>
<p>The real path is more: adapter -&gt; current sense resistor -&gt; diode -&gt; output &lt;- diode &lt;- current sense resistor &lt;- battery.</p>
<p>Bridging the two ends of the current sense resistors, sitting across the output, sit the charging circuit.</p>
<p>The diode prevent a direct battery to input and input to battery current path, but allow both to power the load. Take note that it is usually also in parallel with a mosfet, and some circuit to turn on and off the mosfet (the diode first conduct, but lose some voltage. The circuit detect it and turn on the mosfet, which short the diode and basically no voltage is lost, making a 'perfect diode').</p>
<p>The charger then can see the battery voltage and current, and the amount of power used at the input, and control the charge as to not overcharge and not overload the adapter...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
