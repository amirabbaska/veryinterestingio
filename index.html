		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Did plants even grow in such areas at all, despite having the perfect temperature conditions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. There is plenty of fossil evidence that during the much warmer period of the Cretaceous (145 - 66 million years ago), the ice free land in both polar regions supported luxuriant forest ecosystems. There were conifer populations that existed, although the leaf falls and winter die-back of deciduous type trees greatly reduced energy and respiration demands, allowing for such communities to migrate north into the Arctic in the mid-Cretaceous. </p>
<p>Trees would have been generally spaced further apart than how we see in todays forests, in order to make the most of the sun when it was available. All populations would have been able to utilise the continuous months of sun during the summer/winter (depending on pole) to produce a large amount of the so called earlywood - cells with large, hollow interiors and thin walls that are good at conducting fluids - to meet the high fluid conduction demands of rapid growth. In contrast, the latewood of polar trees contains a layer of much smaller, thicker walled cells. </p>
<p>The earlywood-latewood cycle is seen in trees growing in seasonal areas today, but fossils from Cretaceous polar forests show a much more pronounced difference both in the size of the earlywood cells produced, and in the relative overall thickness of the different growth layers. The transition is almost instant and the latewood layers are extremely narrow, only being produced in the weeks of twilight either side of extended darkness - a period of complete dormancy with no new cells produced at all occurred during darkness.</p>
<p>Edit: light micrograph sections of growth cycles that indicate the kind of difference I mentioned:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a reasonably common phenomenon.  One common way it can happen is when species are strung out over a large geographic area, but the population doesn't mix frequently.  Individuals breed with their neighbors, but not with more distant populations.  When the gradient is smooth, it's called a cline.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology</a>)</p>
<p>But you don't need a cline to get the pattern you mention.  Sometimes it's simply distinct species that can hybridize in certain ways but not others.</p>
<p>When these &quot;species&quot; stretch out around a geographic barrier and meet on the other side, two adjacent populations may be unable to breed directly.  This phenomenon is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species" target="_blank">ring species</a></p>
<p>Really I think it's kind of remarkable that species sort out as well as they do (at least for certain branches of life). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They're called ring species, it's somewhat similar to a cline. However, both ends of the spectrum are unable to breed and in order to fit the ring species definition those populations are close enough that hybridization should be geographically possible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allegedly there were tools and documents, including malware (trojans and the like), RATs, methods of hacking and controlling people's phones, SMART TVs, computers, and other devices that relay through a network (possibly Alexa, Siri, Cortana, etc.) that were used by the CIA and shared with NSA, that were leaked to former intelligence agents. At least one, or of a handful of these agents had transferred the tools and documents to WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>Supposedly, this is only part one of the 'hugest leak' in history, and WikiLeaks will be continuing the Vault 7 database through the month. Considering the amount of documents to go through, I believe it'd be safe to assume they've had these files for months now, considering it's as late as 2016 documents. What is scary is that WikiLeaks mentions that encryption on devices, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, are pointless due to the remote protocols that can take control of your Android or iPhone itself, thereby bypassing the app(s) themselves. Or that a user could have their files uploaded to a server right now, from their phone or computer, without knowledge, and presumably it wouldn't be identified through network mappers such as Wireshark. </p>
<p>Leaks are not a rare occurrence in this day and age, as we've seen from Cellebrite's leak, and the Shadow Brokers' instances. While there are people that see WikiLeaks, and Julian Assange as being allies of Russia, or as being shady (Rex Tillerson, Roger Stone, etc.), there's no solid evidence, AFAIK, but due to this, people see this move as being political to draw away attention from the Sessions controversy, or further administrative actions. It would seem that WikiLeaks has been waiting quite a while to release these documents, so perhaps it is due to U.S. politics, or perhaps it is due to them feeling this to be the right time. People will note the Clinton emails being leaked out during the campaign, and see that as similar to this. This would be bias, and I am only stating that to show how people may and could see the leaks. It might be political, it might not.</p>
<p>At this point, we should definitely be alerted and aware of this, because if such tools end up in the wrong hands -- with black hats, or even dumbed down for script-kiddies to use, it could be incredibly dangerous, especially with the rise of self-driving vehicles (WikiLeaks cites a tool used to control a person's car, though not much information is given. People were quick to jump to the conclusion that the CIA may have used this in the death of Michael Hastings, though it cannot be confirmed as of now.) I'm sure some of what I've written is wrong, but this is what I've gathered from a quick read of the Vault 7's ToC. Expect more to be uploaded -- over 8,000 pages which means it could take some time to see the true effect this leak will have, as people (if the tools themselves are uploaded), will seek to modify and use the tools for their own personal gain. You wouldn't need physical contact with someone's device, since everything could be done remotely. This is becoming quite scary.</p>
<p>Hope that was good enough. I'm sure others could explain with far more insight, but :/ </p>
<p>What can we do about the government surveillance? Not much. They're able to bypass encryption, control devices, search through our information (they can see usage data of your device -- meaning they can figure when you commonly use your device, and when you're commonly offline), record your visual and audio interactions, and upload your files to their servers all without you ever knowing. I could be glum and say privacy is dead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The hacking tools includes &quot;viruses&quot; for Samsung TV's, which enables them to listen to conversations close to the TV, even though it appears to be off. It also contain a nice list of weaknesses in Apple and Android phones, Windows and Linux operating system. Some of these weaknesses are not known to anybody else, which allows the CIA to break into most phones (and thus using the mic, camera, GPS etc. to surveil a person or a group).

We are taught that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a system.  That is valid when classical statistics can be applied- when there are many accessible quantum states available to the molecule within a range of the average thermal energy (kT).  So at high enough temperatures this might hold true for electrons and for the motion of atoms within molecules or crystals as well as for molecules in a gas, while at low enough temperatures it will break down for all of them.  (Due to their small mass, quantum levels are spaced far apart for electrons and so this approximation only would apply at very high temperatures and low densities.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>However there is a couple of things to consider. First the solar panels efficiency drops with temperature. So usually a 2m^2 panel would produce more power than a 2m^2 lens focusing light on a smaller panel. Moreover panels have a maximum operating temperature before the semi-conductor stops to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>tl;dr: Yes you can double or half the temperature of something, but not in the way you're probably thinking.</strong></p>
<p>The confusing part of this topic for most people is that the temperature scales that we use in day-to-day life are kind of...arbitrary. The &quot;zero&quot; on the Fahrenheit scale was based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit#History" target="_blank">the temperature of a mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride</a>, while the &quot;zero&quot; on the Celsius scale is based on the melting point of pure water. While both of these are solid reference points that anyone can measure, they really don't have any deeper physical meaning relating to the nature of temperature.</p>
<p>When we measure things, we tend to start at 0 and work up. A ruler starts at zero length no matter what units you use, a speed of zero mph or kph always means you're standing still, the pressure of outer space is zero<a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/MimiZheng.shtml" target="_blank">^^(not ^^exactly)</a> whether you're using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch" target="_blank">PSI</a> or <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/\(Gh\)/wwhlpr/pressure_units.rxml" target="_blank">millibars</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_mercury" target="_blank">inches</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr" target="_blank">torr</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit\)" target="_blank">atmospheres</a>, etc. But what about temperature?</p>
<p>Temperature is, in rough terms, a measure of the amount of random &quot;motion&quot; atoms and molecules have at extremely small scales. For a gas, this essentially means <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/kintem.html#c3" target="_blank">the average speed of a given molecule in the gas</a>. For solids and liquids, it roughly corresponds to the amount of &quot;jiggling&quot; the molecules do on a microscopic level. More motion/jiggling means higher temperature, less motion/jiggling means lower temperature. Many of us learned this from high school chemistry. So what would you think a proper &quot;zero&quot; for temperature would be? Naturally, you would think that &quot;zero&quot; temperature would be the temperature at which there is no motion/jiggling at all. And that's exactly what we see in physics and chemistry: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> is the temperature at which atoms would (<a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5889074/why-cant-we-get-down-to-absolute-zero" target="_blank">theoretically</a>) have no random &quot;jiggling&quot; at all.</p>
<p>So if you measure the temperature of something on a temperature scale that starts at absolute zero, then you can properly talk about &quot;doubling&quot; or &quot;halving&quot; the temperature. By far the most common scale that fits this definition is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin" target="_blank">Kelvin</a> scale, which is basically the Celsius scale but it starts at absolute zero. So while absolute zero is -273.15C, on the Kelvin scale it's just 0 (and, conversely, the melting point of ice is 273.15 Kelvin).  2000K truly is twice as hot as 1000K, and 50K truly is twice as cold as 100K. Using our day-to-day scales like Fahrenheit and Celsius, this wouldn't be true: it would be like measuring things with a ruler that starts at -4 &quot;blinches&quot;, which is the same as inches but it starts at -4. We know that something that's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6QXqQzD.png" target="_blank">10 inches long</a> is twice as long as something that's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wfzDTfg.jpg" target="_blank">5 inches long</a>, but if we used our strange ruler then something that was 6 blinches long would actually be twice as long as something 1 blinch long, which really doesn't make any sense if we're just doing simple calculations!</p>
<p>Now that you have the background, we can finally get a proper answer to your question. If it was 0F today, and tomorrow it were going to be twice as hot, you might want to consider evacuating you and your loved ones, because <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0F+to+K" target="_blank">0F is 255.4K</a>, and <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*255.4K" target="_blank">2×255.4K=460F</a>, which is pretty close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451" target="_blank">autoignition temperature of paper</a>. If it was 0C today, then tomorrow's doubly-hot weather will be even more unbearable: <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*273.15K" target="_blank">2×273.15K=273C</a>, which is getting close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Bulk" target="_blank">melting point of lead</a>. </p>
<p>Interestingly, if you doubled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth" target="_blank">lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth</a> (184K, which is −89.2 °C or −128.6 °F), you would get <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*184K" target="_blank">368K, which is 95 °C or 202 °F</a>, which is close to the boiling point of water, and way above the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/HottestSpot/page2.php" target="_blank">hottest natural temperature recorded anywhere on Earth</a> (outside of a volcano or a forest fire). So, in practice, it's never possible for today to be &quot;twice as hot&quot; or &quot;twice as cold&quot; as tomorrow. Unless, of course, <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/22111/temperature-of-mercury/" target="_blank">set up a homestead on Mercury</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have already been some good answers, but I'll chime in on a subtle point that I think is worth mentioning. In general, <strong>temperature is a macroscopic characteristic of large ensembles of particles</strong>. In statistical mechanics, we would call temperature an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties" target="_blank">intensive</a> variable. &quot;Temperature&quot; starts to take on a different meaning when you get down to single particles. There is certainly a relationship between the microscopic characteristics of each particle and their collective, bulk properties, but it's very incorrect to assume (except for very special cases) that all of the particles in, say, a gas at room temperature are moving at the same speed. The distribution of the microscopic characteristics like energy and speed can be found with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution</a>, which is an incredibly important piece of math in all statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the speed of a particle is not linear with its kinetic energy. You may have seen the expression for kinetic energy before, KE=(1/2)<em>m</em>v^2. You'll notice that the energy scales with the velocity squared. So, if you double the energy (and kept m the same), you've only doubled v^2, so increased v by the square root of 2. It also becomes more complicated because there are many ways for energy to &quot;hide&quot; in the system that aren't related to the translational speed of the particle. </p>
<p>As other people have pointed out, &quot;zero&quot; temperature really only has objective meaning if you're talking about absolute zero, which is 0 Kelvin,  about -273 Celsius, and about -460 Fahrenheit. However, even if you made up your own thermometer with its own scale, there would be a lowest possible temperature that would correspond to the same &quot;absolute zero&quot;. From a microscopic perspective, the bulk property of absolute zero temperature is due to every single particle in a system being in its ground state, or its lowest possible energy. Again, it's an unusual case because every single particle has the same energy.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question directly, particles at 80 C do not move twice as fast as particles at 40 C. On average, they are moving faster, but it's much less than twice. At out roughest approximation, we can simply let velocity increase go with the ratio of square root of temperature, so moving from 40 C to 80 C, and converting to Kelvin, we have sqrt(353)/sqrt(313) = 1.06. So, <strong>they're moving about 6% faster on average</strong>. Again, this is a very rough approximation, the real story is much more complicated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the other question (do molecules go twice as fast) the answer is no, they go sqrt(2) times as fast. This is because changes in temperature depend on changes in energy, and the energy of a moving particle is (1/2)mv^(2). <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/kintem.html" target="_blank">Explanatory hyperphysics page</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say when you say &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;, it's with respect to the ideal temperature, maybe around 72F.</p>
<p>So yes, twice as cold as 0F would be around -72F</p>
<p>Related to your original question would perhaps be saying something's twice as hot as 72F; for which the same method would yield ... 72F. Which does makes sense - because 72F is not hot, nor is it cold; so twice as hot as not-hot or not-cold should also yield ... not-hot or not-cold.</p>
<p>And yes, this would also apply to temperature in terms of molecular energy; but comparing to molecular energy at comfy room temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a physics point of view, degrees C is absurd (although F is worse). So yeah there isn't a meaningful way to interpret &quot;twice as warm&quot; in C. As people have observed, you can convert to kelvin, but that get you answers like &quot;twice as hot as 0C is ~250C&quot; which doesn't really answer the question your colleagues are asking.</p>
<p>To answer that question (or approach an answer), consider this. Can humans really feel temperature? If you take two blocks, one rubber and one metal, and leave them for a while, which feels colder? You know they are both the same temperature but the metal feels colder. Ok now if I put some ice on each block, which ice melts faster? You want to say the rubber, because it felt warmer, but the truth is it's the one on the metal block. The reason is that metal is a better conductor, and it's the same reason the metal feels colder: we don't really feel temperature, we feel the rate of change of temperature on our skin and use that as a proxy.</p>
<p>So the question you really want to ask might be: at what temperature does the rate of change double?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This pro-erection process is counter-balanced by an anti-erection effect from the sympathetic nervous system. Normally, they cancel each other out. The Sympathetic nervous system activity dips in the small hours whilst you are asleep and the parasympathetic effect 'wins'. Coupled with a normal diurnal rise in testosterone levels; you get a stonking boner. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>They are, essentially. Drinking water supplies contain a low concentration of chlorine bleach or another disinfectant to prevent germs growing.</p>
<p>Also the pipes are sealed, with valves and taps designed to prevent air containing germs being drawn in, and they're opaque so light algae need to grow doesn't get in.</p>
<p>EDIT: As many people have mentioned, not all places and countries leave the disinfectant in the water. Ensuring that it's clean when it enters the pipes - either with chemicals that are removed or with UV light - along with the pipes being airtight and dark and unfavourable to life is when done correctly enough to keep the water clean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Public water supplies DO have chemicals added, but for people like me that live in rural areas with private wells, essentially it's just the process of using the water on a regular basis that keeps it fresh. </p>
<p>Algea and such come from surface contamination, but well water left in pipes for a few weeks or more may get stagnant or have rust from old steel pipes. </p>
<p>Last summer I inadvertantly left my garden hose running all day and ran my well dry.  After it finally refilled in a day or two from the surrounding ground water, I had to &quot;reprime&quot; the system and let the water run to clear out large contaminants like minerals and rust. The water smelled funny and was brownish for a few days. </p>
<p>Even under normal circumstances, I probably ingest small amounts of of microscopic minerals, small celled organisms, rust,etc.
Not enough to be harmful, some of the minerals might even be good for me. </p>
<p>Remember, humanity has been drinking &quot;dirty&quot; water out in nature for most of our existence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It greatly depends the country you're in. A lot of commenters here mention chlorine as main means of desinfection, combined with copper piping. That certainly is the case in the US and many other countries. In other countries, like the Netherlands where I live, chlorine desinfection isn't common practice. Only 20÷ of households in the Netherlands recieve chlorinated water and in that case chlorine isn't used as a primary desinfectant (as that's not allowed), so the chlorine concentrations are very low. Primary means of desinfection is UV or ozon treatment (at the treatment plant). Growth of biological contaminents in the (mostly PE or PVC) piping is prefented by making sure no contaminents are present in the water before it enters the system, combined with measures to prefent introducing contaminents during transport, such as desinfecting piping with silverperoxide before use and mandatory anti-backflush valves at house connections. Apart from the methods mentioned above, there are many more options that are used around the globe, with fluctuating results; in some countries tap meets drinking water standards, sometimes even of better quality than bottled water (like in the Netherlands), in some countries tap water isn't meant for consumption as drinking water but only for use. While the Dutch take great pride in their drinking water quality, something could also be said for not cleaning the water you use for your washer / dishwasher / shower up to drinking water standards. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the drinking water plant they add more chlorine to the water than is necessary to deal with any of the bugs that lived in it. This leaves extra floating about ready to deal with any other bugs it might possibly encounter in the pipes under the road or in your own house.</p>
<p>On top of that to make sure that there is always water with some of that extra chlorine in it operators will sometimes run taps at the dead ends of the underground pipes.  These constantly run water, and make sure that the older water gets pushed out of the dead end pipe by fresher water.</p>
<p>Also, operators like me (or people we pay) will routinely go around to fire hydrants and open them up full bore and spray a bunch of water all over the roads or into ditches or whatever.  This not only makes sure fresh water gets to all the pipes, it also makes the water run really fast through the pipes and it scours off any bugs, or buildup in which they could live, and spews them out of the hydrants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
