		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software developer here,</p>
<p>I wrote software for these one-armed bandits for ~5 years. Detecting a fault in the machine isn't too hard, I suppose, though I never had to do it. If the machine is a &quot;participation&quot; game, then some of the winnings of each game are paid out to the manufacturer, because just making and selling machines isn't profitable enough to stay in business. The catch is the manufacturer pays out the jackpots, not the casino. So the casino doesn't give a shit if you hit 10 jackpots in a row, and neither do the commissioners, for them, they're just doing their job.</p>
<p>When a jackpot is hit, the whole bank of machines are roped off and kept under guard. A poor (EDIT:) sonofabitch engineer or two are dragged out of bed in the middle of the night, or pulled out of their children's birthday party, whatever, and they're stuffed into a plane with all sorts of gear and shit. They will systematically diagnose, test, and dismantle that machine down to the rivets to make sure it wasn't tampered with or flawed. It's the company's responsibility to prove the win was false if they want to save their cash.</p>
<p>But even the manufacturer plans for payouts, it's all part of the budget. My employer designed the math behind their games so one of their participation games, in the entire market, like a Wide Area Progressive, would hit every 6 months. We had one WAP hit twice in one month just after release once, the execs puckered up so tight they shit diamonds to cover the bills that day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you are referring to the $43M ticket from the other day. </p>
<p>One aspect is the nature of the error. That $43M ticket could never have happened under normal operation. The maximum payout for that machine was $10k. So, a factor of 4,000 smaller than the erroneous ticket. That makes it clear it is an error. A single spin not winning is a pretty normal state of affairs. It may well be in error, but it would be very difficult to prove either way. </p>
<p>Then, we put all sorts of checks into those machines. When it attempted to issue the ticket the server will (most likely) have replied that it couldn't issue a ticket that large. At that point the machine has a balance it can't pay out and will go into alarm. At that point the machine will have been rebooted.</p>
<p>Also against that girl is the fact the only photo is of her collecting her &quot;winnings&quot;. Why take a selfie of the boring ticket print screen rather than the jackpot screen itself? Seems to me like the error occurred well after the game ended, she hit collect <em>then</em> something went wrong. </p>
<p>We do our best to make sure that nothing goes wrong with the machines, but errors do slip through. The logic for us is that it is better to fail in favour of the machine. People who are down money will complain and tell us. Then we can check the logs for the exact time they won, see what went wrong and how much they are owed. It may take longer but it can be put right. If we fail in favour of the player then odds are they will never tell us, or worse they will attempt to repeat the circumstances for free money. It could be months before we even find out something is wrong. This leads into what /u/mredding said - if the machine has been actively tampered with, why the hell would a casino feel obligated to pay out? Fail in favour of the machine and check the logs later. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

He won a jackpot at a Roulette machine, but it didn't payout the $1,000 or so he won. I stayed by the machine as he went to complain. They said they couldn't do anything and said we were lying. </p>
<p>The only reason we were there is because we were waiting to get picked up as e took an Uber there the day before. As you can probably agree with, he was pissed off, and I was confused since there are hundreds of cameras lined all over.</p>
<p>We finally called the police, one of which we knew worked at the DPD from high school. They came and the money was given after they wanted to check the eye in the sky. I thought they'd need a warrant or something, but the panic caused by two police officers showing up made them eat their bullshit and pay my brother what he won.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The law isn't written to be fair, it is written to be just. A lot of people equate these terms, but they aren't actually the same.</p>
<p>A fair system would be the one you just described, where if a machine is faulty, all transactions should be considered void and reimbursed.</p>
<p>A just system means everyone has the same legal rights and responsibilities. The just system can have a rule like &quot;if you think a transaction was faulty, the onus is on the person who wishes reimbursement (or the refusal of payment). Any party that wishes to seek these measures must go and prove the transaction was faulty.&quot; Here, the law applies the same to everyone. It is just that the casino has the impetus to test the machine in the case of a huge payout, and you do not have the impetus every time you lose ten cents. If a person would go back to that casino and show evidence that they played 100 dollars on those machines after the casino has proven it was faulty, they would be reimbursed. </p>
<p>TL;DR: You have to seek reimbursement to be reimbursed. Everyone has to, and the casino does when it refuses a jackpot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have lived here and asked that same question to other scientists and learned more about it myself in my studies.</p>
<p>There are several reefs in the Gulf of Mexico (<a href="http://classroom.sanibelseaschool.org/coral-reefs-in-the-gulf-of-mexico" target="_blank">http://classroom.sanibelseaschool.org/coral-reefs-in-the-gulf-of-mexico</a>).  Just none along the north side and all the way down till you start getting into South east mexico.
The flower gardens are reefs.  They are on top of salt domes that brought the depth to a shallow enough level that coral could thrive while being far enough off the coast that the sediment load has settled and light is able to penetrate well.</p>
<p>MOST Coral is very dependent on light and water quality.  Most near shore waters in the Gulf of Mexico are very murky due to the Mississippi River sediment load.  General water circulation in the gulf is counter clockwise so the sediment load is taken to the west along the shore.  By the time you reach south Padre Island the water starts getting clearer on a more consistent basis.
You can actually find numerous pictures of the boundary of water density because of it.  By the time that happens away from the coastline the water is too deep for coral to form and thrive.  </p>

<p>Many causes of coral degradation is attributed to the natural cyclicality of the environment which can increase sediment content, alter salinity, change tide exposure to name a few. </p>
<p>Of course human activity can contribute to its lack of growth or existence/degradation as well. Overfishing, toxins brought in by runoff (both can be attributed to human activity and naturally occurring toxins), human disruption to name a few. One cause of coral bleaching most people are unaware of is caused by sunscreen. When swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving in any ocean or body of water it is best to use biodegradable sunscreen as this does not contain oils that will stick to corals and inhibit growth. Just an easy tip to help do your part. </p>
<p>I also didn't mention climate change (until now) as a human based cause because that can be and has been debated in plenty of other threads. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>why does this specific action recur to this extent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hitting one's self can be a form of stimming (self-stimulatory behavior), but there are many other ways to stim. These include hand flapping, rocking back and forth, various head movements, jumping up and down, etc. Sensory processing, or how we receive and respond to messages from our senses, is difficult for many people with autism, so self-stimulatory behaviors are a way to cope. Some people describe it as something else to feel or think about, and remember it's an automatic behavior seen in people as young as toddlers. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why hitting your head and not other sorts of SH activity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hitting the head is a common form of self-injurious behavior, but hitting other body parts, slapping walls or the ground, etc. are other forms of self-injurious behavior that people with autism and other special needs may engage in. There's also bitting one's self, which another person commented about, pulling ears, pinching, scratching, etc. I think head banging gets a LOT of notice because it is particularly overt and can be scary for the people around the person. </p>
<p>Self-injurious behavior MAY or MAY NOT be self-stimulatory. They <strong>almost always</strong> begin that way, but they may <em>develop varied functions over time</em>. For example, a child with autism engages in self-injurious behavior as a form of sensory stimulation, a way to cope with other sensory issues or internal events like emotions. This behavior may then get them access to tangibles, like a favorite snack or a desired toy or to go outside to play in order to calm down. Over time, the behavior might be engaged in for sensory stimulation OR for access to items or activities. Another example is attention. This behavior understandably gets a lot of attention. It's up to the people around the child to keep the child safe. However, the child may begin to engage in self-injurious behavior for attention. I've personally seen both of these happen. It's up to a trained behavior professional like a school psychologist or a Board Certified Behavior Analyst to tease apart the functions of the behavior and for classroom and care staff to follow through on procedures to reduce the number of times the student or client engages in the behavior. </p>
<p>Good question! Thanks for asking it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a different self-harm than you find in non-autism</p>
<p>Hitting head (stimming) is due to sensory overload. People without autism also sometimes experience it: if you stub your toe you will rub it for example (feeling of pain gets reduced because its covered by other sensation in same area). Or if you eat really hot food you may feel the urge to stand up and walk around so your bodily focus gets placed someplace else. That is sort of what happens with autism: too much sensory stuff going on, so by actively hurting themselves the focus gets reshifted to the pain (it sort of &quot;drowns out&quot; the rest a bit, not exactly, but sort of).</p>
<p>Self-harm as a consequence of for example extreme depression or helplessness (like we find with borderline, common example for self-harm) is similar but also different. It is more characterized by severely high stress levels, and the self-harm (e.g. cutting) actually physiologically reduces these levels. So it is more emotion based and less sensory like in autism usually is.</p>
<p>But then to get back to your question, why some of the engage in head-banging specifically; I don't really know. I can imagine because the sensory overload happens literally in the head (sounds, sights, smell) banging the head becomes the intuitive focus point. But that's speculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It must be awful being so incapable of dealing with a situation that everyone else masters perfectly, that you have to inflict physical pain to yourself to stop the frustration from &quot;exploding my brain&quot; as he says. </p>
<p>I've become quite good at reading him that I can get to him before he starts loosing it most of the times, and I ask him if he wants to wrestle it out of him. So we wrestle, and he gets the frustration out if his body by wrestling me instead of hurting himself. </p>
<p>This is my personal observation with my son. It differs from person to person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a board certified behavior analyst (BCBA) and an educational psychologist. I'm also the clinical director for an agency that specializes in behavioral therapy for autism and developmental disabilities (ABA therapy). </p>
<p>Self injury can occur for a variety of reasons. But the simplest explanation is that it's learned. Very early on in the development of a child (think infant) self stimulatory behavior is common. Babies often hand flap, move their arms and hands around, etc. for most kids, this goes away through the normal course of brain development. However for kiddos with autism, that development is impaired. They keep doing it despite the negative social effects it has. </p>
<p>In many cases, early infantile self-stimulatory behavior morphs into something else. Imagine a baby flapping their hands around. That's common. Parents will generally ignore that. But if the baby ever makes contact with their head while flapping around, parents will step in and stop them and say &quot; uh oh don't hit your head&quot; or something similar. Repeat this pattern over multiple trials and you can see how the child may learn that this always gets attention. And it continues from there. When they want attention they hit their head. </p>
<p>In another example, the infant doesn't learn how to soothe independently or using other means. They aren't calmed by hugs from a caregiver and they don't respond to social soothing. So the only thing that works is flapping. Let's digress to an analogy... suppose you have anxiety and deep breathing works for you. When you're mildly anxious small breaths might help. When you're entirely overwhelmed it takes more concerted effort, deeper breaths etc. the same holds true for self injury. Head hitting works in high anxiety situations. It distracts from the excessive input (anxiety) and calms the person down. </p>
<p>In short there are myriad reasons for self injury and head banging. Sometimes it's self soothing (stimming) sometimes it's attention, sometimes it's something else entirely (like escape from something aversive or access to something they want). But it's always for a reason. And that makes it treatable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main ways to stop a program.  </p>
<p>You can quit from inside the program. The program does whatever it's programmed to do when you click quit, saving data and closing files and such normally.</p>
<p>You can use End Task (on windows), this is the operating system sending a signal to the program that tells the program &quot;Time to quit, finish what you're doing and then exit.&quot;.  The program (hopefully) responds to the signal, finishes up what it's doing, saves data and such, then quits.</p>
<p>You can use End Process (also Windows).  Windows just ends the program, and frees up any memory associated with it.  There's no communication with the program.</p>
<p>In terms of the other guy's restaurant metaphor:  Quitting is finishing your meal then paying up and leaving, end task is being told to pack your shit and leave, and end process is being thrown out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Closing a program normally is akin to being in your car driving down the interstate @ 70MPH, taking the off ramp, braking slowly, coming to a complete stop, shutting the engine off and exiting the vehicle.<br />
Ending the task is like having someone throw a cinder block through the windshield while driving @ 70MPH. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main parts of a desktop application is called the &quot;message loop.&quot; It is code that continually runs, checking for new messages from the operating system or other programs. Messages include things like user input (you clicked a mouse or pressed a key) as well as other notifications that an application is supposed to respond to.</p>
<p>One of the messages that you can receive is the Quit message. This is how the operating system tells an application that it should shut down. The application should respond to this message by trying to exit in as graceful a manner as possible - for example, giving the user a chance to save any unsaved work. This is generally the same flow as normally exiting out of the application.</p>
<p>Selecting &quot;End Task&quot; from the Task Manager in Windows sends a quit message to the application and then relies on the application shutting itself down. Because it's up to the application to handle this, there is a valid response which is &quot;No.&quot; For example, if you have an unsaved document the application might ask for confirmation if you want to quit and you could click no. So the OS does not actually enforce that the quit message results in the application terminating.</p>
<p>However, if the application is in a bad state this message might not ever be received, or the application could still fail to shut itself down. In that case, the operating system can terminate the program by simply not running its code any more and unloading all of its code and data from memory, as well as cleaning up any shared resources it was using such as files or network ports. This means any saved work will be lost so it is the method of last resort. The OS will generally ask you if you want to terminate a process in this way if the message loop stops running for an extended period of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Vomiting is a reflex response to food that the body feels will cause us harm following consumption. The sense and reflex exist for the same purpose. A smell is an aerosol of the source (the smell of pizza is a very small part of the pizza floating through the air) and when it enters the body through the nose the same reflex reaction occurs as if it is in the stomach.</p>

Playing, fighting, hunting never consistently pushing their bodies past their genetic threshold. Where athletes now a days are so scientific with their training they routinely pass the limits their body was made for. Living creatures are all fairly durable when it comes to activities their meant to do. Its when we oass those thresholds that injuries such as blown tendons and things of the sort become much more common.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Less than with humans. </p>
<p>Our whole upright walking thing is fairly new evolutionarily. Our knees especially aren't very good at responding to the stress of quick (for a human) movements. </p>
<p>Adding on to the problem of bipedal running being new is the fact that selective pressure pretty obviously prioritized long distance walking/running over short distance. We can outrun basically nothing in the animal kingdom with raw speed. A tiger could catch Usain Bolt and not even get out of breath, but we can run a goddamn racehorse to death over distance. Since we are so slow, I imagine the only selective pressure for speed would be to outrun slower humans. It would be impossible to outrun some large african predator for anyone.</p>
<p>So in summation, our legs/knees are way less evolved for both time and selection reasons. They are good enough for the job of riding shotgun to our brains that their high injury rate didn't break us. Whereas any 4 legged animal is using a system that was working pretty great since before the dinosaurs. </p>
<p>That's hundreds of millions of years of refinement vs less than 10 million. And to boot, our group hunting strategies were so superior that the selective pressure for our legs was much weaker than it would have been for any other animal during those 10 million years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>animals are injured fairly regularly.  Outside of human interference (hunting/auto collision/ etc) the leading cause of mortality is injury related.  Injured animals are more prone to predation, and in general have drastically reduced fitness.  </p>
<p>For the most part, an injured animal is a dead animal.  But the actual cause of death is going to be attributed to predation, starvation, or maybe something else...because of this it is a bit difficult to prove the injury question a direct answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the US long gone is the time when there was any real challenge to liberal (i.e. free market) policies, whereas in Europe where socialist and even communist or anarchist parties continue to exist, the term defines where some parties lie not socially but economically.

<p>Whether or not a real &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; still exists is debatable if you ask me, and these seem more like vestigial terms inherited from the early part of the 20th century when the divide was more evident, and when social liberalism was fundamentally anti-capitalist, unlike for example the CDU in Germany, which is relatively economically to the right, but socially still more to the left that even the most leftist of US Dems.</p>

Thus it happened that, particularly in the United States, the word 'liberalism' has been gradually appropriated by champions of collectivism who reject liberalism in its classical sense. (See my essay on “Liberalism and the Choice of Freedoms,” in Erich Streissler, et al., eds., Roads to Freedom, pp. 117-146.)    </p>
<p>Old liberals may go on calling themselves by this designation – which is rightfully theirs – but they do so at the risk of being confused with American liberals. To avoid such confusion, they may resort either to explanatory footnotes or to adopting a new appellation for themselves, such as 'libertarians.' &quot;    </p>
<p>(Essays on Hayek, forework, Milton Friedman, p. XIV*)</p>
<p>In short, many in America misunderstood the term, then misapplied it so much that it became the new truth in America.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's your brains way of interpreting the environment and regulating your internal &quot;clock&quot;. In most people, this is regulated by the general brightness as sensed through your vision.

<p>A lot of people eat nutritionally poor foods for breakfast and/or lunch that are full of simple sugars, like donuts or breakfast cereals. The sugars enter the blood stream quickly and your body immediately tries to bring the blood sugar under control with insulin.</p>
<p>Now the energy necessary for body functions has come, and gone, leaving you with a feeling of &quot;crashing&quot; and a desire to take a nap. </p>
<p>In addition many people drink something with caffeine in the morning. This also runs out around the same time contributing to the crash. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I learned long ago about the basic equations used to describe the phenomenon or how to calculate the spectral lines, and I'm very familiar with how a spectrum with a graph on it looks. None of these answer my question.</p>
<p>So Reddit please save me. <em>HOW</em> is black body radiation actually produced on the quantum level? What mechanism takes place to generate the actual photon and what parts of the atom are involved, what are the specific quantum interactions, and which specific Fermions and Bosons are doing what in what way? What energies are involved?</p>
<p>I realize this will have at least 3 different answers depending on the phase of the material, and that there is quite a bit of cross over with thermal radiation.</p>
<p>Bonus: How do monatomic gases emit black body radiation in rare cases?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any object above absolute zero temperature, the component particles will have an energy distribution in which at least some of the particles are sitting above their lowest possible energy state (i.e. the Bose-Einstein distribution for bosons, and the Fermi-Dirac distribution for fermions). This means that some particles always have a possibility of transferring to a lower energy state, releasing a photon at a specific wavelength corresponding to the energy transition. At the same rate, other particles are thermally excited into higher energy states maintaining a constant energy distribution if the object is in thermal equilibrium. The resulting spectrum of emitted photons is dependent on the energy distribution which is a function of temperature and gives us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law" target="_blank">Plank's Law</a> and black body radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of mechanisms both intramolecular and intermolecular (or atomic). For example, the transition of electrons between different energy states in atomic or molecular orbitals. The energy states of different vibrational and rotational motions of molecules (these tend to be in the IR range) as well as the motion of atoms and ions relative to each other (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon" target="_blank">phonons</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung" target="_blank">Bremsstrahlung emission</a>) are how radiation is emitted.</p>
<p>All of those together create a background set of processes at different energy levels that couple together and result in black body radiation along with thermal equilibrium. Depending on the temperature different mechanisms will dominate (nuclear, electronic, atomic, molecular, etc.) Because there are a lot of different possible energy states, there's enough to fill in the black body spectrum. When you have a huge collection of atoms you have a lot of complicated energy states that basically involve the motion of every atom relative to every other atom, which is why macroscopic objects can have such &quot;smooth&quot; black body spectra.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not unique to the UK.</p>
<p>Other countries have or had the same sort of thing. It just evolved differently in many places. In the UK what stands out is that you have so many tabloids competing with each other egging each other on and raising the bar about what is considered acceptable because everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>For comparison in Germany you have the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper which is the countries biggest selling newspaper and largely a print repository of exaggerations, rumors, lies and unethical journalism in general. (One popular band called them out in lyrics of one of their songs as consisting only of &quot;fear, hate, tits and the weather&quot; and a novel about a woman's life being ruined by a Bild reporter and subsequently murdering him is required reading in many German classes in school.)</p>
<p>In the US the height of this form of journalism was when the tabloids in New York started the Spanish American war based mostly on lies and manipulations by yellow journalism. One of the main culprits later Joseph Pulitzer ended up regretting his behavior so much that in his will he left his fortune to help make better journalist though education and though creating a prize in his name that rewards the exact opposite behavior of what made him rich.</p>
<p>In the UK the tabloids just managed to hold on in numbers and continue to make the world a worse place through their lies and unethical behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Celebrities, the Royals, deceased soldiers, bombing victims and 13 year old murder victim, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Milly_Dowler#Voicemail_tampering_investigation" target="_blank">Milly Dowler</a> all had their phones hacked.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists working for the News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends to think that Milly was still alive</p>

<p>I always found this incredible screwed up! Surely they should all be TRUE at least?</p>
<p>They're essentially paper representations of various demographics utilising clickbait style techniques to drag their 'readers' in. They're VERY opinion based and the government doesn't hold journalism to high scrutiny as they are notorious for gagging orders/public enquiries they can control the release of information over. The 'newspapers' pander to the parties they believe they will have the most success selling too. Morality and good journalism is few and far between, in the U.K. And the world. </p>
<p>E.g. The Daily Mail is notorious for pandering to the audience that has no idea what life is like for MOST people so they get away with saying any of shit because their readers aren't commonly known to be deep thinking, research driven customers. They are often face value readers, much like The S*n. Both have countless lawsuits against them in response to false news stories. </p>
<p>The Guardian, on the other hand, appeals to mostly Liberal viewed readers, the social justice readers. However, aside from a few reporters, they don't really push the boundaries very far anymore or cause much debate. </p>
<p>Essentially they've become 'safe' if their market so don't do any journalism anymore. </p>
<p>They do mix it up a bit for the sake of meeting various journalistic standards but any opinions they print for 'balance' are buried in sections you'd struggle to spot them in anyway. </p>
<p>TL;DR: They pander to different political demographics using sensationalist tricks to guarantee clicks/sales; like if buzzfeed was printed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
