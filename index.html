<p>Do you have any examples for this? Most things in the world today require you to put your trust in someone else who is an expert, or require you to become an expert yourself.</p>
<p>Consider the concept of the solar system. I absolutely believe that there are 8 planets (and Pluto), but I have only personally seen four of them. I'm choosing to trust astronomers and scientists and physicists who tell me that there are more, and I have no issue with that trust, but there's always a possibility that they are lying. </p>
<p>Throw in 20 years of action/crime/drama movies where nothing is ever what it seems, and huge organizations all have agendas and manipulating the herd is how people get ahead, and then remove a great education that teaches you to think critically and you can end up with a natural distrust of everyone who isn't exactly like yourself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Opinions seem to be tied very closely to people's identities.  So if you provide people with data that refutes their claims or beliefs, they would have to admit that the premise on which they've based their identity, their purpose, and their goals we're all a sham.  I dont think people consciously have this thought.  I believe it's an automatic psychological defense mechanism. </p>
<p>There is something called the 'Back fire effect.'  Check it out here. <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/" target="_blank">https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/</a></p>
<p>It basically states that when you present proof suggesting a person's opinion to be other than correct, they will grow more convicted in their views.  Basically the opposite of science!</p>
<p>What really boggles my mind is when I see this behavior in college educated people.  Not because I believe non-college educated people are less intelligent.  Far from it actually.  But a college degree, more than anything, should confer upon a person proof to society that they know <em>how</em> to think.  That is to say that I hold them to a higher level of responsibility, that their opinions should be backed by facts, with room to be flexible should new facts be presented to them.  In practice, proof (however it is presented) should affect a person's conclusion.  But unfortunately, that is applies to theory more than reality. </p>
<p>I see this mostly happen mostly with political views.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I had 2 conversations with a 20 year old delivery driver the other day. In the first he was absolutely DUMBFOUNDED that Hawaii was a state and not a continent/country.</p>
<p>In the second I had to explain that germs cause sickness, not cold weather. Cold weather will weaken your immune system to some extent but you need to get germs in your body to get sick. He basically just said he didn't believe me, then when he saw me wearing a light jacket the next time I went out for a cigarette he said &quot;cold huh?&quot; in a very snarky tone.</p>
<p>This is what you get when you combine the NYC public school system, a lack of interest, and an already &quot;not the sharpest razor in the cookie jar&quot; kinda person.</p>
<p>On the plus side, after explaining the germ thing further he did say &quot;learn something new every day!&quot; so I think he knew I wasn't looking down on him. I hope this doesn't come across as hubris or a holier than thou up on a high horse kind of mentality but I feel like it's partially on me to help get him interested in learning these basic sorts of things. It's up to you too, assuming you can do it without being condescending. I can't speak for anyone else but if someone explains something well to me that I previously didn't understand, or gives me evidence that disproves something I already believed, I always appreciate it. I think most people do as long as the other party isn't being a jerk about it.</p>
<p>I guarantee that a large percentage of people who cling to these falsehoods do so because there's an animosity toward people who talk to them like they're stupid for believing it in the first place. I'd wager there's a ton of people reading this who still think urine is sterile. You're not stupid, you just never double checked. That's ok, cuz guess what? You learn something new every day!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The coaxial (cable)/twisted pair (ADSL) leaves your house and goes to a building that's nearby (a mileish) called a Central Office (CO). These cables are buried underground, usually down the street in front of your house or alleyway, or carried on poles if you get your telephone or cable that way.  </p>
<p>In the CO all of the copper lines from all of the houses in the area come together and are plugged into some devices there. The step from the local office to your house is called the &quot;last mile&quot;.</p>
<p>These devices detect amplitude (how big) and/or frequency (how often) changes in the voltage on the line and convert it into digital data (ones and zeros). This process is called demodulation. </p>
<p>From here your data is lumped together with all the other data coming into the CO and sent over a fibre optic line, usually buried under the street or hung on a pole, to a big data center where your ISP's routers are. Fibre optics can go very far, so there are usually only a few of these big data centers in a city. These data centers are physically connected to one another with buried fibre optic cables, and then one or more of the data centers in each city are directly connected to one or more of the data centers in neighbouring cities. So the fibre goes from your neighbourhood CO a mile or so away to a much bigger building somewhere in the city, which then has connections to other data centers in the city and in neighbouring cities.</p>
<p>Electrical signals are converted into light using a transceiver. The light then bounces down the fibre optic line to the transceiver on the other end, where it's turned back into electrical signals.</p>
<p>In the data center your ISP's routers look at the data. Routers are responsible for moving data between different networks. They look at the destination IP address and figure out which IP network the data is destined for. Then they look at these big tables (500,000+ entries) that match each IP network to an ISP based on the ISP's autonomous system number (ASN), which is how the internet sees an ISP. You see &quot;Verizon&quot;, the internet sees ASN 701. Having it's own ASN, and having a copy of the table listing all of the IP network to ASN assignments is basically what makes an ISP an ISP (well, that and connecting to other ISPs). Once the router knows which ASN the data has to go to, it looks for the edge router that is closest to the destination ASN, and then sends the data bouncing through its data centers, city by city, until it gets to that edge router. More about edge routers later.</p>
<p>ISPs connect to one another by burying fibre optic cable from one of their own data centers to an internet exchange (IX), which is a place where a bunch of other ISPs have agreed to drag fibre lines to as well. For obvious reasons, ISPs will also just designate one of their own data centers a Point of Presence (POP) and &quot;allow&quot; other ISPs to bring fibre cables there and rent rack space in the building. </p>
<p>ISPs themselves, or companies that specialize in this, will also sometimes bury cables directly between IXs and POPs that are far apart (e.g. on different continents). These connections can be very, very long and very, very expensive. They will bury it over land or sea, farmland, forest, mountain, coral reef or deep ocean. These lines are usually one big continuous unbroken link, minus a few repeaters/amplifiers/regenerators which keep the signal strength up, and go for thousands of miles. </p>
<p>In an IX or POP, which is basically a warehouse, each ISP is given space on computer racks in the building. So your ISP has brought their fibre optic cable hundreds of miles from their data center to the IX or POP and routed it through the building to their racks. They then place their edge router in the rack and hook up their backhaul fibre cable to it. A physical fibre optic or copper cable is then ran from your own ISPs edge router, through the building, to the other ISPs edge router, which is connected to its own long distance fibre cable back to that ISP's data centers. <del>And that's how babies are made</del></p>
<p>Edge routers tell whatever ISP they are connected to which IP networks your ISP owns, and then, importantly, they also usually say which additional ISPs your ISP is connected to as well.</p>
<p>ISPs will then sign agreements between themselves regarding how much, if anything, they will charge one another for data going between them, and whether or not they are allowed to send data only to that particular ISP, or if they are allowed to also send to ISPs that THAT ISP is connect to as well. This is called peering.</p>
<p>It should go without saying, this is a huge simplification and stereotypification of something that can go a billion different ways.</p>
<p>One usual variation is that there are companies that specialize in burying fibre optic lines between IXs and POPs, so that if ISP A wants to talk directly to ISP B, but is far away from ISP B, they can pay to use part of one of these companies fibre lines to get from an IX where ISP A is to an IX where ISP B is, rather than paying to construct their own long distance cable.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> I realize this is more of a ELI 1st year college student... but there you go...</p>
<p><em>Second Edit</em> Obligatory thank you for the gold, kind stranger. May your internet be forever fast and reliable...</p>
<p><em>Third Edit(s)</em> Good points from some great folks that newer implementations of DSL move the aggregation point (where your DSL line ends and your data is sent onwards over fibre optics) much closer to you and it is likely just a cabinet down the block. This makes things faster for you. Also remembered what a CMTS was, corrected a few typos, and added a few terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is complicated.  There are lots of different things going on at the same time.</p>
<p>The analogy with letters by /u/Atzen doesn't really match how it works, unfortunately.  It's a little more like phone numbers and a phone book.  But I'm going to strip out the analogies.</p>
<p><strong>DNS:</strong>  Let's start with typing in something like <a href="http://www.example.com/cheese.html" target="_blank">http://www.example.com/cheese.html</a> into your browser.  A certain part of that, www.example.com, is the <em>domain name</em> which tells you which computer has what you're looking for.  But the domain name is not enough, it's like knowing a person's name.  What you really want is something like a phone number or address.  The post office doesn't know how to deliver a letter to &quot;Joe&quot; and the phone company doesn't know how to route a call to &quot;Joe&quot; either.  So the first step is to look www.example.com up in a directory and you get an IP address, like 192.168.200.5.  Now you can send packets of data to that address.</p>
<p><strong>Routing:</strong> So your computer sends a packet to 192.168.200.5.  Let's say your computer has an address of 10.1.2.3.  First, it checks if the address is on your network.  Maybe your network has addresses like 10.X.Y.Z, but 192.168.200.5 doesn't look like that, so your computer needs to send the packet to a router that will send it to the right network.  Maybe the router has address 10.0.0.1.  So your computer sends a packet to 10.0.0.1, with the instructions &quot;please send this to 192.168.200.5 for me&quot;.</p>
<p>Your router is dumb, and only knows that it should send everything over your internet connection to your ISP.</p>
<p>At your ISP, there are some smarter routers.  One of them will get the packet, and look at it, and say, &quot;I know where the 192.168 network is, I'll send it that way.&quot;  Your ISP isn't connected directly to that network, so it takes a few hops and visits a couple more routers along the way.  Later on, a router might say, &quot;192.168, that's me! Actually, 192.168.200 is its own network, but I know where that is&quot;.  Eventually, you'll get to the 192.168.200 network, and the router will just send your packet straight to its destination.  Each router only has a little bit of information.</p>
<p>(There are other ways to route packets… sometimes you take a smart router, have it write some instructions on a packet, and then send the packet to a bunch of dumb routers which just read the instructions written on the packet.)</p>
<p>If you want to see exactly which routers you use, try running a terminal command like <code>traceroute www.example.com</code></p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Routers are connected to each other mostly through fiber optic cables buried in the ground.  This is super expensive but very fast and reliable.  Some connections go across the country, or across the world, and some connections just go to other parts of the city.  They mostly work the same way: you take a router, give it a little bit of information like &quot;192.168 is that way&quot;, &quot;10.0 is over there&quot;, &quot;172.16 is behind you&quot;.</p>
<p>However, it gets a fair bit more complicated when you realize that for every router and piece of fiber optic cable, somebody <em>owns</em> that piece of equipment, and wants to get paid for letting you use it.</p>
<p>The way it works is each company builds out their own networks, and then the networks get connected to each other at special places.  So maybe I have my own network, CoolNet, and I run fiber optic cables from Seattle to Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.  Then another company, AwesomeCom, runs a cable from San Francisco to Reno to Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>If you're Kirkland, WA and make a video call (Facetime / skype whatever) to your uncle in Provo, UT, your packets goes through a few networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, it goes through your home WiFi network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then it goes to your ISP's network.  Your ISP has a bunch of cables going from their buildings to their customer's houses, and a cable which goes to Seattle (plus a few backup cables).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once in Seattle, it goes to what's called a &quot;colocation facility&quot;.  It's a building, or maybe a couple floors of an office building, where everybody connects their networks together.  Your ISP has a cable that goes here, and they have a router inside the building.  They rent space from the colocation owner.  The colocation facility has its own little network inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since CoolNet also has cables going to the Seattle colo facility, your packet now goes through CoolNet.  I can't connect you to Provo, but I can send your packet to another colocation facility, this one in San Francisco, CA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now AwesomeCom carries it to a colo facility in Salt Lake City, UT.  (AwesomeCom and CoolNet are both huge networks, so we have a &quot;peering&quot; agreement where we can just send packets through each other's networks for free, since it's good for both of us.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And your uncle's ISP carries it to Provo, UT.</p>
</li>
<li>And your uncle's router will send it to your uncle's iPad or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a business and want a website that's easy to access, a great way to do that is put your computers inside a colocation facility.  That way, your servers will have like 20 internet connections, instead of just one or two, and it will be easy to access.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Network engineer here in the Portland, OR area.</p>
<p>Internationally, you have few grade 1 providers such as L3 networks, XO communications, ATT, Verizon, etc.  Pretty much old school telco providers that have the scratch $ to invest in high speed cabling.  Most of this cabling is fiber optic bundles of a few strands to several thousand strands. Each pair of strands can currently carry up to (theoretical max at this time) 255Tbit per second, but most pairs are currently carrying 100Gbit and are aggregated together into a single connection for trans continental or trans oceanic crossings.</p>
<p>They essentially hop along the shortest path of each respective network from router or Layer 3 switch (which is also a type of router) to the next and often utilize border gateway protocol (BGP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) which is are algorithms that find the shortest paths on networks. BGP is self healing and automatically detects accidental fiber cuts or outages due to hardware failure.</p>
<p>Think of these as &quot;upstream&quot; networks as most international traffic terminates at these types of carriers.</p>
<p>Going down to more the local level, there are usually major network hubs in the world.  Examples of this are:  Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, London, (Fortaleza, Brazil), (Seixal, Portugal), (Mumbai, India), Hong Kong, Tokyo, (Pusan, S. Korea) etc.  There are more worldwide, but I only usually deal with US based carriers as my work only serves US needs since it has to do with a national healthcare network.</p>
<p>These terminate all of these high speed connections to lower level providers like your Comcast, Time Warner, ATT, British Telecom, Telekom, etc. distribute their private and public networks which then resell the upstream bandwidth to individual customers.</p>
<p>Here in Portland specifically, there are roughly 2 single buildings that if, were destroyed would probably knock the whole state of OR offline because almost everything downstream flows through them and are the terminus for most of the networks from CA and WA and far east.</p>
<p>This reselling of bandwith is sometimes done on an oversubscribed method. They sell more than they have. This is where you get into instances of &quot;slow&quot; internet locally and used to happen a lot more than it does now, but is still an issue in a lot of places. The carrier simply does not purchase enough upstream bandwidth to carry all of their customer's data.</p>
<p>This is where caching nodes come in, such as Akamai, Amazon cloud, Microsoft Cloud, Netflix etc.  These are geographically disbursed data centers that basically have local copies of all content on the internet that people are trying to access.  For instance, someone in San Jose, CA wants to Netflix &quot;stranger things&quot; they get it straight from Netflix's data-center near San Jose.  But then Joe in the UK wants to watch it, that data is sent from San Jose to somewhere in London to a cache node at super high speed and then stored there. Joe doesn't notice this but now that it's stored locally in London's cache node, everyone else on that node has access to it without having to make additional pulls from the original and thus slowing down the internet as a whole.</p>
<p>Some 3rd world countries that have extreme restrictions on what their people can access, such as North Korea, use deep packet inspection and firewalls to say what people can access. This also results in them usually only having one single point of internet coming into the country which can be knocked out easily if someone gets out with a backhoe and digs up the fiber cable.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course there is more to it than this, but it gives you an idea of routing and priority.  When visualizing the routing protocols I try to turn it from data packages into real packages (mail), imagine this scenario.  There is a post office at each local, city, region, country.  </p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong>
The example address of  3805 S Keystone Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46227 USA  going to 1400 E Hanna Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46227 USA.</p>
<p>When the letter is given to the clerk at &quot;Indianapolis, IN 46227&quot;.  They recognize that the destination is already from their routing point and just puts the letter back in the out box.  The local mailman knows about &quot;1400 E Hanna Ave&quot; and proceeds to drive to the destination.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong>
The example address of  3805 S Keystone Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46227 USA  going to 87-135 Brompton Rd, Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7XL, UK</p>
<p>The clerk at &quot;Indianapolis, IN 46227&quot; sees this is for a different City and sends it up to state level.  The clerk at &quot;Indiana&quot; sees this is for a different country and sends it up to the National level.  The clerk at &quot;USA&quot; Sees this is for &quot;UK&quot; and then sends it to their routing hub.  From there &quot;England&quot; down to &quot;London&quot;, then finally to &quot;Knightsbridge&quot; Which hands it to the mailman that goes to 87-135 Brompton Rd for delivery.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as the global internet infrastructure is,</p>
<p>A device can connect to the internet and transmit data via an <strong>Internet Service Provider</strong> or <strong>ISP</strong>. Some examples of ISPs would be companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T (these companies provide in the U.S.). These ISPs house their own data communication facilities called <strong>Points of Presence</strong>, or <strong>POPs</strong>, in local regions. These POPs just houses racks of routers and modems. Each POP gathers the data received from local users' devices and transmits this data further out in the internet infrastructure. And this works vice versa - POPs receives data from further out of the internet and sending them to their locally connected devices. The POP's functions are analogous to those of a local post office, but by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem" target="_blank">modems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)" target="_blank">routers</a>.</p>
<p>The physical means for the data to travel between device and POP and then onwards, I'm not sure, but it varies depending on the existing local infrastructure and what the ISP can make use of.</p>
<p>So what happens beyond the POP?<br />
These POPs, which belong to ISPs, are linked together with other POPs from other ISPs (by, again depending on the existing local infrastructure) along with data centers owned by governments and large organizations, at <strong>Internet Exchange Points</strong> or <strong>IXPs</strong>. IXPs houses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch" target="_blank">network switches</a>. Just as POPs are like local post offices, the IXPs are like the larger sorting offices. (No single organization owns an IXP. The ISPs and other participants voluntarily agrees to link together for the sake of serving their customers and lowering costs, practicing what is known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5oe63pOhLI" target="_blank">peering</a> . <strong>You can check out an interactive map of the IXPs around the world by TeleGeography <a href="http://www.internetexchangemap.com/" target="_blank">here</a></strong> </p>
<p>The IXPs are then connected to other IXPs through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone" target="_blank">internet backbones</a>. An internet backbone is made of fiber optic cables serving as principal routes for data to transmit at high capacity. Many of these fiber optic cables - <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/business/a-connected-world/305/" target="_blank">more than 550,000 miles of cable - are buried under sea to connect IXPs worldwide</a>. <strong>You can check out an a interactive map of the undersea fiber optic cables <a href="http://www.submarinecablemap.com/" target="_blank">here</a></strong> also by TeleGeography. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>
<strong>Globally: From device to local Point of Presence(racks of routers and modems) via an Internet Service Provider, to Internet Exchange Point(racks of network switches), to an internet backbone(under sea fiber optic cables), is how information is sent. Then from the internet backbone, it is received at a different IXP, POP, and finally device somewhere else on the globe.</strong></p>
<p>Another key aspect of the internet infrastructure is how the information is sent – for example, a data file is not sent whole like mail. You should look up <strong>I.P. address</strong> and <strong>data packets.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CDs contain what's called &quot;error correction&quot;.</p>
<p>Think of the music as being a string of numbers. These numbers are basically the values of a line graph, which is just the shape of the sound waveform that gets played back. So the first point is a 0, then the next is a 5, then an 8, then a 5, 0, -5, -8, -5, for instance. That's kind of a sine-wave shape that I just estimated. It's typical of a sound wave.</p>
<p>CDs contain that data. But they also contain <em>extra</em> data. There may be some data that says, &quot;the first 3 pieces add up to 13&quot;. This is error correction.</p>
<p>Let's say there's a scratch that renders the first &quot;5&quot; unreadable. Well, we can see there's a 0 and an 8, and the extra info says they should add up to 13. So even though it's partly damaged, we can tell it should be a 5 in the middle.</p>
<p>Additionally, those different pieces of information are intentionally scattered around the disc a bit, so a scratch is unlikely to ruin enough of them at once to make it impossible to recover the missing data.</p>
<p>The actual amount of information and complexity of the error checking algorithm is more complex than this example, for better resistance to missing data, but it's the same basic idea. Extra information to recover damaged portions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: Please refer to the error checking and correction posts. Also, in pressed disks, it's not burned dye that holds the information, but indentations caused by pressing. What's still the same is that damage to the reflective layer is usually more disruptive than damage to the underside of the disk.</p>
<p>That depends on how it is scratched, the sensitivity of the cd player, and the type of data on the CD.</p>
<p>A CD is basically made of four layers, from top to bottom:  </p>
<ul>
<li>a label  </li>
<li>reflective aluminium  </li>
<li>the information layer (dye)  </li>
<li>a protective transparent layer.  </li>
</ul>
<p>When you want to put something on a CD it is translated to a long string of 1s and 0s. Next that information is burned in the information layer: A zero gets a small burn spot, a one doesn't get a burn spot. </p>
<p>When a CD player wants to read the disk, it points a very small laser at the underside of the disk. When the laser hits a black burn spot (a &quot;zero&quot;) the light is absorbed/stopped by that black burn and will never be reflected by the aluminium above. When the laser hits a clear spot (a &quot;one&quot;), the laser goes right through the information layer and gets reflected back by the aluminium.</p>
<p>So, scratches to the upper side of the disk, damaging the reflective aluminium layer, are really bad: When the aluminium is damaged, the laser will never be reflected. Scratches to the underside only cause the disk to skip when it really changes the path of the laser or truly blocks it. So, (deep) scratches on the top side are usually really bad, scratches on the underside may not be as bad.</p>
<p>Whether or not a scratched disk plays also depends on your CD-player. Some are really sensitive and can't handle a slight change in the strength of the light, some can handle it better. When your laser lens is dirty, so that the light level is already lower, the sensitivity to scratches  may also increase(if you begin with less light, you don't have a lot of margin for scratches). </p>
<p>It also depends on the type of data: You can skip a few places with music (missing a few 1s and 0s), but with data (CD-rom) your data is probably &quot;corrupted&quot; (you're missing information that is vital to the program or file; you need every one and zero).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Audio CDs are hideously inefficiently encoded - although to be fair when the standards were being written decent lossless compression (e.g. FLAC) was nowhere to be seen, even good lossy compression (e.g. MP3) was still a way off. So Audio CDs used two channels of 44.1KHz 16-bit raw audio samples, plus some extra error correction and detection bits.</p>
<p>That means that there is a relatively low data density on the disc. The fact that it is error correction <em>and detection</em> means that even if a chunk of data is read and is so badly corrupted that the ECC algorithm cannot fix it, it still knows the data is corrupt.</p>
<p>In audio CD players they had a 0-255 volume level built in and for every uncorrectable sample it turned it down one notch and played the last known good sample again, only turning it back up again when correct data is seen. This led to a gradual turning down of the levels around duff samples rather than a sudden dropout which would have cause an audible 'thump' from the speakers.</p>
<p>This is why even a hole in the disc up to 1/8&quot; could be unheard in the output.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Vesiculus wrote a very comprehensive answer. I'd like to add that audio CDs were designed to handle dirt and scratches: they contain a lot of error-correction data (extra data that's used to reconstruct the original if it wasn't read properly). And many players use oversampling, which reads the same data multiple times (2, 8, or 16 times, possibly more) and uses the result it got the majority of the time.</p>
<p>Also, the orientation of scratches makes a difference. Data is arranged in concentric rings on the disc. Scratches that cross perpendicular to these rings cause only a small amount to damage to each, which is easily correctable. Scratches which are oriented so they wipe out too much consecutive data cause unrecoverable errors. (This is why manufacturers always tell you to wipe discs from the center to the edge.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It's actually very difficult to create a nuclear explosion, and you need some pretty exact conditions for it to go.</p>
<p>Pretty much the worst that could happen is radioactive contamination, and spread of radioactive materials over the local area + radio active particles spread over a much wider area.</p>
<p>Read up on the Chernobyl Disaster if you want an idea.  That wasn't an air-strike, but it was basically caused by an explosion in the reactor.  Effects, assumning your air-strike could actually hit the reactor, would be roughly similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A) The core stays intact, only the cooling is affected: the reaction will be shut down automatically by the control rods and/or loss of coolant(moderator). If sufficient cooling can not be guaranteed, the core might melt and thus release radioactive material to the environment.<br />
Result: Potentially a lot of work cleaning up, especially the molten core. If cooling can be sustained the effects will be minimal.<br />
B) The core is hit directly and &quot;destroyed&quot;: The reaction will break down due to lack of moderator and/or because the fissile material is distributed over a large volume.<br />
Result: Lot of work cleaning up, especially the uranium distributed all over the environment.<br />
It might be easier and &quot;safer&quot; (in terms of guaranteed results) to attack a chemical plant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Anyone who has the ability/technology to conduct a high precision airstrike would probably not do so because it doesn't offer any immediate tactical/strategic advantage. While we are allowed to attack &quot;Works containing dangerous forces&quot; under certain scenarios, it would be more advantageous to either occupy such a facility, or prevent its power from being distributed (such as the infrastructure the power travels along) </p>
<p>The risks associated with an airstrike would outweigh any gain, to any rational military commander. However, and most fortunately, those people who aren't concerned with mass collateral suffering don't have a real capability of causing that much damage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different shapes that planetary nebula can take, and  correspondingly many different ways to explain those shapes. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gz5gz" target="_blank">this</a> image figures a1 to a4 are a schematic representation of the main classes of explanations that have been proposed.  (The following is adapted from <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.astro.40.060401.093849" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set of six schematic diagrams showing possible formation mechanisms. Schematic a.1 GISW model in which an symmetric fast wind from the star expands into a previously ejected slow wind the lies like a torus around the star. The fast wind is then escapes more easily out of the plane of the torus.</p>
<p>Schematic a.2 represents the Magnetized Wind Blown Bubble in which a weakly magnetized fast wind expands into an aspherical density distribution and toroidal magnetic fields (dashed horizontal lines) constrain the outflow and produce jets (arrows) along the axis. </p>
<p>Schematic a.3 represents models with a rapidly rotating central object (a disk and/or a star) that launches a collimated wind. Misalignment of disk and star rotation axis produces multipolar lobes. </p>
<p>Schematic a.4 represents outflows driven by episodic jets where precession of the episodic jet can create the lobes.</p>
<p>Schematic b.1 and b.2 represent processes that can create the toriodal slow wind. In b.1 the source of the slow wind is a common envelope evolution for short period binaries.</p>
<p>Schematic b.2 represents accretion disk formation via Bondi accretion and Roche lobe effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just from looking at the picture I'd guess at the second, where magnetism along with a dense cloud around the equator of the star helps create outgoing jets. It seems like in this case and these jets later hit an even older spherical cloud and are now breaking trough that. It is worth keeping in mind that the central object creating all this is no larger than the other stars in the image, and so the clouds we see are truly huge structures in the sky, about 1.5 light years across. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Because we figured out how. </p>
<p>Cooking meat allows us to extract about 15% more calories from it because of the denatured proteins. Similar for being able to mechanically digest it. </p>
<p>So ground beef that's been cooked to medium has about 25% more effective calories than the same weight of uncooked roast. </p>
<p>That lets humans be the efficient ape. Compared to Chimps (our closest relatives), we've got about the same amount of gut and about half as much jaw for twice the ape. </p>
<p>Cooking food kicks ass. </p>
<p>And this is even skipping over the huge gains that we get from our ability to take &quot;questionable&quot; (read, not really questionable, but almost certainly full of Trichinosis) meat and make it fully safe by sitting it over a smoky fire for a few hours. </p>
<p>Really, it may not be necessary to cook your meat, but it's so much better that it's no wonder the thermivore ape kicked the ever loving shit out of the omnivore apes when it came to competition for environment suitable for living/fucking/fighting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Humans were just the only ones to discover cooking meat prolongs its life and makes it easier to digest,  which in turn allows us to absorb nutrients better.  </p>
<p>You can survive just fine on raw meat. You can't do it on week old raw meat though and our food system is designed so that the majority of meat people have access to or will use is old enough for it to be unsafe or at the very least risky to eat raw (because it's assumed you'll cook it). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So why don't animals get sick from raw meat? Because their immune system is confronted daily by salmonella and stuff.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals mostly lose their regenerative capabilities once their reproductive success rate is significantly dropped. This is because, there is very little selective pressure on genes required for longevity and tissue regeneration after an animal can no longer reproduce and pass on genes. In other words, you might have a perfect set of genes that allow tissue generation and longevity but if those genes cannot grant you reproductive successes, they won't be selected.</p>
<p>Unlike animals trees do not become less successful in reproduction with age. Actually an older tree is larger and can produce far more offspring. So genes required  for tissue regeneration and longevity are selected for those. This is why many trees can live for thousands of years. Yet again mutation accumulate on DNA with time. This eventually wears them down. As a result they are not immortal. But evolution granted them with very long lifespans.</p>
<p>Edit1;According to the comments I wanted to point out that reproductive success does not only depend on the fertility or the ability to find and compete for mates, it is very strongly correlated to general survivability. For instance life span of rats in wild is about 1 year, as a pet rats can live up to 2-3 years and they are fertile and capable of reproducing during that period. Rats in wild have so short lifespans because they have many predators. So a rat is not likely to live much more than a year in wild due to predation even if it's genes would grant it 10 years lifespan. Since rats rarely live beyond a year in wild, they can only reproduce during that period. As a result, only the genes essential for survivability for the first few years are selected by evolution. Now even when we keep rats as pets, they can only go for 2-3 years at max because they lack the mechanisms that allow longevity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>However, there was no such massacre. What <em>actually</em> happened is that in Bowling Green, Kentucky, an FBI agent posing as an Al Qaeda member approached two Iraqi refugees, asking if the two wanted to help him obtain and ship weapons to the extremists back in Iraq. The two men agreed, and obtained weapons illegally, at which point the FBI revealed itself. The two were arrested and the incident prompted a six-month rescreening of all incoming Iraqi refugees. However, it's important to note that at no point was there even a plan or effort to attack US citizens with the weapons, just ship them.</p>
<p>Upon further digging, it's become apparent that Kellyanne Conway has on two other ocassions also referred to this nonexistent massacre, causing people to suspect it was no slip of the tongue but an intentional false presentation of events in order to generate support for President Trump's immigration ban. This is also the same woman who gave us the &quot;altnerative facts&quot; quip, so a lot of the media already considered her a joke. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never happened. Kellyanne Conway, in her zeal to defend the travel ban and &quot;Muslim ban&quot;, said that legislation like this was necessary to prevent another &quot;Bowling Green Massacre&quot;. She's since tried to walk back this claim, stating that she misspoke and meant to say &quot;terrorists&quot;... but it's highly unlikely it was unintentional or just a mere slip of the tongue when you consider this is the same woman who brought us &quot;alternate facts&quot;. She's also made this same claim on at least 2 other occasions, and the word terrorists wouldn't have fit the context of the sentence she was using at the time in this instance. (As far back as 2011, she said in an interview about Obama:  “He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away.” She's also made similar statements on at least 2 other occasions, and has referred more than once to &quot;innocent soldiers&quot; in Bowling Green, KY being killed by terrorists.) </p>
<p>What actually happened was that two potential terrorists (mind you, they had not yet committed any acts of terror on US soil, but they did claim responsibility for attacks on US soldiers in Iraq and were attempting to send money and weapons to Iraq for what we can only presume are the same purposes (attacking US soldiers in Iraq). However, that does not serve to bolster her argument because the ban was purportedly intended to prevent <em>domestic</em> terrorism...so she offered an &quot;alternate facts&quot; version. Which is to say, she lied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
