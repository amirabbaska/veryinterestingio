(Think of buying cereal boxes, each of which has a random coupon at the bottom. How many boxes should you expect to buy until you collect them all?)</p>
<p>There is actually an elegant formula: if there are N coupons (or rolls), then the expected number of attempts is:</p>
<p>N*(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/N)</p>
<p>which, when N = 36, is 150.28. That's pretty close to the result you got from the simulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/uh-okay-I-guess's answer is exactly correct, but when you think of it, you can even understand <em>why</em> N(1 + 1/2 + 1/3.... + 1/N) is the number of attempts needed.</p>
<p>It becomes easier if instead of looking at the number of rolls as a whole, you add up the average number of rolls to &quot;move&quot; from a number of combinations remaining to one less combination remaining.</p>
<p>The first term is number of tries needed to move from 36 combinations remaining to 35. The second is the number of tries needed to move from 35 to 34... and so on until the last term you're looking at is the average number of rolls needed to get the one remaining combination.</p>
<p>The first event always needs exactly 1 try, because everything you try always works. For the second one though, you have a 35/36  chance of getting it right each time you try, so you need on average 36/35 tries (because 36/35 tries * 35/36 likelihood = 1).</p>
<p>The pattern continues. For the third event you have 34/36 good outcomes, and hence expected 36/34 tries on average.</p>
<p>You're going to see this follows the pattern 36/36 + 36/35 + 36/34 + ..... 36/1 = 36(1/36 + 1/35 .... + 1), which is exactly the formula given.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have already pointed out, this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem" target="_blank">coupon collector's problem</a>, where the expected number of rolls (coupons) to get all n=36 equally likely rolls is</p>
<pre><code>n * (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n)</code></pre>
<p>or about 150.284 rolls.</p>
<p>(I find it interesting that the Wikipedia link starts out by asking not for the <em>average</em> number of rolls, but the cumulative probability distribution: &quot;What is the probability that more than t sample trials are needed to collect all n coupons?&quot; ... then goes on to never answer that question.  More on that shortly.)</p>
<p>Others have already asked what I think is actually the more natural problem here: suppose that we are only concerned with the <em>total</em> of the roll of the two (identical) dice, then what is the expected number of rolls to observe all totals from 2 through 12?  This problem is harder, since the individual outcomes are not equally likely.  One of several ways to approach this is using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle" target="_blank">inclusion-exclusion principle</a>, an alternating summation over each possible subset of roll totals, like this (in Mathematica source code):</p>
<pre><code>f[p_List] :=
 Total@Map[
   (-1)^(Length[#] - 1)/Total[#] &amp;,
   Subsets[p, {1, Length[p]}]]</code></pre>
<p>which for the non-uniform distribution of roll totals 2 through 12 with 2 dice yields an average of about 61.2174 rolls.  (This is also the idea behind computing the CDF for the equally likely case.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many such hotels/motels change their business model from nightly visitors to long-term weekly and monthly rentals. This way, they can receive a steady income from people who are either in the zone where they cannot afford the financial basics to obtain a rental home or apartment; from people who are traveling for work and who need an inexpensive place to stay while on short-term long term projects; or from people whose interest it is maintaining a low profile due to past criminal convictions or current criminal activities.</p>
<p>Since the motel properties are usually paid for, any monies that the owners receive is profit. Since minimal maintenance upkeep is often what is done by the motel and non-paying clientele are quickly evicted (in some states, such residents don't receive the same protections that regular renters do) the owners can earn hefty profits while garnering minimal expenditures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of those old motels were built during the early days of highway travel, but before the Interstate system. Think Route 66. Cars of the day ('30s to '60s) didn't get good mileage and most cars couldn't do 65 or 75 for extended periods, if at all. Back in the day, there was a big price difference between motels/motor courts and hotels. That line has become a little fuzzier over the years. </p>
<p>Here in Albuquerque we still have a few old Route 66 motels, but they are mostly populated with prostitutes/johns, drug dealers, temp workers trying to maximize their per diem, long term residents who can't qualify for an apartment or just choose to stay off the grid for various reasons. And of course, very frugal travelers who don't care about anything but price. </p>
<p>Many of those old motels were passed down to children and grand-children who didn't really care about the legacy. They either hired a manager on the cheap or sold the property at a deep discount for a quick cash out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have been pissed off about the recent developments though and as a programmer with time on his hands I was thinking of ways I might contribute to subversion of this bullshit.</p>
<p>I think one prong of a multi-pronged solution for the people would be to devalue the data by essentially corrupting it.</p>
<p>Developers would create &quot;pseudo-browsers&quot; or &quot;distorters&quot;. You would load these with personally identifiable info that you are looking to devalue.</p>
<p>These automated browser processes would then bumble about the web using various scripts and redirects architected to basically trash the economic value of the associated 'profile' by intentionally making requests that make the data look suspect/fake and making it difficult to separate &quot;real&quot; user requests from those of their &quot;browser-history distorter&quot;.</p>
<p>IE:
NRA: We'd like to buy a list of users who are into guns.
ISP: $XXXXX.XX, thanks!
NRA: Hey wait, all of these gun lovers seem to be into Hillary Clinton??? And sites about cross-dressing? WTF?</p>
<p>These subversive browsers would really only need to accomplish the goal of making all their users' histories appear more or less the same by making their history more puff than real stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Occasionally, it will be hidden to protect other classified data as well, which is likely why the recent 9/11 pictures came out.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so say there was a big ol' terrorist attack in the US and a lot of people died.  The country wants a detailed investigation into what happened to find out who did it and why.  You work for the FBI and need to track down that info.  You call up people all over the world.  Finally, you land a lead from a CIA agent in Pakistan.  He points you to a couple of people he knows who may have some info.  You track them down and get what you need to pin the attack on a bunch of Dbags living in the US that played a role in the attacks.  You wiretap said dbags, track their cell phones, and then freeze their bank accounts.  Finally you arrest them and it's time for a public trial.  Hold up though!  You don't want your sources to be uncovered.  The CIA agent is a mole in Pakistani intelligence and it would totally cause an international incident if his ID was leaked.  The agent's sources are close to the terrorist cell that carried out the attack.  You don't want to blow their cover either.   You also don't want to disclose exactly how you managed to track the suspects because you don't want other nations to know the government's spy capabilities.  So you classify the info, that way the sources are protected and so is the US gov's spy capabilities.</p>
<p>You start to feel good.  You can take the dbags to trial and know that the country's interests are protected.  Then you look at the 1000's of pictures that were taken.  It just so happens that the site of the attack was in an office building owned by the government where a lot of sensitive information was stored.  Well, you don't want to expose anything about the construction of the building that may show architectural flaws or its physical security, or may show sensitive documents, or show any computer servers.  Then there are the pictures of the dead and injured.  The press already has a bunch of pictures they took; nothing you can do there.  But you don't want to show the most gruesome stuff because you don't want to upset the public or inflame tensions with anyone.  You also find a bunch of info on the victims that would infringe on their privacy were it to go public.  So you classify all that too.</p>
<p>25 years pass.  Your CIA agent is now retired.  The agent's sources have been granted asylum in the US.  The building that was attacked is no longer being used by the govt and the govt agency that used it has relocated to a new, better building.  The technology in the pictures is hugely outdated.  You decide that the public can learn a bit more about the attacks and investigation because it won't really affect any US government interests any more.  You declassify the info.</p>
<p>You also decide that you're still not going to release a bunch of docs because they contain private information about a bunch of people who are still alive.  It would totally infringe on their right to privacy and wasn't really relevant to the investigation anyways.  There are also some documents you have about the spy project in Pakistan, which is still ongoing even though your spy friend retired.  You decide to keep that stuff classified.  You can always try declassifying it again in 25 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/speakerToHeathens" target="_blank">u/speakerToHeathens</a> is correct that with equal pressure inside and outside your body you would have no difficulty breathing.  </p>
<p>As far as poisoning goes, while you wouldn't be underwater, using SCUBA dive tables are still very applicable.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mide.com/pages/air-pressure-at-altitude-calculator" target="_blank">Using this calculator</a> The pressure at -5000' is less than 1.2 atmospheres. (or 20% more than at sea level)  <a href="http://www.calctool.org/CALC/other/games/depth_press" target="_blank">&amp; using this calculator</a> we see that 1.2 atm is equivalent to about 6.5' under water.  When you compare this to <a href="http://www.scubadiverinfo.com/2_divetables.html" target="_blank">standard scuba diver tables</a> you see that they do not even start until 35-40 ft.  This is because diving at such shallow depths has no real effect and so you can stay there indefinitely.</p>
<p>Now lets say your valley was -33,000 ft. below sea level. (equivalent to 64 ft. under water)   At that point, you wouldn't want to take a rocket high speed elevator ride back to the top as you might get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness" target="_blank">the bends aka decompression sickness</a> but if you took a regular elevator you would be fine.</p>
<p>NOT Until  -65,000 ft. below sea level (equivalent to 200 ft. underwater) would your valley become a concern, as you would be in danger of experiencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity" target="_blank">Oxygen Poisoning</a>  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The atmospheric pressure does not cause any obvious problems.

<p>There are some graphs that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atmospheric_Pressure_vs._Altitude.png" target="_blank">associate air pressure with altitude</a>. There is a formula but I'm done with Maths for today so I will do a estimate of a regression by eye.</p>
<p>At -5000', or around 1550 meters below, Air pressure should be around 120KPa of pressure, that's around 1.2 atmospheres.</p>
<p>That's nothing. You will probably be better at endurance because you would be breathing more oxygen than usual.</p>
<p>I don't know about oxygen poisoning, I will risk to say that you would end up fine if you stayed there for 1 or 2 hours. More than that I don't know (I need to know the values for the amount of oxygen needed to warm you, absortion rate and concentration of oxygen at that pressure).</p>
<p>EDIT: Changed pressure from 140Kpa to 120Kpa, I read the graph in the wrong way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the short answer to your question would be maybe.
there is something called reverse altitude sickness and it has to do with your body not acclimatizing well enough. when breathing below sea level, the partial pressure of O2 is increased however, your hemoglobin saturation does not increase to any significant usable level because at normal elevation your hemoglobin is already very well saturated with oxygen (~97% saturated). only thing that might make a difference is that now at increased pressure, you will have some oxygen dissolved in plasma (which normally doesn't occur at normal atmospheric pressure).
if coming from sea level and going down, you wouldn't normally feel any difference in breathing. however, if coming from high altitude to low altitude, you would feel a change in breathing based on your speed of descent
so really it all depends on how fast you are changing altitude. once your body acclimatize to change in atmospheric pressure, you will be fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a career paid Fireman. The best way to simplify it is to say that we do not ALWAYS enter a burning structure. There are quite a few common sense reasons that are a definite no go for us (such as flames through the roof, indicating a high probability for collapse on most residential fires). If there is a possibility that we can enter the structure, the incident commander has to make a decision which comes down to &quot;risk a little to save a little, risk a lot to save a lot&quot;. If there is any chance that a VIABLE human life is inside, you can guarantee that every firefighter on the scene would risk their life without question to save the person inside. The big word there being viable. Most of the time the toxic chemicals produced by modern manufacturing give off super heated and immediately deadly fumes that can kill you after only a few breaths. We have to take that into account and will not risk as much to recover someone who has without a doubt perished. Our next goal is to save property that can be saved. Family photos and heirlooms are irreplaceable and we make every effort to minimize your loss. If I can read the conditions of the fire and make a direct attack inside the house right at the seat of the fire, it extinguishes the fire quicker, preventing extension and also limiting damage from water being shot in through Windows. Most of our nozzles put out at least 200 gallons per minute. That is a lot if water to put inside your house blindly through a window. Most kitchen fires could probably be extinguished with less than 30 gallons if there is no extension into the walls/roof. Also as others have said, there are a lot of times you can't be certain that the building is unoccupied. A lot of accidental fires happen because squatters light &quot;camp fires&quot; in abandoned buildings to keep warm. They have a right to be saved and us not completing a search of the building (conditions permitting) would be negligent. In residential buildings we keep our eye out for indicators of people that would occupy the structure. For instance if there is a car in the driveway then someone was likely home. Or if there are small children's toys in the yard or house then we automatically assume the possibility that we need to account for children. Sorry for any typos, I'm on mobile. Hope this helps answer your question. If you take anything away from this, just know that if there is a possibility for me or any of the firefighters I know to save a life, we will fight until our last breath to get you out safely.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firefighter here. ELI5 version: Because even a partially burned building is still worth money.</p>
<p>Long version:<br />
If the building is truly empty/unoccupied, with no buildings around it, depending on the age and condition of the structure pre-fire, many times, it will be left to burn. As long as there is some value to the structure and contents post-fire, we'll try our best to contain and extinguish the fire. </p>
<p>There's a lot of factors that go into whether to let it burn or to try and put it out. If only one room is involved, the rest of the house is still good, and we'll put the fire out in that room, then check to see how far it's extended into the rest of the house. The more we can save of the structure and contents, the better. </p>
<p>If the fire is blowing out every window and door, then we know that the structure is unsafe for us to enter. There are some structures that are unsafe for us to enter because the Fire Inspectors have already done an inspection, and determined that the building is unsafe, and marked it as such on the building itself, and on pre-plan documents.</p>
<p>When we're putting a fire out, we try to do our best to save the contents, either by removing them or covering them before we start squirting water and tearing up walls and ceilings. We try to only use as much water and tear up as few walls and ceilings as necessary to put the fire out and make sure it hasn't spread. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firefighter here, like mentioned above there are multiple ways we deal with structure fires.</p>
<p>1: Defensive attack- Just like it says, we're defending. The building/structure/ ect. has no individuals or life inside of it and is so engulfed in flames that  it's unsafe for us to go in. So we set up hoses/aerial hoses (ladder trucks)/ etc around the house to extinguish if from the outside. Also, we constantly water down adjacent houses and tree lines to prevent the fire from spreading (radiant heat warms things up quickly when its thousands of degrees). Practically, we're just controlling the demolition of a house by fire, with a primary goal of attempting to extinguish it completely.</p>
<p>2: Offensive- Just like it sounds again.  We're going in and trying to put it out from the source. This takes place when we have the ABILITY to, such as when the fire is still in the intial phases of growing and not like the scene from spidey 1 where the entire apartment complex is engulfed. I could elaborate more if you so desire, but i hope this amswers your question directly in the simplest way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The UN has this thing called the <a href="http://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/en/treecounter/our-target" target="_blank">Billion Tree Campaign</a>. As you can see, they claim to have already planted 14.2 billion trees.</p>
<p>But it gets interesting. As you can also see from that site, they want to plant <em>One Trillion</em> trees. Why is the goal of the &quot;Billion Tree Campaign&quot; to plant a trillion trees, you ask? Because nine years after the campaign was started, scientists discovered <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/02/scientists-discover-that-the-world-contains-dramatically-more-trees-than-previously-thought/?utm_term=.289b44da5070" target="_blank">the planet is home to 3.04 trillion trees, blowing away the previous estimate of 400 billion.</a></p>
<p>That said, <a href="http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0000322.html" target="_blank">algae is our best source of photosynthesis</a>. So combined with the facts there are literally already trillions of trees and that trees take up a lot more space than algae, planting more trees is not the best approach to curb global warming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a similar question posted earlier: One of the best carbon-capturing trees is the Silver Maple. It can scrub 25,000 pounds of carbon in a 55-year useful lifespan (454.55 pounds per year). Coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania (a moderate producer of CO2 from coal) produce 136 million tons of CO2 annually. This equates to 37,057,220.7 tons of carbon. (Atomic weight of carbon=12, of CO2=44). Now do the math. 37,057,220.7 tons / 454.55 lbs = 163,050,141 silver maple trees. For reforestation purposes, it's recommended you plant between 726 and 435 trees per acre. Using the average spacing, that's about 680 trees per acre. So to cancel Pennsylvania's annual coal-fired carbon, you'd need 239,779.61 acres of silver maple trees. Which is about 374 square miles (.31 Rhode Islands).    </p>
<p>Oh, The National Arbor Day Foundation sells Silver Maples for $6.98 each. You'd need to budget $1,138,089,984.18 for the project, not counting the cost of the land.</p>

<p>1 - the atmosphere</p>
<p>2 - the biosphere and </p>
<p>3 - sub surface</p>
<p>we are pulling the carbon out of the subsurface bucket and placing it in the other two buckets. Planting trees may help to remove carbon from the atmosphere but it only stores the carbon for a short period of time. trees die, burn, etc, and release that carbon back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>the main way carbon is removed from the atmosphere is the oceans. phytoplankton removes the carbon and when it dies, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean, is compressed and due to plate tectonics is slowly submerged underground. this is obviously a very slow process. thus, the only real method to reduce carbon emission in the long term at our disposal is to either stop pulling it out of the ground or else find a reliable, long term method to get it back into the ground.</p>

Planting trees as well regenerative farming practices for soil depletion as well as algae  are our answers to global warming. As far as just planting trees is concerned you don't just need to plant them you need to cut them down too this is sequestering carbon and storing it in items that we can use. Trees are the most green renewable energy. Some things being made/synthesized from wood (I went to a woodlot confrence the other day) : jet feul, fibreglass, biomass, feul wood. Wood is also the second most stable solution to heating your home. More wood we use the better. sustainable forestry has been around for hundreds of years we just don't practice it efficiently enough and cleary do not care about our planet.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A lot of ad services specifically will not advertise &quot;adult content&quot;. This is for a number of reasons, but one is that most sites don't want to be seen with that kind of advert.</p>
<p>For the same reason, most advertisers will go to ad services that prohibit use on 'adult' websites. This is what really leads to the difference in ads on adult and non-adult sites.</p>
<p>You won't likely see any ads for 'horny girls in your area' where you hadn't before, because they aren't really targeted at anyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way Internet Service Providers are gathering your internet history is by simply tracking what websites you request and what is delivered to your network. If you request to see google.com then the ISP will see your request and route the traffic accordingly. And now they log that you requested google.com and can legally sell that to anyone buying. If they can see which individual computer is the one requesting the website is another story. It depends on how far ISPs implement in order to gather your history. If they have router access, Which is likely, than they can see which specific computer requested to see those luscious videos. </p>
<p>I believe this is a logical concern. But I do not think it will be a problem. As ISPs will likely have some sort of identifier (Say a local IP or MAC Address) for who wanted the traffic and target that person individually. It wouldn't make sense if sharon wanted shoes and they send bob some lovely coupons on his next pair of high heels. The targeted advertising wouldn't be effective then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different countries have different ways of writing their currency symbols. Some write it before the number, some after. Generally, people write it a certain way because that's how people before them wrote it. In the US we write the sign before the number because that's how the British wrote the pound sign before us.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to writing the $ before the number. It makes it harder for forgers to modify numbers. You can't change $100 to $2100 by adding a number because there's a dollar sign in the way. Also it's easy to read the difference between dollars and cents on a sign, because the cent sign is written after the number. It's written like $3 and 50¢. Also if you wrote an amount as a decimal, 3.50$ the dollar sign is next to the cents values, and that could get confusing. </p>
<p>But there is little to no evidence that any of these were the reason that way of writing currencies became standard. Language, symbols, and writing systems are constantly evolving, and their origins are too old to know with any certainty. People tend to keep doing what was done before unless there is a good reason to change. That's why we write the dollar sign before the number. Any more specific explanation is speculation at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The US uses the English convention for writing currency symbols: the symbol of the primary currency unit goes before the number. So it's not just $50 but also £50, €50, ¥50 etc. Other languages do this differently, so saying that it's to reduce forgery seems like pure speculation: there is no good reason to suppose that only English-speaking businessmen saw a greater need to reduce forgery in this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
