		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer? It can be.</p>
<p>But we know the water is contaminated, and possibly leaking off-site. Using contaminated water makes the potential leaking water more dangerous. (Even if it's a tiny change) It's also a bad image for Tepco. &quot;Trpco skipping proper disposal of waste water by pouring it out onsite.&quot;</p>
<p>Safe and unsafe levels are defined by amount/volume. For anything. Rat poop in your food. Chemical waste. Rad waste. To make water safe for dumping, you filter it, dilute it, then dump it in the ocean far from land, which does more dilution. How much work before dumping is usually based off of legal standards for country of origin, which may or may not have a scientific backing.</p>
<p>All forms of liquid waste have this problem, but nuclear is worse. Chemical waste can be cleaned chemically and mechanically. Rad waste can need a centrifuge to ensure you pick up all the isotopes. Heavy water is still water, chemically speaking. So a chemical rreaction won't remove it. Ditto for any other isotope of a normally safe element. Some like cesium or lead are easy. They're bad, whether active or not.</p>
<p>Rad waste is also politically more sensitive. Everyone always thinks of fuel pins and control rods. But a ton of waste is low level stuff that's legally classified as waste because of where it was used. Like paper towels or brooms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From my understanding, the water is being recirced from the lower levels of the plant and is being reused for cooling. The liquid waste is being processed to levels that under normal scenarios would be directly releasable to the environment. Most isotopes can be reduced to below detectable levels. Tritium, of course is the one that would remain as it can't be removed without extraordinary equipment and costs. </p>
<p>However, due to the sensitivity of the situation, release of the water, regardless of how well treated has become difficult to be released. If you measure a liquid long enough, you can eventually find some dose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That water could totally be reused. It could (and probably should) also just be dumped into the ocean. The transuranics and fission fragments (i.e. the nasty stuff) are already getting filtered before storage. The stored water is lightly (and I mean really lightly) radioactive due to the presence of tritium. Tritium is probably the least dangerous and conversely, hardest to contain, radioactive material in the world. It has a super low biological half-life (the time something stays in your body) and a very low energy decay. It also likes to changes places with any hydrogen isotope it finds (thus the containment).However, releasing any radioactive material is politically charged, especially when it comes to tritium. From a pure safety stand point, I wouldn’t be bothered if I was to drink or bath in that water. My cancer risk would not change in any detectable way. Once you dump it, or let it leak or whatever, the ocean will dilute it so much that it will essentially be gone. In addition, the ocean is full of naturally occurring radioactive material that will completely overwhelm the presence of a little extra tritium. </p>
<p>You also might wonder about extracting it. Some other posters have addressed that extracting tritium is SUPER hard from normal water. We can separate heavy water with centrifuges or preferential chemistry (the heavy isotope reacts a little tiny bit slower) but that also relies on “large” amounts being present for viability. In this case there is not much tritium there (per liter) so it will be very tricky and expensive to separate. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don’t remember the exact situation of the reactor, but the stoppage of coolant circulation was due to the failure of the primary pump/turbine cooling system from backflow of multiphase fluid instead of pure steam (combining any non-gas with turbines is a bad idea). This primary pump failure is what lead to the backup RCIC turbine/pump system being used, and that’s what I’m involved with in some of my research. The interesting thing is that the RCIC system was rated to run for like 8 hours tops in an emergency but ended up holding out for close to 3 days. That’s why we’re researching this system, to possibly reevaluate the rating on the max operation time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe that is the reason why they can’t circulate that water currently, and installation of a new pump system is a little out of the question. Add that to the fact that there are areas where leakage is a big factor, and it becomes an issue of contamination control management. You can't just circulate this water if it's going to be leaking externally for a whole host of other reasons.</p>
<p>Apologies if this is a little vague, it’s not really my area of expertise. I just know the basic background because of what I’m working in.</p>
<p>Edit: Here are some sources for brief overviews if you're interested in a background of the system. I will dig up some papers that might be relevant to the subject as well.</p>

This heat gets converted to electric energy by something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">Seebeck Effect</a>. This is the phenomenon where you join two dissimilar metals together then apply heat to the junction which will produce a small DC voltage across the junction.  If you stack thousands of these junctions together you will obtain significant voltage. </p>
<p>The same effect can be exploited in reverse to cool things like electronics. The device that does this is called a Peltier Cooler. It consists of thousands of these thermal junctions made up of dissimilar metals just like the Voyager RTGs. If you apply current trough it one side will get hot and the other side will get cold. Same thing works in reverse, if you apply heat to one side you will get some voltage across the device.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough the earliest of these devices were in vogue during the tube radio era. There were<a href="http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/thermoelectric/thermoelectric.htm#rl" target="_blank"> thermoelectric</a> generators you could attach to an oil lamp and that would be enough to power your radio as well as light up your room.

which convert a temperature gradient into an electrical voltage via the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect/" target="_blank">thermoelectric effect</a>.</p>
<p>Each RTG contained about 4.5 kg of Pu^238 in the form of 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres which initially generated 2400 W (thermal). Conversion of this decay heat to electrical power uses 312 silicon-germanium thermocouples with a temperature gradient (initially)  of 700° C.

About one half of a Pu^238 half-life has elapsed since launch, meaning around 70% of the plutonium remains.

As long as it is soft underneath, the blood has a place to go. So the bruise stays soft. If it is hard, because there is bone underneath, then it will push up. Skin can stretch, but only so much. So when skin can’t stretch anymore, the bruise will feel hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In the skin the damage that occurs is in the soft tissues and the blood diffuses through it like ink on wet paper. When you bump your head, you bleed in a potential space between bone and a thick canvas like material called the Galeal sheath. You then created a balloon of canvas and it’s really hard. All bones have a similar sheath called periosteum. As you heal, the blood either diffuses away and you return to normal or calcifies and becomes a callus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Complicated answer already provided.  Simpler to understand answer:  </p>
<p>We haven't identified any combination of particles that form a proton when combined, and have a lower total rest mass than a proton when separate.  So we have no reason to believe you can get energy from splitting a proton.</p>
<p>For splitting particles and nuclei, you can only get energy from &quot;splitting&quot; when the rest mass energy of the products is less than the rest mass energy of the initial particle or nucleus.  The difference between the two is what you get as energy release.  For instance, the sum of the rest mass of a proton plus a neutron is a little more than rest mass of a deuterium (proton+neutron bound together) so splitting a deuterium into a proton and neutron takes energy instead of releasing energy.   Two separate deuteriums have a total rest mass a little higher than a helium-4, etc.  That trend continues (roughly) until you happen to hit iron-56 (26 protons and 30 neutrons), where it starts to be the other way around for complicated reasons.  So, you can release energy by splitting a uranium into two lighter atoms because the sum of the mass of the two lighter atoms is less than the mass of the starting uranium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No; we cannot <strong>split</strong> a proton, to create energy.</p>
<p>Protons are bound by the strong force, and with the binding comes a potential energy. In fact we see that energy manifest in the mass of a proton - the total mass of individual constituent quarks is less than that of the proton. In case you hadn't heard this before, protons are made up of 3 quarks (2 up and 1 down). So if you could split a proton then that energy (as extra mass for example) would be released.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement" target="_blank">Quark (colour) confinement</a>, however, says that essentially we can never see or have isolated quarks. In other words quarks HAVE to stick together and form a baryon - mesons and hadrons. For a start, the strong force being very strong and attractive at very short ranges - this is due to the term +kr (and note the r dependence not 1/r) in the strong force potential, where r is the radius/separation and k is called the <em>string tension.</em> So qualitatively you might start seeing why it's hard; it's in fact impossible.</p>
<p>In a hadron - say a proton - the quarks are bound together by <em>gluon tubes</em> , which is essentially just a bunch of gluons travelling back and forth between the quarks. The gluons (and quarks) have non-zero colour charge (e.g. red-anti-blue or green-anti-red, where something like red-anti-red is neutral colour). But because gluons have colour, as you separate the two quarks, the gluon tubes get stretched and start to narrow. This happens more and more until enough energy is released that the tubes snap and immediately form a quark-anti-quark pair, with each particle of the pair instantly being attracted to and bound to the original pair of two quarks. This is so that the net color charge is zero - the strong force really loves to keep things colorless.</p>
<p>Thus if we could split a proton, there would be a lot of energy released, but it is impossible.</p>
<p>EDIT: Let me clarify: splitting protons <strong>into constituent quarks</strong> is impossible. Proton decays and interactions occur, where protons will turn into other subatomic particles e.g. the proton decay into neutron, electron, anti-neutrino.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The monochromatic-ness is easy to achieve, just use a source which produces only one wavelength of light.</p>
<p>For the constant phase difference, a single slit was often used before the gratings, or double slit, or whatever equipment the experiment was using. This works because the single slit acts as a point source, and therefore, as long as it is not moving relative to the other  gratings/slits, will mean there is a constant phase difference between the sources.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in graduate school we discussed Young's two slit experiment in some detail. It turns out that what we discussed was not exactly on the mark with what wikipedia says on the topic:</p>
<p>&quot;Strictly speaking, there was no double slit in the original experiment as described by Young. Instead, the sunlight reflected off a steering mirror passed through a small hole in a paper, and the resulting thin light beam was then split in half alongside a paper card&quot;</p>
<p>Both the discussion we had in grad school and the wikipedia entry have one thing in common: the source was sunlight. Sunlight illuminates a small hole or a slit. At some distance from this hole/slit the &quot;light source&quot; originating from the hole/slit is now spatially coherent. That is to say, the light waves at different points in space have consistent phase relationships. When we talk about these experiments it is that &quot;spatial coherence&quot; that matters as it allows the observer to see the diffraction pattern. </p>
<p>Lasers create light that is both spatially coherent and temporally coherent. That is, the phase of light at a single point in space is highly consistent, in addition to the phases at different points in space being highly consistent.</p>
<p>Diffraction can be observed with spatially coherent light. To see speckle though one needs temporally coherent light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I’m realizing my question is actually more specifically “Why does 2° matter so much when the temperature outside varies by far more than that every afternoon?”</p>
<p>I understand that it has impacts with the ocean and butterfly effects. I’m just not quite understanding <em>how</em> it’s so devastating, when 2° seems like such a small shift I would barely even feel it. Just from the nature of seasonal change, I’d think the world is able to cope with such minor degree shifts. </p>
<p>It’s not like a human body where a tiny change becomes an uncomfortable fever. The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon. </p>

<p>===========</p>
<p><strong>Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3</strong>
I need to go to sleep. I wasn’t expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I’ve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning. </p>
<p>Main things I’ve learned, based on Redditors’ comments, for those just joining:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Average global temp</strong> is neither <em>local weather outside</em>, nor is it <em>weather on a particular day</em>. It is the <em>average weather for the year across the globe.</em> Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2° warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can’t handle 2° warmer <em>average global weather.</em> They are not the same. For context, <a href="https://xkcd.com/1732/" target="_blank">here is an XKCD</a> explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4° less than it is today. The &quot;little ice age&quot; was just ~1-2° colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of <em>average global temp</em>, since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. <strong>This is what was confusing me.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could’ve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The change in global average (not 2° local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue is not the 2° warmer temp. It is that those 2° could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2° difference can quickly become 20°. The 2° may be our event horizon. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I’m being told that <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth" target="_blank">higher C02 is <em>better</em> for plants</a>, and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I’m still unclear on the details here.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A major part of the issue is the timing. It’s not just that it’s happening, it’s that it’s happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There’s no time for life to adapt to the new conditions. </p>
</li>
<li>We don’t actually know exactly what will happen because it’s impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today.</li>
</ul></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about the temperature getting a few degrees warmer. An effect of rising CO2 levels is that the global average temperature will get a few degrees warmer. That average temperature increase is a benchmark only, not the problem in and of itself. It's the other effects of the same root cause of increasing CO2 levels that are a problem.</p>
<p>The earth is a giant thermodynamic engine that takes in energy in higher amounts near the equator where solar gain is greater than heat radiated back into space, and funnels it to the poles, where solar gain is less than heat radiated to space. CO2 acts like a blanket over the system, keeping more heat in, but the equatorial zones don't heat much, they just shuttle that extra heat to the poles through ocean and wind currents. The same air currents also shuttle CO2 up to the poles, as can be seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04" target="_blank">this NASA model</a>, which further reduces heat radiated back into space at the poles. This means that the poles are heating up a lot more than 2 degrees C. More like 10.</p>
<p>The bulk of earth's frozen water is at the poles, so this rise of several degrees Celsius in the polar regions will melt a significant amount of land based ice, raising sea levels. This is going to cost trillions of dollars to either preemptively try to deal with or as flood damage.</p>
<p>In addition, CO2 in the atmosphere is also absorbed into the oceans. As the CO2 levels in the ocean rise, the oceans acidify, due to the creation of carbonic acid, the same acid in your carbonated soda. You may have seen of heard of people dissolving baby teeth in a can of coke, and the same thing happens to carbonaceous minerals in acidified ocean water. So organisms with calcium carbonate shells like shellfish and coral grow slower and will likely soon reach the point where their structures are dissolving faster than they grow. This kicks the legs out of the base of the ocean's food web, and will largely collapse ocean life in near shore areas with the exception of algae and jellyfish.</p>
<p>Finally, since the earth is currently being shifted out of equilibrium, the weather patterns are behaving like a top that is starting to topple, with extreme systems swinging across the globe. We are getting high pressure systems that park themselves over an area for weeks at a time, blasting the area with heat. In the ocean, this can kill corals, and much of the earth's coral reefs are already dying off as a result of these extended heat waves. Over land they reduce crop yields and can kill people. We have a circumpolar band of wind called the polar vortex that will start to meander, bringing snow to Florida and dropping temperatures across the Eastern US by 10-15 degrees C below normal in the middle of winter for weeks at a time, killing native plants and animals that aren't adapted to being able to survive that kind of cold for that long. These shifting weather patterns also change climate in areas, such that some areas will see extended drought such that there will no longer be enough water for the people that currently live there. In other areas, heavier rainfall increase flooding and landslide events, which cause millions to billions of dollars of damage to communities and kill people.</p>
<p>Any time the world goes through a climactic shift, it becomes less habitable to the species that were adapted to the old patterns. Because of the interconnectedness of ecosystems, these effects ripple in a positive feedback loop that drives up extinction rates in a runaway process that can radically alter the biome. This is not good for humans in the short run or the long run.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerdy anecdote for people who like numerical modeling and/or environmental engineering. It's relevant I swear.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In my civil engineering undergrad program we had to learn Matlab and the course-length model we built was of a real mountain in the Sierra Nevada range. At first it was just an (x,y,z) matrix representing a topographic map, but then we started adding in factors like slope (theta x, theta y, theta z), precipitation, solar insolation, etc. Between the decent visualizations and all the data/code, we ended up with a plausible model of snow cover (depth and extent) on a mountain over the course of a year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The baseline model still had bits of snow on northern slopes pretty late into the year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Running the model with each day's average temperature bumped up by just a degree or two (I forget if we used Celsius or Fahrenheit) was noticeably different in the visualizations. The snow melted more quickly, and less snow accumulated before the melt season began. When considering how important snowmelt is economically... kinda scary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sand is primarily derived from weathering of Cretaceous sandstones in North Africa. When these sandstones were deposited in the Cretaceous, the area where they are now was a shallow sea. The original source of the sand was the large mountain ranges that still exist in the central part of the Sahara. These mountains are volcanic and intrusive, and the granite rock weathers out to leave behind quartz sand grains that are carried by rivers to the sea. These sand deposits eventually formed into sandstone, and as they were uplifted began to weather and break down into sand again.</p>
<p>Only about 10% of the Sahara is actually covered by sand, and parts of the Sahara are in fact covered by soil. More than half of the area comprises soils known as yermosols, with shallow profiles over gravel or pebble beds. These soils have been developing over the past 50 million years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's definitely a day worth celebrating - after all, hydrogen and fuel cells are the perfect partners for clean, fuel-efficient transportation and a secure energy future. Here at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, we've pushed the frontiers of hydrogen and fuel cell research. In the area of electrocatalysis, we've developed a new molybdenum phosphide-based non-platinum group metal catalyst that has 5 times greater performance over similar current catalysts and improved results over platinum catalysts for microbial electrolysis. We've also invented a new design for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction that integrates flow values to enable startup from room temperature as well as optimized operation. And our Chemical Transformations Initiative is allowing us to transform wastes into useful products like aviation fuels, while generating hydrogen gas at the same time. </p>
<p>We'll be on at 12:30 PT (3:30 ET, 20:30 UT), ask us anything!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is one of the most complex machines ever built. Basically every component there has been developed specifically for ITER and there is a huge number of them. The tools to build them have to be developed. The parts have to be built - often one by one. Everything has to be tested, first in isolation and then as part of larger subsystems, and then the subsystems together, and so on. If something doesn't work the scientists have to find the reason and fix it. Even it works you have to analyze the data from tests to verify that everything works. All that takes years.</p>
<p>If no further delays come up until 2025 the scientists might be confident that they can create a first plasma by then. Probably with a low number of particles and at a low temperature. Probably with helium instead of hydrogen as that is easier. Then they will look at the results from that - is everything still as expected? Probably some machine parameters need adjustment. Then you have to test the new parameters. Probably over multiple iterations. After a while the machine is understood well enough to use normal hydrogen. Then deuterium. Then deuterium at slowly increasing density and temperature. And so on.</p>
<p>Most of ITER's goals can be achieved with deuterium alone. The plasma physics is basically the same for pure deuterium and a deuterium/tritium mix. The latter makes the reactor walls radioactive, once they start using tritium it will be difficult to change something inside the reactor. Therefore this will be done only after years of tests with deuterium, once they are sure the reactor can stay as it is and once the tests that don't need tritium are largely done.</p>
<p>I'm not working on fusion but the concept is very similar for particle accelerators and detectors where I see that process live. The LHC had first beams 10 years ago. It still didn't reach its full design energy (although it is close: ~7% below it since 2015). The collision rate is now twice the design value but the machine needed years to get there. The next upgrade phase will start in a few weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
