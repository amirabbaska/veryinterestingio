<p>My mother kicked breast cancers ass the second time just over a year ago and was told she could not donate blood ever again. It had spread to get lymph nodes so maybe that's why? From the responses I gather that unless it's a cancer of the blood you're allowed to donate after 1-5 years clear.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/11/cancers-invasion-equation/amp" target="_blank">Cancer's Invasion Equation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>which was covered in this reddit post:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/72itrn/cancers_invasion_equation/" target="_blank">Cancer's Invasion Equation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>According to the article, even when a human has a few tumors which are stable there may already be metastatic cancer cells detectable in their blood - i.e. the tumors are shedding that.  Yet in many patients these do not cause additional tumors (i.e. there is no rampant metastatis or spread/re-seeding in another place of the cancer cells etc.).  This is contrary to the layman understanding of tumors and cancers - where just having <strong>any</strong> cancer cells shedding from the tumor are seen as being potential metastasis agents - i.e. almost like every such cancer cell that is loose in the bloodstream can lodge somewhere and create another tumor.  But this article suggests the reality is something different - i.e. actually cancer cells are being shed all the time, and don't necessarily create new tumors.  And when they do create tumors, they tend to favor certain organs more.  The idea being suggested is that actually humans may have a pretty robust system working <strong>against</strong> cancer all the time - it's just when that fails that you find metastatis taking place.  Again I am not an expert to comment on these things - that is just my reading of what the article seems to be suggesting.  But this idea that cancer cells are being shed by tumors all the time - is scary.  But then the idea that despite that constant barrage, new tumors happen only in certain special conditions - is heartening.  Because it suggests cancer cells do not hold all the cards - there are other factors (i.e. the &quot;soil&quot; or conditions in the patient's body - which may depend on immune system, as well as organ to organ variation in how welcoming the conditions are for cancer cells to lodge and grow into tumors in that location).</p>
<p>This suggests that it may be possible that in cancer patients, and possibly even in non-cancer patients (or undetected cancer humans) there may already be metastatic cancer cells running around in their blood.  Except those cancer cells are not taking root elsewhere.  This is what the article discusses - the idea of looking at cancer not just from the point of view of the cancer cell, but from point of view of the &quot;soil&quot; i.e. what causes already-prolific cancer cells to NOT take root (example being patients with a few stable tumors who are shedding cancer cells, but they are not taking root beyond a few places).</p>
<p>If this view of cancer is correct - it could mean blood transfusions from even a presumed non-cancer patient could be dangerous.  And it is dangerous for sure when that donation is taken from a known cancer patient - because even though they are cured i.e. their existant cancer cells are not taking root, they might do so in another patient.</p>
<p>They give the example of cancer patients who have gone in to remission and seem to be long-term cured - yet when their organ was donated to someone else - that recipient developed aggressive cancer.  The idea being that for some reason in the donor the immune system or &quot;soil&quot; so to speak had become hostile or conditions were not right for cancer cells to prosper as tumors.  But in another patient (i.e. different &quot;soil&quot; - using that analogy again) - those same cancer cells may find a more supportive environment for those cancer cells to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I go on, there are a few little things that make a big difference. Plastic is the cheapest. Glass is the most expensive. Cans are effective and still relatively cheap, and flavor issues aren't much of a concern as there's a small coating of plastic inside the can. Cans and glass bottles can also hold carbonation much more easily, hence why they're more likely to be the choice for beer and pop.</p>
<p>Beer: cans and glass bottles don't 'leak' oxygen through the walls, which spoils the beer. Bottles are usually heavily tinted and cans block all light which helps keep it from degrading, as some wavelengths of light break down flavors in the beer and make it taste pretty gross. </p>
<p>Pop: Cans, glass, and plastic. almost anything goes because they are sterile already and don't have to worry about the flavors spoiling like beer. Cans are relatively compact and fairly durable, but more expensive than plastic bottles, and glass bottles can help preserve the taste more, since cans have a thin plastic coating on the inside to prevent the aluminum from altering the taste. Glass bottles are the most expensive and most people don't notice or don't care enough to spend twice as much on a bottle of pop. </p>
<p>Water: Water, well, water. It doesn't have the flavors to worry about, so the cheapest option is chosen: plastic bottles. By using only one kind of bottle they can also further reduce the cost because the economies of scale are a beautiful thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Beer could potentially be sold in plastic in an enclosed cardboard carton to eliminate light spoilage (they sell clear glass-bottled Corona and Miller Hi-Life) But from a marketing perspective, nobody wants their beer in plastic, so it's glass or aluminum</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Aluminum cans could be used for water, but a bit of the aluminum does dissolve into the drink. Sodas typically have enough other flavorants that you don't notice the aluminum taste, but it would make plain water taste unpleasantly metallic. You'll notice that soda often gets stored in plastic bottles as well. Glass is more expensive than either, however, so you see that least often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Per Stanford study:<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~clint/Run_Walk2004a.rtf" target="_blank"> Running elicited a significantly greater total energy expenditure than walking on both the treadmill and the track (P &lt; 0.001) for both genders (Fig. 1a). On the treadmill, the males expended 520.6 ± 27.6 kJ for 1600 m; this was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than the energy expenditure by the females (441.1 ± 25.6 kJ). For the walk, the males expended 370.4 ± 17.7 kJ, and the females expended 309.6 ± 17.2 kJ for 1600 m (P &lt; 0.05 between genders).

<p>I wish a couple physicists had chimed in on this... fundamentally, It takes the same amount of energy to move an object of given mass and volume a known distance through a constant medium, irrespective of time. However, running and walking are biomechanically different. Your mechanical efficiency is lower with running and therefore you'll 'burn' slightly more calories. Running is basically controlled, rhythmic, leaps forward thus more vertical work is being done to move the known object (you) forward. In addition, the higher heart rate will also increase your caloric consumption since the heart is a muscle and it needs energy too; I do not know if it is detectable by current measurement techniques within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Where I think this question  arises as I've  received it in the past: Not all treadmills are created equal and the estimation equation for calorie consumption per distance/incline travelled may not account for differences between the mechanical efficiency of running or walking. </p>
<p>TL,DR: run the distance, yields less time and increased calories consumed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Because the neutron star is so dense, it sinks to the center and drives powerful convection currents stirring the layers of a normal star.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;knot&quot; is a muscle that's experiencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanic_contraction" target="_blank">physiologic tetanus</a> — that is, full contraction. Involuntary tetanus, or cramps, are caused by muscle spasms.</p>
<p>The current prevailing theory involves chemicals called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte#Physiological_importance" target="_blank">electrolytes</a>, which help regulate the internal electrical charge of each muscle cell. When a muscle is depolarized — that is, its internal charge flips from generally negative to generally positive due to the movement of electrolytes in and out of the cell — contraction is initiated. This process is controlled by a group of motor neurons called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit" target="_blank">motor unit</a>. If the charge of the muscle cell remains positive after the motor unit stops stimulating the muscle, it remains contracted. Normally, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%2B/K%2B-ATPase#Sodium.E2.80.93potassium_pumps" target="_blank">active pumps on the outside of the cells</a> flush out the cell, causing repolarization (return to baseline negative state). Sometimes, however, the muscle becomes <em>so</em> positively-charged that the NaK pumps don't have enough energy to fully reverse the charge, so the muscle remains depolarized.</p>
<p>Manual manipulation/physiotherapy (i.e. muscle massage) encourages blood flow, which brings new electrolytes and other chemicals to the area to encourage muscle relaxation.</p>
<p>There is also another type of muscle cramp, associated with the inhibition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi_tendon_organ" target="_blank">Golgi tendon organ</a> (which is partially responsible for muscle relaxation in certain ways) and overstimulation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_spindle" target="_blank">muscle spindles</a>, which cause the muscle to contract. It is unclear whether manual manipulation has a distinct effect on this type of cramp.</p>

<p>Without getting too detailed, there are a lot of things in semen.  Within the first few minutes or so, there are proteins that will coagulate and make it sticky.  Heat makes microscopic things move faster, so something warm will speed up the process.  There are also enzymes that will start to break down the proteins, making the semen more liquid again after another 10 minutes or so. There doesn't seem to be a reason for it as far as we know, and I can't confirm it because I've never left semen around long enough to find out.  I think you'll find that if exposed to air it will start to dry up anyway, which kinda negates the fact that it gets less sticky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about in movies and TV shows, like Mr. Robot, when trying to delete evidence or something on a hard drive/usb drive, often simply deleting it isn't enough.
I am aware that simply 'deleting' something doesn't necessarily remove it, (it just sets that chunk of data as available to be written over) and forensic data recovery can find it, so I am asking more specifically how can you recover data that has been properly deleted. Like written over, formatted, and wiped clean. Is physically destroying the drives just to be 100000% sure or is there an actual chance that if found the data could be recovered?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern forensic technology can recover data even if it was overwritten, even several times. Because if you overwrite a track of data on the medium it does not &quot;reset&quot; the original contents to zero. </p>
<p>Or, as a simplified example: if a &quot;1&quot; is stored as a +1.0 strong impulse, and a &quot;0&quot; as a -1.0 strong one, then overwriting an existing &quot;0&quot; with a &quot;1&quot; might actually give you a +0.9, while overwriting an old &quot;1&quot; with a new &quot;1&quot; might give you a +1.1. Both read as ~+1 and return as a &quot;1&quot;, and maybe even the drives electronics does not see them as anything but a +1.</p>
<p>Now if you take a high-end specialized measurement device, you might read those patterns with a lot more decimal digits: +1.1 -0.9 -1.1 +0.9 - The harddisks normal electronics would have read &quot;1001&quot;, but a forensic system might read this as &quot;1001&quot; written over a &quot;1100&quot;. And the more digits they can get (and they have a lot of time to thoroughly analyze each track!), the more &quot;Generations&quot; can be recovered.</p>
<p>And if they are really determined to read that disk, even denting and shredding does not do the job. It is possible to read the magnetization of each fragment, and puzzle the original contents back together, at least to some extend.</p>
<p>Therefor, if you want to get rid of the information you have to heat the drive beyond the Curie point. And that needs some proper equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are getting a lot of either miss-informed, out-dated or just plain wrong answers that go into way too much detail and speculation. Since this is an ELI5 question, I'll do my best to answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because it is the fastest, and the safest way to ensure that the data is impossible to retrieve. *</p>
</li>
<li>Because it is included in some 3-letter agencies' guide to properly dispose of a hard-drive.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should conclude the question part. Now, to address some of the nuances and misconceptions in this thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lot of speculation about the possibility of data retrieval after a full HDD &quot;wipe&quot;. First, we must discuss what could be considered a wipe. </li>
</ul>
<p>a) delete files or quick-format the drive from the operating system</p>
<p>b) write 0's on every available memory location.</p>
<p>c) write a multiple of patterns on every available memory location, X amount of times (where X is different based on what 3-letter agency guide-book you follow)</p>
<p>Now, for a) it is known, demonstrated and widely accepted that this will NOT guarantee the deletion of data. Depending on a multitude of factors, such as operating system, partition type, etc. data CAN be retrieved after this operation. There are a lot of tools that can perform data retrieval in these scenarios, some of them free to use and available for download.</p>
<p>b) should be seen, for all intents and purposes as SAFE. There are a lot of old tales, myths and misconceptions about how one can infer the data previously written at a location, and all that mumbo-jumbo. While I will concede that <em>maybe</em> this could have been the case decades ago, in a <em>laboratory environment</em> with <em>perfect conditions</em>, that is very much not the case in any real-world scenario. There is no currently available commercial vendor that will even attempt to recover a 0-filled modern high-density HDD. There are no academic papers published that even hint of this being possible (in fact there are some that have published very much against such claims). It is a myth, it will not happen in real-life, move on.</p>
<p>c) is a sort of b) on steroids. If b) could be considered safe, then this will be obviously safer. Alas, the problem with both b) and c) is that it takes a lot of time to completely over-write a HDD, so it stands to reason that a faster method would be preferred when dealing with a lot of hosts.</p>
<p>*** Note 1: The above comment does not relate to some edge cases of HDDs that use an on-board firmware (a controller) that deals with bad sector reallocation. There are cases where some sectors could be marked as bad, transparent to the OS, and those sectors might be skipped when over-writing the HDD during a wipe.</p>
<p>*** Note 2: The above comment only refers to magnetic HDDs. The subject of data forensics on SSDs is even more convoluted and controversial. Research presented at a recent DefCon conference stated that forensics retrieval of data from SSDs depends widely on a series of factors, such as controller type, OS used (and TRIM support active/not) and so on. Look for it if you are interested. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a hard drive like a notebook. Imagine writing important stuff on that notebook really hard. If you do a simple delete, you're just erasing the cover that says what's in it. Someone can still open it and read what you wrote. You can also overwrite it, which would be like tearing off that top sheet and writing over the dents in the notebook with other data. Even AFTER doing that, someone could still maybe figure out what was written before (just like rubbing it with the side of a pencil). It's messy and you might not be able to make it all out, but maybe enough to be dangerous. Clearly, the more times you repeat writing over that page, the harder that is. Plus it takes forever to cover every inch of that paper.</p>
<p>Your solution then? Light the damn thing on fire. Or crush it, break it, physically damage it (it should be noted that just like taping a shredded notebook back together, it is possible to retrieve data from broken drives in some cases, but it's very time consuming, very difficult and because data is written in bits spread all over the drive and not in neat rows as in a notebook, even harder still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As it has been brought up by others in this thread, retinoscopy (streak) is the definitive (currently) way optometrists and ophthalmologists calculate prescriptions in cases where verbal communication is not possible, i.e. babies, infants, young children, mentally challenged or elderly patients. </p>
<p>Retinoscopy works by shinning a retinscope into a patient's eye and observing the reflex of light that is reflected back. This system is built on the optics found in the eye, no different to the optics of a camera lens. There are two movements we expect to see, they are an against or with movement. An against movement means you need a negative lens correct (myopia) and a with movement means you need a positive lens to correct (hyperopia). You can also calculate astigmastism with retinoscopy, and this is where it becomes difficult. </p>
<p>In the hands of a capable operator, retinoscopy is far more accurate than any modern autorefractor (for now) as operators have trained many years to use a retinoscope. The problem with current auto-refractors is that they do not account for accommodation in the eye; think when you switch between looking at something far away like the horizon and then looking at your phone quickly. Do you sometimes notice it takes a microsecond or two to adjust? Thats your accommodation working, your eye lens physically changes shape in order for you to see your phone clearly; think chaning focal lenghts on a camera zoom. Accommodation breaks down around 40years old progressively until around 60 and this is why people need reading glasses. I digress. </p>
<p>Auto-refractors are still a very important screening tool in helping aid reaching your final prescription, however the results are not generally completely reliable. </p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctors/optometrists fit children with these prescriptions simply because there isn't a good way of doing it subjectively. Speaking as a pre-registration optometrist in England I will try and explain why this is the case as best i can.</p>
<p>Subjective results are generally better because we must control a process we call &quot;accommodation&quot;  i.e. the ability young individuals have to focus for near. Optics 101 also shows that you can use this additional focusing power to focus through some prescriptions, for example &quot;long sighted&quot; or plus prescriptions, this causes long term issues in patients because this requires effort and causes eyestrain. In children the ability to accommodate is very high. Trust me when I say it is much easier to relax this accommodation in someone who a.) Has less ability to do it and b.) Can understand subjectively when a lens makes no difference to their sight. These are both adult qualities, as a result we must do it differently for children. </p>
<p>The way we generally do it is by relaxing the accommodation with drops called cycloplegics, these drugs then have side effects which then make subjective testing EVEN harder. For example it makes your pupils larger which can then cause glare which could be mistaken for blur. We must then use objective methods to determine a rough estimate of the prescription because the patient cannot operate subjectively, it is by no means more accurate. </p>
<p>BUT that's not to say it is going to damage your child's sight, we tend to give these prescriptions simply to relax the child's eye muscles and allow for NORMAL ocular development. Normal ocular development shows that children tend to be slightly long sighted and become more short sighted until they have no prescription, this is normal because the larger your eye the more short sighted you become. It's obviously normal for your eyes to become larger as the body gets bigger. This is why we only correct gross long sightedness (we rarely intervene with short sightedness because glasses may not help much, specialist CLs are generally used for these children).</p>
<p>As you can probably deduce now, it does not matter if we leave the child slightly long sighted because they have a large amount of accommodation, so the fact our prescriptions will be slightly off when obtained objectively (which they will be) will not be an issue. It's all about reducing the amount of long sightedness to a point which will not cause the patient to accommodate TOO much, which will then cause eyestrain and even lazy eyes (accommodation also stimulates the eyes to turn in as well). Lazy eyes are the worst case scenario in children undergoing ocular development, because the brain is still malleable or &quot;plastic&quot;. Therefore, it can develop to IGNORE the visual information being sent by the lazy eye (therefore, the brain is avoiding double vision and blur) and cause very reduced vision in that eye in later life. </p>
<p>In my experience, I generally prescribe long sighted prescriptions causing problems (for example lazy eyes) then use further tests to monitor whether the prescription has removed the lazy eye at future visits. I refer short sighted/ different prescriptions in each eye (anisometropia) to specialists to fit contact lenses etc. Some children also need patching to remove this dominance issue which is undertaken by other specialists. </p>
<p>TLDR: we generally prescribe children to relax their &quot;accommodation&quot; to the point where it doesn't cause them any issues (lazy eyes/eyestrain). The long sighted child will see fine regardless of if a prescription is in place or not because their ability to accommodate through long sighted prescriptions is so good. Objective methods are not superior but are our only alternative. Prescribing for short sighted children or children with prescriptions which are different in each eye are more complex and require contact lens intervention. We prescribe for those children to slow the progression of short sightedness or to make the images formed by each eye more equal. Again, having the exact right prescription may not be possible for these children without subjective methods but we definitely allow the children's ocular development to be less affected by their incorrect prescription. The goal in prescribing for children is usually not to let them see clearly but to improve their ocular development.</p>
<p>Phew, that's hard to explain in layman's terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can make money three ways when they are selling you a new car, the dealer markup, and any hidden incentives from the factory.<br />
The second way is what they offer you for your trade in.<br />
The third way is through financing of the vehicle.   They secretly get kickbacks from certain finance companies depending on what rate they offer you.   Say, hypothetically, you qualify for a 3% rate, but the finance manager will offer you a loan for 4%, so then the dealership gets a kickback of $500, and if he gets you on the hook for 5%, the dealership gets a kickback of $1000.   </p>
<p>So the salesperson will usually chat you up and try to pull details about what you want out of the deal, they find out what your &quot;hot buttons&quot; are, and lets say you demand to get $5000 for your trade, when it's only worth $4000, well then they can jack up your interest rate by two percent and make that back up.<br />
Or, lets say you demand a certain interest rate, so they agree to that, but the amount of money they will give you on your trade-in just went down.<br />
Since usually people only have one hot button, it's easy for them to find out what that is and then structure that accordingly.
So it's all a big shell game.   You ask for something, they concede, but make it up elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a heavy truck manufacturer (we are talking semi trucks) and the process is similar in the truck world. Our truck dealerships actually make very little money on the sale of the truck. We, as the manufacturer, usually have promotions running that gives the dealership and sales people incentives to really push whatever model(s) we are interested in pushing. We give it back in the form of rebates, gift cards, funds for the dealership to use on marketing, and a variety of other incentives. </p>
<p>The real money maker for a dealership is parts and service.  We sell genuine parts that came on at the factory for upwards of 60-100% margin. The dealership then turns around and marks it up to the end users (you and I) for the same amount.  Yes, those wiper blades that cost you over $20 we as the OEM sold to the dealership for $4-8 bucks. </p>
<p>Parts and service from a dealership border on price gouging but they can get away from it. However, I truly believe if you have the money it’s worth it in so many ways to have your vehicle serviced at the actual dealership that represents your car brand. We give them TONS of training how to properly service your vehicles, plus, we ship them actual tools to fix your specific car that most repair companies can’t get. </p>
<p>Don’t worry - dealerships take in the money hand over fist and it’s truly due to the parts and service departments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They say that the real money is made of incentives from the manufacturer to sell the cars - they just need to move a set number of cars, it really doesn't matter how much they sell them for. And then they get big payouts from the manufacturer. And that's the money they want - not some tiny profit from marking up the car. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually sell cars so here's the breakdown: </p>
<p>If you're buying a brand new car, there is a good chance they really ARENT making any money, or maybe only a couple hundred bucks. Dealerships have an invoice cost of their vehicle, which you can typically get a new car at or below that invoice cost. Most place also have about 4% of the cars cost as marketing incentives and otherbullshit from the manufacturer, but it has nothing to do with dealership markup. So if you're buying a new car at or below invoice, there is a very good chance no one is making any sizable income off of that (for instance, I will typically make only $50-75 flat fee for selling the car). But then you might ask, how does a dealership make money?</p>
<p>Well, if you're buying the car at that dealership, then you're likely going to service it there, too. It costs pennies to the dollar to actually perform service on the car, so they'll make more than the money they lost on that one new car in the multiple service visits they'll have to the dealership. But that's not all:</p>
<p>3-6 years down the road, now you'll trade that car in. So the preowned manager will typically give you a trade in value way under what the car will sell for after being fixed up on retail. So now one preowned car could have $5000 profit on the cost of the car alone, making up for a few of those new cars. You might think this is unfair, but sorry, any preowned manager worth his weight isn't going to put any sizable discount on his car, because it's actually keeping the lights on at the dealership. Just the rules of the game unfortunately. </p>
<p>The unfortunate part is that unlike any other business, people don't feel a dealership is entitled to make a profit. But like, people still have to get paid and lights still have to be kept on. So it is what it is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK.  So it all comes down to how you define &quot;profit&quot; for a car dealership.</p>
<p>First, and most obvious there's the amount that they paid the manufacturer for the car vs what they sold it to you.  That's the &quot;only a few hundred markups&quot; that you see. </p>
<p>Uncounted in that is that manufacturers often give rebates.  So if you sell car X the manufacturer might kick an extra few hundred your way.  This is partly how the manufacturer influences what cars are pushed when.  So for example, if the new Accord is coming out next month, Honda might incentivize selling the old Accords off by giving a rebate on them for a few months. This gives the manufacturer more control over what salespeople push than simply adjusting the original cost of a car. </p>
<p>Next are targets.  Often a dealership will get a bonus if they hit certain targets for sales.  So if they have a 100 vehicle target, but only sell 99 they get nothing but if they sell 101 they get $1,000 for every vehicle.  These numbers are made up but show the point.  The dealership stands to make significantly more profit if they hit these targets than if they miss them. </p>
<p>Next is financing.  Dealers get kickbacks from financing companies.  If a dealer sets up a loan with company X, they might get a few hundred bucks for doing so.  Many manufacturers also have financing companies, for example, &quot;Ford Motor Credit Company LLC&quot; is the bank owned by Ford Motor Company.  This bank contributes a significant amount to Ford's overall bottom line. So the incentives from the credit company are also present.</p>
<p>Next, and perhaps most important is service.  The assumption is that a new vehicle comes with a warranty.  Most people get their warranty service at the same dealership they bought from.  The dealer's service department charges the manufacturer for those services.  </p>
<p>So if you go in and get something done under warranty, your local Ford dealer invoices Ford Motor Company for that service.  Even though you are not paying the dealer, the dealer's service department is still making money on that service.  Now, the rates negotiated by the manufacturer are much lower than you or I would pay, but there's a significant amount of service work done through those dealers that this back-end revenue is part of the assumed profit when they sell a new car. </p>
<p>Then there's the remainder of the dealer's service work.  Because they sell new cars, people assume that they are the best equipped and trained to service all cars of that brand.  So collision repairs, or out of warranty repairs are all gravy for the dealership and those exist because of the new car sales side of the business. </p>
<p>Lastly, there are used cars.  People often trade in a car when they buy a new one.  The dealership flips that car to another buyer, at a profit, or they sell it at auction (often at a profit).  </p>
<p>So the dealer makes its profit in many ways.  There's the straight margin, the manufacturer incentives, and bonuses, there's the trade in, the financing and the future service.  All of those are sources of profit that flow from selling that 1 new car. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The &quot;number of states&quot; is an integral over phase space. There <em>is</em> a continuum of possible configurations for a classical gas.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It seems like there are two separate questions here. One of them is just asking how you count states in quantum statistical mechanics. For quantum systems with discrete spectra, the &quot;integral over phase space&quot; just becomes a sum over discrete states. I don't see how Pauli exclusion relates to this question.</p>
<p>The second question is how does Pauli exclusion work for identical particles in &quot;similar&quot; states? If you have a free electron in space, its quantum state can be written as a spatial wavefunction and a spinor. If you now consider two electrons, and ignore their spins (or prepare them so that they have the same spin state), antisymmetrization forces the spatial part of their combined state to be antisymmetric.</p>
<p>In other words, the spatial wavefunction must take the form</p>
<p>Ψ(<strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em>,</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>) = [φ<em><em>1</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>1</em></em>)φ<em><em>2</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>) - φ<em><em>1</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>)φ<em><em>2</em></em>(</strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em>)]/sqrt(2).</p>
<p>It's clear than that this is identically zero if <strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em> = </strong>r**<em><em>2</em></em>. If they are not exactly equal, then the terms don't exactly cancel, at least not everywhere in space.</p>
<p>When you calculate any kind of matrix element of a two-body operator in this state, you'll end up with integrals over all space of some function multiplied by products of these wavefunctions. If <strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em> is close to </strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>, the two individual electron wavefunction overlap strongly, and there will be strong exchange effects. If </strong>r<strong><em><em>1</em></em> is far from </strong>r**<em><em>2</em></em>, the cross-terms in the integral will be very small, and exchange effects will be negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is actually only a finite number of ways for a fixed volume.  Look at it this way.   Let's say you take a box and randomly insert a particle into it such that no position in the box is favored.  What's the probability of any one position being selected?   Well it's simply 1 divided by the volume.   1/V</p>
<p>Now put two particles in the box.  What's the probability of selecting two positions?  It is again 1/V for both particles which gives a (1/V)^2  since the selection of the two positions are independent.</p>
<p>But for the two particle case we now have to worry about if the particles are degenerate.  IE if the two particles are indistinguishable. If they are then you have to multiply by 2 since there are two possible ways to arrive at the same configuration.  Likewise when we go up to three we get (1/V)^3 and 3! since you now have 3 positions and 6 possible ways to distribute the particles to those positions. </p>
<p>You basically end up with the total number of states being equal to N!/V^N</p>
<p>When you are dealing with probability on a continuous space (which statistical mechanics is very much a probabilistic theory), you need to stop thinking in discrete terms.  You can have an infinite phase space while still only having a finite volume.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Basically you're heading towards a rediscovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_paradox" target="_blank">Gibbs' paradox</a> here. There is no correct classical answer, and there is <em>not</em> in fact an infinite number of ways (that <em>count</em>, literally), and the entropy of a gas is not infinite. Indeed quantum mechanics comes into this, it lead to one of the earliest quantum-mechanical theories before QM proper (along with e.g. Planck's blackbody curve and Einsteins' work on the photoelectric effect), namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackur%E2%80%93Tetrode_equation" target="_blank">Sackur-Tetrode</a> equation. Which is the correct (but not classical) entropy of an ideal gas in the classical limit. Basically the key concept here is that because particles are fundamentally indistinguishable, and the quantization of momentum space.</p>
<p>The Pauli principle isn't involved here -there's still a difference between quantum statistics (whether Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac) and classical Boltzmann stats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The way the states are counted is to usually start with a simple shape such as a box, and try to see how many electrons you can fit in the box.  Let's take a &quot;one dimensional box&quot; where the electron can only assume many states in one dimension, but can only  assume one state in the other two dimensions.</p>
<p>If the electron is confined to the box, its wave function is zero at its boundary, as it can not be found in the wall of the box.  Because the electron is a wave, it has a wavelength.  The longest wavelength the electron can have with its wavefunction zero at the boundary is half a wave period along the length of the box.  Any multiple of half wavelengths can be fit into the box.  Each additional half wavelength we add to the wavefunction adds an additional possible state. </p>
<p>The momentum of the electron is inversely proportional to the wavelength as in $p=h/\lambda$.  Nonrelativistic quantum mechanism tells us that $E=p^2 c^2 / 2m$.  Putting these together $E = h^2 c^2 / 2 m  \lambda^2 $.    We can solve for wavelength in terms of $E$, $\lambda = \sqrt{h^2 c^2 / 2 m E}$.  We can then differentiate to find $d\lambda/dE$ which is the change in wavelength of the electrons as they are added to the box as electrons are added at an energy $E$ up to an energy $E+dE$.  This is more easily done in terms of the number of half waves $n = 2 L/\lambda$ so that $n = (L/2)\sqrt{2mE/h^2 c^2 } and therefore $dn/dE=(L/2)\sqrt{2m/h^2 c^2 } 1/2 E^{-1/2} $, so that this is the number of half waves per unit energy.  You can do something similar for 3 dimensions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>In classical statistical mechanics, the number of microstates is actually uncountably infinite, since the properties of classical systems are continuous. For example, a microstate of a classical ideal gas is specified by the positions and momenta of all the atoms, which range continuously over the real numbers. If we want to define Ω, we have to come up with a method of grouping the microstates together to obtain a countable set. This procedure is known as coarse graining. In the case of the ideal gas, we count two states of an atom as the &quot;same&quot; state if their positions and momenta are within δx and δp of each other. Since the values of δx and δp can be chosen arbitrarily, the entropy is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an additive constant. (As we will see, the thermodynamic definition of entropy is also defined only up to a constant.)</p>
