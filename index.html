		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't necessarily true... permanent disease and the notion of &quot;dry drunks&quot; is more of an AA philosophy, although I absolutely believe the more strongly addicted people will have permanent problems and might not be able to drink at all.  This is true of almost any addiction like gambling and sex addiction too (CP perhaps being a prominent example).  I can vouch for four people in my family who drank heavily 10-20 years ago and got help a long time ago, and avoid alcohol now but can still drink several beers socially with no problem.</p>
<p>AA is not the only answer, unfortunately this is exclusively what is embraced by the US legal and psychiatric system. There are alternative recovery programs for alcohol.  Moderation is a possibility, though the tragic story of Audrey Kishline needs to be read as a cautionary tale.  I personally don't think it's possible to go from alcohol abuse to moderation without a long period of sobriety, and even then it's risky. </p>
<p>Alcohol is extremely addictive and it does bring the danger of a permanent ruinous relationship, but for those who haven't been burned too bad by the addiction I am 100% sure it is possible to regain a normal relationship with it, but only after a couple of years of sobriety and after a lot of your Maslows Pyramid stuff is fixed.  You simply can't go back into social drinking when you've got relationship problems, no job, and without interests that fulfill you.</p>
<p>I'm not advising anyone to start drinking, but if all that stuff is addressed then your life is in a very secure place and alcohol is not that much of a risk. But if you had previously been drinking for 10 years and had failed marriages, DUIs, and rehab as a result of drinking, then you're a lot further along on the addiction spectrum and it's probably better to stay away regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recovered sex addict here. Just wanted to add that while it is true that sex addicts learn to a way to have sex, then it's much more complicated than that. There are in many cases things that we stay away from forever just like alcohol. What these things are differ from person to person but the main idea is that some things will for a fact get a sex addict back into an addictive pattern while healthy and natural sex won't. Also it's not just something that comes easy so it requires continuing work to stay on the right path. Sex addicts have to rediscover a way to have healthy sex.
Since alcohol is not similarly complex then it's hard to say that some parts are healthy and some are not.
Completely removing yourself from anything sexual is not healthy. Just like food addicts can't just quit food but needs to figure out what works and what triggers binging. Alcohol is not a necessity and therefor it's easier to just cut it out. I do however believe that it is possible but since it's not easy then people just tend to not take the risk. Cause even recovered sex addicts have relapses and it's just easier to avoid relapses with alcohol by staying away completely. There is not really a good reason to drink so they don't. Long story short - it can be done if you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certified addiction treatment counselor here. Alcohol and other drugs are chemical addictions. Acts like sex, gambling, stealing are called process addictions. Chemical addictions and process addictions both change the way your brain is wired in similar ways and both cause your brain to release various chemical messengers that makes you feel good. However, chemical addictions have a far more severe and widespread effect on how your brain functions and cause much much higher levels of these chemical messengers than process addictions do.  The less severe impact process addictions have on the brain allows someone to continue doing something they were addicted to without it getting back to the place where it was so out of control or causing severe problems. With chemical addictions, the severity of the effects on the brain makes casual drug use almost not possible, which is why statistically speaking, abstinence based programs are the most effective in treating addiction/alcoholism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will start by saying that I am an alcoholic and not a sex addict. I am 2 years sober after many years of struggling and desperation. I got sober and stay sober through AA. For me, that is the only way, but I know it's not for everyone, and that's fine. I am also a part of Toronto AA which is predominantly atheists and agnostics. I went to AA to get sober and I stay b/c it makes my life better. As an alcoholic I am allergic to alcohol, in that the physical alcohol in the body sets off an obsession for wanting more. While most people can stop after a few, me being an alcoholic, will always want to continue drinking. I tried for many years to learn to drink in moderation, but even when I didn't drink until I blacked out, I was always obsessing about wanting more. I can only share my story here about why I can't moderate as it's not my place to discuss other alcoholics or sex addicts and their stories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Population is always growing, barring some horrible catastrophe or war. Therefore, economic output must also increase in order to create the jobs, and goods, all those new people need. This is true just about everywhere.</p>
<p>2) The value of money is almost always inflating, so people need corresponding wage increases in order to continue to afford to live. As wages stagnate and prices continue to grow, eventually people can't afford to pay for everything they need, such as rent/mortgages, food, gas, cloths, etc. Constant economic growth makes businesses more money, which results in them paying their employees more. (In before some socialist comes and rants at me about growing wage gaps or whatever. This is an economic principle, and yelling at me won't change that)</p>
<p>3) If the economy isn't growing, then it's shrinking. This translates to businesses shutting down, people losing their jobs, and less tax revenue for the government. Each of these things results in, in order; fewer goods for sale, resulting in higher prices; fewer people with money to spend, resulting in even more businesses closing; and the reduction of government programs, which means more people without jobs. Combine these problems with either of the previous examples and you have a recipe for massive unemployment, exorbitant prices, and a bankrupt government that continues to spiral downwards until the country collapses. </p>
<p>TL;DR, An economy that isn't growing is like a body that can't make new cells. You'll be dead in a week. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These people are literally all wrong.  The real answer depends what level you're referring to.  If you're talking a global scale, it's because of the increase in technology and the decrease of inefficiency in the market. Tech increase means any advancement that increases real output, such as a better way to farm or a way to make better houses. Decrease in market inefficiency are things such as removing minimum wages, tariffs, etc. Note, these things may lead to a worse economy in one country, but the global economy as a whole will constantly grow.  People saying bullshit about capitalism and unsustainable growth are completely misinterpreting Marx.</p>
<p>If you're referring to an individual country level, then growth occurs due to the things mentioned above, but also at the expense of other countries. This much is self explanatory.</p>
<p>The reason the economy shrinking is bad is because technology is always increasing such that real output of the entire global system is always increasing. If one country is sitting there and staying flat or shrinking, that means it is losing relative economic strength compared to other countries. </p>
<p>This tends to have a compounding effect as the country is forced to do things that cause the economy to become even weaker. An example is minimum wage. If the US wasn't hemorrhaging high skilled labor (such as techs at a chip fabrication plant) then the US may not need to have to increase its minimum wage to bring the lowest standard deviation of the population to livable wages. But alas the US is shitting jobs like mad and Walmart workers get paid scraps so the US has to introduce heavy inefficiency to the system by raising the minimum wage.  </p>
<p>Edit: Please note I'm being 100% serious about everyone else saying a load of bullshit. Money doesn't inflate for fun. It can deflate just as easily if you feel like making it that way, a la bitcoin. Saying money magically decreases in value just for the sake of it is not real economics. There has to be some kind of underlying reason, as money is not some kind of natural force of the physical world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The underlying thing people are worried about is: &quot;How much stuff can the average person buy?&quot; This goes down if the economy has negative growth (recession) assuming population has stayed the same/increased. Population usually grows, so a stagnating economy usually means that the average person can't buy as much stuff because there are more people who have to share the same sized pie as before. Growth is good provided it out paces population, and inflation. But even when it doesn't, it is still better than a stagnant or shrinking economy. </p>
<p>Is it sustainable? Yes and no. The factors that affect economic growth form an extensive list. Some big ones are: Population, availability of resources, technology, and availability of captial (sort of a resource). Population tends to go up, more people means more workers, so more work tends to get done. Population also increased demand which drives growth as well. Availability of resources is a funny one, because we use the resources over time, but technology can make resources like deep sea oil available when they previously weren't. Theoretically technology always goes forward unless something catastrophic happens so that is one factor that drives growth continuously by improving out productivity. Availability of capital (Savings) determines whether businesses can start or grow to replace those that shrink and fail, lots of capital allows you to replace shrinking/dead businesses and expand. So yes, it is sustainable if technology can keep improving fast enough to make additional resources available as we consume the ones we already have. That is a big if though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>This is not like a black hole because the particle horizon is different for each point of space. There are objects that will never enter our particle horizon, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. Similarly, an object can be and are in multiple particle horizons at once. In particular, because our universe is expanding more or less exponentially, it turns out that the radius of the particle horizon around any point will asymptote to some finite limit. This means that is possible for an object to be causally influenced both by events in some region <em>S</em> and by events in some region <em>R</em>, but <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> themselves cannot causally influence each other.</p>
<p>A black hole event horizon, on the other hand, is much more absolute. <em>All</em> observers agree on which points of spacetime consist of the event horizon. Events behind the horizon are not in the causal past of any event outside the horizon. The only real similarity between the two types of horizons is just some general notion of causal disconnection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Our Universe is exponentially expanding (actually, it has just started to, but it's a minor point) and thus is approaching what is known as a de Sitter spacetime, due to the effect of dark energy. Distances grow exponentially:</p>
<p>(distance after time t) = e^(Ht) (distance now)</p>
<p>(some rough approximations here) where H is called the Hubble constant.</p>
<p>A de Sitter spacetime can host black holes, but only up to a certain size. At this maximum size, the black hole's event horizon and the cosmological horizon become indistinguishable, and one obtains a spacetime known as the Nariai solution. This maximum mass for the black hole is</p>
<p>M = 3^(-3/2) * 2 * c^(3)/(GH)</p>
<p>the funny factor 3^(-3/2) comes from a funny calculation, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0205177v1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> if you're curious. Now, if I didn't get anything wrong that's about</p>
<p>M ~ 7 * 10^(52) kg</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As growth rate increases, so does radiation pressure pushing away the mass surrounding the black hole.

</blockquote>
<p>This is the goal of solar panels. They absorb the photons' energy, and put it into the wires. </p>
<p>For solar sails, we are concerned with momentum, not energy. Photons have momentum, btw. No mass, just momentum. </p>
<p>The amount of momentum transfered to a sail (if it absorbs all of the photons) is the energy in the light divided by the speed of light. If you get the photons to reflect completely, you then get to double that. </p>
<p>So that's the answer- making them reflective is nearly twice as efficient. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to address the <em>TV</em> portion as it can be considered separate from movie production and distribution.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To start, let us look at where TV shows come from. A production studio creates the material for a show. As tv production is expensive (2006 estimates are $120 million average for a season), the studio is often funded (and normally owned) by a conglomerate company, such as Comcast-NBCUniversal. Prior to production, the project is greenlighted (ordered) on the premise that it will be exclusive to a certain company (such as the NBC example above).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Airing of the show is negotiated for a time slot on a certain provider. For companies that own the channel (such as NBC), the slots are determined internally based on projected potential viewers and likelihood to draw from competitors' viewers. The channel owner will also sell advertizing slots to offset the cost of production and operation, and negotiate cost-per-subscriber for cable/satellite companies to stream content.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The cable company needs to negotiate with each company that they want to provide on their services. While some of these channels are profitable on their own (based on cost:subscriber), several are not (ESPN, Lifetime, SyFy). Bundling prevents viewers from paying $15 just for ESPN and allows smaller channels to thrive. Cable companies also sell some of the advertizing slots to recuperate broadcasting costs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now comes in Netflix. Netflix operates on the same principle as Video-on-Demand (VOD), but uses the internet instead of your media box. In order to display shows through its service, Netflix has to secure rights, the same way that cable companies do.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As most rights are held by TV channels, they are reluctant to lease viewing rights within a certain marketability period, which is why shows may not appear for a certain time following their DVD/BD season release. Some studios refuse to lease content to Netflix; Disney-ABC in particular is notorious for this. They also own <em>(edit: 30% of)</em> Hulu, to compete with Netflix and piracy.<br />

As an example ESPN costs consumers ~ $7.00 while TNT is the next most expensive channel and it runs about $1.75.  This is a dying business model and it is going to change very soon.  I think the catalyst is when larger companies like Cox, Comcast, DirecTV, etc allows ala carte channel options where you only pay for the channels you actually watch.  I personally have roughly 350 channels but I only watch about 20 of those with any regularity.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three characteristics that psychology hypothesizes (and the evidence supports) are so integral to human societies that we have a biological predisposition to processing. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Group Membership</li>
</ol>
<p>They are distinguished from other characteristics in that they are processed and encoded a) very quickly b) involuntarily c) culturally universally and d) with very accurate recall.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the work of Leda Cosmides is relevant; you might google her for more info.</p>
<p>So while our perceptions and behaviour will certainly add a layer of complexity to identifying gender; it is very likely we have some innate neural circuitry devoted to it.</p>
<p>Edit: Group Membership</p>
<p>Originally, the list was gender, age, and <em>race</em>. However, from an evolutionary perspective --- necessary if we're supposing that there is any innate biological predisposition going on --- it makes no sense for race to be in this group. Humans have not been exposed to substantially different groups of other humans on an evolutionary time scale. Some very clever experimentation (see source below) established that it was instead &quot;group membership&quot; that was the important factor. That is, we do have a vested interest in establishing who belongs to our tribe and who does not belong to our tribe such that it could potentially be an evolutionary pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Group Membership&quot; really is as general and vague as it sounds --- it's about who belongs to the same &quot;group&quot; as us and who does not and that will vary depending on context. In any given context, we belong to multiple overlapping, hierarchical and competing groups and changing context changes the relative importance of those groups.  We will attend to indicators of group membership <em>to the degree that they are relevant</em> in a specific context. To the degree that race is an indicator of group membership within a community, it will be perceived and encoded in the same fast, automatic, rigorous manner than gender and age are.</p>
<p>The experiment in the source below shifted the social context to team sports and showed that they could override the race effect and replace it with team membership.</p>
<p>This seems to explain a lot of sensitivities that subcultures evolve that outsiders are largely oblivious to. For instance, everyone has an idea of what a &quot;valley girl&quot; sounds like when she's talking, but few realize that there was variation between groups of &quot;valley girls&quot;, particularly in their grammatical use of 'like', that was a clear indication to each other which group they belonged to, even though it was not necessarily a conscious behaviour on their part. Spend enough time with them, and you'd cue to those differences as well.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I felt this perceptual shift myself... I'm Canadian but went to grad school in the US. While it would be ridiculous to suggest that growing up I didn't <em>perceive</em> racial differences---I obviously did---I witnessed a subtle (and extremely uncomfortable) shift in my perceptions in the US. Race just had an <em>impact</em> that it didn't before and I found that I was more sensitive to it. It didn't really change my behaviour, but in my environment (a small college town in a red state) there was very little racial mixing. This was a couple of years before I encountered studies below that helped me explain that experience.</p>

<p>There's often not a clear distinction between &quot;hardwired&quot; and &quot;learned&quot; in human (or animal) behavior.  Some things are fully hardwired (for example, you don't have to learn how to beat your heart) and some are entirely learned (like the Konami code).  But in many cases we are hardwired to learn.  For example, rats (and humans) aren't hardwired to know that certain foods (like rotting foods) can make you sick.  But they <em>are</em> hardwired to rapidly associate nausea with flavors eaten beforehand, even if there's a significant time gap.  If you give a rat a flavor, then make it feel nausea through some other means afterwords (radiation was originally used), the rat will avoid that flavor in the future.  If you try the same thing with a light or a noise instead of a flavor, the rat won't learn nearly as quickly or easily.  That's because rats are hardwired to link taste and nausea. (here's the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/122/3160/157" target="_blank">original paper</a>, though IIRC the first one doesn't test other senses.  Also it's paywalled)</p>
<p>Likewise, humans are not hardwired to walk, but they are hardwired to learn to walk.  Human infants tend to do certain activities (like move the legs alternatively, sit up, and observe and mimic those around them) that lead them to learn to walk.  But the actual walking motion and the precursors that lead up to it have to be learned and practiced.  And toddlers have to learn about what sort of ground they can walk over without falling (eg, gaps and edges).  They have to practice motor control to improve it.  So walking is instinctively learned.  Here's a <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/adolph/publications/AdolphRobinson-inpress-LearningToWalkPreprint.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> you can read if you'd like to learn more.</p>
<p>There are plenty more examples out there...language being a big one.  So when you read about &quot;hardwired&quot; or &quot;learned&quot; behaviors, ask yourself if those definitions are capturing the entirety of what's occurring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright I'll take a stab at this one!</p>
<p>Short answer yes, but the longer answer is yes but it doesn't really mean anything.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/10/12/your-brain-first-notices-race-gender-before-all-else/60650.html" target="_blank">this article</a>
and this harvard study says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you meet someone new, the first thing your brain does is take note of two characteristics: race and gender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it goes on to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that previous research suggests the FFA does not endow visual stimuli with meaning, so it probably does not know anything about sex and race. It’s simply a brain region in the visual system that sees faces as belonging to two different sets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so it seems as though it is one of the very first things that our brains pick up on, but it doesn't really have any meaning other than differentiating between them. Other parts of the brain would then assign meaning to what you perceive as male/female.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are animals that recognize genders. They have specific warning calls for each gender that are meant to warn their group about the dangers human males can cause. If that hardwired into them? At least if primitive species can easily differentiate between human genders it probably means that they have some brain mechanisms to easily understand human genders. That brain mechanism is then very primitive. So we probably don't need a high IQ to differentiate between genders. If it's not automatic from birth it is automated to become a reflex. But I would assume that some things like gender specific clothes are somewhat softwired but things such as breasts and high vs. deep voices are in a higher degree hardwired. But it's probably brain modules evolved to recognize genders but also evolved to adapt to their environment.</p>
<p>Here is one example of monkeys differentiating between genders:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the answer directly for you, and I'm sure someone else could do a better job of answering this, but I have something that points us in the right direction.  Per a study published in 2004, by Cellerino, Borghetti and Sartucci it was determined using various resolutions of pictures that facial recognition methods held by people to resolve gender use different cognitive processes.  </p>
<p>The study broke pictures down with reduced resolution and had test subjects select male or female.  It was determined at a level of certainty above pure chance, that a male face can be identified at a level of resolution that is far less detailed than a female face.  This is possible because the process involved in determining male faces with certainty at above chance is done differently than resolving if a face is female with certainty.  Additionally, the study found that generally females perform better at facial recognition than males.</p>
<p>Does this mean the human brain has &quot;areas&quot; dedicated to recognizing gender? I don't know if you can draw that conclusion specifically, but it does assert that the process to determine a male face versus determination of a female face is handled differently in the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way a solid object stays together as one solid object is because of the forces between the atoms and molecules inside the object. If you push or pull one end of it, that pushes or pulls the bit next to it, which pushes or pulls the bit next to that, and so on and so on until the whole object appears to move together.</p>
<p>However, it actually takes some time for a push or pull on one side of an object to reach the other side. This is actually much slower than the speed of light - it's the speed of sound. This means there's no need for the entire object to get pulled in at once - one part could cross the event horizon before the other end even knows what's happening.</p>
<p>Also, this strength is of course not infinite - if the strength of the bonds in the solid object are weaker than the tidal forces of the black hole, the object will get ripped apart.</p>
<p>So the short answer is that it would break down whatever is falling into it.</p>
<p>The black hole would also expand a bit, just because it's gaining extra mass. But it's not like it's opening its mouth to suck in something bigger than its diameter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

First off, black holes are not &quot;holes&quot;, so something merging with the black hole does not need to &quot;fit into a hole&quot;. A black hole is just any mass in a small enough space that creates enough density that light cannot escape from it. So whatever might fall into the influence of the black holes gravity, whatever the size, will join its mass with that of the black &quot;hole&quot; and expand its radius accordingly. There are no holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If the matter that is about to enter the black hole is bigger than the black hole... THEN IT's ALREADY ANOTHER BLACK HOLE!</p>
<p>Unless the mass is so disperse (greater than its own Schwartzchild radius) that it's no longer a black hole, perhaps a very very big nebula or gas cloud.</p>
<p>But in that scenario, the black hole will suck whatever it encounters, while the rest of the cloud floats (with a hole in the middle). Unless there's enough time for the cloud to stay within the accretion distance of the black hole and it gets sucked whole.</p>
<p>But we cannot think of an star-like object thousands of times bigger than a black hole, because then its only another black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The black hole would expand, of course, because any black hole's size scales up proportionally to its mass. Add more mass to a black hole, it gets more massive and grows in size.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to grow large enough to swallow the original object that is 'fed' into it, though. Rather, the object's constituent material is compressed by the extreme gravity (potentially ripping the object apart in the process) until it fits into the black hole.</p>
<p>Imagine a dry sponge. Floating around in space, the sponge would tend to rest at a particular size. But if you laid the sponge on the ground, it would tend to flatten out a little (particularly at the bottom), becoming smaller than its 'default' size, because the Earth's gravity is pulling it against the ground. What the black hole does is similar, but much, <em>much</em> stronger. It would be able to not only squeeze the sponge into a solid block of plastic, but even squeeze the atoms in the plastic until they get crunched together and stop being atoms, and then squeeze the little particles that atoms are made of until they stop being particles too. Anything that falls into the black hole keeps getting squeezed down like this towards a single point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
