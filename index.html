		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is based on a false premise; the common misconception that being a silverback is the product of being dominant in a group of gorillas. </p>
<p>Any family group of gorillas will have only one silverback. However, that is because there will be only one fully adult male gorilla in a group. The high crest and silver back, are secondary gender characteristics that develop in all fully adult male gorillas. </p>
<p>When a male gorilla gets into late adolescence he will challenge the dominant male for control of the group and get kicked out as a result. He will then be on his own, or join a bachelor group, until he is big and strong enough to get his own females.  <a href="http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/gorilla/behav" target="_blank">http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/gorilla/behav</a></p>
<p>I'll also point out that orangutans are a solitary animal, and I do not see how their cheek flanges would be related to dominance. I don't disagree with the post that says the size of cheek flanges is related to testosterone, but that is not necessarily related to dominance.  <a href="http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/orangutan/behav" target="_blank">http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/orangutan/behav</a></p>
<p>There are primates where dominance and appearance are related. Mandrills, a kind of baboon, do have dominance related secondary sex characteristics. The dominant males will have more testosterone, more colour and bigger balls. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11424076" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11424076</a> I don't think we're clear on the mechanism, that is, why the dominant males will have more testosterone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I can't answer what causes the physical change in silverback gorillas, I can answer that it does happen in other primates. Orangutan males will develop flanges, however not all orangutans develop flanges. It seems that the more dominant ones develop the flanges and that the females prefer mating with the flanged males. Here's a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.22453/abstract;jsessionid=C93407680456AF0966CE2CB7842A836A.f03t04?systemMessage=Pay+per+view+article+purchase%28PPV%29+on+Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+11th+March+from+05%3A00-14%3A00+GMT+%2F+12%3A00-09%3A00+EST+%2F+13%3A00-22%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience." target="_blank">study</a> that was held and found that a higher level of testosterone was found in the flanged males, possibly causing the change. There's also this <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151027-new-insights-into-strange-faced-orangutans" target="_blank">article</a> by BBC earth that explains a little bit more about orangutan flanges and how the flanged males differ from unflanges males. I would like to mention that while that study did find that flanged orangutans did have higher testosterone level, they were not stating that those levels were the cause of the flanges. They are not entirely certain what causes flanges. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a theory called the Sapir-Wharf hypothesis that claims that your mother tongue will alter the way you perceive the world. Wharf was a motha- fuckin genius who was a chemist that studied the causes of factory fires back in the 20s/30s/40s. His research started on language when he saw that &quot;empty&quot; oil barrels was a cause of an explosion when workers threw cigarettes onto them. The word empty means void of anything or nothingness in space. But what our language made us think was that empty meant everything visible. So back then, vapors sitting in that barrel didn't &quot;exist&quot; because they were empty. </p>
<p>Some great examples of this hypothesis is cardinal versus perceived directions (North East South West versus Left Right). In America I tell you to go left on Warner and the Right on Hoille. Aborigines know directions as in cardinal. They can say go West here and then South there. And no matter what they'll understand which way is what. This changes the way we see the world how exactly? Perceived directions are ever hanging depending on the way we face. My left is your right, and vice versa. Cardinal is always the same. No matter where you stand north with always be north. Now this is an extremely abstract example that's hard to understand how it changes the way we see things. </p>
<p>So example 2</p>
<p>Hopi time and Western time. I am going to the store. Now I'm at the store. I was at the store. Future, present, past. There is things happening before now and something will happen after now. That's how western nations (mainly the whole world actually sees time). The Hopi though don't have a future tense. It be We are leaving for the store right now. At that point we are going to 7/11. And there we are going back home. Everything is happening now, it's not going to happen cause the future tense doesn't really exist (and it's incomprehensible in the English language to explain it because we don't use those terms)</p>
<p>Final example, probably the easiest to understand.
Feminine and masculine terms in French and German. Bridge in German is a feminine term, and the Germans, when describing bridges give it femine descriptions such as sleek, long, slender, while bridge in French is masculine and is described as durable, strong, bulk. Just by changing the way a word is described (masculine versus feminine) it changes the way people see non-gendered items in everyday life</p>
<p>Edit:
I study anthropology and have taken a few courses on linguistics and culture </p>
<p>Edit: I switched German and French by mistake </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of debate about this, and the answer is unclear. /u/SleeplessinRedditle quoted a study by Chen, who is an economist and not a linguist, but he makes several very basic errors: for example, he claims English has a &quot;strong&quot; future tense and German has a &quot;weak&quot; future tense, but in fact both languages express the future in almost exactly the same ways (he claims that English always requires a future marker except in very specific cases which he then sets aside, but this is completely false). His hypothesis also fails to explain why savings rates in different countries with the same languages vary so much: Ireland is near the top of the chart in the linked article, Australia near the middle, and the US and the UK right at the bottom.</p>
<p>The basic idea that language can affect how you think is known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (although neither Sapir nor Whorf actually formulated it), and has been floated around and discussed since 1929: it's more correctly called &quot;linguistic relativity&quot;. It comes in two basic versions: linguistic determinism says that the language you speak necessarily restricts the range of possible thoughts you can have and so dictates how you perceive things; linguistic influence says that the language you speak can have some effect on how you think and perceive in some ways, but doesn't dictate everything.</p>
<p>Chen appears to lean towards determinism; if you've seen <em>Arrival</em>, the scriptwriters basically took the determinist model of Sapir-Whorf and ran with it. Obviously, learning a new language can't literally rewire your brain to the extent that you can see all of time -- it makes a great movie, but scientifically it's bunk -- but the consensus among linguists at the moment is that there is no evidence at all to support the idea of linguistic determinism.</p>
<p>Basically, linguistic determinism says that before you can think, you must have language. People who speak languages that use the same word for &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;green&quot; can't tell the difference between those two colours.</p>
<p>However, research suggests the opposite: that we are all born able to think, and then we learn a language that enables us to express those thoughts. Somebody who speaks a language that makes no distinction between &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; can still tell the difference between them: they just use the same label for them.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, this chimes in with my experience. Russian has different words for what we call different shades of blue: I can still see the difference between them, but I take longer than a native speaker of Russian to decide which word goes with which shade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11759-russian-speakers-get-the-blues/" target="_blank">This study</a> suggests that the language does make a bit of a difference -- just not a big one.</p>
<p>Having lived in Germany now for nearly 25 years, I can say that learning the language hasn't made me better at saving money, or changed my perception in any meaningful way. There are some things I can express better in German than in English and vice versa: I don't <em>think</em> differently, but I am able to express a slightly different range of thoughts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're talking about, the idea that our native language shapes our cognitive process, is called the &quot;Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&quot; it was a very popular idea in the social sciences in the second half of the 20th century. Nowadays, most social scientists seem to accept a &quot;soft&quot; version of the hypothesis. That is, language has an effect on our cognition, but it is not nearly as strong an effect as originally proposed by Sapir and Whorf.</p>
<p>Here's an example that is often used to demonstrate the idea in social science classes. If you take 4 different objects, and arrange them in a cross, have the subject look at them for 4 seconds, have them close their eyes and move to the opposite side of the cross from which they observed it, scatter the objects, and ask them to rearrange them.</p>
<p>One of two things will happen: either the person will rearrange them correctly, or else they will rearrange them correctly, but mirrored. This is because there are basically two ways that humans considers space and relationality: we call them &quot;egocentric&quot;, where you use your own body as the ordinal point. This is what results in the mirrored arrangement. There is also &quot;geocentric&quot;, where you ordinate based on the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>In English, when we relay directions, it is most common to say things like &quot;take a left up at the light, go five blocks, and ten right&quot; this is egocentric ordination. For this reason, usually when the experiment is conducted on native English speakers, they will arrange the objects in the mirror pattern.</p>
<p>But! Here's where it gets interesting, and how we come to the acceptance of a &quot;soft&quot; Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. I am a native English speaker, but I am also from the Great Plains. People from areas like the Great Plains, or deserts, or seafaring peoples, due to a lack of landmarks outside of cities, tend to ordinate geocentrically regardless of their native languages preference for expressing direction. So when I did this experiment, I arranged the shapes correctly, even though my perspective had changed. So while our language does affect our cognition, it can be proven to be &quot;trumped&quot; by other factors such as home environment, etc.</p>
<p>Now to give a counter example of why the &quot;strong&quot; Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has largely been discarded: (please remember this is an ELI5 so I am vastly oversimplifying) consider the Japanese language. In Japanese, there is not really a proper future tense. It is implied through context, or through using the present tense but marking location in the future. If we accepted the original Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, this would lead to the conclusion that native Japanese speakers are not able to fully consider the future in the same way as speakers of languages with a dedicated future tense. However, we can see this to be fallacious by looking at household savings rates in Japan as compare to America, where English, a language with a dedicated future tense, is the primary language. Japanese household savings rates are on average, much much higher than America's. This would seem to discredit a &quot;strong&quot; Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.</p>
<p>I think this is a little thick for an ELI5 so I apologize, but I hope that helped a little.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have zero science to back this up, just personal experience. I've spoken English and Portuguese fluently since I was a child (I also speak Spanish and basic Russian now). I live in the US, but when I spend about a week back in Portugal, I feel like something &quot;switches&quot; in my brain. I start dreaming in Portuguese and my tone, speed, inflection, and volume are all much different when I speak it. I vaguely remember reading an article once saying people who natively speak more than one language can experience different personalities. I believe it. I feel more outgoing and funny when I speak Portuguese, and I'm much more cynical and sarcastic when using English. </p>
<p>Edit: through the powers of google here's the link to the above referenced article
<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/11/multilingualism" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/11/multilingualism</a></p>
<p>There is a KEY distinction it appears between bilingualism and biculturalism which seems to be the most important factor. For me, it seems the &quot;differences&quot; I feel when speaking the two languages have more to do with cultural influence and less to do with the grammatical structure of the language. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are specific interactions to watch out for, but as a general rule, higher concentrations cause more damage. Perhaps you could specify what you are doing?</p>
<p>There are a number of acids that you can get for household use: vinegar (acetic acid), muriatic acid (HCl), battery acid (H2SO4), and many rust removers (usually phosphoric acid). Plastics and glass generally tolerate acids in low concentrations well, but plastics shouldn't be used with nitric acid, because it is a strong oxidizer. Metal components will react with strong acids like HCl and H2SO4. And if your jacuzzi is made of stone/marble, avoid acetic acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Anything below 7.0 pH will accelerate the breakdown of the heat exchanger. 7.0 is &quot;neutral&quot; pH anything below it is considered acidic. Metals dont like acids and break down into the water. As more metal enters the water the pH continues to fall into a sort of &quot;downward spiral&quot; it's not the end of the world and can be managed.</p>
<p>Most hot tubs are acrylic and fiberglass. The chemical used to lower the pH in the spa is sodium bisulfate. Sulfates are slowly built up in the water but are not a problem for the tub.</p>
<p>BTW use a scale control to help that heat exchanger last a little longer, hot water will &quot;push&quot; the calcium out of the water in the form of scale (like your shower head or faucets) having a nice layer of calcium on the exchanger coats it like your house plumbing helping to protect it from the water. You just dont want too much so the control helps.</p>
<p>If you're on a well be sure to test your water for pH, alkalinity, metals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I know I'm late to the thread, but I work at a pool store and I don't see anyone here mentioning Phosphates. They're in lots of household cleaners like spray counter cleaner. The phosphates in the cleaners &quot;eat up&quot; any chlorine/bromine/biguanide in your spa so you won't get any sanitation (which is the most important step in keeping your spa clear). The sanitation is the residual of chemical that is constantly kept up at about 1-2ppm if chlorine, 3-5ppm if bromine, and ~50ppm if biguanide. This constantly is killing algae and bacteria so you don't suddenly wake up one morning with a cloudy/green spa. Just stay far away from phosphates. And to go off of other posts, you shouldn't be too worried about acids in your spa as long as your pH doesn't fall below 7.0 for an extended period of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm young and don't have a house, but I honestly forgot about property taxes. Holy crap, how is that fair? A couple makes it their goal to purchase a home and raise their family and once they buy their house they have to pay an enormous amount in annual property taxes. Why?! That's just crazy to me! Does one get any of that back when filing their taxes? Do people who are past retirement age have to still pay those property taxes? A state like Sourh Dakota, who has no property taxes, how do they recoup that loss or is it just an altruistic motive by the state? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Artist: I make like no money making art. I bet I could live in some old warehouse in a near-abandoned district of the city with 20 other artists for almost no money and still make ends meet as an artist, though!</p>
<p><strong>20 artists move into warehouse not really zoned for residence, share a single 100-year old bathroom for 20 years, paint the walls with murals, and make quirky furniture out of garbage they find in the streets. They also paint the walls and sidewalks around the area because no one gives a shit about the area, but artists be like &quot;fuck it, lez make it pretty! ^_^&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>Musician: Man, I'm barely making any money playing music because I'm not a top 40 chart topper. But that new warehouse district seems pretty cheap, bet me and 15 musician buddies could live out our dreams there!</p>
<p><strong>Musicians move into another warehouse. Maybe nightly bizarre concerts aka people playing music in warehouses at 3 am while smoking cheap weed while other people paint with their bodies on the walls start occurring.</strong></p>
<p>Writer/Poet: There's just no place in the world for struggling writers unless you sell out to Hollywood or some shit. Where can I struggle to be the next Bukowski for a decade or two, drink cheap beer, starve myself and have raunchy sex with artists while listening to bizarre music at 3 am every night? Oh hey, I've heard about that still-pretty-cheap warehouse district! I bet me and 20 of my writer/poet friends could live in one of those hollowed out warehouse rooms there for cheap!</p>
<p><strong>Writer/poets move in; open a &quot;coffee shop&quot; sort of a makeshift space in one of the warehouses with water they can filter through a complex series of cloth slow drips that the writers are more addicted to than crack because writers need coffee shops real bad. It becomes a bit of a community hub, though. It inspired some local co-op gardening projects as well.</strong></p>
<p>Kid with $10 million Trust Fund: I need to move to a cool part of the city, that weird warehouse district is pretty cool, totally counterculture! I guess I can buy a floor of a warehouse and remodel it kind of or something.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee shop improves because trust fund kids buy $20,000 espresso machine and water filtration system for it.</strong></p>
<p>Young Professional who managed to land good-paying jobs out of college: I really want to be cool even though I have to work this corporate gig all day. I bet I could buy a loft-sized part of one of those old warehouses and remodel it and it would be cheap as fuck for me, plus that area is pretty dope!</p>
<p><strong>Warehouses now consistently selling in loft-sized units. Over half of the community is made up of trust fund kids and young professionals. There is an organic vegetable co-op that makes deliveries to everyone, the coffee shop has stable walls, and actual cups. There's a cafe that actually makes food for people. The concerts are beginning to get scheduled and start to appear in major newspapers as &quot;hip events&quot; in the city.</strong></p>
<p>Real Estate Developer: Hey, the ROI on converting these old warehouses into neo-luxury lofts is like 10,000%, I should buy up these warehouses and turn them into neo-luxury lofts!</p>
<p><strong>Average person living in the area now pays $5,000/month for a super hip loft in a remodeled warehouse that they live in alone, instead of being 1 of 20 people in an illegal warehouse floor. The artists, musicians, and writers don't live there anymore, except maybe 5% of them who somehow made a bunch of money by selling their art to the trust fund kids, or randomed their way into a 9.3 review on Pitchfork media because someone recorded them randomly playing in a warehouse. There are several high-end coffee shops carefully crafted with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Dutch wood paneling and several of the cities hottest new restaurants have opened. It is paradise, and real-estate values are skyrocketing.</strong></p>
<p>Foreign investors: Real estate prices in that warehouse district in X City are skyrocketing! I should buy up as many lofts as possible to protect my massive fortune!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gentrification is when lower cost, lower income neighborhoods are taken over by those with higher income, which raises real estate prices and rents and forces many of the previous residents out. It often also forces existing businesses out and sees them replaced by higher end and/or chains.</p>
<p>The typical pattern is that low income but trendy people, ie. the cliche starving artists, or unknown musicians, etc. will discover an area's cheap rents, loft spaces, bars with cheap booze. As they move in, so too do the coffee shops, thrift stores, record stores, and edgy restaurants that cater to these types (think vegan diner, no frills ethnic places). Middle income creative types (graphic designers, architects) discover these areas when attending some live music event or restaurant and notice the nice bones of the older, worn real estate. They start buying buildings and rehabbing them. Landlords start fixing up apartments to charge higher rents. Un-savable and ugly buildings get torn down and new buildings go up.</p>
<p>The minority businesses there before the artists can't afford the higher rents, so the ethnic salon or bodega close. Starbucks, cocktail bars, and Dr. Martin open stores. Even longtime home owners have trouble staying as rising home values mean property taxes outpace their income. A farmers market starts up, the local park gets rehabed. Yuppie families who can't afford homes in the upscale areas of town start discovering they can get more space in the gentrifying area, plus it makes them look cooler. Boutiques and baby stores pop up, as well as trendy furniture places. The vegan diner close, and Chipotle opens in its place.</p>
<p>It'd both good and bad. It cleans up rough parts of town and expands the amount of nicer areas that people with more income want to live. But it's bad because it displaces others who cannot afford to stay, and who see their community broken up. Often those who helped get the ball rolling by making it somewhat safer (cleaning parks, neighborhood watch) then cannot stay to enjoy the benefits of their efforts. Also, it's most often wealthy whites forcing out poor minorities, so there is the perception of the strong fighting the weak. And too often, independent businesses are put out of business and replaced by generic chains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are talking about urban gentrification, so I'll touch on my experience with rural gentrification.</p>
<p>I live in a village with a majority elderly working population. People are very poor, and they are being driven out from their homes by these outsiders looking for a nice holiday home in the heartland. The government's response is that this is a good thing, and they offer no benefits for the village to ease this transition.</p>
<p>We don't buy houses here. We inherit them. You're born in the house, you grow up here, you move to the nearby town or one of the larger villages for work, and when your parents are too old to go to work you move back into the home you grew up in, and when your parents die it becomes your house. </p>
<p>Now when parents die, rich city families swoop in. The vultures buy out the property and set about turning it into their holiday home. I can't say I'd be upset if this happens to me: I've got higher aspirations for my life than living in rural England for the rest of my days. But this threatens the village community. </p>
<p>The city folk don't enrol their children in the village school, they send them to a private academy about thirty miles away. The school is going to close in a few years because there's not enough children. The city folk bomb through the village at high speed, and during the school run they try to muscle people out of the road with their America-sized Range Rovers. They don't take part in the village politics unless they are complaining about something, like the Yewtree in the churchyard dropping quills and berries on their softtop, the farmer &quot;trespassing&quot; when he closes their gate to stop his cows from going in when he drives them through the village, the constant smell of muck in the air in spring, the farmers going to work at five in the morning, the Army marching through the village on training, or the children walking home from school for lunch (that's now a thing of the past unfortunately).</p>
<p>Used to be a time when you knew your neighbour. Used to be a time when you'd just walk round your neighbours if they were having a do in the garden and provided you brought a bottle you'd be welcome. Used to be a time when if your hens or ducks or rabbits went into their garden, you could just hop over the wall and get them back. Used to be a time when you could speak your mind without some soft skinned city sod squalling about racism or sexism or bigotry when it doesn't exist (best example: we're apparently racist for the Gurkhas living in a separate housing community than the rest of the village. It's not our decision where the Army builds their houses).</p>
<p>Our families have lived here for a thousand years. These outsiders only live here a few weeks a year, a couple of months in the summer at most. This village is our home, not some rich boy's hobby. Bankers driving beemers and Audis are not welcome here. </p>
<p>How do you think it makes us feel when people with more money than sense or decency walk around our home, looking down on us for being too poor to own a car when they have three?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL/DR; Gentrification is when property values increase to a point that people cannot afford to live in their homes anymore. The key feature that makes gentrification &quot;bad&quot; is that at a certain point (A-3 below) people don't have a choice but to sell their home and move. It is a result of market forces of property value, but it also follows racial lines with white/asians forcing blacks/hispanics out of their houses.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Gentrification is a result of three things:</p>
<p>1) The value of a property goes up when the neighborhood around it is nicer;</p>
<p>2) The taxes you pay for a property go up when the value of the property goes up;</p>
<p>3) If a property owner is paying more in taxes, they will charge more in rent to cover the cost.</p>
<p>...so if enough buildings in a poor neighborhood renovate, then the price of all buildings in the area go up. This has several outcomes:</p>
<p>A-1) People who own property in the area are more likely to sell. The increased value of their lot means that they get more than they paid for it. Why not move to another neighborhood and pocket a few thousand in profit?</p>
<p>A-2) Because more people are willing to sell their property, more property is bought up, renovated, and then sold/leased. This starts to attract real-estate investors and developers who greatly speed up the process. This creates a cycle of increasing value, increasing taxes, and increases in rent.</p>
<p>A-3) For people who don't want to sell their house, the value of their property increases as the buildings in the neighborhood are renovated. This means that rent prices increase, and for property owners there are more taxes to pay. At this point, many people don't have a choice about moving out; they can't afford to live here any longer.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>B-1) Businesses and local economies collapse. As higher-wage individuals move in, they don't buy the same products or shop in the same places as the lower-income individuals who moved out. Local businesses have to pay higher rent for their location, and also have fewer customers.</p>
<p>B-2) As businesses move out, their locations are bought up by businesses that cater to the new, slightly higher-income residents. They sell different products, and so the culture of the location changes.</p>
<p>B-3) As old businesses close down and move, they have to fire their employees. If these individuals can't find work at the new businesses then they are forced to sell their homes, feeding the cycle.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Now on one hand all this can be explained through market forces, but on the other hand American economic strata follow racial lines. There are more blacks and hispanics in poverty, and more whites and asians in the middle and upper class. So as gentrification progresses, a neighborhood typically goes from black/hispanic to asian/white.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the only people who benefit from gentrification are the people who own the property in the first place. Property owners typically make money by either selling their property for more than they paid for it, or by charging higher rent. For the poorest people in the neighborhood - those that rent or in government subsidized housing - they are forced to move out because of the increased cost of renting, but they don't have anything to sell. They are just kicked to the curb. Disproportionately these are minorities, elderly, or mentally disabled people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here.  In the unfortunate event this happens, we are trained to handle it.</p>
<p>Firstly, remember what most people call &quot;an ambulance driver&quot; is actually a trained medical professional, and in some districts, as trained as the Paramedic in the back of the ambulance. </p>
<p>Secondly, we are trained for the care of more than one critical patient at a time (Mass Casualties, First on scene, etc...). So we can prioritize, multi-task, while waiting on additional resources. </p>
<p>Thirdly, &quot;Protocol&quot; is what tells us how to handle situations. Some services, its strict as hell and says &quot;If <this>, then you have to <do this>&quot; and some services it will say along the lines of &quot;If <This>, consider &lt;this, this, this, or this 'within your scope of practice&gt;&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if I was transporting a critical patient, and we hit a pedestrian while transporting &quot;hot&quot;, we would immediately notify dispatch and local 911 dispatch. If neither my partner, patient, or me were injured... then my partner would initiate care to the wounded pedestrian while I made sure the original patient remained stable, we would have also requested mores units to turn care over to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In this case only one of the original ambulances had a patient in it, and it seemed really low-key because he was sitting up and joking with the paramedics as they transferred him to the new ambulance. </p>
<p>Adding a special NYC touch, while this was going on a city bus attempted to steer around the accident scene, hitting and dragging a massive piece of debris down the street for at least a block.

This leads to decoherence and incoherent dynamics, which are formally the same as observation. You can think of decoherence as being due to a measurement  that you are not told the outcome of, often because the measurer was an inanimate object. </p>
<p>Generally we cannot consider a quantum mechanical model for a wider environment, so some (weak) measurement effects will always be present. </p>
<p>As interactions with a wider environment transfer information about correlations within your system of interest, they also affect dynamics within the system.  If we could a big &quot;environment&quot; strongly to a small system we alter the dynamics in the system.  This can lead to the wavefunction of the system being fixed to a particular value and hence the quantum zero effect.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two major reasons:</p>
<p>It gives them an opportunity to weed out applicants for a variety of reasons, both said and unsaid, while citing a polygraph failure as the official reason. When you've got 200 people applying for 3 openings, you want a quick way to whittle that down. Offering a subjective test that's masquerading as an objective test is a really convenient way to do that.</p>
<p>Second reason, and possibly the more important one; not everyone knows it's bullshit. The purpose of a polygraph isn't to detect lies. That isn't possible. It's to get you to admit to things you otherwise would not have, even if it's just admitting that you left something out of your pre-polygraph questionnaire. When a polygraph is administered, the first step is to give you a very long form with a series of yes or no questions. These questions ask all sorts of things like have you ever committed a crime against a person, have you ever stolen property, have you ever committed a traffic offense, have you ever used or sold drugs, etc. If you mark yes to any of these questions, there is usually a blank where you are required to fill out an explanation. Sometime later you are given the actual polygraph test. The examiner has a copy of your questionnaire in front of him. First he will ask you a bunch of preliminary questions that they say are calibrating the equipment. A common one is that they will write the numbers 1 through 5 on a piece of paper and then circle one of them. They will tell you to answer &quot;no&quot; to all five of the following questions and then ask you &quot;is the number one circled, is number two circled, and so on&quot;. </p>
<p>Then they will ask you roughly 10 to 20 questions about your actual past, all of these questions are yes or no. They will ask each question probably 3 or 4 times so while you might get asked fifty to a hundred questions, you might only get asked about 15 unique questions. They just repeat the same ones over and over in different orders, ostensibly measuring your body responses to those questions.</p>
<p>While they are are more than willing to use your answers to those questions as a reason to reject you, the real purpose of the test comes after that. This is called the &quot;post examination interview&quot;. They will make a big show about turning off the equipment, unhooking all the sensors and gear, probably talking to you a little bit about what you had for lunch or what football team you like, all to get you to relax. They will tell you that the test is over and that you are no longer being monitored. Here comes the important part. They then finish by asking you if there's anything you might have left out or any answers you might have wanted to clarify, anything that you may have forgotten to put on your pre-interview questionnaire, etc. They will tell you that it's far better for you to admit to things now since the test results haven't been submitted yet, that you don't want to be found out to be lying later, that it will look good if you would admit to things and that it will show that you're willing to work with them and that you want to be honest if you tell them the whole story about something that you may have not been clear on before or that you may have left out before. If you require a little prodding, the examiner will say something like &quot;I've got some indicators of deception on questions 3 and 7 regarding your possible past drug use. Are you sure there isn't anything you're not telling me?&quot; It's a lie, there are no indicators of deception. There is no such thing as an indicator of deception. It's a trick to get you to say something you would not have told them otherwise.</p>
<p>This is where they get you. The combination of feeling relaxed after the stressful examination, and the desire to appear honest and forthcoming gets a massive amount of people to admit to all sorts of things that they otherwise would not have. &quot;Oh yeah there was that one time in high school where I guess I sold a couple bags of weed to some of my brother's friends, but I didn't think it was a big deal and it's not like I'm a drug dealer or anything&quot;. &quot;I wasn't sure if I should put it on the form that I filled out because I didn't get charged or anything, but there was that time seven years ago where I did get arrested for domestic violence, but like I said I didn't get charged and nothing came of it so it's not like I actually committed a crime. I didn't think it was a big deal&quot;. </p>
<p>Thank you for your honesty. Rejected.</p>
<p>The true purpose of the polygraph is to get you to admit to things and basically disqualify yourself. Even if the things you're admitting to by themselves would not have been that big of a deal, the fact that you didn't include them in your questionnaire or you may have given one answer to a background detective previously but gave a different kind of answer to the polygraph examiner, etc. <em>They're trying to weed out applicants</em>. It's far easier to have you do it to yourself than it is to pay a background detective to research you, or possibly risk some kind of &quot;they didn't hire me because I'm black&quot; lawsuit. If they can show you said A on the form and B to the examiner, you're rejected for lying, it doesn't matter what the smoke and mirrors in the &quot;lie detector&quot; say.</p>
<p>EDIT: a number of people are responding with comments along the lines of &quot;this isn't true, the polygraph really does measure things&quot;. Yes, it does. Namely heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity(perspiration). The hand-waving comes from where they use this data to imply that you're lying about something. There is no actual evidence those data points have anything to do with lying. A question about whether you've ever had sexual contact with a minor may elicit a response because you did, because you were the <em>victim</em> of child abuse, or because the question is just shocking. The data can't tell them which it is, or if you just happen to have a stomach ache. The data they collect does not detect lies. It detects stress (and more to the point, <em>possible</em> symptoms of <em>possible</em> stress). The underlying theory is that one who is lying is experiencing more stress during the lie than they are when they tell the truth, and that has never been proven to be true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Double jeopardy prevents someone from being re-charged with a crime after having been acquitted of same.  So if, for example, you reside in the state of California, and you are validly tried for the murder of John Doe and acquitted, you may never be re-tried for the murder of John Doe, whether by California, another state, or the federal government.  This is true even if you hold a press conference the next day to say &quot;Guess what?  I did it!&quot;  Post-acquittal confessions are not common--most people who get away with crimes are smart enough not to draw attention to this fact--but it's not unknown.  In most cases, those people do not face additional criminal charges due to double jeopardy.</p>
<p>But of course, no legal answer can be that simple.  As other responses have noted, the doctrine of dual sovereignty means that the federal government and individual states are treated as distinct from each other, each with their own law, and each with the authority to bring prosecutions for the violation of their law.  It is therefore possible that a single set of actions can constitute crimes in multiple jurisdictions, and while a failed prosecution for one charge eliminates the ability to bring the same charge (or a reasonably similar charge) a second time, this does not mean that sufficiently distinct charges are barred, as well.  Bottom line, under certain limited circumstances, the federal government may bring a prosecution concerning the same events (though not the same charges) as a failed state prosecution, and vice versa.  In the case of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), the Supreme Court announced a rule that still applies regarding the scope of double jeopardy:  following acquittal, the government may bring a second prosecution on additional charges arising out of the same underlying events as the first prosecution so long as both the new crime charged and the prior crime each contain an element of proof that the other does not.  </p>
<p>Let's go back to the California example, where the defendant has beaten a murder charge for killing John Doe, let's call it second-degree murder.  After the state acquittal, the federal government cannot come in and bring a first-degree murder charge:  this is because while first-degree murder contains elements not present in second-degree murder, there are no elements of second-degree murder not present in first-degree murder, so the later prosecution would fail the Blockburger test.  Going in the other direction, the federal government cannot charge with a less severe offense such as battery, since battery is a lesser-included offense (i.e., it is subsumed) in murder.  However, if the federal government wanted to charge the defendant with a violation of the victim's civil rights, 18 U.S.C. 242, that would potentially be possible, because there, the crimes have substantially different elements.  Therefore, in a situation where a criminal confessed guilt after acquittal, there might still exist other crimes in other jurisdictions that pass the Blockburger test and allow for a second prosecution.</p>
<p>Further, as Jennifer Huber-Julie has rightly pointed out, double jeopardy has nothing to do with the civil system, so a failed criminal prosecution does not impact one's ability to bring a civil suit.  (Note that there are protections against civil retrial, e.g., res judicata and collateral estoppel, but a failed civil suit would not preclude criminal charges, either.)  So confessing to a crime would open the door for a possible civil lawsuit--in the case of murder, the tort of wrongful death would apply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread is a good illustration of why you should be wary of legal advice on the Internet.</p>
<p>You cannot be found innocent of a crime. You are found either guilty or not guilty. Not guilty might mean the jury  think you did it, but are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Several things might happen to you if you are found not guilty and later admit to committing the crime.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you testified you may face charges related to perjury. Depending on the severity of the crime the prosecutor might try and charge you with contempt or some form of obstruction of justice. I'm not sure they would be successful, but they would probably throw whatever they could think of at you. Even if found not guilty they would get some satisfaction of disrupting your life and possibly holding you in custody until trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could possibly be tried by a different sovereign. If you were found not guilty in state court, double jeopardy does not prevent the federal government from prosecuting you for the same conduct. </p>
</li>
<li>You will likely face a civil lawsuit from the victim or victims family. This again depends on the crime. </li>
