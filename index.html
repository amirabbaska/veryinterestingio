		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The statement that &quot;ignorance of the law is not an excuse&quot; is not actually an ironclad rule, and it is in fact in tension with some basic legal principles.  Many people have little parts of this in the explanations already given, but let me see if I can put together the pieces.</p>
<p>First, the law distinguishes between acts that are &quot;malum in se&quot; (bad in itself) and &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; (bad because it's prohibited).  The classic example of &quot;malum in se&quot; is murder -- it's presumed that everyone knows it's wrong to kill.  (Note, though, that this may shift over time -- it didn't used to be the case that everyone was supposed to know that a husband was not allowed to slap his wife, or rape her; now we think they should know that.)  The classic example of &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; is the law stating that you have to drive on the right-hand side of the road (in the U.S.).  Of course, there's no moral element to this -- it could just as easily be the left-hand side -- and so you're not expected to have a moral intuition that you can't drive on the left.  But it's still illegal.</p>
<p>As some people have pointed out in this thread, part of the justification for treating many &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; acts as crimes regardless of knowledge is that when you undertake to do certain potentially hazardous things (like driving) you are presumed to take on responsibility for understanding how to do it lawfully.  In the case of driving, we make this explicit -- you have to have a license to drive, and you have to take a test on traffic laws before you can be licensed.  And while you don't (to my knowledge) have to take a test before you open a restaurant, you are expected to familiarize yourself with the local health codes -- usually by hiring an expert to help you.</p>
<p>Of course, there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of local, state, and federal laws and regulations that carry some sort of criminal or civil penalty, and not all of them address human safety.  Many laws primarily address other interests, such as tax collection, environmental protection, or simply aesthetic preferences (e.g., <a href="http://www.santafenm.gov/historic_preservation" target="_blank">&quot;historic preservation&quot; zones</a>).  It is perfectly possible to violate some of these laws without having assumed any particular duty to familiarize yourself with all of them.  For example, being a tourist in a national park does not reasonably carry with it the responsibility to become an expert on wildlife protection laws, forest fire safety laws, etc., etc -- nor to consult such an expert.  Requiring people to acquire expertise in multiple areas of law to undertake common, non-dangerous activities would be silly.  Yet people in those parks can be held liable for those laws all the same.  </p>
<p>You don't even have to go to a park to commit a crime, though.  Technically speaking, <a href="http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2015/05/if-i-find-an-eagle-feather-can-i-keep-it.html" target="_blank">if you pick up a bald eagle feather off the ground in your own back yard, you have committed a crime</a> -- even though you did nothing to the eagle, bald eagles are no longer endangered, and you may not even know what kind of feather it is, let alone the law protecting it.</p>
<p>That is, really, somewhat unfair, and legal scholars <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=619020093024127103117107020103114123102005063047062066086000020112083094091090088088027001040125108012013088008094082111120029021052054085039026069067093015113002004026085039007001081023117006004028112024001100019026029007013007025005097116115097005001&amp;EXT=pdf" target="_blank">debate the application and reach of this &quot;ignorance of the law&quot; principle</a>.  On the pro side, as /u/ViskerRatio notes, there are practical reasons for not making an absolute defense out of ignorance, since knowledge is very hard to prove.  On the con side, requiring detailed knowledge of the law just to interact with a feather on your lawn seems unreasonable.</p>
<p>Yet, as people have noted, in many situations the worst consequences do not actually follow from such technical violations.  Partly, of course, this is because many technical violations go unnoticed.  There is a certain amount of safety-in-obscurity at work.</p>
<p>Partly it is because of police and prosecutorial discretion; law enforcement officers may not arrest you, and prosecutors may decline to prosecute, if your act was truly without knowledge and the law is obscure.  This discretion is hardly a perfect safeguard, of course, because police and prosecutors (a) are human, and so may be biased in their application of discretion (b) are human, and so may just be rigid, hardass jerks who like punishing people; (c) <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/08/02/ignorance-of-the-law-is-no-exc" target="_blank">sometimes do not actually understand the law themselves</a>; and (d) are sometimes under perverse incentives to meet certain quotas, and a clear crime/violation, even if committed by accident, fits the bill.  But if none of those things is present, police or prosecutorial discretion can be a first-line safeguard against the prosecution of ignorant violations.</p>
<p>There are other layers of protection, too.  Some laws have a knowledge-of-the-law component built into them.  For example, in order to convict someone of &quot;structuring a bank transaction&quot; -- i.e., breaking up deposits into smaller amounts to avoid triggering the bank's duty to report large deposits to the government -- the prosecution has to prove that the defendant intended to avoid the reporting laws.  It's not enough to show small transactions -- you have to show, essentially, knowledge of the law. </p>
<p>Finally, sometimes courts will invalidate certain laws on the ground that a lack of notice violates the right to &quot;due process of law&quot; (guaranteed in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments).   So, for example, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8476324156679315934&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Lambert v. California</a>, the Supreme Court overturned a conviction under a law requiring felons to register with the local government within five days of arrival in the city.  The Court noted that many licensing schemes (say, business licenses, or car registration) required a person to register with the government, but this law was different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Violation of its provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever, mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, <em>circumstances which might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are completely lacking</em> . . . . We believe that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand. As Holmes wrote in The Common Law, &quot;A law which punished conduct which would not be blameworthy in the average member of the community would be too severe for that community to bear.&quot;  Its severity lies in the absence of an opportunity either to avoid the consequences of the law or to defend any prosecution brought under it. Where a person did not know of the duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with due process. Were it otherwise, the evil would be as great as it is when the law is written in print too fine to read or in a language foreign to the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;ignorance of the law&quot; rule, then, is not a hard-and-fast thing, but one among a set of competing principles (including the principle of due process of law).  And it should be applied, when things work right, with a reasonable appreciation of the practicalities, and with due regard for basic fairness.  It doesn't always work out, and people really <em>do</em> sometimes get railroaded for things they didn't understand to be crimes.  But that's the idea.</p>
<p>I'll just add that there's a strong libertarian argument that we should prohibit fewer things and/or attach serious penalties to fewer things, so that &quot;the law&quot; accords better with people's intuitions about what might be contained in it.  On the other hand, most laws and regulations exist to solve some perceived problem, and if you want fewer laws you may have to wrestle with more social problems.  It's all a bit of a trade-off.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Even though it would be impossible, even for someone with substantial legal training, to be aware of every law in operation in every aspect of a state's activities, this is the price paid to ensure that willful blindness cannot become the basis of exculpation. Thus, it is well settled that persons engaged in any undertakings outside what is common for a normal person, such as running a nuclear power plant, will make themselves aware of the laws necessary to engage in that undertaking. If they do not, they cannot complain if they incur liability.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I worked in POS design for a major retailer for many years.</p>
<p>There are a few answers. As others have said, they build them out for peak load. Putting in a bunch of cash registers that get very little use, while not cheap, isn't that big of a number on their bottom line.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have excess capacity for when systems go down. Your store staff isn't going to be able to do more than swap out a few basic plug in components, and in many companies, they won't even go as far as that. You will need to wait a day or two for a tech to show up. Hell, even if your staff could do something like swap in a new scanner, you are still knocking that line out of service for the amount of time it takes someone to go find a spare, unbox it, set it all up, etc.</p>
<p>Also having a bunch of lanes, even though they aren't in use at the MOMENT can simplify bringing added cashiers in or out quickly. You can have someone hop onto a new register and get going without disrupting the existing line for the minute or two it takes to swap someone out.</p>
<p>Also, in a perfect world, stores are rotating their use among the registers. This helps reduce the wear and tear on them making failures like a swipe reader or pin pad wearing out less likely, and discovering that that register you planned on using for the biggest day of the year is dead.</p>
<p>Edit: Quick additional item i thought at. You also have product at the store in those lanes, and want to try and maximize what sells, what the variety is between lines, and collect metrics on it. Did the pogs not sell well because you only put them on every 3rd checkout lane, and the store in question for whatever reason never uses lanes 3 6 and 9?  Lane 2 is heavy on magazines that are all at the end of their run, lets send some extra traffic there and try and move them. Hell, even &quot;the candy they stocked on lane 5 is almost expired, lets work that one extra hard today&quot;.</p>
<p>We played around with all kinds of optimization stuff but found it was pretty much ignored at the local level for various reasons, some valid, so we gave up on it, but I'd be surprised if someone on the scale of a walmart or target wasn't using automation for at least some form of lane selection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A better way to word this would be, &quot;Why <em>would</em> it be possible to imagine a hue that is completely outside one's experience, to the point where the neurological circuitry to process such a hue may not even exist?&quot;</p>
<p>Anything you can imagine or visualize is necessarily going to be informed by and at least in part based on things you've previously experienced. By the time a person is old enough to ask a question like &quot;Why can't I imagine a new color&quot; their brain has probably already been exposed to every possible color or combination of colors available to them (especially nowadays with such widespread and easy access to video games, television, and digital artistic tools like Photoshop and Paint Tool SAI) and has adjusted itself to recognize and process them.</p>
<p>You can't imagine a new color because there's nothing to build it from; it would necessarily have to be derived from a color you already know, or a combination of those colors. Where would you even start? It's as if someone asked you to build a house out of a brand new, never before seen material, but without using any currently known or even hypothetically possible substances or combination of substances whatsoever to create it. You'd need to invent new physics and chemistry before you could even begin.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to clarify that I don't necessarily think it is impossible for a person to <em>experience</em> a new color, either because they weren't exposed to it before, or because of drug use, injury, or some other phenomenon. What I don't think is possible is for a person to <em>purposefully imagine</em> a brand new color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that you're a meditation master and have breached the deepest mysteries of the mind and imagined yourself a color never before seen by human eyes. Or you've dropped acid for the first time and you're lost in the 17th Celestial Realm being shown the wonders of the universe by Marley and Batman on a unicycle. In fact, you have only &quot;seen&quot; this new color with your mind's eye. How would you go about telling someone about it?</p>
<p>All you could really say for positive is that it's a new color. If asked to describe it, you could only say what it was not. &quot;It's not red... it's not blue... it's not white or black or the absence of color at all.&quot; If it were &quot;blueish&quot; or &quot;greenish&quot;, for example, it would just be some shade of blue or green. If you take away all the colors it's not, you have nothing else left. It's a limitation of the language; you can never even walk someone through your mental process to that color as nothing in nature has ever possessed it.</p>
<p>The best you could hope for is that this new color produced a strong emotional response in you or some other synesthesic experience. At least then you could say that the new color &quot;is like stepping on a vacuum cleaner in the dark, but you're worried it's actually a python&quot;. People will generally think you're a pretensions waste of time, but there'll be at least someone out there who think you're cool. If you say that the new color &quot;is the pure love felt for all living sentient beings in all temporal realms&quot; then people will definitely find you insufferable and think you're only bullshitting them because you want to sell your self-written book on success.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I don't think it's impossible to imagine a new color. It's a neat mental exercise that pairs well with doing nine impossible things before breakfast. Helpful for the budding artist. If you did succeed, I expect that it would define your artistic career trying to describe it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a myriad of hypothesis to explain how sexual reproduction first developed. I did my undergraduate thesis on yeast epigenetics (gene regulation through histone modification) so I'm only going to discuss the theory pertaining to that.</p>
<p>In short, it was an accident. A cell developed the ability to share genetic material and through this was able to survive/leave more offspring. Sexual reproduction was likely gradual, with the sharing of some genetic information at first followed by full chromosomal recombination after. Sexual reproduction creates diversity and helps eliminate bad genes from the gene pool. This is typically a net positive despite the increased costs of sexual reproduction. Therefore cells that could do sexual reproduction generally had higher fitness than those that didn't.</p>
<p>Early evolutionary versions of this can be seen in certain bacteria. Bacteria use a sex pilus, basically a tube that sticks out of the cell. The first cell pokes a second recipient cell and the two fuse. Genetic material is then shared between bacteria. </p>
<p>For yeast, this is different. Yeast have the option of reproducing asexually and sexually. They can bud, basically producing an identical copy of themselves or under certain conditions they can undergo sexual reproduction and even class switching (kind of like male to female and vice versa). For yeast, they can have a haploid form (non duplicated genome) or a diploid form (duplicated genome). The diploid does sexual reproduction. The haploid does not. It's likely that during some point a cell that reproduced exclusively via budding was able to combine genetically with another to form this diploid cell. These diploid cells may have existed for quite some time before one received a mutation causing it to split again into 4 haploid cells. Then over time, the process evolved until a point where we have yeast cells that could undergo meiosis (sexual reproduction) as we know it today.</p>
<p>So to summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Development of sexual reproduction occurred gradually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything began as a single celled organism that reproduced asexually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A random mutation occurred that allowed this cell to fuse with another and share genetic material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over subsequent generations this fusing and sharing of genetic material developed.</p>
</li>
<li>Eventually this process would lead to meiosis (sexual reproduction) as we know it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knows much about the origins of sexual reproduction. I'm sure there are ideas, but it's all just speculation. It's very difficult to definitively find out how something evolved over a billion years ago.</p>
<p>As for how life formed before sexual reproduction, that's easy! For single-celled organisms, the cells grow until they reach a certain size, then divide into two smaller cells and keep on growing. Many non-sexually-reproducing (asexual) organisms are single-celled, but there are some multicellular organisms like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_\(genus\)" target="_blank">hydra</a> that reproduce by new organisms budding off of older ones and just breaking away when they are big enough. Most (all?) types of fungi and some plants can also reproduce asexually, although they usually retain the ability to reproduce sexually under certain circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obviously there's no confirmation of the exact process (like with any early development) but all you really need is the concept of multiple cells sharing information to create new cells, which doesn't sound too out there. Like anything with early evolution, it would just be random mutation, with so many different simple organisms you get a monkey on typewriters scenario and something dominant emerges to set the trend for the next process of evolutionary development.</p>
<p>This could obviously fail enough times, until it happens and two cells combine information in such a combination that it creates a new cell that's superior enough to survive, and also possesses the characteristic to seek out a completely separate organism. Presumably once you get to that point it can just continue from there.</p>
<p>Presumably lots of potential sharing of genetic information between different numbers of bodies was possible, but natural selection favored a binary system - complex enough that it can create favourable combinations of genes, but simple enough it doesn't become too limited by those conditions.</p>
<p>From there sexual dimorphism appears, where of the two types, they begin to exhibit different purposes in the reproductive cycle, creating the male and female distinction that is also then passed down (typically classed as the female &quot;bearing&quot; the offspring in some way). In a way this is easily the more interesting question of how exactly this came about, of at what point the two sexes would be pressured by the environment to function differently and how this was somehow a strategy that made those organisms more successful than others without dimorphism. </p>
<p>Sexual organs would develop depending on an exaggeration of those sexual differences, with females overall taking on the greatest burden of reproductive time and males overall taking the lesser amount. This would continue to affect organ development, and then much later the behavioural and societal roles caused by the simple difference in time required to make new life.</p>
<p>I am no biologist though, so feel free to correct me as I could be wildly wrong without a formal understanding backing up those ideas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before sexual reproduction, there was asexual reproduction- basically self-cloning or mitosis. However, this process makes populations susceptible to diseases/bad mutations/etc. When more advanced cells emerged, they &quot;discovered&quot; that swapping DNA and getting some diversification in there was better than simple self-cloning. And as cells got more and more advanced, so did sexual reproduction get more and more advanced, eventually resulting in distinct sexes.</p>
<p>On &quot;discovered&quot;: these DNA swaps only became the reproduction status quo because the more genetically diverse offspring survived/thrived at a higher rate. There wasn't discovery so much as there was happily beneficial accident that became widely adopted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Questions of this kind, until we get some actual evidence say from genetic lineage reconstruction etc, are best approached as trying to find plausible paths of evolution rather than trying to answer a single definitive 'how'. That in mind, something like the following is among the most plausible sequences..</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the very first organisms didnt even have nuclei, they simply 'grew', both their cell bodies, and nuclear matter, and split into pieces that each continued to live separately... thus multiplying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once nuclear matter became more organized, 'splitting' or 'budding off' became a bit more sophisticated and under tighter nuclear control, where a mechanism for duplication and separation of nuclear matter would have developed (which in its modern form, still exists as mitosis or cell division in modern organims).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>errors in such 'splitting off' would have produced cells/organisms that ended up having multiple copies of nuclear matter but otherwise normal. This (i.e. polyploidy) is actually still fairly common, with some estimates that 30% to 80% of modern plants are that way, and happens with animals as well (and occassionally even in humans!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, polyploid organisms can have the copies of nuclear matter diverge just enough from different mutations/changes accumulating in the different copies, that they now have an interesting possibility... combinations of the two copies of the same chromosomal matter might create even more fit versions of organisms with newer or extra capabilities. So organisms with sloppy enough nuclear control that they start mixing up their copies of genetic matter now have a distinct long term advantage in evolving faster to suite the environment and develop new capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This would inevitably lead to something starting to look like 'meiosis' that we see in gamete production in modern animals today, where the nuclear matter that are similar or 'homologous' line up, intermix, then separate out into daughter cells. Now at this stage this would still be reproduction just unicellularly/asexually, but really, this genetic mixing of copies of genetic matter is at the root of sexual reproduction (even now!), regardless of whether the genetic mixing happened only with copies of material retained internally or with external partner too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, having come this far, getting to the actual next stage of 'sexual' reproduction with a partner is actually very easy and obvious. Since the cells internalls already have the mechanism for properly sorting and mixing genetic matter, even something as simple as one cell engulfing another and having their genetic matter combined together would lead to their genetic matter mixing in the next cell splitting phase, thus leading to sexual reproduction. Such behavior would be selected even more strongly in evolution as it would bring together different genetic toolsets which might have evolved under separate environmental pressures or lineages. And soon the ritual 'engulfing' could become some specialized 'fusion' or 'exchange' of sorts. (Although in fact, if you look at the sperm entering the ova, one might thing it is still being engulfed too).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rest of the way is just a matter of organisms becoming multicellular, having specialized tissues and functions, and evolving more specialized ways of achieving the same genetic matter sharing process as they evolve. </p>
</li>
<li>The crux is, sexual reproduction isnt very magical, nor would it have required any fancy leap of ability or 'lucky break' to allow it. Indeed, it would be almost inevitable and very strongly pushed towards by evolution because of how fundamentally straightforward it is, and how big an advantage it offers by allowing different genetic variants to be combined together to patch together new abilities for the organism.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you have observed, there are a lot of ways to make demonyms in English. While we can draw some generalisations for which kinds of place names (toponyms) get which kinds of demonyms, there are no hard and fast rules. The various suffixes come from different linguistic sources, though, and that has some bearing on which ones are used where. We can observe some trends:</p>
<h1>-an / -ian</h1>
<p>The Latin-derived suffixes <em>-an</em> and <em>-ian</em> are by far the most common choice for English demonyms. One reason is that English names for non-English-speaking places are often Latin-derived: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Italian, Croatian, Arabian, Indian, American</em> (the name predates America's settlement by English speakers)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>-an</em> is also common for Spanish and Portuguese-speaking places: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mexican, Paraguayan, Mozambican</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The simple suffix has become the go-to for most newer demonyms, even if the place names are not Latin at all: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hawaiian, New Jerseyan, Chicagoan</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Variations include <em>Torontonian</em> and <em>Panamanian</em></p>
<p>For toponyms that end in <em>-o</em> or <em>-u</em>, if the suffix is true to its Latin roots it becomes <em>-vian</em>: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Oslovian, Peruvian</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Some places have Latin-based demonyms even though the English toponym is quite different from its Latin equivalent: </p>
<ul>
<li>Guernsey → <em>Sarnian</em></li>
<li>Newcastle → <em>Novocastrian</em></li>
<li>Halifax → <em>Haligonian</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And of course </p>
<ul>
<li>Norway → <em>Norwegian</em></li>
</ul>
<p>which spawned the analogous demonyms </p>
<ul>
<li>Galloway → <em>Galwegian</em></li>
<li>Glasgow → <em>Glaswegian</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>-ite</h1>
<p><em>-ite</em> comes from Greek. Few Greek demonyms have survived into modern English, but the suffix lives in the public consciousness due to its use for nations and tribes in the Old Testament. It has become another common choice for recently coined demonyms: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Manhattanite, Wisconsinite, Tokyoite, Delhite, Vancouverite</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>-er</h1>
<p>Many places in Germany have identical demonyms in German and English using the suffix <em>-er</em>, such as Berliner and my favourites: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hamburger and Frankfurter</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>-er</em> is Germanic in origin and is used with many toponyms of pure English origin: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Londoner, New Yorker, Marylander, Aucklander</em></li>
</ul>
<p>and of other Germanic languages: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Amsterdammer, Stockholmer</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>-ish</h1>
<p><em>-ish</em> is also Germanic in origin but is less versatile because it's a adjectival suffix; you don't refer to someone as an Irish, a Spanish, a Turkish, or a Swedish. Some places have one demonym for the people collectively, and another for an individual: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Irishman, Spaniard, Turk, Swede</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Suffix-less demonyms like </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Turk, Swede, Dane, Czech, Pole</em> and <em>Afghan</em></li>
</ul>
<p>derive from their local languages. In fact, these are not demonyms in the strict sense because they do not derive from place names; rather, they are the opposite phenomenon, wherein the place name derives from the name of an ethnic group or tribe.</p>
<p><em>-ch</em> of <em>Dutch</em> and <em>French</em>, and <em>-ic</em> of <em>Icelandic</em> are derivatives of <em>ish</em>. <em>French</em> deriving from Germanic <em>frankisch</em> / Old English <em>francisch</em>.</p>
<h1>-ese</h1>
<p><em>-ese</em> is Romance in origin. It comes from Latin <em>-ensis</em>, which is commonly seen in the scientific names of species. It is common in demonyms for Romance-speaking places and places that became connected with Europe as a result of explorations by Romance speakers, particularly ones in East Asia and French-speaking places in Africa. These demonyms also are more often used as adjectives or collective nouns, rather than referring to individuals. When the toponym ends in -o and isn't Romance in origin, the suffix becomes <em>-lese</em> (<em>Congolese, Togolese</em>).</p>
<h1>-i</h1>
<p>Several places in the Middle East and South Asia use the suffix <em>-i</em>, which probably has sources in several unrelated languages: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Israeli, Iraqi, Emirati, Azerbaijani, Nepali</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>misc</h1>
<p>And of course there will always be outliers with their own unique linguistic history: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>German, Swiss, Greek, Icelandic, Argentine, Cypriot, Montenegrin, Edinburgoynian</em></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What makes profanity different is that it invokes a different part of our brain than our normal speech uses. The part of the brain that controls aggression is called the amygdala which also controls other emotions. So one theory is that profanity is a type of verbal aggression, and our brain recognizes them as such, causing us to feel differently when we hear or think them. There's nothing about the words themselves that makes them different, it's how we associate these words as being aggressive or in some other ways taboo.</p>
<p>This can explain why certain illnesses that affect the brain can cause some individuals to swear more than they would if they didn't have the illness. Invoking this part of our brain can be done with profanity. For example when he hurt ourselves, we often yell profanity as an outlet of aggression which has pain-reliving applications. This is probably due to an evolutionary benefit of being in an aggressive state of mind when you feel pain, as it will help empower you to defend yourself if you are under attack.</p>
<p>That's not to say profanity is always used as aggression, such as the way we use it to emphasize things. Since these words can invoke the amygdala, it can alter how we perceive a statement when he hear it with profanity that causes us to emphasize the meaning of that statement. This is probably why the F-Word is used so often in casual speech, it literally alters the way our brain handles words. Also the more you use profanity, the more your brain will be comfortable with profanity, and will invoke less emotion when you say or hear it than you would if you don't speak with profanity on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The tabooness of the profanity is due to the emotional charge these words are associated with. Our societies decided to make these emotionally charged words taboo as to avoid invoking negative feelings. Once a word becomes taboo, there's societal pressure to avoid using the word, so really it's compounding our instinct to avoid using profanity in certain situations where you would normally avoid taboo subjects. This explains why we might refrain from using profanity at work, but might use it a lot when we are with our personal friends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bad words are bad on purpose, by design.</p>
<p>Since humans sometimes want to offend others, it's useful to have words that have the offensiveness built into the word itself.</p>
<p>Why is &quot;poop&quot; not a bad word but &quot;shit&quot; is?  They both have the same denotation, but different connotations.  That's on purpose.  We may need to talk about the subject with a child (&quot;poop&quot;) or a doctor (&quot;feces,&quot; &quot;stool&quot;) or I may want to compare someone to something disgusting in which case I use the word &quot;shit&quot; because that way it's obvious I'm being crude.</p>
<p>Naturally the bad words tend to refer to things that are disgusting (bodily functions), or formerly considered extremely private (sex), or else something someone should be respectful about (religion).</p>
<p>If you have used classic swears so much they seems just like normal words to you, then perhaps you understand racial epithets better?</p>
<p>Can I talk about &quot;Former President Barack Obama, our first nigger President&quot; without being offensive?  &quot;Oh, I wasn't <em>trying</em> to be offensive&quot; I could claim.</p>
<p>A. you don't have to intend it, the offense is part of the word itself (not the sounds, but the definition in common English</p>
<p>B. Since you <em>KNOW</em> (or should know) point A, you're lying or stupid if you say such a thing and act like people shouldn't have been offended because you &quot;didn't mean it.&quot;</p>
<p>What do you think the word &quot;nigger&quot; means?  It does not mean &quot;black person.&quot;  It means something more like &quot;offensive word used to dehumanize black people.&quot;</p>
<p>Racists that use the word know what they're doing.  Why are they using that word instead of &quot;black&quot; or &quot;African American&quot; or something else?  Because it means something else.  It's not a synonym for &quot;black.&quot;</p>
<p>Likewise, &quot;shit&quot; is not a synonym for &quot;poop.&quot;  They're not the same thing, even though they both refer to the same physical substance.</p>
<p>By the way, many adults consider swearing to be quite rude regardless of whether there are children present.  The number of them have gone down, I'm sure, or at least the ones that will speak up has gone down.</p>
<p>But if you swear in public in front of people you don't know approve of swearing, that makes you a dick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that they &quot;developed&quot; a taboo, as that they were intended from the outset to be crude, vulgar, shocking, or offensive. This has probably been the case throughout human language history;  linguistic studies of ancient cultures shows that they had these types of words and expressions </p>
<p>These words have always referred to things that were considered taboo, private, or not usually discussed in polite company: religious blasphemy, sex and sexual organs, bodily waste, etc. In olden times, it was likely that the blasphemy/religious swearing was considered more &quot;shocking', as you were literally damning God or calling a curse down on someone. Nowadays, this stuff is much less offensive, so it tends to be the sexual-based terms that are considered the 'worst'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The modern version of English swear words, the ones where some words are taboo while others with similar meanings are not, developed during the middle ages (IIRC).  It had to do with the nobility/commoner divide.  Words like &quot;defecate&quot; have latin origins - the nobility and clergy were generally educated in latin.  Words like &quot;shit&quot; have germanic origins, spoken by the commoners.  </p>
<p>So the words the nobility used inherited the sense of being proper/polite/pious, while the commoner versions inherited the sense of being rude/vulgar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Right now, the words that will make people cringe the most are going to be words mocking the disabled and non-whites. Since the civil rights era, we place way more value on diversity and inclusion than before.</p>
<p>Recently, words that alluded to bodily functions (sex, going to the bathroom) were the most taboo. Early 20th century America was kind of obsessed with hygiene and purity (Victorian morals, naturalist ideals).</p>
<p>A while ago, talking about bodily functions was totally ok, but saying something like &quot;zounds&quot; (short for &quot;god's wounds&quot;) was totally taboo, because blasphemy was a bigger deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Tall people usually get the worst of it. It happens when your blood pools in your legs and doesn't go back to the brain fast enough, starving it of that precious oxygen. It can also happen while having bowel movements, peeing right after you wake up, standing still for long periods of time in hot, crowded places (see when teenagers pass out during boy-band concerts? Yeah, that's what it is), having your arms up for too long, or over-excerting yourself at the gym. These episodes can be countered by contracting your abdomen and exhaling strongly. Also a diet rich in sodium, and lots of water.</p>
<p>Not so fun fact: I knew an old guy who had heart surgery. One day he went to pee and died. His heart couldn't take it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally when you move around, muscles in your legs assist in the venous return of blood against gravity from the lower part of your body. </p>
<p>When you are sitting, these don't work as hard, and blood can pool as you stand up, leading to a temporary decrease in blood pressure to the brain until those muscles get back on the job.</p>
<p>This can affect people to differing severity, and the severity can differ depending on how abrupt the transition is for a single person. Some people don't have any problem at all with it, some people can pass out momentarily. </p>
<p>Getting up slowly can usually moderate the effect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Staying hydrated is very important, most people don't drink enough water and are on the dehydrated side, this can make things worse.  Do you take blood pressure medication?  It's a common side effect, you should speak with your doctor.  </p>
<p>A common tip is to get up slowly.  If you're laying down, sit up slowly, sit for a minute and let your body catch up.  Then stand slowly, and stand for a minute, let your body catch up again, and then go.</p>
<p>If you're hydrated and still getting this, you should see your doctor.  You may have hypotension or something else going on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual opera singer here.</p>
<p>The same reason why anyone gains weight when they are in a high-stress job that requires a lot of travel. It's a stressful job with intense hours during production periods, and it gets really easy to neglect exercise and just eat crappy foods, especially because you usually celebrate after performances with your friends/colleagues/family. You often don't get a lot of sleep, and that can also mess with your overall health.</p>
<p>As far as actual singing goes, there's actually no evidence that being overweight makes your voice bigger, lets you sing louder/over an orchestra, or anything like that at all. If anything, vocal scientists are finding that being in better physical shape actually IMPROVES vocal stamina and quality, just as being in shape improves performance in any physical activity.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, being fat has some &quot;advantages&quot; when learning to sing classically. Some of the most common phrases to singers is that they need &quot;to be grounded,&quot; &quot;sing from their diaphragm&quot;, &quot;have low-breath,&quot; etc. When you're carrying around a lot of extra belly weight, you have a constant tugging-down feeling. You have extra weight physically pulling the breath mechanism downwards. It can help in learning to sing.</p>
<p>Also, until recently, it didn't matter if you were fat and unhealthy. If you had a god-like voice, you could look however you want and still perform and get good work. Opera used to be (and, IMO, SHOULD still be) about the voice and music over anything else.</p>
<p>Now that there is a big push for opera singers to LOOK like the roles they play (nobody wants to see a 300 lb Juliet anymore), many professional singers have taken to losing weight in unhealthy, crash diets. They lose weight so quickly, they are unable to feel the changes that happen in their body and take time to make proper adjustments. They no longer feel &quot;grounded&quot; because they don't have the weight actually &quot;grounding&quot; them. So their technique suffers, their voice gets &quot;lighter&quot;, they have an existential crisis, say they can only sing when at a certain weight, and eat themselves into oblivion again.</p>
<p>Those who lose weight responsibly and healthily rarely, if ever, have any problems singing.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR It's a big, mental game. Some singers think they can only sing at a certain weight and size, and actively try to stay large.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, no one really knows for sure why, but there are a few theories. Opera singing requires extensive use of the diaphragm. Some theories suggest that the singers' bodies undergo changes over time due to this (such as expanded ribs). Another theory suggests that a larger mass (mouth, lungs, chest, really everything) helps project the voice over the orchestration. This seems to be backed up by the singers who insist that when their weight fluctuates, their voices suffer. For singers, in general, it's a propagated cautionary tale that weight loss surgery ruins the voice. Additionally, opera houses currently think that slimmer singers will heighten the interest in opera (here's looking at you, Patricia Petibon). However, the opera houses often insist that it is very difficult to find slim people who have powerful voices.
But on a totally different note, a lot of studies show that a larger body mass doesn't necessarily mean that the voice resonates better. So, a lot of people now say that stomach fat must help pull on the diaphragm and thus helps support the voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just a fun story to add to the discussion. I can't offer any scientific evidence. Only an anecdote told to my by my opera singer professor back in group voice. </p>
<p>She said that different bodies sometimes just produce different qualities of sound. She talked of a very large opera singer who had a large voice with &quot;girth&quot; to it. She said her voice had this immense warmth and depth to it that utterly entranced audiences. But due to health issues she absolutely had to lose weight. When she dropped a significant amount of weight, her voice's timbre seemed to have changed from deep and warm to somewhat brighter.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a hormonal change that caused this. Being healthier might have balanced out her hormones and maybe taken some pressure off her throat and various core muscles and organs. She was by no means any less talented, nor was her voice any less beautiful and graceful. However it had shifted in its previous qualities.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that finding an ideal weight for oneself is most important. Breath control and health don't just spring from nowhere. You must be healthy to sing well and for long periods of time, and must practice all the time. And health is probably definitely most important nowadays.</p>
<p>Perhaps being an abundant opera singer was a sign of decadence and wealth and maturity? Who knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets talk first about why many animals <em>do</em> have mating seasons. The reason is usually quite simple: offspring born at certain times of the year have a better chance at survival.  For example, deer mate in the fall and give birth in late spring, ensuring they have plenty of food and time to grow before the harsh winter season.  Many tropical fish spawn when the rains come at the end of the dry season, providing their offspring with access to shelter and food in the newly flooded forests along the banks of their home rivers.  </p>
<p>In species where offspring survival isn't seasonal, breeding seasons don't tend to exist. This holds for many (but not all) tropical species, including all the great apes.  And it holds for humans.  </p>
<p>So to get to specifics, below are some reasons it doesn't necessarily make sense for humans to have breeding seasons:</p>
<p>A) none of our related species have them, so neither did our ancestors. </p>
<p>B) Humans are fundamentally tropical (having originated in tropical regions), and thus our &quot;native climate&quot; didn't have the harsh winters that a breeding season is often timed to avoid</p>
<p>C) Humans live in groups and use technology, and this insulates us from the variability of our environment, meaning our infants are less vulnerable to external environmental conditions</p>
<p>D) Humans have very long infancies, meaning no matter when they are born they are going to be experiencing a full year's worth of climate variation as a baby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like all other organisms, our mating strategy is part and parcel of our overall survival strategy.</p>
<p>In our case, we are extreme &quot;K-specialists&quot;. We devote a <em>huge</em> amount of investment and resources in our offspring, compared to, say, willows who just scatter their seed to the wind by the millions.</p>
<p>Our females have developped a strategy of concealed ovulation. Current thinking is that by concealing her ovulation and maintaining a perpetual state of potential sexual readiness, the human female makes it difficult for males to know whether her offpring are theirs. The male counter-strategy is to be at hand as often as possible to prevent cuckoldry. Together, this strategy and counter-strategy promote pair-bonding, monogamy and dual parental investment, thus maximising parental investment in offspring.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a strain of thought right now that it's due partially to fully bipedal motion. </p>
<p>Most of the drawbacks of bipedal motion are born by the woman, greater angle of the femur into the knee creates much greater incidence of tron ACL/MCL etc. But the big one is a much narrower birth canal than even our closest relative, the Bonobo. A Bonobo is pregnant for 7 months, humans 9. Bonobos come out of the womb capable of climbing and clinging to their mothers. Human babies are near-useless lumps for 3 months. We really should be pregnant for much longer but simply cannot keep a baby in that long. A baby is such an incredible burden on a mother that the time in which she has him is irrelevant. What is more important is the social setting she has. It's also probably one of the reasons women get in ovulation sync after long-term exposure to each other. It's more important to have babies communally than to have them at a certain time in the season. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
