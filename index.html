<p>Another interesting approach is Magnetised Target Fusion (lookup General Fusion) which could potentially do a lot better for Q value than traditional magnetic confinement approaches. </p>
<p>The idea is to produce a relatively low-temperature plasma, inject it into a chamber, and then rapidly compress it with mechanical means (pistons). This raises the plasma temperature very rapidly, and the heat of fusion is absorbed by some kind of thermal transfer material (in General Fusion's case, a molten mixture of Lead and Lithium). </p>
<p>In many ways, their approach is similar to Inertial Confinement (like the National Ignition Facility at LLNL), but instead of the liner of the fuel pellet imploding to compress the fuel, acoustic waves travelling through the molten metal act to compress the initial plasma. These techniques don't do ignition with a self-sustaining reaction - but it's early days for them yet, so watch this space...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To the best of my knowledge there are no nuclear fusion reactors currently that actually have energy production systems in place. That being said, you can compare the thermal output to the input to get a rough idea. For fusion reactors this is the Q value, the ratio of the fusion energy output to the heat energy added to the reactor to sustain the reaction. ITER is designed to have a Q value of 10, outputting 500MWth from 50MW auxiliary heating. Q&gt;1 is &quot;breakeven&quot;, but Q&gt;10 is important for ignition, the point where the plasma can heat itself, mostly from alpha particles, without having to have its energy harvested and put back into the system through some external heating.</p>
<p>A good approximation is that electrical output is about 1/3 thermal output, so if ITER achieves its goal it would be able to produce about 167MW of electricity from 50MW. However, in a reactor that can achieve ignition the input energy is only necessary at the beginning, not continuously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is talking about the Q value which is good but from the way you mentioned economics it probably isn't what you're looking for?</p>
<p>At the moment all we can really say for certain is &quot;fusion will be expensive&quot;. The running theory at the moment with fusion reactors is basically bigger is better. This naturally means that the cost of a working fusion plant will run into the tens of billions just to build the damn thing. Then there's the Deuterium/Tritium fuel mix which needs to be sourced, kept and used as with any other fuel. We're looking at around 10x the current cost of electricity. Although there will be an economies of scale effect which kicks in as tritium production gets online, deuterium becomes more widely available and the materials needed to build a fusion plant turn from research materials with years of work put into manufacturing the damn things into materials which can be mass produced on a global scale. But even then it will still be expensive.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions (tokamak energy, ARK) who reckon they can get small scale fusion up and running with a large Q value, but these require the use of High Temperature Superconductors. I'm in the process of doing a PhD on HTS materials for fusion energy and honestly, we're a loooonngg way off of using HTS in a grid-ready fusion plant. They don't withstand radiation very well at all and they're incredibly difficult and expensive to make. The ARK/Tokamak energy people don't have a particularly strong background in superconductivity and it's really something they need to focus on if they want to get their small scale reactors up and running.</p>
<p>All in all fusion just won't be economically viable for a long time. Even as fossil fuel prices skyrocket we'll still have renewable energy forms which will be cheaper to build and run and the standard fission reactors are getting cheaper and safer every minute.</p>
<p>People like to claim fusion is the future of energy production but to be honest, in the western world, it really isn't. The big potential for fusion energy is in emerging economies. As Africa, Asia and South America begin to industrialise their energy needs will shoot through the roof. They can't use fossil fuels because us westerners used them all already. They won't be able to use renewable energy for everything because the low power density puts a pretty hard limit on the sustainable population of Earth (people reckon around 10 billion) and many of them won't want to use Fission for political reasons.</p>
<p>The economics of fusion is super interesting because the place for fusion in the energy economy isn't where you would initially expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The explanations so far are not correct. 4 continuous hours of sunlight will give your damaged cells less time to repair DNA and less time to apoptose (safely die without causing inflammation).</p>
<p>4 hours spread out over increments gives your cells time to repair DNA and, if need be, apoptose irreparable cells in-between exposures.</p>
<p>If you do not have this break time in-between exposures, cells will become damaged so badly that they cannot die in a safe, organized manner (apoptosis). Instead, they die quicker and release their proteins into the space between cells. Nearby cells sense this, freak out and release chemicals that cause inflammation and pain.</p>
<p>Additionally, immune cells in skin undergoing DNA damage from UV may directly contribute to inflammation.</p>
<p>Fun fact: When you feel heat, when you are out in the sun, it’s from infrared light. A lot of people have the misconception that they aren’t feeling the heat from the sun, so they aren’t getting burned. The “heat” (really just pain) from a sunburn will come on much later, and is produced by inflammation and hypersensitive nerve endings.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add. Even if your 4 hours is broken up into increments, if you’re fair-skinned, you’ll probably still get burned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light is radiation. Radiation is like a really tiny bullet that can shoot through important stuff in your cells (like your DNA). Damaged DNA can cause cancer. When your body detects that the DNA in a cell has been damaged, the cell kills itself for the greater good of the body. No cell, no potential cancer. </p>
<p>Now think of a tinted window in a car. Not as much light gets through it, right? Like a tinted window, your body releases a “tint” called melanin which is what makes you darker when you’ve been in the sun. Your body does this to avoid as many radiation “bullets” passing into skin cells and making them commit suicide. </p>
<p>If you expose yourself to 4 hours in a row, you don’t give your body time to release the melanin to protect your cells so they die and cause sunburn.</p>
<p>If you give your body enough time, it can tint your skin to protect you and you don’t burn (or not as severely).</p>
<p>Edit:
I could go into detail about basal reversal repairs and the issue with double helix breaks, but would it be an ELI5? I’m not going to explain enzyme metabolic rates n shit to a 5 year old. The melanin vector is easiest (and is one of the primary factors).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The premise of this question is a little flawed. It's hard to say this without evoking somebody's political sensibilities, but when it comes to humans race doesn't really exist like we think it does. </p>
<p>The difference between humans with different skin colors is like the difference between a <a href="https://pixfeeds.com/images/dogs/1280-544481718-chocolate-lab-relaxing.jpg" target="_blank">chocolate lab</a> and a <a href="https://previews.123rf.com/images/skyyblue/skyyblue1205/skyyblue120500019/13446187-yellow-lab-smiling.jpg" target="_blank">yellow lab</a>; when the two mix, you don't get a splotchy dog, but one with <a href="https://animalso.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lab-chow-mix_2.jpg" target="_blank">a uniform coat somewhere in between</a>. Sometimes <a href="https://gfp-2a3tnpzj.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Labrador-Mix-Puppies-for-Sale-600x600.jpg" target="_blank">it runs a little darker</a> but the pelt features are the same. </p>
<p>When it comes to phenotype differences along race lines, the features commonly associated with one race are more the result of selective characteristics localizing in one area over time. When somebody is of mixed race, for example <a href="http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/01/010418-rashida-jones.jpg" target="_blank">Rashida Jones</a> their features become a mixed bag from their parents, just like any child from a non-mixed parentage. </p>
<p>The real long and short to your question though: Humans never really evolved to have stripes/spots. I mean, <em>techincally</em> we do, but we can only see them under <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/65092/our-skin-covered-invisible-stripes" target="_blank">outstanding conditions</a> and these would be closer to the phenotype differences we see whenever two parents of any race have a child. That is to say, the nature of these stripes aren't well studied and it's not yet sure if there's any racial significance to them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human skin tone is determined by a large number of genes. The more &quot;dark skin&quot; alleles (an allele is a particular version of a gene) you have, the darker your skin tone is.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the tone of your skin is determined by how much melanin - a molecule which makes your skin absorb more light, and thus makes it darker - is produced in your skin. The more melanin your skin produces, the darker your skin is.</p>
<p>Thus, if you take someone with all dark skin alleles, and you mix them with someone with all light skin alleles, the offspring will be half and half, and thus end up with a skin tone halfway in-between.</p>
<p>Of course, in real people, people don't have just one kind of allele - most humans have some mixture of dark and light alleles, with light-skinned populations having mostly light-skinned alleles with some darker-skinned alleles, and dark-skinned populations having mostly dark-skinned alleles with only a few light-skinned alleles, so there will be some variability in the offspring depending on which alleles they got from each parent, but it will generally end up somewhere in-between the parents' skin tones.</p>
<p>Other animals have different ways of getting their fur patterns, so they don't necessarily end up mixing in the same way that humans do. In some animals, fur color is dominant or recessive - that is to say, rather than ending up halfway in-between, having just one copy of a gene is enough to establish fur color. For example, if red fur is dominant to white fur, if you have two copies of the &quot;white fur&quot; allele, your fur will be white, but if you have one copy of a &quot;red fur&quot; allele and one copy of a &quot;white fur&quot; allele, your fur will be the same color as if you had two &quot;red fur&quot; alleles, because just one red copy of the gene is enough to make your fur turn red.</p>
<p>Another reason why you can see weird fur patterns is when it is on the X-chromosome - female mammals have two copies of the X-chromosome, but you only need the gene expression of one of them to function. Thus, one of them will be inactivated at random (this is known as X-inactivation). In animals where fur color is on the X-chromosome, a female animal might end up with different colors of fur in different patches of skin that have had different X-chromosomes inactivated.</p>
<p>It varies a lot from animal to animal; there's no one answer for why they end up the way they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>For example: if a human body has multiple fractures, severed nerves, multiple lacerated organs, internal bleeding and cuts and bruises, how does the body react to the healing process? Which of the wounds and damaged areas it starts to heal first? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hematology MD here - good question! </p>
<p>If you're thinking of the body like the Enterprise or something (damage control teams to E deck!) the short answer is no, there isn't a mechanism like that, with a set reserve of 'repair ability.'</p>
<p>Since your question focuses on two different 'levels' of damage, e.g. at the DNA/cellular level, and in the trauma setting e.g. lacerated organs, internal bleeding, cuts/bruises etc, I'll answer them separately.</p>
<p>On a cellular level, multiple DNA repair mechanisms exist - Dr Paul Modrich won the nobel prize in 2015 for exploring some of these. The individual cell has an incredible ability to reconstitute / repair DNA following damage; if damage is so great that I can't be repaired, the cell will self-destruct, so to speak; failure to do so is one mechanism by which cancer arises. However, the ability of individual cells to repair themselves is distinct from that of macroscopic injuries.</p>
<p>In the trauma setting, the circulating coagulation factors / prothrombotic pathways become activated, to stop bleeding. It's not a specific process (e.g. bypass the cut on your arm to stop the bleeding in your spleen) but rather occurs wherever the pro-coagulant mediators see damage. That's part of the problem in conditions like sepsis/severe injury - a condition called DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) develops with massive activation of the pro-coagulant pathways in an effort to stop bleeding (or as an 'accidental activation' in the setting of inflammation, where you get similar procoagulant markers expressed). In DIC, you get concurrent bleeding/clotting, since the pro-coagulant factors that are meant to stop bleeding are being used up faster than the body can produce them, while concurrently, clots (thrombi) are forming, often inappropriately. </p>
<p>It would actually be really helpful in the setting of DIC if something like a priority list did exist, so the less important injuries would be ignored and the more serious ones dealt with. </p>
<p>I hope that's helpful! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good question, one that comes up all the time in my profession as an ICU physician. As /u/SGDJ points out, blood flow is key to not only the bodily repair process, but also to its normal homeostatic function. One way to gain insight into what the body “prioritizes” as vital for function is to note what happens when the body is in a shock state. This occurs for example when there is massive blood loss (i.e. hemorrhagic shock). The body will attempt to compensate for diminished oxygen delivery to the tissues by shunting blood away from less essential organ systems to those that are ‘vital’ in the immediate sense. What we see in this scenario is that blood shunts <em>away</em> from skin, kidneys, liver, intestines and <em>towards</em> three main organs: <strong>the brain, the heart, and the adrenal glands.</strong></p>
<p>The reason for this priority is abundantly clear. The most important organ to ultimate survival is the brain. It is also the most sensitive to hypoxia injury. Therefore, the heart must be able to sustain cardiac output and oxygen delivery. And the adrenal glands that secrete vasogenic hormones like epinephrine and dopamine are necessary to regulate it all.</p>
<p>There is constant debate regarding which organ systems should be deemed ‘vital,’ but in actuality, blood flow is preserved to those three organ systems in a shock state in an attempt to preserve immediate survival.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are multiple parts to your question. As u/SGDJ mentioned, a factor in wound healing is going to be vascularization of the tissue. Another is how readily new cells can migrate to the afflicted area to make repairs. It will also depend on the ability of the area to become &quot;re-vascularized&quot; - a process called angiogenesis. Other factors, such as mechanical strain, infection, edema, necrosis, etc, are going to affect some areas more than others. </p>
<p>Some tissues are going to &quot;repair&quot; quickly, but leave scars. So, the priority is going to be &quot;fill in all the holes&quot; with blood coagulation, swelling and temporary repair, followed by extensive repair. It's not going to be as location dependent, as it is how much needs to be done to fix the area. For instance, your body knows you need to stop bleeding before anything else, so your blood clots and cells come to sort of patch up that area (usually in minutes/hours). The tissues that are damaged as a result of the injury won't be able to respond as quickly. Immediately after injury, you will have an adrenaline response that directs blood flow toward some areas that are more central to the body (brain, internals), and away from your periphery.</p>
<p>Internal bleeding is a product of damage, and that leads to all kinds of pressure changes inside the body which will be dependent on the afflicted organ to clot and rectify whatever has happened to it before you die. It will take some time to clear the body of waste in areas that are not usually perfused with blood (such as the area surrounding your lungs).</p>
<p>Bruises are sort of similar, where you have simply broken a shallow bed of capillaries that must repair. So, for a bruise to go away, you just need replace the vascular and surrounding damaged tissue in the area. Usually, not a big deal and can heal up over the course of days/weeks.</p>
<p>Lacerated organs, however, are going to have a harder time, because many of those tissues are highly specialized, and will form scar tissue (made of fibroblasts and collagen) that sort of secure the are from further harm or from bleeding out, before the specialized cells get a chance to migrate there and mature. This is going to affect different tissues to various degrees, depending on how specialized the tissue is (e.g., a scar on your heart is a big deal, because those cells don't replicate easily and are very specialized, so it essentially never heals to 100% before the injury). </p>
<p>If you're talking about a fracture to a bone, it's again going to depend on vascularization, the size of the bone, etc. Cells will go there to remove damaged parts, create a scaffolding for new bone to form, then you have to have cells that will form new bone come in, mature, and fill in the area. Going to be extensive, and doesn't always come out correctly on its own.</p>
<p>Severed nerves are tricky. They need some sort of intervention, typically, but peripheral (those not in your brain or spine) nerves can heal quite naturally, given the right environment. This is different than other wounds which are simply replacing damaged cells with new ones, because a nerve is made of really long individual neuron fibers called 'axons'. These axons have to connect to the other half of the same cell that got severed in order to heal properly. Luckily, your body can do it with the assistance of cells called Schwann cells, that essentially migrate to the area, create a tunnel of cells, and help facilitate removing the damaged part of the axon and giving it a path with all the signals it needs to grow back together. This can take a very long time (months/years).</p>
<p>Damages in the brain aren't usually repaired easily, and if you're lucky to not have an embolism, or stroke, then you'll see that the neurons that die will be cleaned out and replaced with glial cells that kind of keep everything going the best they can (proper pressure and nutrient supply to unaffected areas). Neurons don't really grow back (at least the ones that were in a network that died won't be immediately replaced). After some swelling, cleaning up all the mess, and going through this process called &quot;gliosis,&quot; I guess you'd eventually call that healed as much it's going to be. </p>
<p>TL;DR: There's not particularly a priority list, but rather stages of healing. Some areas of the body have more stages than others.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is one real phenomena that is one the most interesting things in physiology to me.  The highest priority is cerebral perfusion. (Making sure you have adequate driving pressure to get oxygen and other nutrients to the brain). There is times that the body will protect that at almost any cost. If you use too much oxygen and outstrip your hearts ability to pump oxygenated blood. The brain will shut down your body (pass out) to ensure it gets enough blood. It's the phenomenon of seeing triathletes collapse near the end of the course. </p>
<p>Seems like a high priority to me.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. I have a bit of experience with healing after being severely damaged. In 1989 I was ejected from a car during a high speed roll over. I suffered C5,C6, and T3 spinal fractures, a lacerated liver, a dislocated shoulder, both collar bones broken, several ribs broken (including several right at the sternum that could not be set which now are raised up and very weird feeling), and facial contusions. I was 6'3&quot; and weighed about 155. My body fed off itself rapidly over the next three weeks and even with a gastric tube constantly feeding me I got down to 116. My hair was shaved over my ears for a traction apparatus and grew about an inch in three weeks. I wore a size 11 tennis shoe when I had the accident and wore a 12 two months later. I'm also closer to 6'4&quot; now. My body basically went into a healing overdrive that healed all the broken bones and the shoulder in about 4 or 5 weeks. I was only 18 and very healthy so that was a huge factor the doctors said, along with the overall trauma causing my healing factor to go crazy. I was up walking with a crutch in about 5 weeks too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>No - the total force due to the photons emitted in the forward and backward directions will be equal in the reference frame of the moving object. Hence, no deceleration in any and all inertial frames.</p>
<p>Edit: this is because all inertial reference frames agree on whether there is a net force acting on the object. No net force in one of them means no net force in all of them (and correspondingly no acceleration).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually studied musicology and cultural attitudes towards music, so this is an informed answer!</p>
<p>tl;dr: It's complicated as fuck.</p>
<p>Let's start low-level.  Attitudes towards harmonies, scales, musical tones, etc. seem to be mostly cultural.  People across cultures recognize the octave interval (because it's natural; going up an octave means doubling the frequency of the note).  The octave interval is universally pleasing to one degree or another.  Beyond that, it is hard to make any generalizations about what sounds &quot;nice.&quot;  In most Western cultures (with a shared musical tradition), the major scale sounds &quot;nice,&quot; but that is not true in other cultures.  Arabic music involves minute pitch changes, which Westerners would either not notice, or would perceive as unpleasant or foreign; those who grew up with Arabic find it pleasing.  So the first step in developing your musical tastes is <strong>what is reinforced culturally</strong> on a very low level like note intervals and chords.</p>
<p>After that, we can move up a level to things like chord progressions.  These are still culturally informed, but not as strongly.  The I - V - vi - IV progression, famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I" target="_blank">parodied by Axis of Awesome</a>, evokes various emotions of redemption or hope in Westerners, but that is only because we've been exposed to movies and TV shows and songs which use that pattern emotionally.  People who grow up with no exposure to Western music do not show that kind of emotional response to this pattern.  <strong>Emotional content of music is not inherent, but what you're trained to hear</strong>.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to subcultures.  Someone who is not interested in speed metal, and who has very little exposure to it, will literally just hear it as fast noise, because they don't have cultural/emotional associations tied to it.  If you grow up with speed metal, or you start listening to it because of your friends, you will become &quot;fluent&quot; in its &quot;language&quot; and certain tropes will become more meaningful to you.  <strong>You can learn appreciation of musical tropes</strong>.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, musicians or those musically trained show a higher emotional connection to music of all kinds, because they're fluent in a wide range of compositional techniques)</p>
<p>Beyond that, it gets weird and complex and is an area of active research.  There's lots of evidence that exposure to music can make you get used to it and even like it, and music is definitely used as a social tool, so the conclusion there is that <strong>your tastes are affected by what your family &amp; friends like</strong>.  Some research suggests that given <strong>personality traits are linked to musical tastes</strong>; this may seem like an obvious conclusion, but with things as nebulous and hard-to-nail-down like &quot;personality&quot; it's an important question to approach scientifically.  People with a high degree of empathy seem to prefer mellow music like indie rock or some pop, while people with an analytical brain prefer complex/harsh music like metal (Greenberg, Baron-Cohen, Stillwell, Kosinski, &amp; Rentfrow, 2015).</p>
<p>Finally things can get even more wild.  There is evidence that high testosterone levels, particularly in men, are correlated to a dislike of complex music.  Neurological differences in the brain may impact what you get out of music.  It's an exciting area of research!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks while they were still unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zajonc (a researcher) tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were asked to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen...Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive than those who did not receive repeated exposure.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Zajonc, the mere-exposure effect is capable of taking place without conscious cognition, and that &quot;preferences need no inferences&quot;.</p>
<p>So, you like certain music cause you've heard stuff like it before, even if you didn't really think about or notice it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For me personally, I actively try to maintain an open mindset when it comes to different genres, different styles etc. Nowadays any noise can be classified as music (looking at you dubstep), so don't go and argue whether it is or isn't. Whenever I hear a new song, I say to myself: &quot;There must be a place, a time, a situation where this song will be a perfect fit.&quot; And by that logic I will try to enjoy it for what it is. Experience also tells me that frequent exposure to things you initially don't like can make it more tolerable - some songs/artist need to be listened to more than once before you can form a good opinion.

<p>The center of atom is somewhat like that. You have positively charged particles called protons. Just like the ends of the magnets they want to repel each other, but something called the Strong Nuclear Force holds them together. For this to happen though the protons have to be close together. Getting them close together takes energy just like pushing the ends of magnets together takes energy. </p>
<p>To split an atom you have to get the protons far enough apart that the Strong Nuclear Force can't hold them together anymore. When you do that the energy that went into getting them close together is released. </p>
<p>If you just split one atom that's not going to release that much energy. However, with certain special atoms, like certain types of Uranium, when you split them they shoot out lots of particles. Those particles can then cause other atoms to split. This is what is called a chain reaction. Each atom causes more to split and those in turn cause even more to split. When that happens slowly you have a nuclear reactor. When it happens quickly you have a nuclear explosion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single Uranium atom cannot cause an explosion. However, if you hit it with a neutron, then the atom will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nc0wCrkk00" target="_blank">undergo a few reactions</a> and split into two smaller atoms. These two atoms require less energy to keep the nucleus together (thanks /u/Luminum__), so the now extra energy gets released.</p>
<p>To get an explosion, you need a certain mass of Uranium. It must be the right kind (isotope) that is &quot;reactive&quot; enough. This is called enriched Uranium. When you &quot;clump&quot; together a certain mass of enriched Uranium, you get a chain reaction: one atom releases two (or three) neutrons, which will hit two other atoms, which will release four neutrons, and so on. You detonate the reaction in a big, strong casing to avoid spreading your Uranium all over before the reaction gets strong enough to cause a large boom.</p>
<p>That's what happens in a fission bomb. Of course, not all neutrons will hit other atoms, and not every atom will go under fission. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy" target="_blank">Little Boy</a>, the bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima, had 64&nbsp;kg of Uranium. It is estimated that less than one kilo went under reaction. However, notice that one gram of Uranium contains a ridiculously large number of atoms (about  2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PS:</strong> a lot of people are mentioning E=MC^2, and there's a lot to say about it. I'll keep it short and say just that the energy released is not 1 kg of Uranium times the speed of light squared. That would be the case, for example, of matter/anti-matter reaction, when the entirety of the atom is released as energy, which doesn't happen in atomic bombs. For more details and more precise explanations, read the tens of replies I received.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> as requested, a follow-up question: What would have happened if all 64 kg of Uranium went under reaction? According to the guys at r/AskScience who actually know this stuff (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3xyjqe/how_powerful_would_the_little_boy_atomic_bomb/" target="_blank">source</a>), the explosion would be &quot;only&quot; about 58 times stronger. It's a big boom, but we actually have made much stronger bombs than this.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> I know there are a few imprecisions in this reply. A few are on purpose. I know just having Uranium above the critical mass is not enough for an explosion, but I don't know the subject enough to explain in an ELI5 way the detonation process. I have no understanding of the concept of &quot;fissible atom&quot;, so I just glossed over and said &quot;reactive enough&quot;. It was an attempt, and I'm surprised ane happy it was well-received. If you'd like to point mistakes please give me an ELI5 and I'll amend the answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called &quot;nuclear binding energy.&quot; You can take an atom and look at its nucleus and see how many protons and neutrons it is made up of. We know the mass of protons and neutrons, so you can count the number of protons and number of neutrons and calculate how much mass the nucleus should have.</p>
<p>But, if you were to measure the nucleus as a whole, you would find that the total mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its constituent parts! Where did that mass go? Well, it turned into that nuclear energy (as per E = mc^(2)).</p>
<p>But, this binding energy is different for each atom and it is why both fusion and fission can release energy.</p>
<p>Starting with hydrogen and moving up, atomic nuclei bind more strongly, meaning more mass is &quot;lost.&quot; So if you were to take two deuterium atoms (hydrogen atoms plus a neutron each) and fuse them into a helium atom, you'd find that the mass of the helium nucleus is less than that of the sum of the individual deuterium nuclei. This lost mass is released as energy.</p>
<p>But, once you get to iron, this trend stops and reverses somewhat. If you take a very large atom, like Uranium, and split it into smaller atoms like Krypton and Barium, you'll find that the mass of the original Uranium nuclei is <em>more</em> than the sum of the masses of the Krypton and Barium nuclei and you lose mass by splitting it. Again, this lost mass is released as energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: There is an optimum number of protons and neutrons in an atom to be most strongly bound (like iron). Uranium is far from this optimum, thus when splitting it into smaller pieces (by e.g. a neutron), these pieces are closer to optimum, and the difference in binding energy is released. A nuclear explosion is this happening to many U-235 atoms in a chain reaction when neutrons released in one uranium split are splitting further uranium atoms.</p>
<p>OK so let me try. I try to be simple, but can't promise short.</p>
<p>Atoms consist of protons (positively charged) and neutrons (no charge). These together are called &quot;nucleons&quot;. Nucleons are bound together by the so-called &quot;strong interaction&quot;, a &quot;glue&quot; which acts only over small distances, i.e. imagine all nucleons are only bound to their immediate neighbors, as if they were literally glued together. So the binding force is roughly proportional to the volume of the nucleus, or the total number of nucleons (a.k.a. &quot;mass number&quot; of an isotope).</p>
<p>There are multiple things that counteract this binding force.
1) The protons have similar charge and thus they repel eachother (all of them repel all other ones). The more protons, the increasingly stronger the force trying to break the atom apart. The higher the charge (or &quot;atomic number&quot;) the stronger the protons try to break the nucleus apart. </p>
<p>2) Since the &quot;glue&quot; only acts over small distances, nuclei at the surface of the nucleus are less bound (they only have neighbors on one side) and so the larger the fraction of nuclei at the &quot;surface&quot;, the less bound the atom is. As the atoms grow larger this fraction gets smaller (more fully bound nuclei inside) and thus getting bigger makes this effect weaker.</p>
<p>3) For reasons which I cannot explain in ELI5 fashion (feel free to help), the more close the number of protons and neutrons is to eachother, the more bound the nucleus is. Similarly, and even number of protons and neutrons is better than having an odd number of any of these. So 2+2 is more stable than 1+1, 3+3 or 2+3 in either combination. 3+3 is more stable than 2+3, etc.</p>
<p>Combining all of these is the &quot;liquid drop&quot; or Bethe-Weizsacker model of the nucleon. (go to wikipedia). </p>
<p>Small nucleons have too few fully bound nuclei (almost all of them are on the surface). If one goes larger to increase this bindig force, also the splitting force (number of protons) grows. One can try to compensate for this by adding just more neutrons. It turns out we need more than 1 neutron for any extra proton, which then increases the asymmetry, destabilizing again. For any number of protons there is an optimum number of neutrons, these are the stable isotopes of the elements.</p>
<p>Large enough deviations from the local optimum (that is an optimum number of neutrons for a given number of protons) is the root cause of spontaneaous nuclear decay, a.k.a. radioactivity. Nucleons either expell a part of them (2 protons + 2 neutrons at once -&gt; alpha decay); or convert a neutron to proton or vica versa (beta decay). The excess energy is released in the form of a gamma photon.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the most bound atoms are the mid-sized ones such as e.g. Iron. Therefore uniting (fusing) small atoms into mid-sized ones makes the bond stronger. Similarly, splitting ultra-large atoms (like in uranium fission) into smaller ones also makes the bond stronger. In either case the excess binding energy is released. The first process drives the stars (and the Sun) while the latter powers nuclear reactors and drives the atomic bomb. Fission and fusion are not the same as radioactivity.</p>
<p>Uranium is special, because it has so many excess neutrons (total of 235 or 238, to compensate for its 92 protons) that when it splits, it also emits more than 1 extra neutron. These neutrons can split further uranium atoms, leading to a chain reaction under appropriate circumstances (geometry, isotope composition). A nuclear explosion is an uncontrolled, exponentially growing chain reaction, which leads to a large number of uranium atoms to split and release the excess binding energy.</p>
<p>Nuclear reactors are designed in a way that for every fission there is exactly 1 neutron that causes another fission. I can explain this too, in a different ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 (using simplifications that are not strictly true but easy to understand): </p>
<p>In atoms, there are protons and electrons. Like magnets, protons and electrons have charges (Protons are positive, electrons are negative.) So they are attracted to each other.</p>
<p>However the way atoms are structured are that protons are stuck to eachother with electrons rotating around them.</p>
<p>Problem: How can protons stick to eachother when they should be repelling eachother due to them being the same charge?</p>
<p>Answer: There is some type of glue binding them together. (Imagine a machine that forces two magnets together, even though they want to repel)</p>
<p>Nuclear fission:</p>
<p>With nuclear fission, we fire at these grouped protons (and neutrons) with stuff, breaking them apart.</p>
<p>When they break apart into smaller,  and seperate groups, they are less magnetically repulsive to each other, so this glue that binds these groups doesn't need to use so much energy. This excess energy is released.</p>

(PNAS July 21, 2009. 106 (29) 12184-12188) is a little old by now, but I don't know of an authoritative, recent paper that looks at the question.  </p>
<p>McNab starts with the assumption that dinosaur metabolism was similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanidae" target="_blank">varanid lizards</a> -- significantly higher than most lizards, but much lower than mammals.  He reasons from this that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The presumptively low energy expenditures of dinosaurs potentially permitted Mesozoic communities to support dinosaur biomasses that were up to 5 times those found in mammalian herbivores in Africa today. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He shows a bunch of calculations and compares to things like modern tortoises and elephants, and justifies some of his comparisons by arguing </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The terrestrial vegetation that was available in the Mesozoic included an abundance and diversity of ferns, horsetails, Ginkgo, and conifers (5), which some analysts (34) have argued were of equal nutritional quality to plants presently available, thereby implying that the maximal Kh was similar to that found at present. ...  Consequently, the mass-independent food intake of a 40 to 100-ton dinosaur must have been lower than found in mammals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if dinosaur biomass was five times greater than modern African herbivores, that's pretty large (think of the enormous wildebeest herds, elephants, zebras, and so on); but of course dinosaurs were typically much larger than modern herbivores.  A wildebeest weighs a few hundred pounds, a generic herbivorous dinosaur might have been closer to 10 tons, maybe forty times as much, suggesting there would be 5-10 times more wildebeest than equivalent dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Wildebeest herds of thousands or tens of thousands occur, so herds of dinosaurs of several hundreds seem plausible, which matches with <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/largest-dinosaur-bone-bed/" target="_blank">bone beds</a> that have been found.  </p>
<p>Larger dinosaurs would presumably be more like elephant equivalent, potentially living in moderate-sized herds, while apex predators like T. rex would be less common, but perhaps analogous to lion numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of this also depends on if you agree with various herding behaviours. For example, whether the Albertosaurus bone beds in Alberta (Dry Island) represents true density and animals living together or if this was more of a predator trap as is proposed for the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah, representing the densest Jurassic dinosaur assemblage yet found. </p>
<p>An assumption made for the Albertosaurus assemblage is that these animals died together so they were living together, though there could have been some outside factor (ie a predator trap) luring these large animals together. </p>
<p>One assumption based on the large olfactory of Tyrannosaurus in particular is that this animal was using humongous areas of land. We also have a fairly reasonable idea that some of the herbivores were migrating, as we find Pachyrhinosaurus in both Northern Alberta and New Mexico, though I think the species is different we see this genus ranging quite far. So you are left with two options for consideration here: how far were they migrating or how large was their permanent territory. We see modern herbivores that range insanely long distances, such as caribou, wildebeest and even elephants. We also see Carnivores with insanely large territories, like polar bears ranging 10 thousand square km. So it really depends on if you believe these animals were solitary or not and what method they were using to obtain the absurd amount of food needed to power such massive populations.</p>
<p>All that said, we do have overlapping populations of large carnivores and herbivores. A prime example is Alioramus, with more slender teeth, and Tarbosaurus, with bone crushing teeth. So depending on available resources, you could have concurrent populations of huge dinosaurs living in the same areas based on resource division. </p>
<p>It's a complicated question, one that microsite density work is trying to sort out- though it can be tricky when you have individual hadrosaurs (for example) with 2000 teeth in their mouth at once and no real way to demonstrate similarly sized teeth aren't just coming from one individual.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1.) your mind doesn’t need to run through the scenario in real time. It can speed up each event so that you process more events in less time.</p>
<p>2.) your mind doesn’t generally process each scenario completely. For example, you can imagine yourself walking from your curb to your front door, but it’s unlikely that you know the exact number of steps between your curb and your front door. Your mind isn’t processing every single step you would take in the scenario, and therefore your mind doesn’t need the exact number of steps in order for you to imagine the scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It can do this because your brains computing power far exceeds any man made processor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way. Your brain is a computer and every cell is a processor.</p>
<p>Distributed data processing is the technical term for what's going on. Whereas an actual computer must go through a long list of if/then type scripts and commands, it can technically only make one process decision at a time per processor.</p>
<p>Organic chemistry and neuroscience do not care about these limitations</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
