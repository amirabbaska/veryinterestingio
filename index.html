		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called statelessness, and it's possible. More often it happens at birth or involuntarily. Several UN conventions have aimed to reduce it. However, the U.S. hasn't signed them, and unlike many countries, will allow citizens to renounce their citizenship with nothing to replace it. This has happened at least a few times. Renouncing U.S. citizenship as an adult is irreversible.</p>
<p>You don't want to be stateless. No country is obligated to give you a passport or legal documents, provide protection or services, nor even to take you in. You can be in limbo indefinitely.</p>
<p>There's not an obvious limit on multiple citizenships, though it's hard to get more than a few. Some countries won't allow their citizenship to be held in combination with others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Considering the requirements for obtaining citizenships, I think there was a discussion from a while back where it was shown that the maximum number you can feasibly obtain and hold at the same time, assuming you're wealthy and live a long life, is around 15-18.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Basically sound has a huge problem crossing a barrier where there is a large &quot;Impedance mismatch&quot;  like between water and air.  When sound hits that &quot;soft release&quot; (because the air's impedance is much less than the water impedance) it gets reflected back into the water and doesn't radiate out efficiently.  You have a similar problem of sound starting in the air and moving to the water.</p>
<p>However, for sound created in water, you should be able to hear it in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you put your transmitter above ground, it is almost impossible to get the signals deep underground and it would be a waste of energy to try to. If you put transmitters inside a tunnel you can actually reach quite far with them because the signals would reflect a lot. So we could do it. We probably don't because it takes a lot of money and it isn't really worth anyone's time since you will be above ground soon anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They can manage a few walls in the house, but put a bit of solid of stone in between, and the signal will be soo weak that you don't get any connection. So we can't use normal antennas to radiate underground. </p>
<p>Instead, we can use what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_feeder" target="_blank">radiating cable</a> (AKA Leaky feeder). It is basically a very long antenna which you put in the tunnel, and connect a cellular basestation at the end. The antenna distributes the signal along the tunnel.

The user is in the same cell site/sector along the entire length of the tunnel so no rapid hand-offs are needed.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok here's a thought experiment. Suppose you have a rigid sphere. You put three marks on it : two on the equator, about 90 degrees apart, and one on the poles. I claim that no matter how you spin the sphere, you cannot get all three points to have equal centripetal force directed away from the center of the sphere.</p>
<p>Why is this? Well, for each point, the centripetal force is perpendicular to the direction of motion of that point. For the two points on the equator that's easy. Spin the sphere so it rotates on its axis, and the points are moving along a big circle of rotation. The normal force is away from the center of the rotation.</p>
<p>But now how can you simultaneously get the point at the pole to experience the same force? That would mean that point is also moving perpendicular to the direction of the force. The point would have to be moving towards the equator - but we said it's a rigid sphere, so the points can't be moving relative to each other on the surface of the sphere.</p>
<p>You can add all the axes you want, but you can't change the fact that each point on the sphere is only accelerating in one vector at a time. And in a rigid sphere, you'll find you can't get all the points on the sphere to accelerate so that the normal force is outward via rotating the sphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you could, if you had some super-material to make your &quot;balloon&quot; out of. This concept is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_airship" target="_blank">vacuum airship</a>. The practical flaw is that you can't just put a vacuum in a balloon—it will just become really flat as you pump the air out. :) You need an incredibly strong yet light structure to contain the vacuum. Any vacuum container made with modern materials weighs muuuch more than the air it displaces (otherwise all those vacuum chambers used in scientific experiments would end up flying around the labs!).</p>
<p>This has not stopped inventors, of course. Some of the earliest conceptions of flying machines are vacuum airships. The earliest such scheme was proposed by Jesuit priest Francesco Lana de Terzi in his design for a sort of flying boat. Later inventors have come up with various schemes to create vacuum airships, none of which have ever flown.</p>
<p>Naively, a vacuum airship would appear to have the advantage of using the lightest possible lifting &quot;gas&quot;, and avoiding use of flammable hydrogen or rare helium (or even heavier alternatives like methane). Just pump the air out for lift. In reality it's not terribly more effective at lifting than hydrogen, and quite a bit more difficult to contain. The vacuum cells will be in constant danger of imploding, with potentially even deadlier results than hydrogen igniting. If your gasbag tears, you get a leak. If your vacuum cell tears, the whole thing violently implodes. You could probably design a truly safe hydrogen airship far more easily than a vacuum airship. </p>
<p>But theoretical vacuum airships do have one big advantage. The amount of lift could be changed by pumping air in and out of the interior, or dynamically altering the volume of the balloon. This would be a great advantage for cargo airships that need to offload a heavy load. Conventional airships have the problem that as soon as you offload the cargo, the suddenly-much-lighter airship wants to shoot up in the air. In real life, various schemes for conventional airships using thrusters to keep the airship on the ground or devices to compress engine exhaust to produce liquid ballast have been proposed to combat this. A vacuum airship could just reduce the amount of lift. At the end of the day, it could just let all the air back in or collapse the vacuum cells and land, a major advantage over traditional airships like the Hindenburg that had to be moored, at the mercy of wind and weather. One of the fellows to peddle the vacuum airship concept, Arthur de Bauset, mentioned this as one of the advantage of his airships. You can read about his ideas <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IH0EAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22arthur+de+bausset%22+aerial+navigation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l97qhtCTbR&amp;sig=jlULBzzve8FuJeQGQZm1EImPlYI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eKA4TMa7NYSFnQe46r23Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>In theory some sort of super-material of the future could fix the practical issues with vacuum airships. Vacuum airships have featured in SF stories that handwave such a material. The earliest I know is, amusingly enough, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan_at_the_Earth%27s_Core" target="_blank"><em>Tarzan at the Earth's Core</em></a>. They also appear in the Neal Stephenson's <em>The Diamond Age</em> (enabled by diamonoid nanotech supermaterials), and the alien shuttles in Buzz Aldrin's <em>Encounter with Tiber</em> become these to fly in planetary atmospheres. </p>
<p>I rather like the idea of the vacuum balloon, from a SFnal perspective. It's just cool. But its simply not a practical flying machine with the materials and engineering we have today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The speed of something can only ve measured in reference to another object, can't we just measure the speed of light in two directions and have the exact speed at which that point in the earth is moving ( C - measured C = speed of that point of earth.</p>
<p>Extra question: How is it that the universe is expanding? I have a big theory on this but how is it that we can measure the expansion of the universe?? That doesn't make any sense to me because if the universe is expanding we are also expanding, how can we know that what we percieved as 10 meters is now 20 meters if our instruments for measures also expanded and our own body, mind, eyes, atoms, and even the photons in the universe also expanded?</p>
<p>I say this cause scientists say the universe expands faster than the speed of light... </p>
<p>Extra extra bonus final boss easy question</p>
<p>How can something not pass the speed of light if the momentum formula is f=m.v being f force, m mass and v volume. To move something of 1 kg faster than the speed of light you need more newtons than speed of light, does a newton always take the same energy to achieve or does one newton take more energy in relation to the one that was applied before??</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for clearing my mind! I think a lot about this things but school is shit, I'm 16 and we are learning movement, I wanna learn about plancks not fucking a.t+iv=fv, that's easy boring shit. (Sorry for small rant)</p>

<p>The speed of light is <em>always</em> the same, even if you're moving. It's only speeds <em>below</em> the speed of light which are relative.</p>
<p>What you're describing is almost exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson-Morley" target="_blank">Michelson-Morley</a> experiment - measuring the speed of light in two directions. But it doesn't work because light is <em>always</em> measured to be moving at c, even by two people who are measuring the same light but moving at different speeds themselves.</p>
<p>Space and time &quot;rotate&quot; into one another as you change your speed in a way which essentially conspires to maintain the speed of light as you measure it. What one experimenter sees as space (and time) is not quite the same as what another (relatively moving) experimenter sees as space (and time).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To the first question. You can measure the speed by synchronizing two clocks, taking one very far away and then sending an object from one to the other at a very specific moment in time and then counting how long it takes before it arrives. If your measurements are sufficiently fast you can even measure the delay of light in very small distances in processors for example.</p>
<p>To the second question. I don't know much of the details behind the mechanisms of the expansion of the universe but it isn't so much that everything just gets larger but that the space in which objects are located gets larger. It acts like a sort of force accelerating content inside space out. As long as the forces holding objects together are larger, the objects will not grow in size themselves. We know it is expanding because distant objects move away from us which causes a doppler shift in the frequency at which they send their light. They look more red if they fly away from us and more blue if they move towards us. Similar to how an ambulance sounds different when it comes to you and moves away from you.</p>
<p>The formula f=m<em>v is not correct. It should be F=m</em>a. Where everything is the same but a is the acceleration. These equations however need to be corrected if you account for relativity which limits our velocity and those equations get much more complicated to a point where I'm not comfortable going into detail and I also don't think it would help you too much at this point. I think the most important lesson for you to take away from this is that some equations in physics aren't perfect but just sufficiently good within certain conditions and as long as you are not going a significant fraction of the speed of light for example. The principles that will happen once you start reaching the speed of light is that time doesn't move equally fast for different frames of reference which causes all kinds of non-relativistic physics to stop working properly. </p>
<p>If something goes really fast (99.99% speed of light for example), its time from the perspective of a stationary observer would 'almost' stand still. You might see the problem with definitions of force here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can just measure the speed of light like we can measure any other speed. The speed of light is only 300,000,000 meters per second. We can easily make things that make measurements at 1000 times per second or more. So all you would need to measure the speed of light is a distance 150 kilometers long, a mirror and a sampling rate of 1000 times per second. This is exactly how we got our first measurement of the speed of light. We created a pulsing light beam and then shot it at a mirror, then had a spinning disc that we could change the RPM of next to the emitter, this lets us measure very precisely what the travel time of the pulses are.</p>
<p>Our own bodies, atoms, and eyes are not expanding. The force pushing everything away from each other is ridiculously weak and almost any object's gravity can overcome it. The space between galaxies is very very big though, much bigger than the space inside of galaxies, so the dark energy force that is causing the universe to expand is greater than the incredibly tiny force pulling galaxies towards each other, so galaxies move away from each other, but the forces inside galaxies and between very close galaxies like our own local group is more than enough to keep those things together.</p>
<p>The speed of light does not work the way you think it works, and has nothing to do with light itself. What we call the speed of light is actually the speed of causality. Light in it's own reference frame moves almost infinite distance in almost zero time. Light moves much much much much faster than the speed of light in it's own reference frame. So f=ma works until infinity in your own reference frame. It is only outside stationary observers that see things moving at the speed of light. We don't really know what causes this, but one theory is that it's the Higgs field. The Higgs field is a sea of quantum particles that fills the universe and imparts mass to objects in the universe, letting them interact with other objects.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with how the speed of sound in a medium works, we get the speed of sound because it is the maximum speed that particles in air, steel, or water can transmit a wave from one particle to another. The speed of light/the speed of causality is thought to work in the same way. When you move from one location to another in the universe your mass has to go with you before you can move again. So as you move faster and faster the Higgs field has trouble handing off your mass from the particles at your previous position, to your new position fast enough. Because you cannot experience time without mass you do not experience these delays with the Higgs field updating your position, but outside observers see you moving in slow motion much like watching a laggy video on YouTube that is constantly buffering. Just because people watching a video of an SR-71 Blackbird with very slow buffering see it taking much more time to cross a distance, doesn't mean the plane in the video is going any bit slower. The plane is still moving ridiculously fast, it's just that you as an outside observer experience it moving much slower due to the buffering. Likewise outside observers see things moving at or near the speed of light with progressively more buffering. Those things going near the speed of light are still moving incredibly fast, quadrillions of meters per second or more in their own reference frames, but we can only update their positions at a maximum speed of about 300 million meters per second when we observe those objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The formula for momentum isn't p=mv,</p>
<p>It's actually</p>
<p>p=γmv</p>
<p>where m is the mass, v is the speed in an inertial frame of reference, and γ=1/√(1-v²/c²) is the Lorenz factor.</p>
<p>If you graph both γmv and mv as functions of v, you'll see how much the equations differ when v approaches c. For low values of v the equation p=mv is acceptable to use, but when v gets large you need to account for relativistic effects and use the proper formula p=γmv.</p>
<p>To change an objects momentum you need to apply a force. Force is the derivative of momentum (F=dp/dt) so it's​ the slope of the graph p=γmv, and as v approaches c that slope gets infinite which is why you need an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a mass to the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Back in January 2011, a car exploded in close proximity to a number of defense department facilities (including the Pentagon). SWAT and bomb squads responded, and it was initially investigated as a possible attack. Turns out, it was a construction worker who had left an oxyacetylene torch in his trunk, which detonated (possibly due to temperature/pressure fluctuations caused by the cold). Within a couple hours, it was established what had occurred, and things backed down from &quot;terrorist attack&quot; to &quot;accident,&quot; but in those initial minutes of response, nobody had any way to know. <a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2011/01/11/breaking-news-car-explodes-in-penrose/" target="_blank">Here's a news article with updates and images</a>.</p>
<p>Other things can also cause explosions, such as natural gas pipelines. For example, three 5-story buildings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_East_Village_gas_explosion" target="_blank">were destroyed in NYC in 2015</a>  due to a gas pipeline problem, and another couple buildings there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_East_Harlem_gas_explosion" target="_blank">blown up in 2014</a>. Big explosions, but not bombs, and it took time to establish that. Until there is certainty of the cause, they will treat things as potentially the worst, so that they don't miss signs or put the public in greater danger by treating something less seriously than they should.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, terrorism refers to violence with <em>ideological</em> motivations: political, religious, etc. Although bomb attacks usually are ideological in nature, they don't by definition have to be. Someone can commit a bombing for non-ideological reasons (maybe the bomb is an attempt to murder someone with whom the perpetrator has a personal dispute with.) </p>
<p>Terrorism is not defined by tactics. If a man stabs ten people in a mall because he's a dickweed, that's not terrorism. If a man stabs ten people in a mall because he thinks it contribute to the overthrow of the government, then that is terrorism. </p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that the word <em>terrorism</em> doesn't really define what terrorists do. The term implies that creating fear is terrorists' primary motivation, but this is generally not the case. Terrorists' goals vary depending on their motivations, but causing widespread terror in the minds of populations is generally more of a desirable additional effect than the main goal. The generally accepted modern definition of terrorism is violence or the threat of violence by non-state actors driven by ideological motivations.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is easy to step down an investigation, but much harder to ramp one up. Treating an explosion of undetermined, but suspicious, origin as a terrorist bombing means that any possible evidence recovered will be handled and logged in accordance with evidentiary procedure. Explosives experts will be among the first people combing through the debris, looking for any of the components of the explosive device.</p>
<p>If it is treated like an accident or something other than a criminal act, then it is entirely possible that valuable evidence may be lost or overlooked. Evidence might be handled or recovered in ways that make it useless for testing or inadmissible in a trial.</p>
<p>If you follow the most stringent investigative procedures, you know you're good. Worst case scenario is that you were too careful and exacting.</p>
<p>These are the same reasons suspicious fires are investigated as possible arson, and deaths of unknown origin are treated as possible murder. Until your investigation shows that the worst case scenario isn't true, you want to be certain that you aren't underdoing it.</p>
<p>EDIT TO ADD:  The reason it is treated as a terrorist bombing specifically, rather than any other type of criminal bombing, is because that gets the intelligence community involved.  That's the critical difference between the investigation of a possible terrorist act and a 'regular' criminal investigation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>In case it was not a deliberate bomb.  Without knowing the full details yet, it could have been something else, like a pyrotechnics accident.</p>
</li>
<li>If it was a bomb, there are other possible reasons besides terrorism, including suicide, homicide targeting a deliberate person or people, or other reason for destruction.  The Dortmund (fixed, thanks /u/taversham) bus bomb was supposed to look like terrorism, but turned out to be someone trying to commit financial fraud.</li>

<p>Isn't a bombing in nature an act of terrorism regardless of who did it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.  Terrorism is using fear as a tool to try to force some sort of political or social change.</p>
<p>If the point of a bomb is to try to cause a group of people to comply with some sort of demand because they're terrified of being blown up if they don't, that's terrorism.  But if someone is setting off a bomb just because they're crazy and want to kill people, that's not terrorism.</p>
<p>In short, whether or not something is terrorism is a matter of intent (much like whether or not something is first degree murder is a matter of intent).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially you have three constants which relate to different areas of Physics.  There is planck's constant hbar which relates to quantum mechanics,  the speed of light c,  which is to do with relativity,  and the universal gravitational constant G,  which relates to gravity. </p>
<p>There is only one way to combine these three to get a length which is</p>
<p>L = sqrt ( hbar  G / c^3 ) =1.61 ×10^-35</p>
<p>By dimensional analysis, this should occur as a natural length scale when dealing with the quantisation of gravitation and the curvature of space. It also occurs in an entropy calculation for black holes</p>
<p>S = A / (4 L)^2</p>
<p>With A the area of the event horizon.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will comment on Planck length in the end, but a better question is how did Max Planck calculate the Planck constant, which can be used to write down the Planck length.</p>
<p>So we know that a hot object emits radiation with certain distribution of wavelengths. This is called the black body radiation. But the exact form of the distribution was a bit of a mystery to the physicists in the end of the 19th century; it was pretty much known from the experiments, but a theory for the distribution was missing. </p>
<p>It turned out that the a missing piece of inventing this theory was assuming that light can only come in certain frequencies. Max Planck first introduced this assumption to his calculations just arbitrarily without any physical reasoning behind it. It turned out that the calculations indeed resulted in the correct shape for the black-body radiation spectrum. The only unknown parameter in the theory, the frequency spacing of different possible light frequencies, could be then calculated from the experiments. This parameter is called the Planck constant.</p>
<p>Now to your question about the Planck length.</p>
<p>In physics we often do something called dimensional analysis. If we have a bunch of parameters we know might be relevant to the phenomenon we want to study, we can try combining these parameters to produce all different kinds of derived parameters. Planck length is essentially just taking Planck constant, the gravitational constant and the speed of light and combining them in such a way that the resulting quantity has dimensions of length. This length scale is supposed to be the one at which the two phenomena represented by the ingredient parameters - gravitation and quantum mechanics - start both playing some role.</p>
<p>Planck might or might not have invented Planck length himself. Dimensional analysis as I described above is such a common tool for physicists that anyone who just knew about the three constants could immediately do it and thus the &quot;inventor&quot; of Planck length is probably not known.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To add: We don't really know if that length scale (and the other Planck scales) has any actual meaning. There are hints from theories we have at hand and it's quite believable that something ought to happen at these scales, but we don't have any experimental evidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two factors I think are worth mentionig.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Roche Limit describes the distance from a celestial body at which a satellite will be torn apart by tidal forces. It's approximate and depends somewhat on composition, but it is very roughly 2.5 radii of the main body. <a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/roche_limit.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
</li>
<li>The sphere of influence is the distance at which, in this case, the moon's gravity is less of a factor on an object than the earth's gravity. Any further from the moon than this and the object would no longer orbit the moon, but rather orbit Earth. Our moon's SOI is about 38 lunar radii <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_(astrodynamics)" target="_blank">source</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So a satellite of the moon needs to orbit at a distance greater than 2.5 lunar radii but less than 38. Closer and it would break up, further and it would drift away. Of course, as others have said, a subsatellite would not stay in this zone, as it's an unstable orbit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
