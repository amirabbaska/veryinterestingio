		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a psychiatrist and suicidologist, unfortunately I am on my mobile and cannot provide citations easily.  </p>
<p>The short answer on the whole population level is not significantly, but the longer answer is rather complicated. </p>
<p>First of all, very few people with depression is by suicide.  Overall, the rate of suicide in the Western world is generally 11 per 100000 per year. Having depression increases your risk of suicide by 3 to 5 times.  Therefore, we can translate those rates into 33 to 55 per 100000 per year.  Being depressed includes suicidal thinking as part of the illness, but it is not a common outcome to die by suicide.</p>
<p>Second, there are multiple risk factors for suicide. Depression is but one.  Family history, substance use, social circumstances, marital status, stress at work, resilience, etc... These are all factors of suicide risk, and are not changed.</p>
<p>Third, having depression doesn't mean you have taken antidepressants.  There is still a strong anti medication stigma put out there, and many people with depression are not compliant to their treatments (therapy or medication).  I sit on a coroner review panel in my province and review suicide analysis regularly.  A small percentage of depressed people who died by suicide (which is a subgroup of those who died by suicide) actually have detectable levels of antidepressants in their blood on autopsy.</p>
<p>Fourth, the effect size of antidepressants is good (0.45 to 0.8), but is not large enough to significantly statistically alter population levels of suicide.</p>
<p>Overall, the risk of suicidality on antidepressants (0.87% people get suicidal thoughts in the first two weeks under the age of 24, but let me tell you that the evidence for this is way shakier than most are aware) is much less than the risk of suicidality with depression and NOT on antidepressants, and the &quot;number needed to treat&quot; to effectively treat a depression is about 5 to 9.</p>
<p>On individual studies, taking an SSRI significantly increases the length of time one goes without suicidal thinking, and is an effective treatment for depression (equal to therapy and superior when both are combined), and I would guess likely does reduce suicidality overall in the group of those who take them.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people keep mentioning that depressed people starting medication have increased rates of suicidality (maybe now due to having energy for actions - I believe a claim made by industry). However, it is important to remember that healthy adults also have this trend. It is possible that anti-depressants just have this side effect. Anti-depressents are still considered one of the most effective treatments with people who have severe depression. But I would think of this side effect as something unfortunate that could happen with medication for a serious disease.</p>

What this doesn't address are the suicides caused by antidepressants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like surely mathematicians have discovered just about everything we can do with math by now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heavens, no!</p>
<p>What you learn in school as mathematics is actually just a small <em>subset</em> (and many say a very <em>boring</em> subset) of what mathematics is generally.  There are branches of mathematics that deal with things like studying the properties of prime numbers (which is <em>one</em> element of a field called number theory, and is studied from a variety of different perspectives), or with understanding the behavior and structure of surfaces as you stretch or fold or manipulate them (part of topology), or with understanding how the solutions to certain polynomial equations can lead to beautiful links between geometry and algebra and even topology (one aspect of algebraic geometry), or with understanding arrangement of objects that meet certain requirements of symmetry (design theory, which is a subfield of combinatorics).</p>
<p>In each of these fields, there are plenty of open questions.  Some of them are technical and intricate-- you would need some serious background to understand the question itself.  But some of the questions are easy to understand, but still a real <em>bitch</em> to answer.</p>
<p>For instance, there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="_blank">Collatz Conjecture</a>, which is straightforward enough as a problem (do all positive integers eventually settle into the 4-2-1 pattern?).  We don't have a solution for the problem, and our toolkit for going after this sort of problem isn't very well-developed.  It's likely to remain an open problem for a while.</p>
<p>Trick is, mathematics is the study of relationships and interconnections of ideas.  Those ideas are often very carefully defined, but that care and precision allows mathematicians to bring a variety of tools to bear on those ideas.</p>
<p>And ideas are... well, ideas are everywhere.  Somebody wondered what would happen if you brought mathematical ideas to bear on the Rubik's cube.  Or Sudoku.  At a big math conference this year, somebody discussed what could happen if you put the game &quot;Flow Free&quot; onto a different shape, like a ball or a donut.  Mathematicians looking at quantum physics said, &quot;Hey, that looks like the symmetric group!&quot; and helped build models for the behavior of particles at a ridiculously small scale.  There have been mathematical tools developed to measure gerrymandering.  Somebody looked at data science and data analysis, and realized that some of the problems looked a lot like topological problems-- and so there is a field called &quot;topological data analysis&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is preventing this end point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say the fact that mathematics has an infinite number of questions to ask, and at least SOME of those questions will always be interesting to SOMEBODY.  Fermat's Last Theorem captured the imaginations of mathematicians for CENTURIES-- which is all to the good, because many of the failed attempts led to interesting new tools, or to related questions.  Even in &quot;failure&quot;, mathematics often advances itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first question to ask is: what do any academics do, especially in STEM? What is left to discover? We can look at physics. If Newton's view of physics was right, research would largely have died out long ago. But the universe is much stranger than we thought. Relativity, Quantum Theory, Exotic Particles, etc. There's so much going on that we have open questions left for many future lifetimes. And how about biology? Well, if it was all about balancing the four humors, we wouldn't have quite so many people in labcoats. But even just human biology is a tremendous biochemical and genetic mess that we are just starting to de-tangle. So it probably doesn't seem too strange that professional biologists exist.</p>
<p>One reason you might think that all math has been discovered is that you haven't been acquainted with how large and strange the mathematical universe is. Mathematical models are, and have been, used to describe physical phenomenon from the complex rippling of waves to the folding of proteins and the stochastic behavior of the stock market. Deep mathematical ideas are needed to talk about relativity and quantum mechanics and string theory and to help find structure in the genetic code. Computer encryption uses mathematics, so there must be some part of mathematics that deals with how to conceal and recover information. Modern machine learning relies on increasingly sophisticated paradigms of statistical inference. In a certain sense (with some important caveats), mathematics needs to be at least as complicated as any of its applications.</p>
<p>Behind (beneath?) these applications is so-called pure mathematics. The distinction is fuzzy near the boundary but not entirely arbitrary. There are mathematicians that try to understand the nature of logical and mathematical systems: can everything proven be true? can our axioms describe everything of interest? There are mathematicians that try to understand how to compare and quantify knots. There are mathematicians that try to study how complex multi-dimensional signals can be decomposed into various sorts of basic waves. There are mathematicians trying to build a 'multiverse' of geometries in which different shapes can be compared and moved between. There are mathematicians who try to find fast algorithms to find routes on complex networks.</p>
<p>The key word in all these examples is &quot;trying&quot;. As mathematicians, we are foraying into the unknown. We don't know what will work and what will fail. We remain largely ignorant of the important questions to ask. It often turns out that we were studying something from the wrong perspective, making it unnecessarily difficult. And more often than not, every time we get an answer it gives us just enough insight to realize how peculiar and strange it all is, and sends us down yet another rabbit hole. We're currently far below the surface of the earth, moving between massive caverns by way of increasingly narrow tunnels. Please send help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is an example of what an applied mathematician might be doing:</p>
<p>A widely studied (yet still not completely understood) phenomenon is fluid turbulence.</p>
<p>When you look at the smoke coming from a fire, and you see all the swirls in the smoke, you are observing turbulence. When you are on an airplane, and suddenly the plane starts shaking, you are experiencing turbulence. Given how common fluids are in the world, understanding how turbulence behaves is super important.</p>
<p>We would like to be able to explain how turbulence behaves using mathematics. The reason we are using mathematics, is because mathematics is the tool that physicists and engineers use to do what they do. </p>
<p>Think about how you can use mathematics to calculate how long it takes for a ball to fall from a tall building. The same is true for using mathematics to explain how turbulence behaves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, trying to characterize turbulence, and trying to predict how it behaves using mathematics is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>It's so difficult, that there hundreds of mathematicians and scientists all over the world studying it, and working out the mathematics needed to fully describe turbulence.</p>
<p>You need complicated mathematics to be able to calculate things like how a fluid flows around objects, or how objects moving through fluids are affected. </p>
<p>At some point (not too far ahead though, unfortunately), the mathematics needed just hasn't been developed yet.</p>
<p>You need mathematicians to come up with ideas, and to work out these ideas, to make sure that these ideas are indeed correct. They spend a lot of time proving things, because they want to be sure that what they are discovering is correct.</p>
<p>This field has been around for a few hundred years now, and there is still a lot more to learn.</p>
<p>I hope that helped. Although my example was for applied mathematicians (mathematicians whose work directly relates to real world applications), pure mathematicians do a similar thing, except their work is more abstract.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Capsaicin has been shown to do this experimentally (though the only study I found was when it was given intravenously, rather than inhaled, though the effect was still on pulmonary irritant receptors). Next time you have a stuffy nose, try sniffing it in front of a mirror and see if your nose flares slightly.</p>
<p>The additional mucous production is likely counterproductive to decongestion, but is effective in trapping and expelling unwanted irritants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To some extend a microwave can kill bacteria, but not all bacteria can be considered equal in terms of conditions required to inactivate or kill them. As you might understand there are many factors in play to consider such as the material, thickness of the material and the type of bacteria so it's not possible to give you a generalised answer that will apply to everything you stick in the microwave.</p>
<p>Perhaps you've heard of this tip before. Stick a sponge in a microwave to disinfect the sponge. Going by this example the following has been found. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/health/27real.html" target="_blank">NYTimes - The Claim: You Can Disinfect a Kitchen Sponge in the Microwave (2007)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, at least two studies have put the claim to the test, and both have confirmed it. The most recent, published in the December 2006 issue of The Journal of Environmental Health, found that microwaving kitchen sponges and other scrubbing pads for one to two minutes at full power could reduce levels of bacteria, including E. coli and other common causes of food-borne illness, by more than 99 percent.</p>
<p>A previous study in 1999 found that many bacteria are eliminated within the first 15 seconds of being heated by microwave, and that only E. coli survive longer than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>To avoid fires or overheating, the authors of the 2006 study recommended that only damp sponges and those without metal be zapped. But some experts say the practice poses a safety hazard and should be discouraged. Some news accounts have described cases in which kitchen sponges caught fire while being cooked by microwave.</p>
<p>Other studies have found a safer alternative: soaking soiled sponges in diluted solutions of bleach, which is just as effective as heating. Then again, there is an even simpler option: tossing the sponge out and getting a new one.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6293735.stm" target="_blank">BBC - Microwave 'sterilisers' warning (2007)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Gabriel Bitton, a expert in environmental engineering at the University of Florida, and colleagues contaminated kitchen sponges and plastic scrubbing pads in dirty water which contained faecal bacteria, viruses, protozoan parasites and bacterial spores.</p>
<p>After two minutes on full power, 99% of bacteria were inactivated. And E. coli bacteria were killed after just 30 seconds. Bacillus cereus spores - which are largely associated with vegetables or foods in contact with soil and are normally quite resistant to radiation, heat and toxic chemicals - were completely eradicated after four minutes in the microwave.</p>
<p>Professor Britton said it was likely to be heat, rather than radiation, that proved fatal <del>as microwaves worked by exciting water molecules.</del></p>
<p>The team also looked at whether the microwave oven could be used to sterilise contaminated syringes. It was found to be an effective method but took far longer - up to 12 minutes for the Bacillus cereus spores.</p>
<p>Professor Hugh Pennington, a food safety expert at the University of Aberdeen said heating was an effective way of sterilising kitchen equipment.</p>
<p>He said heat was an obvious method of sterilisation.</p>

<p>Disinfect: To kill all pathogens but not all microorganisms</p>
<p>Decontaminate: To make something safe for use by the general public</p>
<p>Sterilize: To kill all life, including viruses</p>
<p>Microwaves, do not kill cells by altering cellular structures, they just kill cells by heat. So it can kill cells to an extent, and can decontaminate if you let the microwave run long enough to get the food or whatever being heated to a high enough temperature. However, it does not necessarily disinfect. Food is always and only decontaminated. I've never heard of any industry or company disinfecting food, not sure it would be safe for consumption.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, even boiling cannot sterilize. You must use either incineration or a combination of pressure and heat, in order to increase the temperature of water past 100 degrees Celsius to kill all life. </p>
<p>Extra knowledge, endospores are an extremely heat resistant form bacteria can create, and they can outlive all other forms of vegetative bacteria. These are usually the hardest to get rid of when sterilizing something, unless there is extremely heat resistant Archae present in your food, highly unlikely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a sterile compounding IV room, and I can't help but chuckle when people think they've &quot;sterilized&quot; or &quot;disinfected&quot; something. In order to enter an IV compounding room, you must cover hair, shoes, beards, and face up to your nose, wash up to your elbows for 30+ seconds, dry with a low-lint paper towel drying elbow to hand elbow to hand, elbow to hand, put on a low-linting garment, and then apply alcohol-based sanitizer to your hands for 30 seconds or until dry. Then you must put on sterile gloves. That means not the gloves in the boxes. These come like band-aids are packaged and you must put them on without ever touching the outside of the glove with your bare hand or the inside of one glove to the outside of the other. Then you must spray these gloves with 70% <em>sterile</em> alcohol. (Yes. 70% isopropyl alcohol is not sterile by default). You are now ready to begin compounding. Because you shed about 600K particles per hour of filthy skin cells, you're basically the highest risk item and must constantly redisinfect. You must work in a space that delivers HEPA filtered air in one direction so that no microbes land in the exposed sites like needles and vial membranes -- which must be wiped three times in one direction before you use them because those are not sterile either. </p>
<p>Bacteria can survive outer space. They can survive 70% alcohol. They can survive radiation. They can survive just about anything. Unless there was some type of harmful bacteria in the food that was pathological, you probably don't have to worry about it because unless you perform the procedure above at all times, your food and house and you are crawling with bacteria at all times, especially since you have more bacteria cells than human cells. So it's all kind of  irrelevant. Wash with hot water and soap or a high-temperature dishwasher and that should be adequate for a dish you're using to eat.</p>
<p>Microwaves work by heating water. They're not as good at heating other things. Furthermore, it needs to be pressurized to sterilize bacteria because the temperature to kill everything but prions is 250ºF or 121ºC for ≥15 minutes. Bleaching the sponge or immersing in rubbing alcohol would work better. (Particularly in sequence).</p>
<p>TL;DR, it's the heat and pressure, unfortunately, your microwave is unable to generate it such that anything can be even remotely called disinfected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough, I think it's a both yes and no answer. </p>
<p>Yes, the heat generated from microwaves DOES kill most bacteria. Provided that the heat is high enough and for long enough periods. </p>
<p>This includes the heat that is generated by the microwave bouncing off the moisture within the bacteria. </p>
<p>Now...the real question might be, if you kept the pathogen cool, or if the pathogen did not contain any moisture, would the microwave kill it? </p>
<p>I think the answer is no - it would not kill it. Hence the reason why bacteria still survives in a microwave oven even after prolonged exposure, simply because the bacteria is kept cool or kept from heating up to a degree that would kill it. </p>
<p>Therefore microwaves themselves most likely do not kill pathogens. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The languages you are talking about are the Indo-European languages. Almost all languages in Europe are part of this language family. The original language that all of these descended from (Proto-Indo-European) had gendered words like that, so almost all of the languages that came from it also have it. Originally, there were three genders: feminine, masculine, and neuter. Some languages, like Russian and German, still have this. Some other languages, like Swedish, merged the feminine and masculine words to make a 'common' gender along with neuter. The Romance languages have gotten rid of the neuter gender and have the feminine/masculine words you were talking about. Funnily enough, English also used to have feminine, masculine, and neuter words, but over time people just kind of got rid of them, and now english is almost completely genderless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a vestige of the old Proto-Indo-European language. It simply had these classes. Many other languages have different classes; some use animate-inanimate. Many Native American languages have multiple classes that describe the noun (usually with animacy, state, and consistency). Most linguists use gender when it comes to actual gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter), while reserving class for pretty much everything else.</p>
<p>Gender is usually only grammatical. For instance, German <strong>Weib</strong> (&quot;woman&quot;) is neuter. So as I've said before, it's just vestiges of an ancient ancestral language. Nothing to do with sexism or whatever (usually).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to realise that many - even <em>most</em> &quot;why&quot; questions about grammar just don't have a good answer. Languages developed quasi-randomly, mostly without direction and often without &quot;natural selection&quot; evolving the language towards certain useful features. So a lot of quirks are just there because, well... they just are!</p>
<p>So the real answer is that <strong>we don't know, and possibly there is no good reason.</strong> However we can make some guesses which, in the case that gender didn't just happen for no reason, make sense. The first is that gender makes things less ambiguous. Think about the sentence:</p>
<pre><code>There is a shelf in the shop which I clean.</code></pre>
<p>Do I clean the shop or the shelf? In German this would be:</p>
<pre><code>Es gibt ein Regal in dem Laden *das/den* ich putze.</code></pre>
<p>If you use <em>das</em> then it means you clean the shelf, if <em>den</em> then it is the shop: there's no confusion, because the word has to change depending on the gender of the noun it's referring to.</p>
<p>The next useful feature is that gender just serves as an extra part of the word which, if you have two words which sound similar, serves to make it clear which you meant.</p>
<p>Other people have mentioned that the ancestor language of all Indo-European languages had gender, and this is why <em>so many</em> modern European languages have it now. Hopefully the above explains what we can say about why gender might have developed in Proto-Indo-European.</p>
<p>Finally let me point out that you should not get confused by the terms &quot;gender,&quot; &quot;masculine&quot;, &quot;feminine&quot; etc. &quot;Gender&quot; originally <em>only</em> meant the grammatical category and had nothing to do with human beings. It was occasionally used (often humorously) to refer to people being male or female, and then, because &quot;sex&quot; stopped meaning just &quot;male or female&quot; but started being short for &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and therefore being naughty, people started using &quot;gender&quot; to mean &quot;sex&quot; much more often. But this was in the early 20th century and way after &quot;gender&quot; had long been used more as a grammatical term, or a way to just say &quot;type.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't find anything about why &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; were the words used to talk about two of the genders, when they were also used to talk about people's sex. In English, the grammatical term is attested first but I suspect this usage all goes back to Latin. Anyway my point is that you shouldn't read too much into the names for what words are and what people are being the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a linguist at all, but I've noticed it can be helpful for disambiguation.  Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<p>First, consider sentences like, &quot;Put the microwave on the conveyer belt, and then put the ball on it.&quot;  Does &quot;it&quot; refer to the conveyer belt, or the microwave?  It's actually unclear.  So instead of &quot;it&quot;, you would have to say &quot;the microwave&quot; or &quot;the conveyer belt&quot; at the end of the sentence, which adds several syllables and makes the sentence longer, and we're always searching for shorthand.</p>
<p>Now imagine that &quot;microwave&quot; were feminine and &quot;conveyer belt&quot; were masculine.  Then instead of &quot;it&quot;, you would be able to say &quot;her&quot; or &quot;him&quot;, and your meaning would be obvious.  So you'd be able to say a shorter sentence without making it more ambiguous.  If there are 3 genders, then it might be unambiguous 67% of the time by random chance.</p>
<p>Second, I've noticed (this is an information-theory type of answer) is that sometimes extra syllables (sentence context) can make it easier to understand someone's meaning.  Imagine someone says &quot;Hand me the ta-&quot; and you aren't sure if they said &quot;tap&quot; or &quot;tape&quot; or &quot;tab&quot;.  If the word &quot;the&quot; comes in one of three genders for each of the words, then you can more easily guess which one follows.  Stealing from German for a moment, imagine the words are &quot;der tap&quot;, &quot;die tape&quot;, &quot;das tab&quot;.  If someone says &quot;Hand me der ta-&quot; then you can be pretty sure they meant &quot;der tap&quot; and not &quot;das tab&quot;, from the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>So I'm not totally sure how that sort of thing would evolve, but I can see how it adds greater redundancy to sentence structure and makes it easier for people with different accents of the same language group to communicate.</p>
<p>Edit: Oops, I just noticed F0sh's answer was similar.  Check that one out too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Much like when you are very nervous or unsure and ask yourself &quot;Am I really going to do this?&quot; And you truly don't know but then you somehow decide and either do it or don't!</p>
<p>It also mentions how this type of inner dialog may have influenced humans view of religion because they literally heard someone telling them what to do.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's 'hearing voices' and there's your internal monologue.</p>
<p>One is some people's stream of consciousness - the way they think - in a verbal way rather than visual way.</p>
<p>The other is often a symptom of schizophrenia or a hallucination.</p>
<p>Whether these two things are linked is an interesting question. i.e is the fact that I recognise my inner voice as my own thoughts the only thing that differs?</p>
<p>I believe this inner voice is (at least one of the things) that Buddhists are trying to escape from by meditating. Which I don't really understand. e.g I was out walking last night and I constantly converse with myself, think of different ideas and mull things as I'm doing that, to the point where I can have covered a large distance without really being aware. To me that's what makes activities like cycling and walking relaxing.</p>
<p>Whereas it seems to be that Buddhists believe that ignoring your thoughts and instead trying to focus on being in the moment is important.</p>
<p>Perhaps a lot depends upon what kind of thoughts you have. If you're fretting and anxious about things maybe you would want to escape it. I can't help thinking that a lot of epiphanies in maths and physics were reached by this kind of inner conversation - I'm sure most of us are thinking about more mundane things though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was very effective against unsupported cavalry. At Waterloo, for example, French cavalry fruitlessly tried attacking allied/British infantry in squares for an extended period of time. Forming a square was a purely anti-cavalry tactic, as it had weaknesses, but it worked for at least three reasons (this list is probably not exhaustive):</p>
<ol>
<li>As others have pointed out, there is no flank and all fronts.</li>
<li>Horses will not charge into things.</li>
<li>Squares are much more densly packed with arms than cavalry.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order, cavalry charging out of where you did not expect them to come and hitting your flanks or rear is an infantry nightmare. Squares prevent this by making sure there are no flanks. Wherever the cavalry is, it is facing an infantry front. This is no fun for the cavalrymen.</p>
<p>And unlike what some will have you believe, horses will not charge into things. They will no more run madly into a wall of bayonets and musket fire than you will run into a wall unflinchingly. Anyone who has ever been on a horse will know this. The nearest thing to this happening was at García Hernández in 1812 when a mortally wounded horse stumbled into a square like a ram and thrashes about (opening the path to other cavalry which charged into the square and - unsurprisingly - had a field day as all the enemy were suddenly showing their rear).</p>
<p>Finally, the firepower and bayonets of a square made it almost impenetrable to cavalry. Squares at Waterloo were mostly four ranks deep. The first rank would kneel and plant the musket butt in the ground, with fixed bayonets, creating a wall of spears. The other ranks were free to fire. The infantrymen would stand more or less shoulder to shoulder, many deep, meaning there were a lot of musekts and bayonets pr yard of square front. The cavalry, on the other hand, would ride about outside the square, needing room to manouvre, with considerable space between the horses, all the time sitting on an unstable platform (the horse moving about) whilst the infantry was densely packed and standing on firm ground. The disparity in volume of fire over the fronts of the squares was tremendous, meaning for every carbine or pistol the cavalrymen could fire at the square, many, many times that number of muskets would fire back.</p>
<p>The weakness of the square was if it was broken, which it sometimes was when infantry panicked, it was done for. Then it became a death trap. Interestingly, in the movie Waterloo (1970) which was filmed with Red Army extras in huge numbers both as infantry and cavalry, you can in some scenes see squares disintegrating. These were extras in a movie - perfectly safe- but apparently the experience was still scary enough to break them. The real thing must have been very tough going.</p>
<p>The other problem was the density. If cavalry was supported by infantry or artillery, the cavalry could force the enemy to maintain a square and then artillery would have a field day with an enemy presenting a perfect target. This was much of the reason for horse artillery, which could keep up with cavalry and help it defeat infantry squares. Or supporting infantry would be able to deploy in line and overwhelm the square with more efficient infantry tactics (essentially having all the infantry face one side of the enemy square, where three quarters of the square would be unable to use their weapons against them).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A well disciplined square formation was absolutely very effective against cavalry (although by no means immune) but only if done right. </p>
<p>First, there's no flank or rear to attack, which is the ideal tactic when using cavalry. In a square formation, all your weapons are facing outward.</p>
<p>Second, horses have the same self preservation instinct as humans but without military training, and and such, they won't willing run into volley fire or a wall of bayonets. A well timed square could catch a cavalry charge off guard and take large numbers of them out with volley fire and impale the rest with bayonets.</p>
<p>The flip side is that a poorly timed or executed square could quickly turn into a death trap. If the square formed too early or didn't time their fire correctly, the cavalry could regroup at a safe distance and harass them back with their own fire. Worse, infantry support could surround the square and attack or hold them in place under artillery fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The advantage that cavalry has over infantry is in speed and mobility.</p>
<p>A square formation helps counter this in two way </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's hard to flank - if the cavalry attempts to go around and attack on the side, the essentially encountering another front</p>
</li>
<li>Because it's several lines deep it can't be charged over (and allow the cavalry to return for a second charge). The horses get &quot;bogged&quot; down and are easier to fight back against. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cavalry was usually still going to be much more effective against infantry in almost any situation though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cavalry moves much faster than infantry, so it can always out-maneuver infantry and attack from the weakest side.  A square equalizes the firepower in all directions so there is no 'weakest side'.  (Note: a mathematician might quibble with using a square, but you also need a formation that can be easily assumed by infantrymen jostling in relation to one another).</p>
<p>The reason they used the square was that it was effective.  Firearms were very inaccurate, so you really needed mass volley fire to do much good.  If you had a situation where isolated infantrymen were put up against cavalry, they normally wouldn't be able to do much because the cavalry could close faster than they'd be able to land a lucky shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: it knows you want to restart because up until you actually do the restart it can remember things, including whether you clicked &quot;shutdown&quot; or &quot;restart&quot;.  If you tell it to restart, it doesn't actually turn off power - it just wipes the CPU back to a &quot;clean&quot; state.</p>
<p>Long answer:  Your OS will shut down normally (flush writes to disk, park the drives, etc).  However, while doing so it will also know whether it's going for a halt or a restart.  </p>
<p>Once it's finished shutting down, the processor will then send an ACPI command to the motherboard.  Again, depending on the shut-down mode you've selected, this will either be a &quot;shutdown&quot; command or a &quot;restart&quot; command.  </p>
<p>In the case of a shutdown command, the CPU basically tells the motherboard to turn off the power supply.  You wouldn't want your power supply running all the time and consuming power, so normally only a small part of the power supply is turned on while idling.  When your motherboard wants power turned on it completes a circuit which tells the power supply to turn on power to the rest of the system.  Normally this is when you push the power switch - but modern motherboards can start themselves on a timer, or from a USB event (clicking the mouse), or from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN" target="_blank">network command from a remote computer</a>.  During shut-down, it simply breaks this circuit and the power supply turns off.</p>
<p>If it wants to do a restart instead, the CPU executes an instruction which returns everything to the &quot;default&quot; state.  This clears all the registers, the internal modes (by default every CPU boots up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode" target="_blank">an ancient mode</a> that would let it boot very old operating systems), the cache, etc.  It's just like the CPU had just had power applied to it. </p>
<p>In theory there's no reason you couldn't actually have the system shut off and set a start timer for one second later (since the motherboard can start the system on a timer).  It's just easier and faster to reset the CPU.</p>
<p>One problematic area can be the other components in your system.  The CPU may be wiped clean, but things like your graphics card's frame-buffers will not be.  Some applications (particularly games) won't wipe their window buffer before they start - so while they're loading it may display a picture of the FreakyMidgets.com page you were on before you did the restart.  Memory, also, is pretty notorious for having the ability to hold data for much longer than its specs would imply (especially if you hit it with something ultra-cold like liquid nitrogen).</p>
<p>On the software side of things - one interesting aspect of modern OSs is they never really &quot;shut down&quot;.  It used to be that when you shut your computer down all the operating system internal code (the kernel) would have to be re-initialized from scratch.  This takes a really long time, several seconds even on a fast computer.  So modern OSs (Windows 8 and up) will actually write the kernel's state to disk before they shut down.  Then they will just load the kernel state from disk rather than set everything up from scratch.  This is the &quot;Fast Boot&quot; mode, officially called Hybrid Boot because it's a hybrid of a shutdown and a hibernate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

cold&quot; start. Cold starts are coming up from no power to the machine, when you physically give the start signal to a powered off machine, and the machine completely initializes itself from nothing.</p>
<p>When you perform a soft reset, or a hot reset, you aren't reinitializing the hardware of the machine quite the same way. Some of the management controls just roll back to a certain point of their power-on cycle (we'll call it step 2, whereas step 1 is actually providing power to everything) and kicks the BIOS off and back into your operating system.</p>
<p>Because a soft reset like when you do a &quot;restart&quot; command never interrupts power to your computer, the management controllers can influence how they turn back on.</p>
<p>If you want to think of it in a flowchart kind of way, hitting the power button initiates step 1 of the power on process, and the power controller(s) will provide power to all of the peripheral devices to get them initialized. Step 2 will load firmware/BIOS and run them to get everything on the motherboard synchronized with eachother. A soft reset would skip step 1 and go right to step 2, because it knows step1 is already done.</p>

<p>Then some power management features were designed and made standard. This was know as ACPI and one of those features was to do a full shutdown of the machine so that &quot;it is now safe to turn off&quot; message was relegated to the past. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The BIOS is the thing that makes it take a few seconds before you get the windows logo. It checks to see whats connected, what the processor is and it's timing, and a couple other things. It can do that because it is a processing system separate from the CPU and the OS. When you tell the computer to restart, the OS tells the BIOS &quot;Hey we need to restart&quot;. The BIOS then shuts down (not off) everything except the power, and then when everything has reported back &quot;I'm down&quot;, the BIOS triggers the restart.</p>
<p>Remember when you added RAM to the computer that message you got?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>System memory changed from 512KB to 640KB. Continue? (Y/n)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was the BIOS. Windows has no idea how much RAM there is, nor most things about the hardware attached to the system, until the BIOS decides to tell it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The general argument is that regulations like this make it more difficult for someone to open or run a new business or plant, so they are less likely to build that.  Those new establishments would have employed people, so by discouraging people from starting these establishments, they are in essence preventing jobs from being created.  You'll see similar thinking applied when someone argues against any regulation.  </p>
<p>If I can inject my own opinion, this argument makes more sense if you're already not inclined to care about the environment.  We could encourage the creation of jobs in other, non-environmentally damaging, areas by investing in solar, but it's easier to say &quot;fuck nature.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the <a href="https://www.osmre.gov/programs/rcm/streamprotectionrule.shtm" target="_blank">actual rule</a>.</p>
<p>In layman's terms, what the rule does is give a federal regulatory body authority to deny a mining operations permit if they believe the mining operations will effect the natural habitat of a stream.</p>
<p>The primary criticism of the rule is that it's purposefully broad and vague, and thus, gives regulators the ability to deny permits for almost any coal mining operation and makes it more costly to apply for coal mining permits.  Also, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Water_Act" target="_blank">Clean Water Act</a> already prohibits companies from dumping waste into streams and rivers.  Regulators already have the authority to shut down mining operations if they suspect there are Clean Water Act violations.  The functional effect of this rule would be to mire coal mining operations in a long, bureacratic money pit to pursue any new mining operations.  </p>
<p>It's worth noting that this rule was rushed through at the very end of Obama's presidency, less than a month before Trump took office.  It's so new it really hasn't even gone into effect yet.</p>
<p>Basically, it's a poor implementation of a good idea.  We don't want industry to dump waste into streams and rivers.  That's why we already have laws prohibiting it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I lived in WV as many coal mines were being shut down. It was an everyday occurrence for the mines to announce that a few hundred people had lost their jobs. When I moved away, [less than half the people] (<a href="https://secure.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-only-state-where-less-than-half-its-citizens-work-2015-01-13" target="_blank">https://secure.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-only-state-where-less-than-half-its-citizens-work-2015-01-13</a>) even had jobs. </p>
<p>I keep reading these posts that speak as though water is the only problem that needs solving in America, but many of these people need food and shelter. Many of these people would love to have a sense of self-worth as they work and would love to have something to do with their lives. Water certainly needs to be clean, but it's more complicated than it seems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you have two mines/factories/whatever that are otherwise identical,  but one needs to build pollution control facilities and pay pollution control staff,<br />
and the other company doesn't.   Which one can sell its product for a lower price? </p>
<p>If you ignore the external effects of the pollution,  healthcare and cleanup,  assuming those things get paid for,  then it is cheaper to not have regulations.   Even if you do pay for those things,  it can be other industries essentially subsidising the polluting one by paying a larger share of tax for cleanup. </p>
<p>Of course it's madness.  But if you think China is 'winning' by building hundred of coal generating stations a year and making so much airborne pollutants it is toxic,  then you think mimicking that will level the competitive playing field. China is understandably a bit bipolar on the issue,  with efforts to cut pollution but the need to meet energy demands of a wealthier population.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.   Coal is largely expensive as a source of energy in the US compared to any other fossil fuel.  Some politicians thought that they could win an election by tricking people in coal mining country (who, by and large are not only suffering from low employment but some laid off coal miners are dealing with black lung) into thinking that jobs would come back to their area if regulations on coal mining were eased.  </p>
<p>If you were to drop all the regulations on coal mining, yes it would make coal more competitive but those regulations are there for a reason.  Coal is a dirty, dirty fuel source.<br />
And the jobs aren't coming back, because <a href="http://www.mining.com/study-shows-96-of-some-mining-jobs-can-be-automated/" target="_blank">coal mining is more automated</a> than it used to be.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
