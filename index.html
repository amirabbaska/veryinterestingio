<p>Really, the current system is hot water pipe + cold water pipe, and you choose the mixture.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They make them. Pretty expensive but they are out there.</p>
<p>A shower or even a sink for that matter generally works like this:</p>
<p>There are two valves, one hot one cold. The more you turn the knob towards COLD, the cold water valve pushes more water out than than the HOT water valve. Same works for hot water. If you put the knob on HOT, more water will be pushed from the hot water valve than the cold. </p>
<p>When you turn the knob, you're not exactly putting it on a &quot;temperature&quot;; you're adjusting the water pressure between the hot and cold water valves until it feels ideal on your body.</p>
<p>Not really sure how the new thermostatic temperature controls work in a shower but I would imagine they read the temperature of the water as it flows through the valves and automatically adjusts to your desired temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Among other reasons, tobacco companies suppress knowledge on the toxic stuff in cigarettes.</p>
<p>Take polonium-210, an isotope in the radium decay chain. It's been known to be a major carcinogen in cigarette smoke since the 1960s. Tobacco growers failed to clean the stuff from the tobacco leaves, partially because the washing process removed the flavor and partially because it was not effective in general. They then tried to filter it out, but that, too, was ineffective and introduced its own problems. They then tried to genetically engineer plants that wouldn't absorb the Po-210, but funding kept being cut right before results were analyzed, so no data could ever be published. In the end, instead of continuing to try to remove the Po-210, tobacco companies stopped publication on the problem to avoid lawsuits.</p>
<p>It's one of those things that seems like a crazy conspiracy theory, but here it is in the NIH archives: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509609/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509609/</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeds generally require three things to &quot;decide&quot; to germinate: warmth, oxygen, and water. </p>
<p>Water affects seeds by causing them to swell enormously and break through their coating, allowing the seed to begin to grow. At the same time, the water activates hydrolytic enzymes (chemicals which cause water to react with other chemicals, producing hydroxides and hydrides), and these enzymes break down stored food and other nutrients in the seed into useful things which the plant can use to grow - an example being the breakdown of stored starch into sugar (glucose) molecules, which can be used by the germinating seed to respire aerobically and produce energy for all sorts of things, as well as the production of cellulose for cell walls.</p>
<p>Oxygen is required for the seed to germinate because it is used in many processes, but most importantly, aerobic respiration which provides energy to the plant (as mentioned above). The seed simply cannot germinate without oxygen.</p>
<p>Temperature affects many chemical reactions in the plant, and usually lower temperature means slower/no reaction, which again means that the seed cannot grow and germinate. A sudden rise in temperature allows reactions to occur, which in turn allows the seed to germinate.</p>
<p>How do the seeds hibernate? Well, a seed is robust, and requires a very tiny amount of energy to remain living. Similar to how a chicken egg can remain dormant and rely on minuscule nutrition for 10 days while the mother chicken decides whether or not to sit on it, the living part of a seed (called the embryo - <a href="https://bam.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zhp4q6f/small" target="_blank">here's a diagram</a>) can also consume tiny quantities of food and remain living for a long time, waiting for the right conditions to begin growing. The embryo has evolved to survive on a small amount of nutrients in a number of ways. A huge proportion of the energy intake of a human is spent on heating the body; plants do not heat themselves, and so don't need to spend energy on this. This is also the main reason that a snake can eat a deer and not eat again for weeks or months. The embryo doesn't grow or repair itself either, another large expense of energy for most life. It is incredibly efficient.</p>
<p>In the case of the Siberian seeds which were germinated after 32,000 years, the freezing, oxygen-starved and dry conditions in which the seeds were kept would have slowed down the processes of the embryo significantly, allowing for more longevity, as the embryo would consume its stores at a much slower rate. In carefully controlled lab conditions, with the right care, the seeds are able to germinate - although they probably wouldn't have been able to do so if they had just been planted in some field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I don't think they sprouted like normal seeds. It sounds like they used tissue culture to do it. I know in the other <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/051122-old-plant-seed-food/" target="_blank">2,000 year old seeds that previously held the record</a> they had to treat the seeds so they could absorb water, provide nutrients for it and it took months to germinate a seed.

<p>The thing I'm kind of missing is how this necessarily leads to the idea of a point of near - infinite density and infinitesimal volume.  From my limited understanding, part of the idea of a singularity is that we don't understand how the physics of such an object would work at all, in common parlance we hear that physics &quot;breaks down.&quot;  If we're going to admit that physics as we understand them can't tell us anything useful about a singularity, what leads us to believe the collapse wouldn't stop at say - the size of a tennis ball, or the Planck length, or something like that? </p>
<p><del>Also, can someone speak to any explanation of the coincidence that the density we calculate as being unable to observe due to it's escape velocity is <em>exactly</em> the density that we calculate collapses into a singularity?</del> EDIT: That is not the case, thanks /u/Robo_Connery.</p></div></div>

<p>There is nothing stopping there being another pressure that we don't know about, &quot;string pressure&quot; or some exotic matter pressure.

<p>This is not true at all. There is no coincidence because the two things (formation of event horizon and exceeding the maximum pressure) don't happen at the same time.</p>
<p>If we have a fictitious neutron star that we gradually add mass to we will eventually reach the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit. This limit is when any extra mass we add will increase the gravity of the star beyond what the internal pressure can support.</p>
<p>At the exact point you reach this limit the surface escape velocity is LESS than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Since the force pulling stuff in exceeds the force pushing stuff out the star will shrink, very quickly it will have shrunk from it's initial size (~10km) to (~4km) which, for something of a few solar masses is the Schwarzschild radius. At this point and not before, the surface escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.</p>
<p>With no pressure capable of resisting the ever increasing gravity we assume the collapse continues till all the mass is in a single point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The reason you find it hard to breathe when there is wind blowing at your face is because you are experiencing a sensation that you very rarely feel. Its not that it is necessarily harder, it just requires more thought. You have to regulate the amount of air that comes in, rather than just blindly breathing in and out as you normally do. The air blowing at your face is goes in a lot easier when you breathe in, so your breathing muscle have more control and behave in a way that they never really do. The feeling that you get when wind is blowing in your face and you start to breathe is very short lived and goes away once your body becomes accustom to it.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU4SDDNXuUA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU4SDDNXuUA</a>  This video shows that we have absolutely no problem breathing when high speed wind is blowing into our face, pressure differentiation do not have much affect at all. You would be ripped apart by the wind much sooner than you would not be able to breathe.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Our lungs inhale by creating a lower air pressure inside your lungs than the atmospheric pressure (15psi).   So when the wind blows, and hard enough, the pressure drops cause your breathing to be difficult.    Think like the movies where a hole in a space ship sucks everything out into space, same theory, space psi lower than psi in the ship, except, you wouldn't be sucked through a small crack, unless the difference in pressure is somthing like 100s to 1000s  psi, or lbs of pressure.</p>
<p>That's why low pressure storms tend to have high winds, air swirling from places of high pressure to low pressure.    There is a video of a crab walking on the ocean floor, super high pressure, along a pipe that has a crack in it, the pipe is pressurized to low pressure, the crab sucked through, because the ocean floor has massive pressure and the pipe was likely at atmospheric pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Other users can handle the geology question, but for this I'd like to point out that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7uLfRM1.png" target="_blank">Dinosaurs only showed up fairly recently on the time frame of the history of the entire Earth,</a> and we have discovered countless animals that predate them by millions of years. We are constantly making new discoveries about early life on Earth, including this very year, discoveries showing that life began <em>billions</em> of years ago. However, the fossils from billions of years ago are all basically just microscopic remnants of little microscopic single-celled organisms. Still plenty of complex animal life before dinosaurs though, lots of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O4psa9D.jpg" target="_blank">weird sharks</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YratuD9.jpg" target="_blank">giant bugs</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HIFr9H3.jpg" target="_blank">monster fish</a> and things. Always more to discover.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets start by  having a look at the ages of material we <em>actually have</em> observed.</p>
<p>The first blunt observation we have is that the age range of geological materials is much narrower for oceanic rocks than it is for continental rocks. The oldest oceanic crust is about 340 Ma old, in the eastern Med basin; most oceanic crust is quite a bit younger. This makes sense because we observe that oceanic crust is preferentially destroyed by subduction (look up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics" target="_blank">primer on plate tectonics</a> for an overview).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvvuagittuq_Greenstone_Belt" target="_blank">The oldest continental crust we've found so far is 3.8 Ga old, in the eastern part of the Canadian Shield</a> - that's ... pretty old. But the age of that oldest rock is complex and layered. The 3.8 Ga age is an U-Pb age of crystallisation, the age at which the magma solidified into a rock (it was a volcanic rock). But the very same sample was dated using another method (Nd/Sm geochronology). This yielded an age of 4.38 Ga - the meaning of this second age is different from, and complementary to, the first one. What this Sm/Nd age indicates is the time at which the volume of magma which ended up in that rock was extracted from the Earths mantle.</p>
<p>That 4.38 Ga age is extremely interesting, because we have also been estimating the age of the earth by dating meteorites, which we believe to be leftover material from the building of the Solar System. And the age of formation of most meteorites (4.5 Ga) is getting pretty close to that of the oldest dated event on Earth (4.38 Ga). Those specific rocks, located in the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt, were found about ten years ago; we might find older material still in the years to come. But we  expect the age of older materials to be somewhere within that range of 4.38 to 4.5 Ga.</p>
<p>So ... back to your initial question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have been measuring the age of earth by looking at the layers of ground, how do we know there aren't any older evidence underneath the thick snow of North pole?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, we don't. And that's why people like me and my colleagues keep studying northern rocks. Although it is worth pointing out <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/44/e9/e7/44e9e7aa779630d052f615ec48f69a47.jpg" target="_blank">the North Pole is in the Arctic ocean</a>, and not above a continent. But the rocks of the Arctic seafloor are under study, as are the rocks of the surrounding landmasses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or the deepest ocean floor that human has yet to discover?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentionned earlier, oceanic rocks tend to be destroyed much faster than continental ones. They are still being studied of course, and any abnormally old rocks in the oceanic crust which might be found will certainly be the object of intense scrutiny.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or even unknown creatures that lived before the dinosaurs..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're in luck there. The dinosaurs lived from about 230 Ma ago to 65 Ma ago, but the fossils of complex life forms are quite abundant and diversified in the preceeding time period starting around 541 Ma ago. During this earlier period in the history of life, critters started off in the oceans and eventually colonized the land. New species and genera are identified and described every year by paleontologists. You may want to have a look at the following references, and look up trilobites, anomalocarids, crinoids, orthocone cephalopods, graptolites and brachiopods, for starters:</p>

<p>Key misconception here, we estimate the age of the earth by dating other rocks we find from the early solar system (meteorites). What we've learned about stellar formation, some very esoteric math, and a number of very complicated computer simulations have narrowed down the potential age of the earth by ruling out many many hypothesized ages. We look at layers of the earth's crust to estimate how old the crust is, which is a different question almost entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Now, what would happen if one of the legs is cut off? The upper part of that side of the body would fall down due to gravity right?  This force was initially supported by that leg which was cut off. The torque due to this force is what causes the imbalance. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit! Table salt is amazing! It does two incredibly important things in cooking: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It breaks down and releases sodium when it dissolves in your mouth. The sodium bonds to one of the major flavour receptors in your mouth (i.e. salty flavour). This has a synergistic effect on other foods; particularly savoury flavours (see point 2). </p>
</li>
<li>It draws moisture out of foods, speeding up the caramelisation of sugars/carbohydrates in food. In food chemistry terms, these are called Malliard reactions. In ELI5 terms, it helps foods (particularly meats) brown and give that delicious seared flavour. These seared flavours activate other flavour receptors (particularly umami/savoury receptors, and sweetness receptors). It's like a sensory gang-bang in your mouth. </li>
</ol>
<p>Pepper contains glutamic acid (an umami/savoury flavour) and activates heat sensors in your mouth. It's like a bit of nitro for your taste buds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Not a lot, mind you, but it does the same thing for a dish that salt does and accentuates the savory flavors of whatever you're cooking without all of the sodium. I wouldn't use it as a replacement of salt, but when salt just isn't doing everything you want it to do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's probably a good combination of 20 reasons why these two seasonings are often used. They all come down to versatility, shelf-life and taste.</p>
<p>They are so easy to use that even amateurs can add these spices to a dish without making a mistake. When you're cooking on the stove top or oven, it's usually meats, cheeses, breads, vegetables, which salt and pepper go well with. Most other spices require some balancing to make sure they're not conflicting with something else. You can't put cumin or cinnamon on anything and come out with a well-balanced meal.</p>
<p>Salt has been historically used to preserve foods, most importantly meats. Without refrigeration meat is only good for a day--without seriously risking bacterial and parasitic infection. Even with refrigeration they don't last longer than a week or two. Through drying, curing, smoking meats, they will last months longer, perhaps even years. All of these processes work better with salt. If you live in an older society that doesn't understand &quot;germs&quot; but you can preserve meats and vegetables much longer, you'll see why it's always been extremely important and sought after. It also never spoils, if preserved correctly.</p>
<p>Pepper also has a long shelf-life. Granted, freshly cracked pepper is a thousand times better, whole peppercorns are still good for 4 years. When they've been cracked, they will slowly lose that flavor, but they still retain a lot of flavor compared to dried herbs. Some dried herbs don't have a lot of flavor even when done correctly (parsley, cilantro) and others will lose their flavor in about a year.</p>
<p>They also go together in most styles of cooking. It might not be traditional to use them in any cuisine, but they work well in almost any country's savory, cooked foods. Most spice blends will have salt and a lot also contain pepper.</p>
<p>I think these reasons kind of sum up why they get added to just about every recipe. And once it's become popular to do so, more recipe writers just end up throwing it on there without thinking twice. They almost always enhance cooked, savory food with very few downsides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that it is 1920 (so, no GPS other satellites). You have just found a island in the Pacific and want to know where it goes on the map. There are two things you would need to figure out to do that: how far north or south is the island, and how far east or west it is. One way to do this is by sighting the stars.</p>
<p>The stars look like they are fixed to a sort of celestial sphere that rotates around the Earth, with its axis of rotation going through our north and south poles. By looking at the north-south positions of the stars, you can figure out how tilted the celestial sphere appears to be from your position, which tells you how far north you are. For instance, if you see the North Star, you can almost directly read your north-south position. If it's overhead, you're close to the North Pole, and if it's on the horizon, your near the equator.</p>
<p>Determining your latitude (east-west) [EDIT: sorry, that should be longitude] position is much more tricky, and there is a long history concerning it, but it basically boils down to clocks. As the celestial sphere spins in sky, the stars will appear to be in different positions east or west depending on how far east or west you are. If you have an accurate clock and a star chart, you can determine where the stars would be at that time if you were at a reference point on the Earth (for instance Greenwich, England). Looking at where the stars actually are in your sky at that time, you can determine how far east or west you are.</p>
<p>A book that's well worth a read on this subject is <em>Longitude</em>. It discussed the problems and history of determining your position while navigating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It must be said that drawing on a map (flat) what the Earth (round) looks like remains a very complicated task.</p>

Since at least the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_Triangulation_of_Great_Britain" target="_blank">18th century</a>, we've been able to create extremely detailed maps via trigonometric surveys.  It's similar to the surveyors you'll sometimes see around roads and land development.  </p>
<p>Basically, one person stands in a known location and another person stands in the location you want to measure.  Then you can measure the distance and angles between the two locations and use trigonometry to plot the new location accurately on a map.  Then you go to the location you just measured and measure a new location.  You keep doing that until you've measured an entire country or continent.</p>
<p>Placing those maps onto a globe is just a matter of knowing the latitude and longitude of one of those locations we measured.  Someone else posted about how we were able to measure Latitude and Longitude, but we've been able to do if fairly accurately at least since the middle of the 19th century.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
