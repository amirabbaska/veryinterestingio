		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key contribution of water in plate tectonics may seem to come from left field and be somewhat counter-intuitive, but it resides in the effect of water on the temperature at which partial melting of the mantle occurs. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GC003942/full" target="_blank">For instance, the addition of about 15 wt% water to garnet peridotites will lower partial melting temperature requirements by 350Â°C</a>. In anhydrous settings, partial melting is much harder to achieve and the plate tectonic conveyor belt &quot;seizes up&quot;, as rifting fails to give way to oceanic crust formation for lack of sufficient melt. the same problem occurs at the other end of the conveyor belt, as anhydrous lithospheric material will also require temperature a few hundred degrees higher to succefully initiate anatexis. Furthermore, the temperature increase for partial meltin of anhydrous rocks intensifies at higher pressures. (<a href="https://journals.lib.unb.ca/journalimages/GEOCAN/2006/Vol_33/No_04/geocan33_4ser01_fig8.jpg" target="_blank">See also</a>) And just to be clear, it is not sufficient for the water to occur on the surface, the mantle has to be pervasively hydrated for the presence of water to matter.</p>
<p>The case of Mars interesting, as <a href="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/37/12/1087.full" target="_blank">the martian mantle is understood to be water-poor, but chlorine-rich</a>. So, even if there was water in Martian oceans, there does not appear to have been an efficient conveyor belt reintroducing that water back to the Martian mantle. And the Martian Lithosphere is much thicker that Earths, so the corresponding anhydrous melting temperatures are rather daunting. Yet, there was incipient rifting on Mars [see Valles Marineris], it just failed to open and produce oceanic crust. There is no evidance of incipient subduction to my understanding either. There was intense hotspot volcanism as witnessed by those spectacular shield volcanoes, however, so at least some degree of partial melting occured; just not enough at sustained rates enough to open up...</p>
<p>That being said, I can't imagine how a global planetary ocean would interfere with an active plate system. Just gotta remember that over the course of geological time, plate tectonics tends to favor the progressive formation of continental crust which is much thicker and persistent, so just cause you start with a 100% oceanic crust and no emerging land in your system does not imply it will remain that way over geological time periods. In our Earths history, continental crust seems to have been much rarer and in smaller pieces in the Archean than today. </p>
<p>TLDR:</p>
<p>1 - No water - no significant plate tectonic activity</p>
<p>2 - water sequestered at the surface without a way into the dry mantle: no significant plate tectonic activity</p>
<p>3 - water at the surface in small or huge quantities and a wet mantle: plate tectonics all the way</p>
<p>4 - No water at the surface, but a pervasively wet mantle: plate tectonics galore as long as the mantle remains wet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of Mars there's no direct causation between the lack of oceans and the lack of tectonic activity. Rather they're both due to an underlying cause: Mars is no longer geologically active. Obviously this has caused Mars to cease tectonic activity; it is also the reason that Mars has no water, because no geological activity means no magnetosphere to prevent the atmosphere being blown away by solar wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I talk about this extensively in my book, Our Cosmic Story:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Cosmic-Story-Exploring-Civilization-ebook/dp/B01N6O2OBC/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Our-Cosmic-Story-Exploring-Civilization-ebook/dp/B01N6O2OBC/</a></p>
<p>From what we know of Earth, it is a resounding YES, but on other worlds it depends on how large the planet is, as hat is a key indicator of how active and hot its interior (viscosity). There appears to be a fine balance between not enough and too much interior activity. </p>
<p>Mars lost its atmosphere, water, and plate tectonics (likely in that order) because the planet is simply too small to support an active interior (and thus a magnetic field that protects the water and atmosphere from erosion), and probably had too thick of a crust as well. Venus is simply too close to the sun and succumbed to a greenhouse effect on a massive scale, losing its water through atmosphere escape. It still has an atmosphere due to it being larger than Mars and able to hold on to those gases via other methods (and an erosion process that overloaded its atmosphere with carbon dioxide).</p>
<p>Back to Earth, it has plate tectonics because of water helping to lubricate the plates and keep them moving along mainly the subduction zones. At times in Earth's history these plates were not moving (what's called a stagnant lid scenario). If there was no water on the Earth, it's quite reasonable to presume that plate tectonics would have long shut down, and our world would be a slightly cooler Venus. This will still be the case a couple of billion years from now as the Sun continues to heat up.</p>
<p>Worlds that are on the larger super-Earth size of 1.6 radius or more may not have plate tectonics either because their interiors are too active to allow the just-right anchoring of the plates and yet allow them to slide at regular intervals. This is still quite uncertain though, as these worlds may have super thin crusts, which may be enough to offset the interiors activity... though it may prove a problem with too much outgassing.</p>
<p>There is a window of where even more habitable worlds than Earth might reside with just-right plate tectonics that never form a stagnant lid scenario, or rarely, and without needing water for lubrication. These are worlds roughly 1.1 to 1.5 radius of the Earth. A thinner (but not too thin) crust is likely on these worlds as well, which helps to prevent a stagnant lid scenario. </p>
<p>The depth of the water will not have much, if any, effect on the plate tectonics being active or stagnant. Once there is water sufficient to cover the active subduction zones of the plates, driving water downward into the mantle to help lubricant the process, that is all that is required. 100 meters or 10,000 meters of water will do the same job here.</p>
<p>Water is essential to life at all stages of development, and at least as far as simulations are concerned, it seems to be nearly that case for the planet itself to maintain active geology of the type life would fine necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This effect only happens in matches that contain trace amounts of metal such as iron. For example, some match heads will contain some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III\)_oxide" target="_blank">iron (III) oxide</a>, i.e. the stuff in rust. This scattered iron oxide will have rather weak magnetic properties. However, when you burn the match, carbon present in the match can reduce the iron oxide to metallic iron:</p>
<p>Fe2O3 + 3C -&gt; 2Fe + 3CO</p>
<p>The metallic iron you get is ferromagnetic. As a result, the entire match will be much more strongly attracted to a magnet after burning.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Something I am actually qualified to answer! I actually started a <a href="https://blog.birchfinance.com/newbies-beat-the-banks/" target="_blank">beginner's guide/series to reward programs</a> on my blog and <a href="https://birchfinance.com" target="_blank">my startup built an app</a> that helps you optimize your credit card rewards and find the best cards for your spending.</p>
<p>There are two main parts that make up credit card reward programs:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Earning rewards  </li>
<li>Redeeming rewards  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types of reward currencies you can earn  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cash back  </li>
<li>Points  </li>
<li>Miles  </li>
</ul>
<p>(points and miles are virtually the same and vary depending on what that specific reward program wants to call them. A lot of Airlines will use miles because you're &quot;flying a certain number of miles when you travel&quot; and others use points because they tend to be more generic - hotels, specific bank branded credit cards etc.)<br />
Let's break down each type of program:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cash Back</strong>  </p>
<p>Cash back is pretty simple - you earn a fixed cash percentage back on your credit card purchases based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_category_code" target="_blank">mcc code</a> multiplier or a specific merchant (like Target or Banana Republic). For example, the <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-preferred/" target="_blank">Amex Blue Cash Preferred</a> earns 6% cash back on groceries, 3% cash back on U.S. gas stations and department stores, and 1% cash back on everything else. You can read the Blue Cash Preferred <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/personal-card-application/terms/blue-cash-preferred-credit-card/36501-10-0/?pznOfferCode=PIWG-3PBEQC-25WM-9O4&amp;print#offerBenefitTermsDisclosures" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/rewards-info.html" target="_blank">Reward Terms</a> to see which MCC codes are included/excluded and also learn about every other limitation/quirk this card has.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The complicated part</em><br />
The biggest complication with cash back cards are the limits/caps the issuers put on how much you can earn each year. With the Amex BCP, you only earn 6% on groceries on the first $6000 in grocery spend each year, then 1%. Some cards offer <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar.html" target="_blank">rotating categories</a>, like the Chase Freedom and Discover It cards.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Points &amp; Miles</strong>  </p>
<p>I'm bucketing points and miles together because although they have different names, they are effectively the same thing - a virtual rewards currency. Any non cash back reward program will be either points or miles. These include airline, hotel, car rental, supermarket, gas station co branded cards and more, as well as bank specific non cash back cards like the Chase Sapphire Cards where you earn Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou cards where you earn ThankYou Points.  </p>
<p>Instead of earning a cash back % for each $ spent, you instead earn a points/miles multiplier on specific categories and merchants  - The <a href="https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-preferred" target="_blank">Chase Sapphire Card</a> (CSP for short) earns 2x points on travel and dining and 1x for everything else. Of course, there are exclusions in the terms and conditions.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The complicated part</em><br />
Redeeming points &amp; miles is extremely variable, and the $ value for what the rewards are worth changes depending on a whole lotta factors. For example, if I redeem Ultimate Rewards from my CSP card for Travel I &quot;get 25% more value when you redeem for airfare, hotels, car rentals and cruises through Chase Ultimate Rewards. For example, 50,000 points are worth $625 toward travel.&quot; &lt;- Directly from Chase's site. That means if I redeem my points for non travel, they're worth less. The Points Guy does <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/category/points-valuations/" target="_blank">monthly reward valuations</a>, but IMO they're a bit too simplistic and I'm not sure he uses a big enough data set to make super accurate calculations.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, in this case above, if I can redeem 50,000 points for $625, that means each point is worth $.0125 each. Meaning that if I earn 2x on travel and dining and redeem for travel, I effectively am getting <strong>2.5% back</strong> per $ spent.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take it one step further, I'll use United's MileagePlus program. (In light of current events I still enjoy flying United, personally have their CC, and fly 3-4 flights for free each year). The miles on United's program vary depending on the airports you fly to/from, the time of day you fly, how far in advance you book, seat class, etc. This holds true on many other airlines as well. And even though United is a <a href="https://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx" target="_blank">tier structure</a> - if you select North America as your departure and arrival location it will show you the 10k, 12.5k, 25k chart - the flight values vary, so the more expensive flight I can get for 12.5k miles on way, the more my rewards are worth. Most recently I flew Orlando -&gt; San Francisco and redeemed my miles for around 2.9cents each, so on each purchases where I earned 1x mile I got 2.9% back effectively, and any purchases with multipliers I got 5.8% back, effectively.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get even more complex, I can <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/chase-ultimate-rewards-transfer-partners" target="_blank">transfer my Chase Ultimate Reward Points</a> as a 1:1 ratio to United. So purchases made on my CSP card at travel and dining and redeemed for the reward example above would net me 5.8% back.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take this system of changing reward rates above and apply it to hotels and other redemption types and it gets tricky. This is why a lot of people choose cash back cards with a flat 2% cash back, like the <a href="https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card" target="_blank">Citi Double Cash</a>, but many of us enjoy racking up points and miles and getting higher value when redeeming for travel (usually the highest).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a complete list, and there are so many more things to consider like annual fees, foreign transaction fees if you travel abroad, cards that offer airport lounge access, anniversary bonuses, spending bonuses, other caps and exclusions, sign up bonuses and more. And if you travel, you earn rewards just by flying the airlines and staying in hotels, so you can rack up points beyond just what the credit cards offer.<br />
&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So who pays for rewards?</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Interchange Fees: The credit card issuer takes a cut of your purchase when you pay at a retailer. The rate on this varies but is usually higher then the redeemed value % on that purchase (plus a lot of rewards just sit around and are never redeemed)  </li>
<li>Credit card debt: The interest that revolving card holders pay will fund reward programs much of the time. That's about half the US population.  </li>
<li>Annual fees: The annual fee you pay on the cards will sometimes offset the reward value earned  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tl;dr: You earn rewards a variety of different ways and redeem for different reward types where values change. Cash back is just a % back on your spending. All have exclusions and limitations to look out for. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten several excellent answers to &quot;how&quot; rewards work, but there are also interesting reasons &quot;why&quot; they've grown in popularity.</p>
<p>About 10-15 years ago, when airline &quot;miles&quot; were still the dominant credit card reward, the IRS decided that these rewards from credit cards would not be treated as income and, thus, would not be taxable.  This is different from traditional interest on a savings account, for example, which is still taxed as income.</p>
<p>The rationale is that credit card rewards are earned only when you purchase something, and so they operate like rebates or even simple price reductions.  In other words, if you used a coupon at the grocery store for 2% off your entire purchase, you wouldn't have to pay income tax on the 2% that you saved; and if you went to the grocery store, and a week later they sent you a rebate check for 2% of your purchase, same thing; and if you went to the grocery store, and paid with your credit card, and later you got 2% back on your credit card statement ... well, same thing, says the IRS.</p>
<p>Now, add this to the fact that interest rates on savings have been at rock bottom for nearly 10 years now.  Banks couldn't attract new customers with higher savings rates because, frankly, the economy just wouldn't support paying out interest.  So instead, the IRS revenue ruling has created something of an arms race as banks use bigger/better credit card reward programs to attract customers.</p>
<p>Finally, it's not just the banks.  Many popular cards are co-branded with specific companies (the Southwest cards offered by Chase are a popular example), and those companies not only get a cut, but they use enhanced points and perks to drive up their own business.  Southwest recently reported in an earnings call that their credit card revenue is the fastest growing source of revenue in their company!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Credit card companies make money in 2 main ways;</p>
<p>1) If you do not pay of the balance at the end of every payment period (usually a month, but there might be cards with other terms), they can charge interest. Usually this is a rather high rate.</p>
<p>2) Companies that want to accept payments from credit cards must pay the credit card companies for this. For this reason credit card companies give you gifts for using their cards. If you want those rewards, you'll use your credit card more often, which means companies must pay your credit card company more.</p>
<p>A little more color on #2.
Retailers that take credit cards from your mom and pop shop all the way to Walmart pay about 2.9% per transaction. This is what is used to subsidize your rewards program. The retailers pass this fee onto you via higher cost of goods.
On average, rewards program values are around 1% of your transaction.</p>
<p>Lots of retailers are starting to push back on this since they are the ones subsidizing the rewards program of these credit cards. In addition, for low margin businesses like grocery, their typical profit margin is between 3-5%. If they didn't have to pay the cc transaction fees, they could double their profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>How Reward Systems Work.</strong> Reward cards offer a variety of rewards in different ways. Some give cash back on all purchases, some give bonuses if you meet a spending threshold (such as 50,000 airline miles for $3,000 spent in the first 3 months), and some give other perks.</p>
<p><strong>Why Some People Get More/Better Rewards.</strong> Some people get more points or rewards because they qualify for rewards that other people don't. Just like qualifying for a loan, card companies offer different cards (with different rewards) to people based on their credit worthiness. A reliable consumer qualifies for better reward cards with better perks just like a reliable borrower qualifies for better loan terms. </p>
<p>Also, the amount of rewards you get is based on the amount you spend on the card. So if you have a card that offers 1 mile per dollar spent, but you only spend $500, you only get 500 miles. If I spend $15,0000, I get 15,000 miles.</p>
<p>(Source. I've used credit card rewards to pay for about 80-90% of my vacation expenses for years, and regularly cycle through cards to farm rewards. The only reason card companies offer these cards is because: <strong>1.</strong> People qualify for the card but don't end up meeting the minimum spend, <strong>2.</strong> People let the points expire, and most importantly <strong>3.</strong> People incur enough fees that the amount they pay in interest or fees exceeds the value of the offered rewards. (And because card companies make a little money on each transaction.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is we are not sure and there are many theories</p>
<p>Goose bumps start in the part of the body called the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system sends signals from your brain to your skin. Goose bumps usually happen when you get cold or feel certain powerful emotions, such as fear.</p>
<p>When you feel certain powerful emotions, a part of your brain called the hypothalamus sends a message via your nerves to the muscles in your skin to tighten up. When the skin on your body gets tight, your hairs stand on end and goose bumps form.</p>
<p><strong>You're probably still wondering exactly how goose bumps are related to music.</strong> As you may have experienced before, goose bumps can occur when you hear a love song, a classic song, or a passionate version of the Star Spangled Banner.</p>
<p>A theory about why people get goose bumps from music is that  People can feel intense emotions, like sadness and passion. When people feel strong emotions, their brains release the same chemicals that tell the skin to form goose bumps.</p>
<p><em>More details for nerd 5 year old -</em> </p>
<p>About 50 percent of people get chills when listening to music. <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/abs/nn.2726.html" target="_blank">Research shows</a> thatâs because music stimulates an ancient reward pathway in the brain, encouraging dopamine to flood the striatumâa part of the forebrain activated by addiction, reward, and motivation. Music, it seems, may affect our brains the same way that sex, gambling, and potato chips do.</p>
<p>Strangely, those dopamine levels can peak several seconds before the songâs special moment. Thatâs because your brain is a good listenerâitâs constantly predicting whatâs going to happen next. (Evolutionarily speaking, itâs a handy habit to have. Making good predictions is essential for survival.)</p>
<p>But music is tricky. It can be unpredictable, teasing our brains and keeping those dopamine triggers guessing. And thatâs where the chills may come in. Because when you finally hear that long awaited chord, the striatum sighs with dopamine-soaked satisfaction andâBAMâyou get the chills. The greater the build-up, the greater the chill.</p>
<p>You can feel chills from any genre, whether itâs Mozart, Madonna, tango, or techno. Itâs the structureânot the styleâthat counts. Goosebumps most often occur when something unexpected happens: A new instrument enters, the form shifts, the volume suddenly dims. Itâs all about the element of surprise.</p>
<p><strong>But there are competing theories.</strong> Neuroscientist <a href="http://www.sensoryresearch.net/misc/EmotionalSourcesOfChillsInducedByMusic.pdf" target="_blank">Jaak Panksepp</a>, for example, discovered that sad music triggers chills more often than happy music. He argues that a melancholy tune activates an ancient, chill-inducing mechanismâa distress response our ancestors felt when separated from family. When a ballad makes us feel nostalgic or wistful, that evolutionary design kicks into gear.</p>

It just knows your more advanced cerebral brain is getting exited based on physiological connections you've made to a soothing singing voice, or a certain song that triggers an emotion in you psychologically. This in turn causes the release of serotonin, Oxycontin, adrenaline, and dopamine, that triggers an ancient survival function that served duel purposes of warmth and visual deterrent ( like making ones self bigger to scare the woolly mammoth)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sumit316 covered the main points. The reason powerful emotions lead to horripilation (goosebumps) is yet unknown. Most behaviors we know play a role in our fitness to some degree, but why then do we cry when we are sad or even joyful? Why do we experience horripilation when we hear good music? We as humans have yet to understand why we experience certain sensations under paradoxical conditions or due to seemingly unrelated causes, but given the interconnected complexity of our peripheral and central nervous systems, the majority of theories explaining these phenomena can be found there. </p>
<p>Our brain is a processing and storage unit that is connected to the outside world via our body and that can influence our body's interaction with the outside world via the peripheral nervous system. Due to their intensely connected nature (for example damage to area of the brain can cause all sorts of sensation or motion impairment, from blindness to paralysis to involuntary movements like in Tourett's syndrome), it is not surprising to find these mechanisms in our nervous systems that we have established are part of certain behaviors, but are also seen at work in unexpected ways. Maybe one day we can understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It is also suspected that rocky cores roughly the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063399000434" target="_blank">size of Earth, but much more massive than it</a> reside at the centre of Jupiter and Saturn, with the one in Saturn probably a little smaller. </p>
<p>However, there is no clear &quot;surface&quot; like what we are used to seeing on telluric/icy planets. The outer atmosphere consists of methane, ammonia, water ice and various other light gaseous clouds. Then about 100 km down from the cloud tops, it's mostly hydrogen. This hydrogen simply gets increasingly denser, until it becomes liquid several thousand kilometres down from the cloud tops. About a third to halfway to the centre of the planets, the pressure approaches 10^(11) to 10^12 Pa,  where the hydrogen becomes liquid metallic hydrogen. See <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galleries/gas-giant-interiors" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The metallic hydrogen behaves like a liquid metal. Because of the immense rotational velocities of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as their internal heat, this liquid metal behaves like a dynamo and generates very strong magnetic fields. </p>
<p>Furthermore, metallic hydrogen may have some intriguing properties, like being a room temperature superconductor (refer to the first link on metallic hydrogen).     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Think of it more like transitioning from a gas to a solid, over a gradient rather than there being a surface. There is a rocky core, but it's surrounded by hydrogen. So much hydrogen that the densities are so great that as one goes deeper, it becomes liquid, then solid.</p>
<p>So there is a rocky core, with a surface, of sorts. But that's meaningless because to reach it you'd have to penetrate increasingly dense, then solid, layers of hydrogen.

The floor will fully support your body, but will not conform to your body shape. A mattress that is too soft will not support your body well, but will contour to your body well. Ideally, you will want a mattress that can still conform to your body but with sufficient support. This will ensure you can maintain the proper spinal support while sleeping without having too much or too little support. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You need something firm enough to hold you up and prevent you from &quot;hamocking&quot; into it, but soft enough to follow your natural form and relieve pressure. Semi firm is usually the best compromise, but a side sleeper should have something a bit softer to reduce the pressure on the shoulder and hips. </p>
<p>Sleeping on the floor is a terrible idea. Only way to make this work is to sleep flat on your back with your legs raised under some

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've tried sleeping on the floor and on a low platform bed without a mattress just using a blanket or two underneath me. What I've found out is that I don't mind a hard surface because my body adjusts to it in a matter of days and from there on out, I'm comfortable while sleeping, even more so than on most of the beds I've tried over the years, but it can get cold. What's worse, you might not notice if you're cold straight away, you might just sleep through the night, which could have an effect on your health long-term. All in all, I'm definitely in favor of a hard sleeping surface, but just make sure you're warm enough.</p>
<p>You could try out a relatively cheap closed-foam camping mattress that has decent insulation (for example, a therm-a-rest ridge rest that has an R-value of around 3) and maybe even use it with a thinner sleeping bag (2-season). If you have a friend with a camping setup, ask to borrow it and try it out on your floor so that you don't have to spend any money before seeing if it works for you, and if it does, you can also go outdoors with it. You could also try sleeping without a pillow, which I found to be quite nice indoors and while camping. Finally, if you feel like you want to get up off the floor because of bugs or whatever, you can always add a simple DIY platform bed which shouldn't be too expensive to make. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically because Cops have to work long hours, such as nightshifts, and need to be able to respond at a moment's notice. As such there's not a lot of options for a quick bite to eat in the middle of the night. They also provide a place to sit down and take a quick break (or fill out paperwork in a place that's not the front seat of your patrol car) and you can take the doughnuts with you.</p>
<p>Funny story, when I was super young we went on a field trip to the local police station. As we were walking along the mezzanine above the staff break room I saw a box of doughnuts and a coffee machine on the table. Without thinking a blurted out &quot;IT'S TRUE! THEY DO LIKE DOUGHNUTS!&quot; causing the whole building to erupt in laughter and my mom (who was the chaperone) to go completely red.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Meanwhile doughnut shops were open so they became a frequent stop for cops to get some food and a cup of Joe. Since more places are open at later hours now they have more options but the association with doughnuts stuck.</p>
<p>Also doughnuts are quick so they could grab something and get back to work relatively quickly compared to late diners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest Explaintion I coud find - </p>
<p>All plants can sense the direction of the gravitational field and orientate themselves accordingly. This is called geotaxis. In mature plants, phototaxis (growing towards the light source) overrides the gravitational impulse for the stalk and leaves, but the roots - and the seed while it is underground - rely on gravity for orientation. </p>
<p>The mechanism is thought to be based on either the protoplasm (the living substance inside a cell) exerting a greater pressure on the cell walls at the bottom, or starch grains within the cells settling at the bottom. One or both of these cues influence the production of plant growth hormones that cause the plant to 'steer' as it grows.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/how-do-seeds-know-which-way-grow" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p><em>Details for nerd 5 years old</em></p>
<p>A bunch of other commenters have mentioned that plants can sense gravity, but nobody's explained how! The answer is that they have starchy components (amyloplasts) in some of their cells that are heavier than the cytoplasm, making them sediment at the bottom of the cell. A hormonal growth signal then emanates in the direction of the part of the cell where the amyloplasts accumulate (i.e. down).</p>
<p>You can see this for yourself by tipping over a fast-growing potted plant. The side of the stem facing down will grow faster, causing the shoot to gradually bend upright again. Plants use the same mechanism - uneven distribution of growth hormones in response to sensory input - when they grow toward light, etc.</p>

<p>In the most simple of terms, plants have cells called stratocytes in the tips of roots that respond to gravity. They give a signal that releases a plant hormone that directs the growth of new cells.</p>
<p>In the shoots and stems, a similar process occurs which directs growth upward. Mature plants don't really have this ability anymore and thus use the angle of the light to &quot;decide&quot; where to grow. This is called phototropism.</p>
<p>A seed in utter darkness will know to grow roots downward, but a plant in utter darkness will not know which way to grow upward because there is no light for it to chase after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of these are right with some and wrong with others. A plant that is healthy knows which way is up and down regardless of whether there is light or not. There are hormones that promote plant growth, IAA, that respond to light as well as other sensory responses. In roots, there are starches that settle to the &quot;bottom&quot; of the cells that tell the cell which way to grow (elongate) and divide. This is how the plant knows up and down. As for when light is absent, the sensory system previously mentioned still works, it's just that the addition of light makes the plant produce IAA on the other side of the plant so those cells divide, turning the plant away from the production of hormones and toward the light.</p>
<p>I used to work in a lab and we grew our samples in complete darkness and they always grew against gravity (the shoot) there have been studies that show that indole acetic acid makes the shoot grow away from application. The top of the plant was cut off and then on half of the now exposed vascular system was treated with IAA and the plant bent away from the side it was applied to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>âThe root just went straight down and the shoot went straight up. ... How did it know? It turns out that inside the seed there are specialized cells called statocytes that are mini plant snow-globes. Inside each one there are specialized starch grains that are more dense than the rest of the cell, and they settle toward the bottom of the cells [due to gravity.] Protein networks can sense where they are, and so the seed, and later the plant, knows which way is up. Next time you plant a seed, turn it over and think about the mini snow-globe inside, and then plant it whichever way up you like, because the plant can solve the puzzle.â</p>

<p>Geotropism occurs mostly in the root, and it is thought that the settling of starch granules at the bottom of cells causes elongation in that direction (towards gravity, i.e. downwards)</p>
<p>Phototropism occurs mostly in the shoot, where a chemical called auxin is released on the side opposite the light, causing cells on that side to elongate, and the plant grows towards the light</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).</p>
<p>Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.</p>
<p>Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.</p>
<p>So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.</p>
<p>Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.</p>
<p>So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?</p>
<p>Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.</p>
<p>The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.</p>
<p>Does that kinda summ it up?</p></div></div>

That's the Curie Temperature, where the heat jiggles the magnetism about harder than the exchange, anisotropy, and demagnetizing fields can keep it in place. That doesn't mean it's non-magnetic, it can still be paramagnetic.</p>
<p>As for the earth's core, the other posters here are spot on. The core is spinning, and that spinning means charges are being spun, which looks just like an electromagnet. And although the magnetic field does need to travel through the rest of the earth, and other magnetic materials on its way to the surface, the field it produces it <em>huge</em>. Much weaker than if the core was a uniformly magnetised permanent magnet, but it is still an enormous electromagnet.</p>
<p>As for the moon, the core isn't hot enough or large enough to convect. So, it doesn't spin. So, it doesn't produce an electromagnetic effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few misconceptions in your post, to begin with. </p>
<p>Firstly, the inner core isn't in the plasma phaseâit's thought to be <em>solid</em>, surrounded by a sphere of <em>iron-rich fluid</em> (probably liquid, to be precise), according to <a href="https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~glatz/geodynamo.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. At the centre of the Earth, the pressure is too high (on the order of 10^10 â 10^11 Pa), and temperature too low (4000 â 5000 K) for iron to become plasma. </p>
<p>Next, nickel is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">most definitely ferromagnetic</a>, i.e. a piece of nickel will stick to a magnet if you put one near the former. </p>
<p>The geodynamo which generates the terrestrial magnetic field arises due to a combination of convective currents, the Coriolis effect from the Earth's rotation, the slowly growing inner core as the inner Earth cools, and the direct heating effect from the inner core (which in turn arises due to energy from gravitational collapse and radioactive decay of unstable isotopes, especially potassium-40). The fluid in the outer core moves in cylindrical rolls due to all this. </p>
<p>The fact that the fluid contains electrons (it is a molten metal alloy, after all), and is already moving in a magnetic field, means that a circular electrical current is induced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Faraday's Law</a>. Moving electrons = moving charge = electric current in the opposite direction of electron movement. The circular electric currents in turn generate their own B-fields, or magnetic field. Electric currents in a circle or in a solenoid generate a dipole magnetic field, which is what the Earth's magnetic field is, for the most part. </p>
<p>An interesting note is that simulations of the Earth's magnetic field even manage to account for the cycle of magnetic pole reversals.</p>
<p>TL;DR: the overall field is powered by the residual kinetic and thermal energy in the Earth's interior. The order of energy conversion makes this simpler to understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thermal energy from the inner core â kinetic energy in convecting fluid outer core. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinetic energy of fluid outer core â (should technically be an equals symbol, because electrical energy is due to kinetic energy anyway) electrical energy of fluid outer core. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electric energy of fluid outer core â magnetic energy of fluid outer core. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinetic energy of fluid outer core <em>in</em> magnetic field generated in <strong>3.</strong> â more electrical energy of fluid outer core. </p>
</li>
<li>Repeat 3. and 4. recursively.  </li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth is an electromagnet, as are all bodies in outer space that have a significant magnetic field. Electromagnets are generally weaker than ferromagnets per unit mass (which is why your plasma arc probably didn't have a strong magnetic field), but the Earth has a huge amount of mass. </p>
<p>The moon has no magnetic field because it has almost no metal inside it.</p>
<p>Since electromagnetism is a force with infinite range, it shouldn't be surprising that swirling in the Earth's core can produce an effect reaching the surface. In any case, the outer liquid core isn't that much smaller than the while Earth (its radius is around 2000 km, 1/3 of the Earth's radius) - so a large-scale current would produce a surface magnetic field only 3^(3)=27 times smaller than the field in the core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
