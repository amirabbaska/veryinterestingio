		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jaysis. Lots of comments on here from people who don't know WTF they are talking about. </p>
<p>MD here. Long and short of it: we <strong>do not</strong> know. Saying something is &quot;good for you&quot; or &quot;bad for you&quot; is very challenging, given the huge variability from person to person. You know those commercials that say &quot;consult with your doctor before trying this exercise program&quot;? That's why. Reddit skews young and healthy, but the people I see are old, overweight, and sick. </p>
<p>There are numerous studies showing that consuming large volumes of caffeinated coffee increases longevity and improves quality of life. Is that because of caffeine? Antioxidants? Social effects? Some confounding variable like a good job or exciting hobby that causes people who would be happier anyway to consume more coffee?</p>
<p>We know that stress leads to increased levels of hormones like epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol. These hormones have wide-ranging effects beyond their immediate effects on the heart. Likewise, we know that exercise has a huge range of effects, from promoting the development of new neurons to promoting lower weight and better cholesterol levels that reduce the risk of atherosclerosis (one of the major forms of disease worldwide). </p>
<p>In a young person like yourself, drinking caffeine in large amounts will drive your heartrate up. Probably not a big deal. But in general, young people get their caffeine from drinks that have tons of sugar or fat (soft drinks or Starbucks-style abominations), so docs tend to make broad statements like &quot;drink less caffeine.&quot; Does that mean we know shit? No. Does that mean it's actually bad for you? Who knows. </p>
<p>Exercise is <em>probably</em> good for you, but if you're a marathoner with a massively hypertrophied heart and a resting heartrate in the 40s, does that make you much healthier than someone who just exercises a moderate amount, doesn't have bad cholesterol, or generally takes care of their health? I don't know. In fact, it may put you at a disadvantage. Given that most of the health problems in the US revolve around obesity and its consequences, though, docs are very likely to recommend exercise. </p>
<p>Could all of this change? It sure could! Could some forms of chemical stress on the heart be good for it? Probably! But in the meantime, I'll tell you the same things I tell everyone: get some exercise and avoid stress. Life just feels better when you do that stuff. </p>
<p>And everyone here who pulls out a study showing one finding or another: I can probably find a study showing the opposite.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you exercise, your body is responding to external stress, and raises its metabolic response appropriately. Not only does your heart rate increase, but your peripheral arteries dilate (allowing blood to flow to your muscles), while your other unconscious processes (such as digestion) are put on hold and receive less blood. (This is why you can get stomach cramps if you exercise too soon after a large, heavy meal, and why coffee can make you need to poop even if you haven't eaten anything in a while.) Additionally, certain chemicals are released and energy is converted from storage to active use and then utilized to exercise.</p>
<p>When your rate is chemically increased, none of these responses occur. Your body may be forced to enter &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode, but the energy being produced isn't <em>going</em> anywhere, and is typically converted to visceral fat (no matter where it came from) if it's not used. It's exactly the same reason a high-stress environment combined with a sedentary lifestyle can result in abdominal obesity.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/661psu/slug/dgeybme" target="_blank">another comment</a> mentioned vasoconstriction, which is the constriction of blood vessels to increase blood pressure. Caffeine is both a diuretic (makes your body excrete more water) and vasoconstrictor (makes your blood vessels narrow). While it is true that a diminished blood volume can offset the effects on blood pressure that vasoconstriction has, the increased heart rate raises BP further. Your heart is pushing harder against a tighter space. This damages the arteries.</p>
<p><strong>Edit^(2):</strong> I'm talking about straight caffeine. I can't recall the dosages off the top of my head, but 1-2 cups of coffee a day aren't really going to push your BP up very high unless you have a caffeine sensitivity (like me). Ten coffees over the course of a day? Yeah, you're probably seeing some shit. <em>Note that everyone's physiology is slightly different</em>, and caffeine resistance is definitely a thing you can develop. If you're concerned, pick up a home BP cuff (most drugstores sell an automatic cuff; it might be a little pricey but if you're worried it can be worth it) or talk to your PCP.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Exercise, by definition, is the use of external physical stimuli to increase performance. Using chemicals (caffeine, atropine, epinephrine, etc.) to induce the exercise response without actually exercising doesn't produce any results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the increased heart rate that's the benefit, it's all the other things that's happening along with it when you're exercising that together creates the net benefit. Going by heart rate is because it's the easiest metric to tell if you're getting a sufficient amount of exercise.</p>
<p>When you're exercising, your body needs to deliver more oxygen (and thus blood) to your muscle tissue. This results in the blood vessels opening up and the heart rate increasing to push that blood along. In general, your blood pressure doesn't increase by much, if at all. Your heart is working faster, but it's not working harder per squeeze.</p>
<p>Things like stress or certain drugs increase your heart rate, but they don't result in a corresponding opening of the blood vessels. In fact, in the case of some drugs, the opposite will occur and your blood vessels will constrict. With your heart pushing faster through blood vessel or same or smaller diameter, this results in an increase in blood pressure. It's that chronic exposure to the increased blood pressure that can cause problems - it stresses the muscles in the heart and the blood vessel linings. And this is all because the heart is having to squeeze harder than before due to this increased pressure.</p>
<p>So in short, exercise good cause heart rate is matched by opening blood vessels. Other sources don't open blood vessels, so your blood pressure rises, which is bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hope its will help I get from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/aug/21/science-little-voice-head-hearing-voices-inner-speech" target="_blank">theguardian.com</a>
Most of us will be familiar with the experience of silently talking to ourselves in our head. Perhaps you’re at the supermarket and realise that you’ve forgotten to pick up something you needed. “Milk!” you might say to yourself. Or maybe you’ve got an important meeting with your boss later in the day, and you’re simulating – silently in your head – how you think the conversation might go, possibly hearing both your own voice and your boss’s voice responding.</p>
<p>This is the phenomenon that psychologists call “inner speech”, and they’ve been trying to study it pretty much since the dawn of psychology as a scientific discipline. In the 1930s, the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky argued that inner speech developed through the internalisation of “external”, out-loud speech. If this is true, does inner speech use the same mechanisms in the brain as when we speak out loud?</p>
<p>We have known for about a century that inner speech is accompanied by tiny muscular movements in the larynx, detectable by a technique known as electromyography. In the 1990s, neuroscientists used functional neuroimaging to demonstrate that areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area), which are active when we speak out loud, are also active during inner speech. Furthermore, disrupting the activity of this region using brain stimulation techniques can interrupt both “outer” and inner speech.</p>
<p>So the evidence that inner speech and speaking out loud share similar brain mechanisms seems pretty convincing. One worry, though, is whether the inner speech we get people to do in experiments is the same as our everyday experience of inner speech. As you might imagine, it’s quite hard to study inner speech in a controlled, scientific manner, because it is an inherently private act.</p>
<p>Typically, studies have required participants to repeat sentences to themselves in their heads, or, sometimes, count the syllables in words presented on a computer screen. These lack both the spontaneity of typical inner experiences and the conversational quality (think of the conversation with your boss) and motivational purposes (“Milk!”) of inner speech. Although the experience is undoubtedly different for everyone (not everyone reports having “conversations” in their head, for example), what does seem clear is that inner speech is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.</p>
<p>Why does it matter whether we have an accurate understanding of what’s going on in our brains when we use inner speech?</p>
<p>One reason is that understanding typical inner experience may be the key to understanding more unusual inner experiences. For example, psychologists have argued that hearing voices (“auditory verbal hallucinations”) might simply be a form of inner speech that has not been recognised as self-produced (although there are also important competing theories). Neuroscientists have found some evidence in favour of this theory. When they scanned the brains of people who reported hearing voices, they discovered that many of the same areas of the brain are active during both auditory hallucinations and inner speech. Broca’s area, for example, is often active in people when they’re hearing voices.</p>
<p>But if we really want to know what the difference between what happens in the brain during inner speech and voice hearing – and how inner speech might become hearing voices – then first we need to understand what our internal talk is usually like. A recent study by researchers in Finland attempted to address flaws in previous brain-imaging studies of inner speech. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they studied the difference between activity in the brain when participants experienced an auditory verbal hallucination, and when they deliberately imagined hearing the same voice. In this way, they controlled for aspects of the experience such as the sound and the content of the voice.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>They found the main difference between the two conditions was the level of activation in a cortical region known as the supplementary motor area (SMA), which contributes to the control of movement. When participants heard voices, there was significantly less activation in the SMA, which fits with previous hypotheses suggesting that recognising actions as one’s own might rely on signals from motor cortical areas reaching sensory areas of the brain.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is to say that understanding what happens in the brain is the only, or the most important, aspect of research into hearing voices. We also need to understand what the experience is like, how we can help people who are distressed by it, and when there’s a need for psychiatric care. But to do any of this, we first need to know what typical inner speech is like, and the underlying neuroscience is part of that understanding.</p>

Language is one of the most important mental tools, as it plays a major role in socialisation as well as cognition. We use it to regulate our thoughts and structure our intellectual activity. When you use the voice in your head to narrate a thought process, it's called private/ internalised speech. This can be observed in young children, who often talk to themselves aloud to help them work out a problem. This is gradually internalised as a child develops, but even as an adult sometimes reading something out loud can help you understand it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The molecules in water are one of a gas (water vapour, not relevant here), liquid (standard room temperature) or solid, and the transition between those last two is an either-or sort of yes-no thing. </p>
<p><strong>Either</strong> a molecule of water is in liquid form and behaves among other similar molecules like a liquid that can easily slide and flow and move around, <strong>or</strong> it's locked into a solid crystal like a needle of ice or a bit of snow.</p>
<p>Other chemical compounds such as many oils behave differently when they experience temperature change, or have a mix of chemicals in them that contribute to such a behaviour change (maple syrup's an example), but water keeps to this simple one-sort-of-state model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water's bulk properties are determined almost entirely by the hydrogen bonding and, due to the simplicity of the molecule, all of the hydrogen bonds have a similar potential.</p>
<p>This results in very abrupt phase transitions because when the average kinetic energy is high enough to break the H-bonds then any particular molecule has the same potential to constantly break and reform them (i.e. be in a liquid state), but once it drops below, suddenly any molecule has the same potential to be H-bonded to an adjacent molecule (i.e., be in a solid state).</p>
<p>If you look at something like various simple alcohols, they also have a hydrocarbon tail, which gives more ways for the molecules to interact with each other.   So when it's cold enough for <em>this</em> particular interaction to be stable, there's still <em>that</em> other one that's going to keep everything moving.   Thus an increase in viscocity.  And then length of the chain matters.  If you have both methanol and isopropanol in a dry ice bath, the iso will be visibly syrupy while the methanol is pretty much the same as room temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is why pouring hot water into a mug sounds subtly different than pouring cold water into a mug.</p>
<p>That said, the difference in viscosity is rather slight compared to substances generally thought of as &quot;syrupy&quot;.  (See other answers for explanation of crystals, and pure vs suspended substances)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else said that it's because &quot;syrupy&quot; liquids are still liquids - they fill their container like a liquid.  There's also there's no temperature point where water goes from liquid to syrupy. it's not like a continum like gas to liquid to solid is. it just depends on the make up.</p>
<p>Just a fun fact - some people can't drink liquid water due to medical reasons such as a poorly working neck muscles so they have classifications of liquids. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thin liquids - Basic water and coffee, juice, milk,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nectar thick - the level of OF thickness is similar to hot syrup since if you stick a spoon it in and take it out the liquid will just run off the spoon but the liquid doesn't splash like water when you pour it. It just is thicker </p>
</li>
<li>Honey-like - so it's like honey. If you dip in a spoon and the liquid doesn't come all the way off and coats the spoon, its honey-like level thick </li>
</ol>
<p>If you get to like a pudding consistency it's no longer a liquid </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Epsom salts are a form of magnesium. </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.epsomsaltcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/report_on_absorption_of_magnesium_sulfate.pdf" target="_blank">this study</a> it appears that magnesium is capable of being absorbed through the skin. </p>
<p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice resource that may provide information regarding its (empirically-supported) efficacy and clinical uses. </p>
<p>In essence, the relaxing effect of magnesium appears to be due to magnesium's neurological functioning. From the examine page: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Low Magnesium levels are associated with neuronal hyperexcitation and random firing, and secondary to higher activation of NMDA receptors more calcium appears to be released.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a rudimentary level, glutamate (what works on NMDA receptors) exerts a stimulatory function. </p>
<p>From the data above, it appears that magnesium reduces the amount of glutamate that is operating in the brain when you are at a sufficient level (or optimal, really...there are issues with the RDA level as it pertains to optimal health).</p>
<p>A study found that magnesium helped attenuate symptoms of ADHD, and that may serve as clinical support for this neural mechanism in humans. </p>
<p>There was further data supportive of this relaxation claim that was found in elderly people, their sleep quality increased and cortisol decreased. </p>
<p>Overall, it's undoubtable that a comprehensive overview of how magnesium works is easily explicable. It certainly operates in myriad ways, so just know that it does. </p>
<p>Edit: added a link to a study that found that epsom salt baths may allow for systemic magnesium to rise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL2e0rWvjKI" target="_blank">Veritasium</a> did a video on this. You lose weight in water, lost through urine excretion with less intake, sweat and water lost through respiration. </p>
<p>Then there's metabolism that converts sugar and O2 into CO2. So you're converting solid into gas, which gets expelled through expiration. Atmospheric air consists of 78.9% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Exhaled air consists of 78.04% nitrogen, ~16% oxygen, and 4% carbon dioxide. </p>
<p>So the weight of ambient air is (0.789 x 14.0067 + 0.2095 x 15.9994 +  0.0092 x 39.948 + 0.0004 x 44.01) grams / 22.4 liters. This comes to 0.655 grams per liter. The average tidal volume of one breath is around 500mL, so each breath of inhaled air weighs 0.328 grams.</p>
<p>The weight of exhaled air (now with more CO2) is (0.7804 x 14.0067 + 0.16 x 15.9994 + 0.0092 x 39.948 + 0.04 x 44.01) grams / 22.4 liters. This comes to 0.717 grams per liter and a weight of 0.359 grams per breath.</p>
<p>So you lose 0.328 - 0.359 = 0.031 grams per breath due to gas exchange and metabolism. The average breathing rate is between 12 - 20, so let's say 16 RPM. You sleep on average about 8 hours a night. So you're losing 8 x 60 x 16 x 0.031 = 238.1 grams simply through the difference in inhaled vs. exhaled air. That's about 0.52 pounds. So this isn't the entirety of weight lost, but it contributes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO" target="_blank">An M16 fires a 5.7 mm diameter bullet.  The weight of the round is about 4 g.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient" target="_blank">The drag coefficient for a bullet is approximately 0.295.</a></p>
<p>The equation for terminal velocity is</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee680de6632767977a602cfbed943853e3854cdc" target="_blank">https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee680de6632767977a602cfbed943853e3854cdc</a></p>
<p>where</p>
<p>Vt is the terminal velocity</p>
<p>m is the mass of the bullet, 0.004 kg</p>
<p>g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^(2))</p>
<p>rho is the density of air (1 kg/m^(3))</p>
<p>A is the area of the bullet (pi/4*(5.7 mm)^2 = 25.5 mm^2)</p>
<p>Cd is the drag coefficient (0.295)</p>
<p>So the terminal velocity of a bullet fired straight up from an M16 is 102 m/s.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7175470" target="_blank">here</a>, the minimum velocity of a bullet to penetrate skin is 58 m/s.  This bullet well exceeds that.</p>
<p>Don't shoot guns in the air.</p>
<p>Edit: it's been suggested that I point out that the muzzle velocity is 960 m/s, so the bullet is far, far slower on the way down than if it were pointed at you.  Also, a gun shooting at 102 m/s wouldn't count as a firearm under Canadian law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the bullet. It will be coming down significantly slower than it goes up, especially if it is shot straight up, because if it is shot straight up, it is much more likely to tumble on its way down, drastically increasing drag. If it is shot at an angle, it is much more likely to maintain its spin and stability, so it will have a much faster terminal velocity, and therefore be much more dangerous.</p>
<p>With big bullets, even tumbling it can be lethal, but small bullets will likely be survivable if shot straight up.</p>
<p>Regardless, getting hit by a bullet that was shot straight up is never going to be better than not getting hit by a bullet it all, so don't be firing guns into the air. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are doing (kinda), but perhaps in a way that you might not expect.  </p>
<p>The only way to increase CO2 uptake really is to increase photosynthesis and growth rate. We don't want to do that too much to algae because that could choke the lakes and seas, killing fish and devastating the ecosystem. Similarly, we don't want to do it to bacteria because bacteria were brought up properly by their parents and always share- by which I mean that they can transfer their genes laterally to other species. Think C.Diff is bad? Imagine if it develops a growth rate that's twice as fast. Not good.  </p>
<p>What we <em>are</em> doing however, is looking into plants. Depending on when you last studied biology you may or may not know that there are many different types of photosynthesis. Most plants use C3 photosynthesis, which was a lot better back when there was more CO2 in the air and less oxygen, but is increasingly inefficient. Some plants use C4 photosynthesis, which works better in all sorts of ways. C4 plants use less water, grow faster, and generally need less fertiliser. Sugar cane is a crop that naturally uses C4. A lot of work is being done to engineer more plants to use C4 photosynthesis, which would have the benefits of more food for less water and fertiliser, but equally take more CO2 out of the air.  </p>
<p>TL;DR, we're trying to make plants grow faster and more efficiently as a way to give more food and take more CO2 out of the atmosphere </p>
<p>Edit: a few follow up questions have been quite common;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No this would not be a good solution to climate change, most of the CO2 taken up would be released by decomposition, however trees modified to C4 could help with reforestation efforts by growing quickly. C4 trees could possibly grow faster than C3 trees, and if the total amount of biomass increases as a result, then more CO2 will be sequestered.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many scenarios where C3 is better than C4; it tends to be better in cooler, wetter environments with lower oxygen levels. However as the climate warms up, C4 will be increasingly important. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, growing algae in vats would not be a good solution. Any fuel generated would release this CO2 back into the environment. Yes, this would possibly reduce the amount of new CO2 being added to the atmosphere by preventing fossil fuels being burnt, at best this is carbon neutral, it doesn't actively decrease the CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>A lot of people are upset by me using the figure of 25% more efficiency for C4 plants. The fact is that around 25% of all photosynthesis reactions in C3 plants go wrong, trying to fix O2 rather than CO2, in a process called photorespiration. If you want a source for this, see:</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR:it's not that simple to make plants consume more CO2, other needs(water, light, nutrients) can be limiting, CO2 has to be transported to the place where photosynthesis happens, and GMO isn't magic.</p>
<p>the plant also has to get the CO2 to where it needs to go, which is limited by the CO2 concentration in the air, how fast the air around the leaves is refreshed(wind, and if the leaf has hairs more air stays still around it), and how quick that air can enter the stomata(small holes in the leaves, basically a leaf's lungs). then how quickly the CO2 is transported from inside that buble of air into the plant's cells(to think of a rough comparison, think of how the oxygen you breathe has to get from the air in your lungs into your blood).</p>
<p>next, you need enough light to use that CO2. then you need enough nitrogen, to grow new plant-parts and intercept more light. and other nutrients that are needed in smaller amounts. reducing all those limiting factors is not easy to do for any poor farmer, and depends on the climate. farmers in rich countries can get very far, but greenhouses are best since you can also control CO2-levels and reduce waterloss to outside the greenhouse. but still sunlight has a limit.
so at each of those steps you need to find solutions(and then a way to actually get it, either with conventional breeding or gmo, or management practices).</p>
<p>you would need leaves with a lot of area and no hairs, which keep their stomata wide open. open stomata also leads to a lot of evaporation of water, so you need to provide plenty of water. you need some wind to refresh air around the leaves, and enough light and nutrients.</p>
<p>one big thing you could do is go for C4 plants. C4 plants have a clever adaptation to one big efficiency-loss. the chemical that binds CO2 in plants, so that it gets from the air into the plant cell, can also bind oxygen. you could increase CO2-concentration(that's done sometimes in greenhouses), so there's more CO2 vs. oxygen. C4 plants do something like that too, they use a different chemical, that only binds CO2, and then transport the CO2 into a kind of airducts in the leaf where the CO2 concentration becomes very high and the original chemical can do it's work with high efficiency.</p>
<p>however, it's not easy to turn a C3('normal' plant) into a C4, since it's not just that one chemical, but also the airducts in the leaf. (little sidenote, it's not like C4 is rare, maize is C4 for example) and C4 do better at higher temperatures, so in temperate regions there's not that much to gain from turning a C3 into a C4. and actually, the reason that there is interest in turning C3 into C4 is due to using less water, not more CO2. since they can deal with lower CO2 concentrations, they can keep their stomata closed more often, so they evaporate less water.</p>
<p>and last, I think you're thinking of gmo as magic a bit too much. gmo sounds like it can do everything, but there are actually still a lot of problems. if you know what you want(let's say plant without hairs on leaf, C4 photosynthesis including the leaf anatomy), you need to find all the genes that do those things first. that is possible, but it's still something that takes time, money  and researchers. then you need to find a way to paste those genes into an existing plant, and grow a healthy plant where the editing succeeded and that can reproduce. and then you need to do breeding to actually make that plant good. if you made a gmo supertomato that is resistent to any pest, but you get shitty tasteless, small, green tomatoes, it's still worthless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measuring sea level is actually tricky business and we're not really <em>that</em> good at it currently.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's global sea level and local sea level. Global sea level is mostly affected (at least on human time scales) by the volume and temperature of the ocean (which is mostly affected by melting of surface ice). But the land on Earth is not static, so local sea level ends up being even more complicated with a lot more factors going into it. A major factor around river mouths, for example, is subsidence. The land there is soft, and it settles over time (to simplify) so even if nothing about the ocean changed the water depth at a particular point in a river delta might get deeper over time. Similarly, material deposition can have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>An important factor today is that the Earth only recently, in geological terms, came out of an ice age. For a period of about a hundred thousand years vast ice sheets covered much of the northern land masses. The current location of Boston would have been under more than a kilometer of ice, for example. Those ice sheets were, of course, massive and the water that made them up came out of the oceans, which is why the sea levels were lower during that period. Additionally, the weight of those ice sheets pushed down the continents, which float on the solid but plastic mantle. When the ice sheets retreated with the end of the ice age about ten thousand years ago the water raised the global sea level significantly (flooding a lot of low lying areas) but it also reduced the force that was weighing down the areas of the continents where the ice sheets were. As a consequence many northern land masses have been experiencing a long period of &quot;post-glacial rebound&quot;, as slow geologic forces push them toward a different equilibrium elevation than when they were weighed down by glaciers.</p>
<p>This movement is actually large enough to be measurable, and it's highest in places like Norway and Northern Canada. And, of course, Alaska. Southern Alaska is rebounding at a rate of several millimeters per year. Global sea level rise is smaller than this movement so local sea level change in regions still experiencing post-glacial rebound is negative, the sea seems to be going down (though in fact the land is going up). You can see the same thing in <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.shtml?stnid=040-321" target="_blank">Oslo, Norway</a> for example.</p>
<p>But if you look at areas that never had local glaciation and aren't experiencing post-glacial rebound, like <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.htm?stnid=500-041" target="_blank">Mumbai, India</a>, you see a different trend, one of increasing sea level. However, if you look at the sea level trends for a lot of different port cities at low latitudes you'll find that the rates of sea level increase are all over the place, from just a single mm/year up to several mm/year. A lot of that is due to different rates of subsidence. The land moves (both up and down), so trying to measure one moving thing from another moving thing is a very challenging problem.</p>
<p>We've been measuring the sea level with satellites for decades, but even that is not without it's fair share of problems. The main one being that we can't seem to calibrate the measurements of the satellites sufficiently well to actually have much confidence in the exact values of the trend data. We can be fairly certain that there's a global sea level rise but it may be as low as 0.5 mm/year or as high as 2-3 mm/year, it's hard to be certain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A process called isostatic rebound causes land uplift resulting from the lack of ice that was once present which caused large depressions over an area. This uplift, or rebound, is greater then the rate of sea level rise. A classic example of this process can be observed in north eastern Europe, where historically the land was covered in ice kilometres in thickness, similar to present day Greenland. It is very important to note that sea level change is a very complex science with dozens of factors contributing to a net rise or fall for example, water temperature, air pressure, and water currents trends. All of which change on annual, decadal, centennial, and millennial scales. The max and min sea level difference globally is a much as 70m from what I remember, all due to local factors mentioned. </p>

To me this is fascinating because as a kid, I always imagined that when you detonated a nuclear bomb, the entire world exploded. It seems more like nukes are basically just ordinary big bombs filled with magic poison. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tECIrCew3QM" target="_blank">a video from the time</a>, describing how nukes were used for fracking. These generally didn't leave a trace above ground because they were so deep. Like <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B012'51.8%22N+116%C2%B011'01.8%22W/@37.2105931,-116.1849102,514a,35y,38.9t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d37.21439!4d-116.18382?hl=en" target="_blank">Diamond Sculls</a>. But some testing left subsidence craters, like <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B004'55.2%22N+116%C2%B002'14.7%22W/@37.0749965,-116.055611,26694m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d37.08201!4d-116.03742?hl=en" target="_blank">Oscuro</a> and the others surrounding it.</p>
