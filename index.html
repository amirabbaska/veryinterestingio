<p>If you're asking for mathematical proof, then one can show that the gravitational waves follow from the Einstein equations for gravity in a low intensity field regime. In that regime, the equation literally is a &quot;wave equation&quot; and the parameter indicating the speed is exactly the speed of light. Or more correctly, the wave equation describing light waves and the wave equation describing gravitational waves possess the same speed parameter, which we call the &quot;speed of light&quot; but probably should more appropriately be named the &quot;Einstein constant&quot; or something like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>&quot;In a speech delivered in the Reichstag, Hitler stressed the military importance of occupation, noting that by occupying Czechoslovakia, Germany gained 2,175 field cannons, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft artillery pieces, 43,000 machine guns, 1,090,000 military rifles, 114,000 pistols, about a billion rounds of ammunition and three million anti-aircraft grenades. This amount of weaponry would be sufficient to arm about half of the then Wehrmacht.[9] Czechoslovak weaponry later played a major part in the German conquests of Poland (1939) and France (1940) - countries that had pressured Czechoslovakia's surrender to Germany in 1938.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: I said invaded and occupied, but Austria was sympathetic and became German through an Anschluss plebiscite. Czech Sudetenland and the Skoda arms factory was gifted to Germany through the Munich Agreement in an appeasement move.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what other people are saying:</p>
<p>In WW1, Germany launched a sudden attack against France (and Belgium), and so most of the trench warfare happened next to its borders, but outside of Germany. When the rides of battle turned, and Entente soldiers began making their way towards Germany, they surrendered before they actually reached Germany. </p>
<p>This means that the German soil saw no fighting during the war, and the country's infrastructure was essentially intact. Compare and contrast with France that had huge swathes of its territory rendered completely unusable to the point that some areas remain even today still off-limits. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It didn't. It was wrecking its own economy in the build-up of WW2 (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefo_bills" target="_blank">hiding its near bankruptcy by handing out funny money</a>), it was desperately short on manpower (parts of the army were demobilized between Poland and France so the men could be sent back into factories to make the ammunition they'd be shooting later!) and so short on equipment that each conquered country had to be plundered for just enough materials to fund the <em>next</em> conquest (the soldiers invading Russia had to use captured French and Polish equipment, which were conquered using Czech tanks). </p>
<p>The German war economy was a dumpster fire that needed to rape and pillage all of Europe to <em>barely</em> match the industrial output of a fully mobilized Britain, with no hope of ever matching the USSR or the USA. (Hence the whole Blitzkrieg idea – Germany couldn't afford more than a few months war, therefore everyone had to surrender within a few months. Too bad Stalin didn't want to cooperate.)</p>
<p>Germany mainly got away with it during the 1930s and the first two years of the war because everyone else was too reluctant to mobilize and match Germany's war machine – the Great Depression was wrecking havoc with everyone else's economies too, and they instead focused on rebuilding their industrial base to have a healthy civilian economy instead. For France and the rest of continental Europe, this was a bad idea, since Germany could quickly assemble an army <em>just barely</em> good enough to take on the continental European peace time armies. But for Britain, the USSR and the USA, this gave them the broad industrial base they needed to out-last Germany.</p>
<p>Germany never had hope of sustaining a long war. Not enough time nor resources to build a sufficient navy (and thus no hope of taking on the US or even Britain), no time nor resources to develop high-performance aero engines needed for strategic bombers (and thus no way to even slow down Britain, or hit the Soviet war industry); hell, for a large part there was no time nor resources to even build <em>assembly lines!</em> Apart from a few prestige projects like the Bf 109 short-range fighter (too short range to fight over Britain) and the Ju 88 light bomber (too light bomb load to be useful over Britain), Germany couldn't afford assembly line manufacturing for most of their equipment in the build-up to WW2. </p>
<p>Even Speer, despite his promises, couldn't rationalize German industry as much as he liked to – too little resources and too little manpower to get by. He mostly just fudged the numbers by burning through slave labour (literally, in many cases; the Germans killed more slaves while building the V-2 than they did by using it) and allocating all available resources to tank and airplane factories at the expense of &quot;less important&quot; industry… like machine tool factories that made the tooling said tank and plane factories needed to keep running. </p>
<p>Manpower, as mentioned, was a similar dumpster fire. Because Germany was pouring all its resources into getting ready for WW2, it didn't have any reserves to invest in, say, mechanized farming equipment. (Not that it would've been useful, with how little oil Germany had.) As a result, Germany needed a <strong>lot</strong> of farm hands and peasants to feed its population, and mobilization for war was only possible by raiding all of Europe for slave labour and food (thus leading to millions of people starving). Again, completely unsustainable; Germany ran out of its nominal manpower reserves by 1940 and was improvising from then on. The Allies, on the other hand, never had that problem – both because they <em>had</em> more reserves, and because they weren't ideologically blind and mobilized women at a much more massive scale in all possible fields (factory work, and in case of the USSR, even front line combat duty).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to that question entails an accurate understanding of WWII, which few people in the West are ever taught. Germany had enough resources and manpower to start WWII because their entire war plan consisted of a knockout blow to the Soviet Union that would conclude the war in a matter of three months. Barbarossa was not the &quot;start&quot; of he war for Germany. It was the beginning, middle, and end. They didn't really have the resources to fight beyond that and when Barbarossa failed to topple the Soviet Government, the Germans were doomed. If the Germans knew how strong the Russians really were, they never would have invaded (though they'd still be in a perilous position because every year the Russians would increase their advantage and eventually use that to invade Germany). The real question is how the Russians became strong enough to not just withstand a German assault but to counterattack and conquer all of Eastern Europe just 20 years after losing WWI.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is a condition that ophthalmologists have to treat. You remove the damaged epithelium by scraping with a cotton swab, place a dried placental membrane over the area that sticks in place to the exposed cornea, add some saline drops, and cover with a contact lens for a few weeks. The patient is prescribed extra salty tears to keep the surface a little more dry so the new epithelium can adhere. You come back and take the contact out and continue to use the drops until everything is back to normal. This is all done in the office and not the OR.

It probably doesn’t sting your eyes the way the salt in the ocean sometimes does. The salt in the Great Salt Lake or the Dead Sea would probably sting a lot worse. The amount of dissolved salt also affects the osmolarity, and if that is too high or too low, that affects comfort.</p>
<p>Tears, sweat, and blood (or Blood, Sweat, and Tears, - great group; you should listen to one of their albums- but I digress) all have salt(s) in them, but they have different concentrations of salt, and different concentrations of different salts (compounds like potassium chloride, calcium salts, magnesium salts, etc). Sweat and tears can have different pH (acidity or alkalinity). And they contain different lipids (oils).</p>
<p>The surface or the eye is built to be healthiest and most comfortable with the salinity, pH, lipids, and other components of our tears. If you change any of those parameters too much, and put that different solution in the eye, the cells on the surface of the eye can tell the difference. And they may tell you they don’t much care for it. By stinging, burning, and YES, by tearing, to restore the normal surface fluids on the eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Freshwater dwellers have salty blood relative to the water around them. Without a mechanism in place to control it, osmosis would equalise salt concentrations between the animal and the water surrounding it, pumping salt out of the body and flooding it with freshwater. A sodium pump, like that found in freshwater fish species, uses chloride cells on the gill surface to actively absorb sodium and potassium ions from the environment. Any excess water taken in at the same time is excreted as urine.</p>
<p>Marine dwellers have the opposite problem, and need to conserve fresh water while expelling salt. Cephalopods pump seawater through their gills and use their kidneys to filter out fresh water from the ocean. Salts and waste water are channelled through the funnel.</p>
<p>ie, they never developed a sodium pump that would help them cope with osmotic change in freshwater.</p>

<p>I don't have a solid answer for you, but I do have a hypothesis:</p>
<p>The main issue for invertebrates in freshwater is maintaining sufficient concentration of salts in the body while preventing too much water from coming in.  Cells are saltier than freshwater, and water wants to diffuse from less salty to more salty.  Stick a standard marine animal in freshwater, and a bunch of water rushes into the animal.  The animal needs to eliminate the water, but loses salts along with it.  To live in freshwater, you need some sort of osmoregulatory organ...something that can isolate and retain salts in the body while excreting water.  Freshwater shrimp and worms have such organs.  Squid and octopus apparently don't....but why can their relatives the snails and clams manage while they can't?</p>
<p>Well....it turns out that mollusks are pretty crappy at osmoregulation.  Freshwater clams and snails mostly deal with freshwater environments by....having really low salinities <em>in</em> their tissues.  The difference between internal and external concentrations are lower, and therefore easier for the animals to deal with.   But....the very ions they have at lower concentrations are the ones that are used for nerve signaling.  I couldn't find any studies specifically addressing this, but it's <em>plausible</em> that the reason snails and clams can invade freshwater but cephalopods can't is that cephalopods rely on fast and complex neural action, while snails and clams...don't.  Therefore, snails and clams can afford to operate at low nerve signaling efficiency brought on by low salinity tissues  in freshwater while squid and octopus can't.  </p>
<p>If nobody's studied this directly, it'd make a pretty good project I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Other times, the winner might want the attention/fame that comes with their identity being public, often giving an interview for a newspaper, site or show.</p>
<p>And sometimes, the lottery requires their identity be public as a condition of receiving the money. It “proves” to potential players that the game is winnable, and encourages them to play. The legality of this varies by area and game— an extreme example is the publisher’s clearing house which is a marketing company that makes money in other ways than selling lottery/sweepstakes entries. Giving money away is 100% for attention and public image, not directly generating revenue, for that company. Naming the winners publicly is part of that system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There’s continuing/growing demand for cheap, power efficient storage but the newest 3D NAND tech has been tricky to produce. Meanwhile, phones are being sold with a larger amount of NAND storage. At the same time, desktop/laptop computers are moving away from spinning HDDs for storage, increasing NAND flash use for those devices.

The price of 2D NAND has been pushed so low that almost nobody can make money manufacturing the parts. Try to buy a 512MB SD card and Amazon will offer you a 2GB one that's cheaper.  Higher densities of 3D NAND make that technology more profitable, and it keeps 2D NAND manufacturers from raising prices.  So, everybody did what seemed like the right thing for them, they closed their 2D plant and invested money in a 3D plant.  Alas, 3D is much harder to make and many 3D plants have low yield rates.  There is simply not enough capacity.  Nobody wants to open up their old 2D plant, because that's not very profitable either.  Everybody is mad because they have suppliers that promised them xGB parts for $y and now can only deliver 1/2 of what you order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been pretty heavily invested in Micron for the past 18 months and it has be very profitable. I will do my best to explain the current situation with memory.  </p>
<p>A few years ago there were about 10-15 memory makers producing DRAM and NAND.  Micron, Samsung, and Skhynix are pretty much the only companies that make BOTH types of memory.  </p>
<p>The memory producers, in the past, simply over produced memory chips leading to cannibalization of profit margins. The weaker companies could not survive and were simply bought by what is now the big three.  Micron, Samsung, and Skhynix.  Toshiba, Nanya, and Western Digital still make NAND.  Furthermore, in the past, DRAM and FLASH were almost exclusively limited to PC and Phones.  </p>
<p>The past 3 years have seen an unprecedented demand for memory in data centers.  Compounding the memory &quot;tightness&quot;  is demand from Smartphones, AI applications, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, etc.  The remaining companies no longer wish to completely decimate profit margins from over production and are, what appears to be, implementing a much more disciplined approach to production.  Even FURTHER compounding this shortage is the fact that entry into this industry is INSANELY costly.  New memory fabs cost about 5 BILLION dollars and the memory makers can't simply switch over production overnight.  They have to carefully consider where to allocate capital and production.    Making these highly specialized chips is also VERY hard and any problems in the process leads to the complete ruin of the chips.  Micron has had a few problems with this recently and this only makes the supply that much more limited.  </p>
<p>TLDR:  Supply and Demand with the suppliers not wanting to gut their profit margins and making further memory yields very difficult. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Currently, NAND pricing expected to fall about 30+% in 2018 (no supply problems), however NAND manufacturers simultaneously lowering their manufacturing costs per bits sold faster, so still making lots of $$.  Why? They are shrinking node sizes and offering more bits of memory on same size wafers through 3D NAND layering and stacking. Costs of Gb or gb much lower as a result and you will soon see greater transition away from Hard Disk Drives as SSD now cost competitive with HDD. The problem with this though is with each new level of stacking, space in the FAB's is lost for more machines and clean space needed</p>
<p>DRAM another story. Only 3 manufacturers (of any real magnitude) left in the biz and they are reaching point where shrinking more bits into same die no longer reaping cost benefits. </p>
<p>Finally, the big 3 (Samsung, Hynix and Micron) are hesitant to spend huge amounts of cash (5+ $billion for a FAB and 2 yrs to bring it on line) only to shoot themselves in foot by flooding market with too much supply, lowers average selling prices and lose money....like past cycless)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The respondents so far are essentially saying “yes”. They’re not wrong, since each body cell requires a blood supply- so the BIGGER you are, the more blood you have.  But let me tackle another angle: No.</p>
<p>Take two people who are both 90kg. Same weight. One of these two runs 4 times a week and body builds at the gym. He is filled with lean muscle mass, which requires a vast network of vasculature to deliver oxygen and nutrients. His 90kg counterpart is made up of adipose tissue (fat storage cells) which just deposits energy for future usage and does not require extensive vasculature. A kg of lean muscle mass has a ton more vascular volume than a kg of adipose tissue. Sure, while your weight goes up due to obesity, you have more vascular volume than before, but the rise of blood volume per kilogram is lower than previous. It makes (accurate) drug dosing of narrow therapeutic range drugs that are dosed per kilogram much more difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, obesity actually = LESS blood volume than comparators of the same weight. </p>

<p>There are few wolf and bears in Europe because in most places they are hunted to extinction.</p>
<p>So if you compare with North America and Asia at the same latitude you will find some large cats that don't live Europe. But those areas are less populated  and the population drops when large numbers of humans live there from habitat destruction and hunting.</p>

<p>Woolly Mammoth</p>
<p>Aurochs (wild cattle)</p>
<p>Neanderthal man</p>
<p>Wooly Rhino</p>
<p><del>Short-faced bear</del> Cave bear (basically a massive grizzly)</p>
<p>Brown bear (grizzly)</p>
<p>Straight-tusked elephant</p>
<p>Wisent (European bison)</p>
<p>Saber-toothed cat</p>

<p>Horse</p>
<p>Timber wolf</p>
<p>Wild boar</p>
<p>Moose (elch)</p>
<p>Giant deer</p>
<p>Elk (Red stag)</p>
<p>Of those, only a handful of mostly game species remain, like red stag, moose and wild boar.  Timber wolves have mostly been extirpated except in European Russia and maybe the Pyrenees.  All of the truly dangerous game was either wiped out (mammoths, their predators like cave lions and cave bears) or, actually, domesticated.  The aurochs in particular was famously dangerous in Roman periods; its last wild descendant was killed in Poland if I remember right in the 18th century. You can see its domestic descendants in any cattleyard.  Likewise horses and Neanderthal man were domesticated, with the least placid individuals wiped out. In the case of Neanderthal man we inbred with some and killed the rest.</p>
<p>Europe is basically a garden.  It has been as heavily modified by man at the height of his abilities as anywhere in the world, AND its climate has changed radically since we got there, which put additional pressure on the local megafuna in a way inconsistent with, say, India or Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Fair point about brown bears (grizz).  For whatever reason, European brown bears don't have the fearsome reputation of North American grizzlies, but I still do not advise you to poke one with a stick if you see one in Russia, the Balkans, or Finland.</p>
<p>^^1 i.e. Europe was home to these animals when modern man (Homo sapiens sapiens) arrived.  Many evolved elsewhere and migrated to Europe over the years before Man arrived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But I'm villages it is quite different. Your social circle is quite small and everyone knows everyome else. Here your caste is part of your identity.</p>
<p>You will probably get many different answers for this question, which are all correct but also wrong because in country of 1.3 billion people thimgs drastically change from place to place and situation to situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In urban areas, it doesn't matter that much. Although, won't say it is completely alleviated.</p>
<p>For example, I live in the top tier II city of India and I just asked my mother sitting in front of me this (she's not staunch Brahmin but conservative a little and knows stuff).  Some reasons are like names. The surnames can tell a lot. While Mishra, Shukla, Dubey, Tiwari et cetera are Brahmins, just like that Valmiki, Chaudhary for example are Dalit surnames. </p>
<p>They can of course change their name but even that practice is so common that it's not a secret anymore. Say a Valmiki can change his name to for example Kumar but that doesn't mean all Kumars are Dalits. But since it is practiced so commonly,  caste minded people get the idea. Hope I'm making myself clear.</p>
<p>Another way is the rituals! Upper castes tend to (want to) enjoy rituals themselves. Say someone dies in a Brahmin family, the mourning period and the rituals tend to last for 13 days but that is not the case for Dalits, since, from ancient times they have not been able to practice such rituals, it has become tradition for them, so if someone dies in a Dalit family, the ritual barely lasts for 2-3 days. People talking about their rituals and practices is the most easy way to understand. There are other examples too but that raises an obvious question! </p>
<p>Dalits today in a modern society can change those rituals right? They are guaranteed by the constitution and law and order and all that stuff.  This is true and many tend to do it but this tendency lies in urban areas only. In rural areas, if a Dalit man even tries sitting on a horse for his wedding baaraat (a procession) the upper caste would literally shoot him for attempting to show himself as equal to Brahmins. Of course the law takes its course but the damage has been done and since it's a rural area, even police tends to act loosely because they themself sometimes respect the caste system too much or are afraid of the local upper castes people.</p>
<p>And here's what you need to understand! India (a big chunk of it) still lives in those rural areas and this is why it is prevalent and while we are a developing nation and emerging super economy (means people are migrating to urban areas for better lifestyle and standard of living), these are the same people who once lived in rural areas and practiced those same traditions, they feel if they abandon such Brahminical mindset, they're betraying they're culture. So in a subtle way, it still exists in urban areas. For example, we have Dalits in our apartment and while my mother is outspoken  (a lot) she has called them Dalit (even after changing name using the same practices that I told you) but she hasn't ever discriminated. Dalits have come in our house, talked, ate, had fun, hell, even cooked in the kitchen. </p>
<p>Hope I answered you well.</p>
<p>PS - I'm a Brahmin. The sane ones. We don't shoot people for riding horses. Frankly I asked half of this stuff from my mother just now. As an individual who was never imposed all this, I couldn't care less but that doesn't mean I shouldn't know about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually one can guess the caste by a person's surname. As in there are certain surnames which belong only to lower caste people. People have done the changing surnames thing actually, a lot have changed their surnames to general Kumar, Kumari or Gupta.</p>
<p>Low mobility. People lived their lifetime in a given area and changing cities (dislocating from your family and profession) was not easy. Eventually someone from you area will notice you wherever you have shifted. Also, since education was scarce for them, finding a job in a new place would be difficult. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few ways:</p>
<p>1) Type of job: Dalits tend to do the most menial/dirty jobs, such as cleaning streets, picking up/sorting/disposing garbage, unclogging sewers, working with dead animals/leather, etc. For generations, that's the type of work that has been available to their caste and they historically haven't been able to move out of those.</p>
<p>2) Skin color: Dalits tend to be darker than the others in their community. This is a total guess on my part but based on some of my travels in India. Even in the South where my family is from, and where people are often darker than their Northern counterparts, I feel like people of lower castes tend to be darker. I don't know if it has to do with lower castes perhaps coming from indigenous tribes in India, or simply because those in lower castes historically work jobs in the hot sun. I feel like it might be the latter, but in any case, having dark skin is often looked down upon in India.</p>
<p>According to the Indian Constitution, discrimination of individuals due to caste is illegal. Sadly, you don't change thousands of years of social and economic discrimination in less than 100. And those in the &quot;untouchable&quot; community still face a <strong>lot</strong> of harassment and discrimination. Especially those who are trying to get educated and move up in life, and those who are fighting for their basic rights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yay, I can answer this. </p>
<p>Different meats have different fat, water, and amino acid ratios. Fish is a great example since it has a high nitrogen content and low fat content which promotes Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp to become the dominant microbe. </p>
<p>The animals also have different dominant bacteria when they are alive which will contaminate the meat to a certain extent as it's processed. How the meat is stored will also play a role (aerobic, anaerobic, refrigerated (to what temperature), what preservatives may have been added). </p>
<p>The bacteria that spoils the meat isn't necessarily the bacteria that might harm you. Often, spoilage microbes are not the ones you worry about, however their presence in high levels is an indicator that conditions have been ripe for microbial growth and therefore the ones that could harm you are also likely present in sufficient quantities to cause disease. </p>
<p>Another key indicator is pH. Poultry typically has a higher pH and therefore will spoil faster. Lactic acid bacteria will often proliferate in beef (which is what gives it the sour smell as it starts to go bad). They have the effect of lowering the pH which limits other spoilage microorganisms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Decomposition is mostly a matter of which microorganisms are best able to thrive in the medium.  The major differences between, e.g., beef, pork, and poultry will be in the ratios of fat and protein, connective tissue, etc., but also in what organisms are already present within the meat, giving them a huge advantage over those just landing on the surface from a touch or from the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
