		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does a lot of things that'll be too difficult to explain in a single post because you need to pull in a lot of information from biology to understand it, but I can try.</p>
<p>Ionising radiation is the dangerous kind because it has the power to cause molecules to break up. When a molecule breaks up, it goes from a stable form to an unstable form. This unstable form can attack other molecular bonds, causing damage. The most significant damage in our body from ionising radiation at the beginning is because of Reactive Species (also known as Reactive Oxygen Species but there are other types like Reactive Nitrogen Species or Metals) which are highly reactive and cause a lot of local damage by attacking cellular components that are nearby.</p>
<p>When this happens you get one of two things. Either the cell recognises that its too far gone and kills itself (apoptosis). Or, the cell doesn't, and it starts to break apart (necrosis). This is pretty bad. In addition to the cells literally being torn apart (kind of like blending fruits), they also release special molecules (mediators) triggering something called inflammation which can have nasty effects. While it usually helps the body, because your cells are all torn up, you get stuff like bleeding, swelling, fluid in places where you don't usually get it, etc. This is acute radiation damage. You basically give the person an analgesic (painkiller) and hope they survive. We can supply blood and stuff, but the rest of it depends on how strong a person is.</p>
<p>The major effects depend on where the cell damage happens. In your bones, you produce less red blood cells, less white blood cells because they normally produce these, so damage = less production. In your intestines, you can cause a lot of bleeding because your intestines have a lot of small vessels to assist absorption of nutrients. On your skin, it starts swelling, bleeding, forming ulcers, and shedding. All of these happen from the same basic principle, its just cells getting shredded and our body trying to help but really messing up and making it worse. </p>
<p>The body's also really weakened because of this, and your white blood cell factors can be damaged because of the radiation. We can give antibiotics which help stave off secondary infection while the body tries to heal. </p>
<p>And the rest of it:</p>
<p>The worse part is DNA mutation. Your cells can usually repair DNA mutation because we have special enzymes that do it. However, this can go wrong. When a gene mutation happens, it can be lethal, causing the cell to kill itself, apoptosis, or stop functioning which also causes it to kill itself. When it's non-lethal, the cell has to catch the mutated gene and repair it. If it can't do it, the cell passes it on.</p>
<p>Okay, mutations aren't too bad when you have one. They might have minor effects like the cell not doing the same thing anymore, or they don't recognise other signals that tell it to kill itself, or it might grow really fast, or it might not know when to stop growing. The body can catch cells that do this and kill them, but sometimes they miss them. What's worse, is when they get more than one of these mutations. Suddenly, the cell doesn't respond to other cells telling them to die, and they can hijack cells around them to support themselves (desmoplasia). Even worse, is that they grow fast, they don't know when to stop and that's called cancer. The more of these non-lethal mutations they have, the worse they get, becoming these unrecognisable messes of cells that look nothing like the normal cell and they're very scary because they're like unkillable, super dividing, parasitising super-cells. </p>
<p>How do we stop cancer. Well, we could target these cells specifically, but how? They're basically the same as other cells, except they don't really respond properly. One thing we can try is looking for them using X-ray and CTs and such, and finding areas that are strangely dense or lumpy. Then, we use radiation to blast them, hoping that acute radiation damage like I mentioned earlier will kill them before it kills us. Alternatively, we dump a bunch of poison in our body, hoping that those cells die first before our body does. </p>
<p>Cancer cells use up more energy and nutrients than other cells do. The hope is that they suck in more poison as well, and that'll kill them first. But this also causes havok on the rest of the body. We don't know how to target them just yet, because each cancer is different. A different gene mutation can give the same cancer in different people, or even in the same cell. </p>
<p>I had to shorten a lot because it is <em>insanely</em> complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of radiation poisoning, and which is which, affects your options for living. </p>
<p>If you are exposed to ionizing radiation, say from an Xray machine, or solar flare, or exposure to hard radiation (without being exposed to the chemicals themselves) then it's like your body got an inside out sun tan. The radiation shoots through your cells like a cosmic machine gun, damaging your DNA, RNA, and basically damaging large amounts of cells at once similar to a flame. </p>
<p>The good news is that all a person needs to do is  get away from the source of the radiation, and new damage stops immediately. Just like pulling your hand out of a flame stops you from being further burned. </p>
<p>The immediate result of this is that the dead or dying cells begin to release toxins into the blood and muscles, the body tissues begin to swell similar to being burned by a fire, and there is trauma to the exposed parts of the body. How much exposure determines how quickly these symptoms set in. Usually from hours to days, although nausea can occur within minutes. </p>
<p>The longer term problem is that with the genetic code of your body damaged in so many places, the cells can't reproduce properly, much like a computer program that's been corrupted. This leads to secondary cell deaths, mutations, cancers, and all kinds of nasty secondary effects. If you survive the initial dose of radiation, these secondary effects will plague you the rest of your life. </p>
<p>So that is assuming you were exposed to radiation, but not exposed to radioactive elements directly. IE you're exposed to the light, not the light bulb itself. If a person comes in contact with radioactive elements, fallout, nuclear waste, etc, then these sources of radiation get on their skin, in their hair, in their clothes, inhaled in their lungs, ingested in their saliva, and once in the body, they continue releasing that damaging radiation until either they radioactively decay (a very long time), they are cleaned out of the body through something like chelation (not very effective), or the person dies. </p>
<p>There are some treatments that can help if administered early enough after exposure. For instance one of the more dangerous elements in nuclear fallout is radioactive iodine, which tends to concentrate in the thyroid. However if you dose somebody up with a large amount  of regular iodine, then the thyroid becomes saturated and can't take any more in, effectively rejecting the radioactive iodine. </p>
<p>This is the far more dangerous kind of radiation poisoning because you can't remove the person from the source of radiation, since it's inside of their bodies. In other words even if they are moved away from the source of contamination, they themselves are contaminated, and will continue to receive radiation. The paper suits and dust masks that people wear in contaminated areas, do not protect them from radiation at all, but they do provide protection from contamination by radioactive dust by covering their faces and clothing.</p>
<p>Now naturally a normal medical xray isn't giving you burns or cancer because it's relatively weak. So we have a measurement system that takes into account actual damage, and risk of damage to your body and we call these Sieverts. It's not a measurement of radiation itself, but is instead a measure of how much damage that radiation would cause to a person. At low levels it increases the risk of cancer. At high levels it results in cell death.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the dose is high enough (~2 Gy), the radiation kill your very sensitive blood stem cells. Your white cell count will diminish and you will have a reduced immune system. If left untreated it's likely to kill you within a few months. </p>
<p>If the dose is higher (~4 Gy) your intestines are in danger, and the colon stem cells might die. If this happens your villi in the gut do not regenerate, and are eventually grinded down completely within a few weeks. This leads to open wounds in the colon, and infections, which might kill you, even if you're hospitalized. Your blood stem cells will of course die too, but the gastrointestinal syndrome will kill you first. </p>
<p>At super high doses (~ 100 Gy) vessels rupture in the brain and the pressure will kill you within a few days. Little is understood about this case. You are guaranteed to die.</p>
<p>So treatment is basically just to keep the body alive and hope that it manages to regenerate new stem cells e.g. through transplants. And these are all the syndromes associated with a whole-body dose. For medical radiation cases, the dose is localized. In that case a too high dose will cause the skin to die (necrosis) which if left untreated will lead to nasty infections and death. Skin grafts have been used to save patients whose been accidentally over-exposed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiation poisoning is basically random damage to cells throughout your body, for more details see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5yry50/eli5why_do_you_get_better_for_a_few_days_after/deshgyw/" target="_blank">this comment of mine</a>.</p>
<p>Medicine cannot really cure any of that. It can treat some of the symptoms (like dehydration from vomiting) and prevent those from killing you while your body repairs itself, and it can support some of the body's repair efforts, for example the bone marrow (which is responsible for producing blood cells) can be severely affected, and there is a protein that stimulates bone marrow growth. While it works, blood transfusions can supply the blood cells your body isn't producing.</p>
<p>In cases where the radiation poisoning comes from <em>contamination</em>, i.e. radioactive material got into your body and is <em>still</em> releasing radiation that constantly damages your body, medicine can play a very important role in saving your life by removing some of that radioactive material. For example, giving you lots of non-radioactive iodine can prevent your body from holding onto radioactive iodine, and some substances form bonds with certain radioactive elements and cause your body to excrete them.</p>
<p>But if the radiation poisoning is too severe, you will die and the only thing medicine can do is to ease your suffering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiation damages single molecules.<br />
Those molecules can contain oxygen, which when freed will damage another molecule cause it's highly reactive.<br />
Our DNA is a massive, massive molecule itself, which can also be damaged and in many places at once. Cells have the capability to repair DNA, but only to some extent.<br />
A cell with damaged DNA either dies or passes the damage to its &quot;children&quot; when it divides. The latter can cause cancer, which is a long-term effect of radiation.<br />
Cells are most affected by DNA damage when they are about to divide. Thus, the cells that divide a lot are the most vulnerable. Those are the cells producing red blood cells located in spleen (causing anaemia), white blood cells producers in bone marrow (causing a drop in immune system strength and risk of infection) and the lining of guts (causing various gastric problems, including problems absorbing nutrients and gut infections).<br />
For comparison, nerve cells almost never divide and can take much more radiation before being affected.  </p>
<p>When acute radiation happens the cells that are in the vulnerable stage will be damaged. There is no immediate effect because the affected cells are only precursors to the cells that do the real work. Sometime later, however, the body will experience severe lack of the cells that failed to be produced. Those types of cells die off and are regenerated constantly, so any disruption in the production of new cells leaves a shortage when old cells die.</p>
<p>When one knows exposure is imminent they should try covering the most vulnerable parts of their body. Experiments have shown that covering belly and a thigh bone with lead increases the survivability the most.</p>
<p>Medicine does not have a cure for radiation sickness. They can alleviate the symptoms and wait for the next generation of new cells to be produced and cover the deficits. If the radiation wasn't too strong, the cells that were not dividing at the moment of exposure will remain largely unaffected and will pick up the slack. It does take very long time to recover, though, and cancer should be expected within few years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not as well. The heavier elements in the carbon have more electron shells, which makes them occupy more volume in a molecule and form weaker bonds with other atoms. Carbon is 'small,' allowing it to form stronger bonds and fit into more densely-packed molecules (density in the sense of total atoms within a given volume - not to be confused with density in the conventional sense of total mass within a given volume). The more massive members of the carbon group are poorer at this. Silicon can still form alkane analogues (known as group-14 hydrides) and polymers, Germanium can do so to a lesser extent, and Tin can only form two known group-14 hydrides (stannane and distannane). Plumbane (PbH4) is known but only in trace amounts.</p>
<p>So the short answer is yes, the other Carbon group atoms can form chains, but not as well. The heavier the element in the group, the shorter the maximum chain length it can form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I can't get a decent cell phone signal and these guys are communicating on an Interstellar level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mobile phones work off UHF (Ultra High Frequency), so the range is very short. There are usually signal repeaters across a country, so it gives the impression mobiles work everywhere. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>wouldn't this take an enormous amount of power</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, not really, as long as there is <em>nothing</em> between Voyager and the receiving antenna (usually very large).  As long as the signal is stronger than the cosmic background, you'll pick it up if the antenna is sensitive enough. </p>
<p>So the ELI5 version of this would be :</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening to a mouse in a crowded street.</li>
</ul>
<p>Versus</p>
<ul>
<li>In an empty and noise-less room, you are staring at the mouse's direction, , holding your breath, and listening for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: did not expect this to get so up voted. So, a lot of people have mentioned attenuation (signal degradation) as well as background cosmic waves.</p>
<p>The waves would very much weaken, but it can travel a long wave before its degrades to a unreadable state. Voyager being able to recieve a signal so far out is proof that's its possible. Im sure someone who has a background in radiowaves will come along and explain (I'm only a small-time pilot, so my knowledge of waves is limited to terrestrial navigation).</p>
<p>As to cosmic background radiation, credit to lazydog at the bottom of the page, I'll repost his comment</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, it's like this: we take two giant receiver antennas. We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off. Both receivers get all of the noise from that area of the sky, but only the first gets Voyager's signal as well. If you subtract the noise signal from the noise + Voyager signal, what you've got left is just the Voyager signal. This methodology is combined with a lot of fancy error correction coding to eliminate reception errors, and the net effect is the pinnacle of communications technology: the ability to communicate with a tiny craft billions of miles away.</p>

The signals from the Voyagers are not strong - they are, in fact, weak compared to the background noise, but clever software algorithms have been developed which identify and isolate these transmissions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some other commenters have covered really well how it's still transmitting, so I'll cover a bit of how we're receiving. The signals Voyager transmits are really weak when they get here, and there's a lot of noise in the electromagnetic spectrum, so the signals are way weaker than the noise. &quot;But wait&quot; you might say, &quot;if the signals are weaker than the noise, how can we hear them?&quot; It's a challenge comparable to hearing your friend whispering from across a room full of people talking. We came up with a really clever way to hear them, though.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no known mechanism by which the particles &quot;send a message&quot; to one another. The phenomenon is the result of creating a system of two or more particles whose wavefunctions depend upon one another. By measuring an aspect of one particle, its wavefunction is collapsed to known value, which causes the other particle's wavefunction to be known as the other value.</p>
<p>For example, take two electrons that are known to have a total spin of 0. Each electron has a 50% chance of being measured to be either spin-up or spin-down. If you separate them, each will still have a 50% chance.</p>
<p>However, if you separate them without changing their spin, and then measure electron 1 to be spin-up, then you will find that electron 2 is spin-down 100% of the time. How does it know that electron 1 is spin-up? Nobody really knows. It's an active area of research, however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A specific example of entanglement can be represented mathematically as |11&gt; + |00&gt;, where |XY&gt; is a notation that means &quot;first particle is in state X and second in state Y&quot;, and the + really means that they are in both situation (00 and 11) at the same time, not either one but a superposition of both.</p>
<p>For our example, that means you have a superposition of both particles 0 or both particles 1. Now when you measure the first particle you will not measure a superposition,  what you can get is either 1 or 0 as a result. For the sake of argument, let's  say you get 1. You know -- if you knew the state beforehand -- that the only state in which the first particle was in state 1 was |11&gt;, so now you know that the second one is also in state 1.</p>
<p>That's entanglement in a nutshell.</p>
<p>The real weirdness appears when you separate the two particles before measuring them, so that they can't know that the other particle was measured, even if they'd have communicated at lightspeed somehow. It will still stay consistent and the statistics can be shown to be different than that of particles that'd have been fixed at either |00&gt; or |11&gt; without you knowing, i.e. not in a superposition. It's been showed experimentally in an experiment called the violation of Bell inequalities. Fun fact: Bell thought that his inequities would not be violated, but it was actually proved otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had two guns. One in each hand. You also had a stiff wooden plank strapped to your back, extending the length of your outstretched arms forcing you keep your arms at full length and you cannot bend your arms in any way. If you raise one arm, the other arm is forced to be lowered by the stiff wooden plank.</p>
<p>Now in the case where you always fire both guns at exactly the same time we can say that the position of the guns is related to each other, because of the stiff board forcing the direction of one gun to be effectively opposite of the other gun.</p>
<p>Raise one arm so the gun is pointing to the ceiling and fire. You make a hole in the ceiling but you also KNOW there MUST be a hole in the ground. It doesn't matter if the ground was 5 ft away or a mile ( lets assume the bullet can travel in a straight line for an infinite amount of distance and ignore real things like air resistance for now etc), you still know there's a hole in the ground.
When two photons are entangled, there's a similar dependency on each other for things like their position and momentum. When you have two detectors for use in a quantum experiment, which is measuring the output of a non-linear crystal that generates entangled pairs , your two detectors will always receive the two photons at exactly the same time, you'll get synchronous clicks.</p>
<p>Since you got this far, its time to have a little ''mind blown'' experimental example!</p>
<p>Take a laser, but this laser is a special one where you can get photons coming out both ends, instead of just one end. Turn down the intensity of this laser until your basically only getting one photon out of each end at a time and where these photons are quantum entangled.  </p>
<p>Photons can have a polarisation. This is basically an orientation of the direction in which the propagating electromagnetic wave travels. For linear polarisations this direction is constant with propagation and can take any angle between 0-360, where 0 is arbitrarily defined by you . Now the cool part. Polarisers are sheets of material with molecules arranged in their surface such that only specific polarisation states can pass through. The non red/blue type of 3D Glasses in cinemas these days are polarisers, so your left eye sees a different image to your right eye because one type of image is polarised in one direction vicea versa. Now lets say we put a horizontal linear polariser at some point in the path of one of the entangled photons. The polarisation of the photon is random, it can be horizontal, vertical , 45 degrees -45 degrees or any angle in between. </p>
<p>If its horizontal it gets through 100% of the time and if vertical is blocked. But something interesting happens at 45 degrees. it actually has a 50/50 chance of getting through or getting blocked. However, in the times when it gets through , its polarisation will actually flip to horizontal afterwards, kind of like throwing pennies at a slot machine, if you throw the penny exactly ride itll slide easily through the slot, throw it at a bit of an angle it might bounce off but maybe it 'chinks' through the slot, changing its orientation. </p>
<p>However, remember that other photon  we made which was flying off into the cosmos? Well since it was entangled with the first, if we had measured the polarisation of the first photon, we would know that the polarisation would be the same in the second photon. However, at the moment the first photon when it gets through the polariser and flips to horizontal, when it started at 45, the other photons also instantaneously flips to horizontal too. </p>
<p>No matter if its at the other side of the lab or the other side of the universe. </p>
<p>And no, this is not superluminal information transfer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it doesn’t happen instantaneously. For example if you have a particle in an excited state with one lower-energy state (the ground state), the time-dependence of the wavefunction is something like exp[iEt/<del>h</del>], where E is a “complex-valued energy”</p>
<p>E = E<em><em>0</em></em> - iΓ/2.</p>
<p>E<em><em>0</em></em> is the actual energy of the excited state, and Γ is the energy width. </p>
<p>If you calculate a probability density for a wavefunction of this form, you get something proportional to</p>
<p>exp[-Γt/<del>h</del>].</p>
<p>Notice that this is not an imaginary exponential, which is an oscillating function. This is a <strong>real</strong> exponential function, and it decays with time. This is the exact same exponential decay that you see in radioactivity.</p>
<p>So the probability density for finding the particle in the excited state decays exponentially in time; it doesn’t instantaneously change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the epidemic. For rare diseases that pop up now and then, like ebola, this was important because people wanted to know where ebola was coming from. Years could pass without a single known human having it, so it was coming from the environment, likely some kind of animal. After finding out &quot;patient zero&quot; for ebola outbreaks, you can look at where they lived, what they did, etc. to identify likely candidates for animal hosts, and then go into the wild and collect those animals to see if  they actually have the virus. If they do, then you can now warn everyone that this is how you get ebola, so they know to be cautious. </p>
<p>Studying diseases that can jump species barriers can also potentially teach us about which diseases might do this in the future, so we can be prepared just in case it happens. </p>
<p>If <em>very</em> little is known about the disease in question, tracing the path of transmission can tell you how the disease is spreading. Is it airborne? Does it live in the environment, or only within hosts? How long can it survive outside the host? Does it even spread from person to person, or were all those infected exposed to the same source, rather than one passing it to the other? Legionnaire's disease is like this, it DOES NOT spread from person to person, it spreads through inhaling contaminated water vapor. So if a group of people get it, we can look to see  what water sources they've been near, so that we can stop any more people from being infected by that source. </p>

<p>For that reason, two things are very important in developing a cure/treatment: patient zero and resistant/carrier patients. </p>
<p>Patient zero helps give you a better idea of where it came from and how it is communicated. Knowing these things also helps you understand who's most at risk and how best to limit infection. Resistant carriers are the most critical because they help you determine how the body can fight off the infection, and they tell you what kind of reaction you need to artificially create in the body to help fight it off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For once, a question that I am more than an armchair expert in! </p>
<p>So what you need to understand is that most geostationary communication satellites in use don't know anything about protocols, data, or anything else like that. They are simple dumb bent pipes in orbit. They simply take the radio signal that's transmitted to them, shift its frequency, amplifies it, and retransmits it back to the ground. They do not demodulate or decode what's being sent through them.</p>
<p>This is done for a couple of reasons. First, modems are power hungry and often sensitive to radiation. Putting that on a spacecraft increases your power demands, and thermal control issues. All of that reduces the power you have available for your transmitters. It's also, of course, impossible to service or uograde something once it's in orbit.</p>
<p>Because all of this, the standard option is to put the complex equipment on the ground where it's easy to power, cool, upgrade, and service.</p>
<p>Now as far as the second part of your question, it's a mix of protocols. The network I operate is just running standard IP (over HDLC). The trick is that all satellite modems include various forms of Forward Error Correction (FEC). This is basically redundant/checksum data that lets the far end modem reliably reconstruct the data, even in sub optimal conditions. The net result of that is as long as my signal to noise ratio is above a certain threshold, the link is quasi error free. Maybe one bit in a billion will be wrong. There is virtually no packet loss if designed right, the satellite link is really just like a (very) long serial cable.</p>
<p>Now latency is an issue, mostly when it comes to the TCP window size. I have Cisco WAAS deployed, which does a bunch of tricks to make things more useable. It fakes out the acks to get things going, does de-duplication and compression where it can, and a bunch of other things. The biggest thing that hurts it is the move to SSL everywhere. My performance took a nosedive when Facebook switched to SSL by default. Prior to that it was eminently cacheable.</p>
<p>TL,DR: the standard protocols work fine as long as the network is designed properly. The satellites themselves don't care.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the Gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In contrast to the excellent answers /u/millijuna has given, all of my experience is with a few different science data satellites, rather than commercial data service satellites.  I'll note up-front that science data satellites tend to use tried-and-true standards rather than the latest technology.  The latest tech is reserved for demonstration satellites (which I haven't worked on...)</p>
<p>The satellites I've worked on used CCSDS standards, such as the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/727x0b4.pdf" target="_blank">CCSDS File Delivery Protocol</a> for transferring files.  For telemetry; i.e. spacecraft health and safety data, or science data: onboard information is packaged into packets; several packets are packaged into &quot;frames&quot; (see <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/102x0b5s.pdf" target="_blank">CCSDS &quot;Packet Telemetry&quot;</a> ) , which have Reed-Solomon error-correcting codes added on to them.  The frames are then convolutionally-encoded.</p>
<p>Both Reed-Solomon and convolutional encoding help to compensate for noisy data links.</p>
<p>The data is downlinked using various kinds of radio-frequency (RF) links -- e.g. QPSK.  You can <a href="https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsndocs/810-005/208/208B.pdf" target="_blank">read about how NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) does it.</a></p>
<p>For ground-to-ground links, some systems use yet another CCSDS standard called &quot;Space Link Extension&quot; (SLE).   SLE consists of several protocols, and not all of them are used by a particular system or satellite.  The older satellites don't understand SLE, so they continue to use the older CCSDS standards such as Packet Telemetry.  Some of the newer satellites understand one or more of the SLE protocols.</p>
<p>Uplink is a yet another standard; e.g. the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/202x0b3s.pdf" target="_blank">CCSDS Telecommand Standard</a></p>
<p>You can find detailed information about the CCSDS standards (e.g. SLE) by reading the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/publications/bluebooks.aspx" target="_blank">CCSDS blue books</a></p>
<p>For more on error-correction, see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3y8r77/how_are_satilites_that_are_very_far_away_able_to/" target="_blank">previous askscience post</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some spacecraft are using TCP over HDLC, with IPsec for security. But that does not work over long distance. As far as ESA probes are concerned, and also for a good part of the scientific satellites in Europe, protocoles defined by the CCSDS are used: <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx</a> </p>
<p>When controlling the satellite, you will send telecommands and receive telemetries. When you have a satellite that is far away, you will typically send a bunch of time tagged telecommands that the satellite will record and run when the times comes. And the spacecraft will send bunches of telemetry at the next contact. If the satellite is close enough, you can do all this in real time during the contacts, though you are still planning activities for when you cannot talk to the spacecraft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've used satcom links for TCP/IP (not to talk to the satellite, but through the satellite), and didn't have to use anything different, from the user point of view. I suppose the packets are encapsulated in something different from your wifi or ethernet cable at the lower layers, but at the TCP/IP layers, it's the same.</p>
<p>Remember that TCP/IP was conceived to be robust and able to recover from packet losses. Lost packets are resent, and it lowers your final throughput, but a properly sized link (antenna gain, tx/rx power and sensitivity) should minimize that.</p>
<p>For latency, there's no way to &quot;compensate&quot;. Gaming and other real time applications will suck, but there's no workaround for the speed of light.</p>
<p>The latency issue will be much better with the new generation of data satcoms, which will use non-geostationary lower orbit sats, but it still won't be like ground fiber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you take a look at the 7 layers of  OSI, you can see this in another perspective. The radio frequency part (wireless signal) of satellite communication is Layer 1. TCP/IP is Layer 3. As you go up in layers, the higher layer is just a payload to a lower layer. So you often hear, &quot;layer 3 rides on layer 2 and 1.&quot;</p>
<p>In essence, the protocols that you mentioned are all payloads of a layer 1 communications medium, so they ideally do not really have any awareness on how it gets transported from point A to B. I say ideally because your Layer 1 implementation still matters. For example, if you're using smoke signals as a Layer 1 medium to transmit TCP/IP packets, then you'd have to use trickery on the TCP/IP protocol to bypass its timeout settings and such because transmitting information via smoke would involve additional processing, which in turn translates to higher latency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
