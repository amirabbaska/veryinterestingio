		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For decades, the Russian-led Soviet Union was a huge threat to the US and the Western World. This belief is still strong.</p>
<p>Since Russia recovered from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia is actively working against the US-led World Order. The US and its allies believe in a unipolar world. The US as the strongest nation to lead the others and make everybody adopt representative liberal democracy, capitalism and free markets. For this, the US created and supported several international organisations like the UN, the IMF, etc.</p>
<p>Russia believes in a multi-polar world with several equal leaders. So they don't want the US to meddle in what Russia considers <em>her</em> corner of the world. Russia has little regard for Western rules like territorial integrity and has often acted militarily against its neighbours like Georgia or Ukraine. </p>
<p>This is the general animosity between them. Now for some current issues:</p>
<p>Some of Russia's neighbours are US allies (for example Estonia and Latvia), US politicians are concerned that Russia might act against them. This would either result in War with Russia, or the US abandoning its Allies which would seriously harm US influence in the World.</p>
<p>Also, Russia and the US have mutually exclusive aims in the Syrian Civil War. The US wants to remove Assad, Russia wants to keep him in power. The US accuses Russia of specifically bombing non-Islamist rebels and civilians, thus committing war crimes.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are current allegations and indications that Russia might have interfered in the last Presidential Election of the USA and might do the same in other Western elections.
There is also the whole mess of the ties to Russia of President Trump and members of his administration. Some US politicians are scared that Russia might have blackmailing material against President Trump, or even that he might be conspiring with them.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Russia is the main country defying the US right now and is alleged to have meddled in their elections.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are an undemocratic kleptocracy where a tiny number of really rich people own almost everything, control the media, and also have access to the second largest nuclear arsenal.  Putin wants to reunite the Soviet Union and because of economic sanctions, the economy is tanking and they fear the public will turn on them regardless of media control.  Thus it is critical that they have the sanctions lifted, especially because it affected the production of oil (their only real source of revenue) and consequently the ability to make sustained investments into the military.  To get the sanctions lifted they essentially started a cyber war involving groundbreaking use of misinformation, which affected the election in the US, UK, and now is being used in Germany and other places in western Europe.  Also very possibly they are working with US kleptocrats (rich people whose goal is to concentrate wealth into the hands of very few by pushing risk onto the public and rewards onto themselves) to entrench power through the use of controlled media and threats to democratic institutions - namely gerrymandering, voter suppression, and turning normal citizens against each other instead of the kleptocracy.  You will find that politicians who focus on wealth inequality are the ones most vocal about Russia and Trump, because in the end it is about cementing a world order where 1% of  people own 95% of the wealth, which is actually happening with the full support of the working poor thanks to Russia-like media manipulation and race-baiting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now, it's politically useful for Democrats to talk up Russia as a threat which is why we're hearing a lot about it right now.</p>
<p>More generally, Russia has historically been an adversary to US policy and the current administration wants to project their power in places like Ukraine and Syria.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in 2012, President Obama mocked Governor Romney for stating that Russia was a threat saying that, &quot;the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.&quot;  Four years later, talking about Russia as a threat is useful to Democrats given President Trump's positive comments on Russia and Putin and (alleged) Russian efforts against Clinton.  So, Russia is &quot;such a huge threat&quot; because it's politically useful.</p>
<p>I think that's why <strong>US politicians</strong> consider Russia such a huge threat right now.  Other people seem to have gone the route of answering &quot;Why is Russia such a huge threat&quot; which I think is a more interesting question than one where the answer is basically, &quot;politicians will always be doing things to advance themselves and attaching themselves to whatever is in the news now&quot;.</p>
<p>And there's plenty of good reading for that.  Russia is corrupt, it wants to be powerful even though the world has passed it by, it thinks the world should give it deference given its size and (former) military might, it has designs toward reclaiming some lost territory, and it wants to be a major player in the world that gets consulted on things.  But it's just not that important. . .unless it does something nutty.  So, it has the potential to go a bit nutty to try and regain some of its former glory.</p>
<p>I mean, the world has passed it by as China becomes important to the world, India becomes more important, Latin America gets better, the EU becomes important, etc.  What's Russia good for?  Oil and gas?  Only until greener energy starts replacing fossil fuels.  Russia's military might?  Waning.  The US, China, and Saudi Arabia outspend Russia and the UK, India, and France come close.</p>
<p>In some ways, Russia is this dying country that didn't change after the Cold War.  It's corrupt. Its exports are basically just raw materials like oil, gas, coal, aluminum, and iron.  It didn't invest in its future.  But it does have nukes, it does have oil and gas that the world is currently addicted to, and seemingly little to lose being a bit of a bully.</p>
<p>That's not a great, stable, happy mix.  Like, China isn't a threat because they like our money.  Yea, they can push a bit - especially over uninhabited islands where the death toll would be thousands of rocks!  More seriously, China certainly has ambitions and such, but they're growing nicely, benefiting a lot from trade, and see their economy strengthening by being part of the normal, stable world.  That makes a country only willing to go so far.  China has invested enough in its future that, ultimately, it isn't really threatening.  They'd rather invest in educating their citizens, buying US companies, selling Americans televisions and cell phones, etc.  China is <strong>way</strong> more likely to be threatening economically - like trying to keep Google below a certain marketshare in China or turning a blind eye to intellectual property infringement by their own firms.  And that can be a problem, but it doesn't really come with a huge body count.</p>
<p>Russia doesn't have that integration and path.  What's Russia's future?  Hoping that they can still sell oil and gas to the West in 2075?  A lack of a future combined with a feeling that the world should be giving you more isn't a stable mix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WALL OF TEXT INCOMING, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</p>
<p>First: Because the US doesn't know how powerful Russia is.</p>
<p>The &quot;election hack&quot; was just the newest in a long list of russian interference in international affairs in recent years. Russia seems to be VERY keen in its cyber warfare, and the US simply doesn't know HOW keen, but they are getting success after success while the NSA and CIA are repeatedly humiliated (Snowden, Wikileaks). Russia, by all means, doesn't come even near to the global superpower the USSR was in its prime, but the US doesn't know HOW powerful they are right now. Ukraine seems to indicate the Russian Army is experimenting with new strategies and heavy integration of drones and cyber attacks in warfare, even with their economy falling apart. Also, nukes. Loads of nukes.</p>
<p>Second: The cultural threat.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the USSR, the US worked to create an unipolar world where &quot;&quot;&quot;american values&quot;&quot;&quot; ruled international relations - representative democracy, arbitration of conflicts by international entities like the UN/EU, free trade, free movement of individuals, etc. Russia, for a lot of reasons (revanchism, nationalism) is throwing these rules to the wind. They just barreled into Georgia and Ukraine with little care for international law, and are repeteadly threatening Scandinavia and the Baltics. Russia is actively trying to convince the world the american model of international relations has failed, and it seems to be working. Trump, Le Pen, Erdogan, Farage... the populists are gaining power around the world, always with the same discourse: globalization has failed. Again, we don't know to wich extent Russia is behind this, but the damage is already showing with the cracks in the EU and OTAN. </p>
<p>Third: Russia is getting desperate.</p>
<p>The Russian economy is falling apart with the sanctions and collapsing prices of gas and oil. They are losing the little economical and political weight they had, and since russian government almost literally belongs to a circle of corrupt gas and oil magnates, this is reflecting directly in their pockets. So nationalism is on the rise, Putin is stepping up its anti-western rhetoric and they are pouring even more money on the military. When all you have is a hammer and all that. This could end VERY badly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Due to the fact that they are they are still the 'de-facto' USSR they have the ability to reignite old ties and alliances they had before the collapse in terms of influence in certain parts of the world, which the US doesn't want. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every studio does something different from each other, and so it seems most answers will be slightly different from each other.</p>
<p>In general, the most important thing to know is that things will and do get broken. Ideally, those things are then fixed before it impacts others much.</p>
<p>I will step through each individual piece that's gone through for at least where I work (which is specifically with Video Games). This will likely be a very very long post, so I'll try to simplify each piece down for the ELI5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Main Steps</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Space.</strong> Room to work in. When there's a lot of code to work with, it's much easier for programmers to work on parts of the code where other programmers aren't touching it as often. If you think of programmers in a large house both building the house and building things in the house, the larger the house is then the easier it is to have a couple rooms to yourself or a small group of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation.</strong> Rooms try to stay mostly to themselves. You don't want to have your ceiling staying up because you put a log wedged into the cabinet in the next room. Especially if programmers work only on a single room at a time, they might not realize the random log in <em>their</em> room is important and that they shouldn't move the cabinet. It's better to build supports in your room for your ceiling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modularity.</strong> You don't always know what the rooms next to your room might be, or if they might need to be replaced. So code makes things modular to deal with this, saying &quot;there are 3 doors. They are these sizes and at these locations&quot;. Where those doors go to can change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compiler</strong> (this one will be more specific and definitely not shared by all codebases). Strangely, this massive house everyone is working on only <em>describes</em> the house. Which is why modularity (3) or isolation (2) is so important. You can't always easily see what your room will actually touch until the whole house comes together. There's this thing called a compiler that actually takes all the descriptions of room and builds a house out of it. The compiler will complain when things don't quite connect where they should, or where the modularity says something is wrong, because the compiler can't finish it's job. (Jargon note: There are actually a few pieces in this - such as the linker or preprocessor - and the compiler is just one of these pieces. Programmers a lot of times just group them all together to save time when talking.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unit tests.</strong> There's a lot of pieces that require very very specific things that it must do. To keep running with our house analogy, this may be to say that a specific breaker switch controls the electricity to only a few specific rooms in the house. Or that a faucet always gives the same heat when turned on to the same angle each time. In code, this is usually complicated functions that bare most of this wait. Instead of having to check all of these things that are easy to miss, unit tests are made that checks these things for you. They're just more code that you say &quot;I expect this to always do these things when this happens to it. Check that for me every time I use the compiler.&quot; And they do. Thank you unit tests. In my experience though, unit tests can't cover even a tiny bit of the range of inputs a video game has possible, so in our case these aren't good enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal Check.</strong> After the compiler puts everything together, each programmer can walk through the house themself and just check if everything seems to be in place, and then specifically check out the room they were working on and see if it's hooked up correctly for themselves. A lot of times, programmers will make their own tools to let them cheat around their room to make this type of check faster. For games, let's say you're working on a new way to purchase items, you might give yourself a tool that let's you freely make money. That kind of thing. (There's more code to prevent these tools from going out to everyone)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional Tests.</strong> Unit tests (5) like to check very small pieces, but a large part of the house can be checked all at once with something called functional tests. Functional tests look at how something should work in general, rather the specifics. In our house, they could ensure things like... starting from the front door, can you still eventually make it into the attic? This helps for cases where someone might remove a door somewhere, for their own good reasons, but fail to see the big picture somewhere else. These also occur automatically, but in our code base it's usually after the programmer has committed the code - so that the programmer doesn't have to wait on these tests (they can take awhile).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>QA - Quality Assurance.</strong> There's a large group of people who are really good are doing all these different types of checks themselves as well, predicting what types of changes might break what, or even being very clever at breaking the code in ways nobody else thought to try. These are QA. Tests (like unit tests and functional tests) are only as good as a programmer can predict the program might work, but breaking something can be more extensive a job than what the programmer might consider. In those cases, QA is specialized in finding out where other problems might lie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Pipeline.</strong> Hinted with the fuctional tests bit, there's computers specially setup to do the compiler (4), unit tests (5), and functional tests (7) all on their own. A lot of people can be changing a large part of the house at once and need to have their changes all at similar times. This can create times where personal checks and running your own compiler doesn't catch problems that might arise from two different changes not liking each other. Build machines do the steps above with everyone's code (who put their code in) to provide their own versions of the checks.</p>
<p>a. <strong>Build Pipeline - Multiple Operating Systems.</strong> This is a special note for game dev. Operating systems, like Windows XP, Windows 7, OSX 10.6, etc. can all be quite different from each other. Thing of these like broad locations your house can be built on, with the more different the operating system the more different the location. If you're constantly checking if your house might work in a forest, there might not be something you noticed when your house is on a tall barren mountain. Or underwater. Operating systems get very different. The &quot;big ones&quot; should be checked yourself, but build machines and QA (Compatability) can help to fill in the gaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CI - Continuous Integration.</strong> (Blah that term sounds technical). CI is something of a philosophy that some studios have and a way of setting up the build pipeline (9). CI is the idea that, two sets of eyes is better than one set, and this can only get better from there. When you put code in the shared place so that a build pipeline can use it, it's <em>possible</em> that can be one of many places with many different build pipelines. Historically, this is how a lot of code bases worked, you would have teams with their own build pipelines who would then eventually do a large push of all of the changes they did in the last few months (or years) from their builds to the big central build. This was called &quot;integration&quot;. CI just says &quot;Hey everyone, just put all your stuff in the central spot and figure out some other way to hide it.&quot;. This means that while everyone is walking through their spots in the house, they might be more likely to see other problems for someone else more often. More eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Playtests.</strong> (Game dev specific, kinnnnd of. Just called different things elsewhere.) If you're building a fun house, play in that fun house to make sure it's actually fun and working the way it should be - and that no random spike it sticking out under a trampoline. It's better for you to get hurt than your players. Game programmers make sure to play where they build.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Large Testing Environments.</strong> Beta testing. Similar to CI (10)'s mentality of &quot;the more eyes, the better&quot;, programmers try to get lots of different potential home owners to try out their house for awhile just to get more eyes. And, more importantly, more environments - locations - where the house could be. Again, this provides more opportunity for something bad to occur and for someone to see it and report it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large-team software stuff sucks unless you have a strong leader delegating well-communicated and specific tasks.</p>
<p>In software, abstraction is important. In other words, for two parts of a program to work together, they just have to know how to talk to each other - they <em>don't</em> have to know how the other part actually works internally. In other words, the two parts have to know how to &quot;interface&quot; with each other.</p>
<p>Imagine I had a method/function called 'add' that would accept two numbers and add them together. To call the function, id say add(3, 5) and the result would be 8. I have no clue how it adds those two numbers, and quite frankly I don't really care as long as it works.</p>
<p>So if I create the basic (theoretical) design of the software, I can design all of the interfaces (the function names, the parameters and their types, and what type of item the function returns as a result) and hand out chunks of the program for people to code. If you write my add() function, you can make it work internally however you want as long as you follow the requirements I gave you (that it accepts two integers, and returns the sum of the two integers). And that way I can assign Tim another part of the code that will constantly use your add() function. He will write his code assuming that your add() function will work. Then, everyone puts the code together and tests it. It won't work because that's how life goes. Fix the errors one by one with tons of testing in between. </p>
<p>Of course, this is definitely overly simplified, but hopefully it gives you a small hint. The other important part is extreme communication and frequent meetings. Incremental deadlines are helpful, but are hardly met. Lastly, it's good to have a leader supervise everyone else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you change the contract you (potentially) need to update everything that uses that contract.</p>
<p>When ordering a pizza you don't need to worry that you might not know how anymore because they changed how their ovens work. So long as the contract remains the same you don't need to relearn how to order a pizza. If they changed the contract, like for example, no longer accepting cash, then you would need to make changes yourself.</p>
<p>Code needs to be written in understandable components or it gets very messy very fast. I've worked with code like that and it takes ten times the brain power and time to get anything done. When code is broken down into manageable pieces with a single purpose it's beautiful. It doesn't matter how big the total software is if it's just a bunch of tiny parts. When working on something you should only need to know how that one tiny part has to work. It's as if the software only consists of that tiny part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things: </p>
<p>First, evolutionary psychologists think of pain as having two functions. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Preventing immediate damage</strong>. If you keep walking on your broken leg, you will do more permanent damage to it. Pain discourages you from moving now. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Teaching</strong>. Some painful events do not prevent further damage, but teach you to avoid similar situations in the future. Gastrointestinal pain does not help you avoid immediate damage (for the most part), but the memory of the pain will stop you from eating that poisonous mushroom again. </li>
</ol>
<p>So, contrary to how the question is formulated, the function of pain is not to indicate damage.</p>
<p>Second, &quot;damage&quot; here needs to be understood evolutionarily. Cheesecake probably does the average overweight person damage to their body, but it is extremely pleasurable. </p>
<p>&quot;Damage&quot; to the body are those changes to the body that would've made that conspecific (specific individual organism) less fit in its environment of evolutionary adaptiveness (the environment in which it evolved its current form). Scratching off dead skin cells wouldn't have made us less fit, whereas breaking an arm and moving it before it healed would have. So scratching isn't painful, just like cheesecake isn't painful, whereas moving a broken arm is painful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water effectively acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticizer" target="_blank">platicizer</a> for wood and materials derived from wood. In other words, it increases the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_(physics\)" target="_blank">plasticity</a> of the wood, or the property to deform (e.g. bend) in a non-reversible way. The way water does this is that water molecules get in between the strands of cellulose polymer and the lignin matrix making up the wood. Normally these polymers are held together by strong hydrogen bonds so they can't easily slip past each other. However, the water helps to break these bonds, instead creating new ones with itself. As a result, the material becomes much more flexible. On top of that, if you raise the temperature you can increase the flexibility yet further. As an aside, this is exactly the same reason why you add water to clothing when ironing it. It's much easier to reshape the fabric when wet then when it is dry. Once the fabric cools down and dries this new shape is then locked in.</p>
<p>For more information, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00226-015-0777-x" target="_blank">here is an article on the topic.</a></p>

The process (as I understand it from the explanation I got) is to supersaturate the material and then compress it perpendicular to the grain (as though attempting to shorten the board) with extreme pressure while at the same time providing containment of the piece to prevent splitting. The result is basically like a wet noodle. You can literally tie it into a knot. Once it has been dried it maintains the shape similar to other wood bending techniques. The guy who told me about this had developed the technique and said it effectively turns the cells into something like an accordion. </p>

<p>As the fiber in wood absorb water they swell, becoming softer and separating from one another.  This makes it easier for them to slide past one another when the whole piece is flexed.</p>
<p>Not really a rule of thumb, though.  Different kinds of lumber do different things.  Steam and heat will accomplish the same thing as water in less time and often with less damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Pigmented birthmarks result from when there is an excess of skin pigment cells, the cells that give your skin colour, in one place. Examples of these would include moles, café au lait spots, and Mongolian spots.</p>
<p>Vascular birthmarks are from an increased amount of blood vessels in a given location. These are red, such as salmon patches and port-wine stains.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that the imperfections effectively act as a catalyst that reduces the activation energy needed to form the bubbles. As a result, nucleation (the first step of bubble formation) will happen much faster in those regions than in the bulk of the liquid.</p>
<p>To get a more complete answer, we have to consider the energies involved in bubble formation. Fist of all bubbles form spontaneously. That means that there is a negative Gibbs energy Gv associated with the process. Moreover, this energy will scale as the volume of the bubble, which is why I labelled it Gv. However as the bubble first starts forming (in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation" target="_blank">nucleation</a>), the process is not energetically favorable. The reason is that on top of the volumetric Gibbs energy, there is also an interfacial Gibbs energy. (Gi) This second factor is due to the fact that by creating a bubble you are preventing the surrounding water molecules from being stabilized by other water molecules. As a result, the surface tension wants to squeeze the bubble out. </p>
<p>As a result, you have to competing energy contributions, the volumentric (Gv) and surface (Gi) terms. Now as you increase the size of the bubble, Gv eventually wins out <a href="http://i.imgur.com/53VlsT5.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. But in order to get to that regime, bubbles must first get enough energy to grow past the hump were energy needs to be added. This hump is called the activation energy, denoted as G^* in the diagram. In the case of the bulk solution, this activation energy can be very high. As a result, bubbles can form so slowly that you basically never see them. This process is called <strong>homogeneous nucleation.</strong> </p>
<p>However, near surfaces or other imperfections, the interfacial energy can be much lower. The umbrella term for this process is <strong>heterogeneous nucleation</strong>. There are two main mechanism for how this process may play out:</p>
<ol>
<li>There can be solid surfaces or grooves that are in contact with the bulk liquid. At these points <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JhKFs2r.png" target="_blank">gas can bind to the surfaces and grow into small nuclei.</a> Because the area of the bubble in contact with the water is smaller, the interfacial energy is smaller. Eventually the bubble can grow past a critical size, detach through the water and zip to the surface.</li>
<li>There can exist pores that are already partially filled with gas, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XVOXtp8.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. Additional gas can then seep in, creating a larger pocket of gas. This gas can then leave the pore as a bubble and escape. The process can then start all over again.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key point in all cases, nucleation will happen in those regions much faster, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Nucleation_finger.jpg/640px-Nucleation_finger.jpg" target="_blank">which is why you see so many bubbles there.</a></p>
<p>edit: I expanded my answer a bit to include specific mechanisms of heterogeneous nucleation</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those imperfections act as nucleation sites. In your example they help with the physical separation of the gas (carbon dioxide) from liquid (water). When you open the bottle some of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the water wants to leave (pressure change) and go into the air but it can't because the individual CO2 molecules cannot overcome the viscosity of the water. The nucleation site provides a place for CO2 molecules to aggregate and form bubbles capable of breaking the hydrogen bonds of the water molecules. Without the imperfections there is nowhere for the CO2 molecules to coalesce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever bubbles do form randomly within a liquid, they'll quickly travel to the surface and pop. Along the surface of the glass, there's more possibilities for nucleation, and there's also somewhere for the bubble to stick and grow. So you get a survivorship effect as well.</p>
<p>Beer with a head demonstrates a variation on this behaviour. You get far fewer bubbles on the insides of the glass, the way you do with cola, and the bubbles that do form throughout the beer collect together in the beer's head and last long enough to make a significant layer of bubbles. The bubbles in ale heads last longer than lager bubbles and much longer than watery old cola-bubbles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You can purchase cheaper materials and components, and make a tv that will work just as well as one built with much more expensive parts. But a cheap tv sacrifices reliability, lifetime, and predictability in quality standards. And two tv's built right next to each other can have unpredictable quality issues, like dead pixels. So they test the tv's, and the ones that are marginal are either rebranded and sold for a lower price, have features disabled and are sold as a lower model, or saved for events like black Friday. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people have mentioned the definite advantages but there can also be downsides to technology maturing. As prices come down on established technology some companies have to cut corners to remain profitable. This can lead to subtle changes in the quality of materials used in a product.</p>
<p>As the machines that make the products age they also become less accurate and harder to maintain in top condition. The higher end manufacturers will change their machines every X years, these machines are then either moved to production facilities in lower wage countries, that often have less well trained/experienced staff, or sell them to lower tier manufactures, also often in lower wage countries. </p>
<p>This can result in a price drop for consumers but also in products with a worse fit/finish and a drop in overall quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;720p, 32 inches&quot; describe the display panel, and only vaguely. The panel has other properties like how fast the pixels can change colors, color accuracy, expected life time, and tons of other junk. BUT there are other components inside the tv such as a power supply, image processor, some more things, and then the circuit boards that actually run and control things.</p>
<p>Those different components have to be designed by engineers. A bad design could take a quality screen and not use it to its full potential, possibly burn it out faster, or have terrible energy efficiency. A good group of engineers can design a tv that uses a cheap screen and makes the most of its capabilities, makes the tv easier to use, and make it last a really long time. Those beast mode engineers don't come cheap.</p>
<p>Also, those components in the tv are made up of small pieces (capacitors, transistors, and on and on...). These pieces come in different qualities and tolerance ratings. If you pay more money for these pieces then you get longer lasting parts, have less variation in how well they operate, and less chance of getting a bad part.</p>
<p>Some other things you're paying extra for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the processor used in the tv</li>
<li>strong construction</li>
<li>visual design (people pay for beauty)</li>
<li>the quality of programming (a lot of those fancy image-enhancing features are done by a processor that runs code someone had to write. Better code = better quality)</li>
<li>to be cool like everyone else, since the marketing professionals tell you that.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple things that go into being a superstar in any field. The superstar is someone who can combine all these things. Their trainers will often have specific skills in one particular area but not the whole package. Moreover they will have skills that make them a good trainer that is not necessary for being a superstar. </p>
<p>I'll give you an example from MMA. Even though they have a primary skill A MMA fighter needs to have training in a wide variety of disciplines to compete. Moreover, the MMA fighter doesn't need to be the best in the world at any one particular thing. They may have a boxing trainer, a judo trainer, a jiu jitsu trainer in addition to a strength and consitioning trainer. Each of these people may have never been in a MMA fight but they understand that component very well. </p>
<p>A trainer may also be someone who understood one part of a game very well but didn't have other gifts that allowed them to compete. Maybe they got injured or didn't have the requisite size or athleticism. Example: Kevin Long is the Mets hitting coach even though never played in the major leagues. He was by all accounts a good hitter in the minor leagues but he injured his wrist and decided to retire. Of people good at hitting he seems to be really good at coaching other players. People who work with him seem to all praise his coaching ability. Often people who were superstars make horrible managers because they had all the natural talents and don't know how to connect with any player or competitor who didn't. </p>
<p>I'll give you one last example from my life. I taught myself computer programming and computer science and I'm a software engineer for a living. I studied math in college (for reasons) and I was decent at it but decided not to go to grad school for math. I would never ever be a superstar in either field. It I'm waaaay better at computer programming than I am at math. I'm a bunch better teacher at math than computer science. I couldn't even tell you how I learned how to code, i just got a book and did it at 9 years old. I can absolutely guide you through learning calculus, set theory, linear algebra and a few other fields of math. If you need someone to teach Calculus I'm not a bad choice because it didn't come naturally to me at 9 the way programming did. On the other hand I know plenty of peofessors who studied way more math than I did who can't teach for shit. They are brilliant, they know the material but they don't know what to do when someone doesn't get something as simple as Calculus without trying. </p>
<p>The only superstar I would reliably say should teach Calculus (though I imagine there are others) is a superstar in physics, Richard Feynman. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Allot of times when your naturally skilled at something you don't need to use proper technique since your raw skill is so much better then your average persons skill. When you are the average person you are forced to learn the techniques at a much higher level to compensate for your lack of ability compared to more skilled competitors. This lets you have a much more advanced understanding of the technique. The talented person who relied on raw skill to win at lower levels of competition may start to struggle as the competition reaches higher levels as the competitors now all either have better techniques or also have more raw talent.
This is where a good coach can really help make a star with allot of raw talent into one of the best in the world by helping him improve with his more advanced understanding and knowledge. </p>
<p>Lets take for example Mike Tyson in boxing. Some good qualities to have in boxing include Punching power Stamina Speed Resilience. The trainers job is not to be better then Mike at those thing but to teach him how to use those qualities better and get even better at the things he excels like teaching him better footwork to allow him to use his power and speed more often.
The trainer will also analyze and try to correct holes in his game. For example maybe Tyson always circles to the right after throwing a jab which leaves him open to counters. The coach correct that making him get hit less often.
The trainer can also show him subtle things like foot position or slight deviation in hand movement that will make him punch even harder and faster.
Another aspect the trainer can help the athlete with is to keep him focused on his training diet lifestyle etc.</p>
<p>Once the athlete realizes how many times the trainer is right and the benefits the trainer has to his game and how much better he is performing after following their advice they will put their trust into them and start obeying listening to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the ability to coach is different than the ability to perform at a high athletic level.  </p>
<p>Being a top athlete, first and foremost, requires you to win the genetic lottery and have natural athletic talent.  There are plenty of people who were just as good as top stars and worked just as hard, but they were a few inches too short, a few steps too slow, or got hurt at the wrong time.  They fact they didn't make it as big doesn't mean they know less.</p>
<p>In fact, superstars have a pretty poor track record as coaches.  When you solved most of your problems by being bigger and stronger and faster than everyone else, you don't have much to offer the average player.  It is the player who had to make the most of their lesser talents who understand the game well enough to be coaches.  If you look at the NFL, there aren't many great QBs in the coaching ranks...there are a whole lot of backups, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because they didn't have the ability doesn't mean they didn't have the mind for it. It's the same reason many MLB managers were backup catchers and NFL head coaches were backup QBs. They learned the sport but never had the skill set to match their mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being good at something doesn't mean you understand why you are good at it or what you can do to get better at it. That's what coaches and trainers are for. They don't personally need to be able to perform at a high level to have knowledge of what is required to do so.</p>
<p>To give a sports example, let's say you can suddenly throw a baseball 90 mph. That's great but how do you do it in a way that you can control where the ball goes? How do you throw even faster? You need coaches and trainers to tell you and they can obtain that knowledge independent of actually throwing a ball themselves.</p>
<p>Now certainly some athletes are more self-aware than others of what they are doing or knowledgeable about biomechanics and physiology but even then there are going to be specialists (coaches and trainers) who know more or can provide a different perspective (since there is more than one way to be successful at an athletic activity).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
