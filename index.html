Because it is a little bit higher than the recommended dose, and certainly more than added fluoride content in city water supplies, our local health unit has recommended that children in our community do not use toothpaste with fluoride, to prevent fluorosis. It is likely that fluoride free toothpaste is intended for communities like ours.</p>

<p>Some people have an intolerance to fluoride that can present itself in mouth ulcers. Not uncommon, it seems to run in my family and I'm aware of a couple of friends that have the same issues. Not a big deal, doesn't cause any major harm, just uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Because some people need it, the product pops up in the market. People see it and either assume it has health benefits or has read something somewhere that says it's bad for you. So the market for it increases and major brands pick it up to increase sales. </p>
<p>Simple as that really. If you can use fluoride toothpaste then you probably should. I hear it's better for you. But if you have frequent mouth ulcers then try brushing with fluoride-free toothpaste and see if it makes a difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The social reason: Some people think the government makes us consume fluoride in toothpaste and water to make the general population easier to manipulate and control. The argument behind this idea varies but what I've seen most is that Hitler added fluoride to German water right before the war supposedly to control the population. Therefore fluoride bad because Hitler's used it. </p>

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sir_Aleister" target="_blank">Sir_Aleister</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons I see. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The same station are used for long-distance/international train and regional/suburban train.  You do not want to deal with security checkpoints in your daily commute. You could imagine putting checkpoints only on long-distance train, but then why not the regional/suburban trains ? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A train can in a few minutes go to a <em>safe</em> position. Simply hit the breaks, usually the driving system implies a <em>dead man switch</em> and if the driver stop to hold it train will automatically send alarm to the regulation and stop.   Even high-speed-trains pass trough backup station where they can stop if anything goes wrong (it's always easier to have an ambulance and the police coming to a station than having them walking 500m trough a muddy field. )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't have to deal with the difference of pressure, a bomb exploding in a train will cause serious damages an dozen of deads for sure but it won't fully destroy the train and most of the passenger will leave the train on their feet. The same in a plane and even a small blast will destroy the plane due to the difference of pressure (as punching a balloon with a niddle) killing everybody on-board. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, in the commercial battle rail vs air. The fact that you can arrive at the station 5 minutes before your train, be on the platform 2 minutes later and catch your train on time is a serious asset that train companies will try to keep. </p>
</li>
<li>(At least in Europe, I saw this in France/Germany/Belgium). For international train it's not that uncommon to see the border police/custom patrolling the train, checking passengers ids and having their dog smelling the bags (especially in the train from Asterdam to Paris). In a train with 500 persons on board it's easy to fit 2 policemen and their dog inside. They don't even need a seat. </li>
</ul>
<p>That said, after the failed attack in a Train between Brussels and Paris, I started to see metal detector and luggage-scanner for train too.  I already told reddit the day I thought they where getting crazy on terrorism security until I saw the head of the European and his bodygards leaving the same train. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the big reasons is hijacking. If you hijack a plane you can go anywhere in the world you want as long as you have enough fuel onboard. With a train you can not choose your destinations. You go where the rails go. Planes are also really fast compared to trains.</p>
<p>One other reason to hijack a plane is to use it as ammunition. A train obviously can not be used in such way. You can go at full speed and try to derail the train but that's it. You can't drive it into certain building. But you can fly a plane everywhere or AT anything.</p>
<p>Other thing to remember is that train is much harder to hijack and control. A train can be really really long and have many passenger wagons. All it takes is one person to pull the emergency brake and the train stops. After that the doors open and everybody can run off. At most you are looking at a hostage situation in the middle of the forest. Pretty pointless hijacking unless hostage situation is the exact thing you want. For political reasons this could be an option.</p>
<p>So trains are simply far less useful for any kind of reason whereas planes are excellent for the exact same reasons. A train at most has to deal with bomb threats which in reality is not really good option for the bomber. If you want to inflict mass damages train is not good target. As such it is hard to justify spending tons of money on train security when there is no point even for anyone to make any kind of attack using a train as a target or tool for causing damage. </p>
<p>Planes also are very expensive and even if you don't lose the plane the downtime is super expensive if a hostage situation occurs for example. If you lose the plane and the passengers then it is a massive pr issue for you as a corporation. If a bomb attack happens in train you don't lose the whole train. Not only is the train and the wagons really robust but any kind of damage is limited only to the wagon where the bomb went off and the train wagons that derailed. Train tracks themselves can be fixed relatively quickly unless we are talking about really really big bombs.</p>
<p>tl:dr. Trains are just really poor targets. Planes on the other hand is the best kind of target you can imagine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

At the other end they didn't ask her for it when getting off, or back on to go home.  </p>
<p>They asked for it on return to england and she told them she thinks she left it at home, so they just let her go though anyway.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you stall an engine by overloading it you stop the rotation of the crank, stopping the pistons from moving up and down and stopping the sequence of events that leads to more combustion cycles. Even in modern e.f.i. Engines there is sensors tell the injectors when to fire. There won't just keep shooting fuel into a cylinder that isn't cycling anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've powered out diesel tractors before when a grade gets unexpectedly steep for the load. They will try to pull right to the very last, and as the RPM drops the governor opens up, injecting the maximum amount of fuel. However, when even a full charge of diesel doesn't develop enough power to accelerate the load, the motor starts slowing down.</p>
<p>As long as the crank keeps turning fast enough to compress and ignite the diesel, it will fire and keep turning over. If we are talking about an old air breathing diesel, this can be a very low speed. Black smoke will puff from the exhaust in distinct clouds as each cylinder fires, with a &quot;poof poof poof&quot; sound reminiscent of an old steam train. As the motor slows, it falls further out of the powerband and develops less and less torque.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the motor is going too slow, and the heat of compression is not enough to ignite the diesel anymore. This is when it comes to a sudden stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an overloaded engine, the explosion still occur normally. The explosion cause the mixture to heat up, which cause an increase in pressure. This force the piston down. When the engine is overloaded, that pressure just can't push enought on the piston. Then the gas start to cool and the pressure drop, thru press less against the piston. All that energy that would have been used to push on the piston had nowhere to go, part of it will go in the cylinder walls, which will be cooled by the cooling system, air on small engine, liquid on bigger ones. This excess of heat can also cause the engine to overheat. The extra pressure also cause lots of stress on the engine.</p>
<p>Normally the explosion take time to spread inside the mixture, which spread the power stroke over a wider motion range of the piston, helping to reduce the force applied, while giving out more of the usable energy. By overloading the engine, the power stroke ends up in a more limited portion of the stroke and you also lose efficiency, thru less power out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can covalently bond with up to 4 other atoms, and it forms reasonably strong bonds with itself as well as with Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and a few others.</p>
<p>Carbon can serve as the &quot;backbone&quot; for constructing an effectively infinite variety of complex chemically active molecules. And because of that variety it presents the possibility for a nearly infinite variety of carbon based molecules with different chemical properties.</p>
<p>To take some examples from biology: you can have sugars which are basically cyclo-esters (a carbon chain that is connected back to itself but with an oxygen atom in the chain) with hydroxyl groups attached to every carbon atom in the chain (a sort of &quot;super&quot; alcohol). Sugars are polar molecules, they dissolve easily in water. They're remarkably good for storing energy because you can basically just split it in half into two pyruvate molecules and get free energy. But if you link a bunch of sugars together you can produce cellulose, which has very different properties from sugar. If you modify the sugars slightly by adding an amide group and form those into a polymer you can create chitin (the material of the exoskeletons of crustaceans, insects, etc.) which has very different properties compared to both glucose and wood, though it is closely chemically related.</p>
<p>Alkanes are long chains of carbon atoms each linked to two other carbon atoms and (usually) two hydrogen atoms. Fats are made out of long alkane chains bonded to a carboxyllic acid group and then sometimes attached to something else (like glycerin or a phosphate group in the case of phospholipids). An ordinary fat is extremely non-polar, so it doesn't dissolve in water, phospholipids have a polar end and a non-polar tail so they form into bilayers serving as cell membranes, for example. Proteins are made out of strings of carbon based molecules that start out as amino-acids (a carboxyl group with an amine group on the next carbon over) which enables the formation of amide bonds. The backbone of a protein's peptide chain is a series of [NH] [CH-R] [CO] [NH] [CH-R] [CO] (and so on), with different R groups corresponding to different amino-acids. Without the N or O atoms the peptide chain wouldn't be feasible, but without carbon it would not work at all, and the R groups are also carbon based. That basic structure makes it possible to create a huge array of micro-polymers (proteins) that can have an enormous array of different physical and chemical properties ranging from something as &quot;simple&quot; as a structural protein of hair to something as complex as a component of an electron transport chain designed to serve as a component in the machinery of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>In short, the variety of molecules that can be created with carbon based chemistry and the enormous span of different properties those molecules can have is what makes that chemistry so deep and interesting. It's particularly suited to use in the field of nanoscopic molecular machinery, which serves as the foundation for all life as we know it, but even that is only a fraction of what's possible with organic chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of stuff!</p>
<p>Most people mentioned the 4 bonds, and at least one mentioned that its the smallest element that can make 4. But consider that it's also the smallest element to make more than 2 bonds, and its also the smallest element to make more than 1 covalent bond.</p>
<p>Why is &quot;multiple bonds&quot; an important concept? </p>
<p>Because we exist and move about in 3 geometric dimensions! Imagine you have one atom of Hydrogen, what relative space does it occupy? A point. Now that Hydrogen covalently bonds to satisfy its outer shell requirements and makes a Hydrogen molecule. What relative space does it occupy? A line. Oxygen will bond with two hydrogens, the angle provided by these bonds will allow for a plane (2 dimensions). But, A single molecule containing Carbon can make enough bonds to occupy all three dimensions in space.</p>
<p>Why is being the smallest element important?</p>
<p>Because everything that is; has resulted from an initial state of free floating protons, electrons, and neutrons (shortly after the big bang). </p>
<p>The easiest element and Isotope to synthesize is Hydrogen: A free proton needs to capture a free electron to create an electron shell orbital. This is highly likely due to the attractive force of different charges in electromagnetism. After that the next easiest isotope to create is deuterium. A Hydrogen nucleus (proton) absorbs a neutron (which is not affected by electromagnetism). After that its Tritium: Deuterium absorbs a Neutron. </p>
<p>Then the next most likely thing to happen is that Tritium absorbs another neutron. When that happens, one of the neutrons changes its &quot;spin&quot; and becomes a Proton. A Beta particle is emitted (with negative charge) and a charged helium atom is produced (This method of Helium synthesis is far more likely to happen than a Proton nucleus absorbing another proton due to electromagnetism repulsion factors). The charged helium will then rapidly acquire another electron to form a neutral Helium atom.</p>
<p>This method of synthesis will continue on down the line, making the smaller elements much more likely to be synthesized than their larger counterparts. That means..... There is way more Carbon than say Silicon which makes it more LIKELY to be used in a system.</p>
<p>Carbon also has an equal number of &quot;extra&quot; electrons from the next lower electron shell (S1) as it does &quot;missing&quot; electrons from its next higher full electron shell (S2, P2). This means that not only is it incredibly electroneutral, but it can be altered equally to the left and right by bonding it with a more electronegative (which will steal electron density) or electropositive (which will donate electron density) functional group.</p>
<p>This means carbons can function as neutral, partially positive, AND partially negative. That means it can make LOTS of different bonds with lots of different types of elements and functional groups. It ALSO means that it can bond well to itself while still leaving room for other bonds to be made. For instance an N2 gas bond will have a triple bond, but won't readily bond again (or react which is why it is considered largely inert). That makes it not so great in creating longer chains. O2 gas, and F2 gas are much the same in this respect. But carbon will use it's partially positive nature to form a third or 4th bond with a partially negative atom (like a nitrogen, oxygen, or hydrogen).</p>
<p>Those Carbon-Nitrogen, Carbon-Oxygen, and Carbon-Hydrogen Bonds are literally what make nitrogenous bases, monosaccharides, and amino acids possible. Further, they facilitate those monomer units to polymerize into more &quot;living units&quot; (DNA, Proteins, Polysaccharides, ect.).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon is the smallest element that makes four bonds. </p>
<p>Larger elements hold onto their electrons less because of their size, and this makes them more metallic. Once you start acting metally you  get kinda pigeonholed into making quite metal-like bonds which are far less vared and far less able to be fine tuned and specialised than covalent bonding networks like non-metals can do. If you can covalently bond you can form a variety of patterns in the bonding network that make different substances - different types of lipids, inorganic crap, sugars and stuff if you throw oxygen in... you know. Variety. Different properties.</p>
<p>But metallic bonding is so blurry and non-speciifc you lose that ability to differentiate materials a bit. They're all pretty samey the more metallic you get. So carbon being the least metallic and most common is the best one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Carbon, in its native state, has six electrons that are contained in 2 orbital types: s and p. The s orbital is closest to the nucleus and has two electrons that the atom really likes to hold on to. The p orbital, or more specifically orbitals, can exist in three different orientations along perpendicular axis. The electrons in these orbitals aren't held as tightly as those in the s orbital and are able to more freely bond with other atoms that have available electrons in the correct orbital orientation. It is also the p orbitals that are responsible for double and triple bonds in alkenes and alkynes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Warfarin and other drugs are metabolized (broken down) into active or inactive compounds by enzymes in your liver. Grapefruit and other foods contain substances that can inhibit the activity of these enzymes, stopping the metabolism of these drugs. It can either lead to dangerously high levels of the drugs remaining in your system, or in the case of drugs that need to be broken down before they're active, dangerously low levels as the pro-drug you've taken isn't getting metabolized properly.
Also, it can result in other enzymes acting on drugs that aren't usually active or sufficiently active, resulting in the wrong kind of metabolite forming, which can be harmful as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical Student.   </p>
<p>Many drugs are metabolized by a certain enzyme called CYP P450 (or other enzymes that are also within the CYP family). Warfarin is one of these drugs. CYP P450 is basically what is breaking down warfarin in your body.  </p>
<p>So, anything that changes how CYP P450 does its job of breaking down warfarin will impact how warfarin works. Different drugs and other things (grapefruit juice, St. John's wort) either make CYP work better or inhibit CYP.   </p>
<p>If CYP is made to work better, for instance by St John's wort (commonly used for over the counter mild depression), then CYP will be breaking down warfarin super fast. The warfarin can be broken down so fast that it does not reach the level needed to actually thin the persons blood. To say again, by inducing CYP to breakdown warfarin better, warfarin cannot reach therapeutic levels.   </p>
<p>Another example is the CYP inhibitor cimetidine, which is commonly found in over the counter stomach medication (it's an antacid). Cimetidine is a CYP inhibitor, meaning CYP is not breaking down warfarin as well as usually. So, since warfarin is not being broken down, it causes warfarin to reach possibly toxic levels. Patients are at increased risk of bleeding.   </p>
<p>Overall, warfarin is not that great of drug, partially because it is dependent on CYP for breakdown and for a variety of other reasons. It also requires constant monitoring because it can be difficult to maintain within therapeutic range. Look up the list of things warfarin interacts with, and you'll be surprised that it's the most commonly prescribed drug thinner in the U.S.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

On the other hand, some drugs are actually precursors of the active chemical, so no enzyme = no active drug.</p>
<p>The cranberry interaction is contested, and I'm not aware of any study that's shown how it actually interferes with drugs.</p>

<p>But I think others in the thread have made warfarin sound worse than it is. I barely even think about it anymore. Every day I have the same amount of vitamin K by measuring out some broccoli on a food scale. This is second nature to me now and takes no extra time. (It's also helpful for counting calories w/ other foods.) I know (roughly) the translation of that amount of broccoli to other common vitamin K greens like lettuce, and I know the foods to completely avoid (kale is ridiculously high in K).</p>
<p>Blood draws are also not an issue. I have a home testing machine that involves just pricking your finger. You barely feel it and you get the results near-instantaneously. My levels have been A-OK for the last 5 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Imagine that there is an old-fashioned war, on a battlefield, with troops rushing towards each other and going at it with hammer, tongs, tooth &amp; claw.
The two sides would be the bacteria that are trying to multiply fast enough to bring troops to the front line, and their opponents are your neutrophil leucocytes, or white blood cells, that are getting to the front from the war factory of your bone marrow and making an amphibious landing via your bloodstream.
Both sides are dying in droves. Their dead bodies are what makes up pus, which is actually often sterile, oddly enough.
In the rectum/anus, the bacteria are fighting from a very small beachhead, uphill, and are vastly outnumbered. It's like the body has a tsunami of troops.

One of those in each set is a sex chromosome, that exists in X and Y versions. In females, both sex chromosomes are the X version, in males there is one X and one Y.</p>
<p>Sperm and egg cells, however, have only a single set of 23 chromosomes. Each one is more or less randomly chosen from one or the other of the two complete sets we have. Since females have two X chromosomes, all egg cells contain an X chromosome. But since males have an X and a Y chromosome, sperm cells have either an X or a Y, with a 50:50 mix.</p>
<p>So when sperm and egg combine to give two complete sets of chromosomes again, if the sperm cell contains an X, the offspring will have two X's and will be female. If the sperm cell contains a Y, the offspring will have an X and a Y and will be male.</p>
<p>tl'dr: sperm cells randomly get assigned an X or Y chromosome, and that ultimately determines the sex of the offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned Fisher's Principle, which describes why the sex ratio of most species is approximately 1:1 between males and females.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a situation where male births are less common than female births and, subsequently, there are fewer males than females in a population. This means a male in that population will have better mating prospects than a female because the male has are more mates to choose from. A male can, therefore, expect to have more offspring. That means if any set of parents in this population are genetically predisposed to produce more male than female offspring, they will then tend to have more of grandchildren born to them. Therefore, whatever male offspring favoring genes they have, will spread more quickly, and this leads to male births becoming more common in that population. As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, whatever advantage associated with producing males dies away. The same process would occur if the situation was reversed for the sexes. Therefore the 1:1 ratio is the evolutionarily stable strategy.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed &quot;less common&quot; to &quot;more common&quot; at the beginning so it made sense.
Edit 2: Changed &quot;more males&quot; to &quot;fewer males&quot;. I hope this makes sense now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we speak out loud there are 2 signals that the brain receives: the internal monologue and (assuming you are not deaf) auditory feedback from our speech output. This may be why we tend to think we are speaking louder than we actually are. Your brain also receives a 3rd feedback signal from the articulation/speech muscles. Your brain learns to associate all 3 signals with each other (thinking a word, with the sound of the word, and the movement of the speech muscles needed to speak the word).</p>
<p>So if you are thinking internally, your conscious brain will only receive the internal monologue signal.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned, the internal monologue is extremely closely related to the production of speech (this topic is known as &quot;embodiment&quot;). Studies show that when people read text silently, muscles used for speech are slightly activated. Also, speech production areas of the brain are activated when people speak internally. This all suggests thinking and speaking use similar neural pathways, and so the brain perceives thinking almost like speaking.</p>
<p>Note: this is referring to clear-cut intended internal speech. More ambiguous &quot;thought&quot; is going to be much more complex.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The act of speaking, the sound of speaking, and the internal thought which is correlated with the speech, are all highly associated with each other (They use similar brain pathways). So when you &quot;hear&quot; yourself think, it is probably because you are activating the same brain pathways used for normal speech and hearing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is marvelous. All that is you are the stories you know and or believe in. Many of these clips drop unused on the cutting room floor. Most, though, make up you and the stories you believe. Let us keep focused on your question and not include genetics.</p>
<p>With one exception, all of the words we think about do, though, include genetics as a foundation, OK, enough of that.</p>
<p>Let us consider, this the inner monologue never stops during our consciousness. There is always some kind of flurry of disjointed or coherent words flowing from where to where?</p>
<p>What we are hearing are words, sentences, paragraphs, and on we go. Yet, back to your question, keep in mind that you do not own this inner monologue, it happens. You don’t control it. In the brilliance of youth they are extremely vivid monologues. As you grow older you lose your acuity as you do your muscle fibers.</p>
<p>That should be enough of a scaffold to answer your question. The answer to your question lays in what is listening to this monologue. What is listening is your body and as your body is the instrument of the brain, it plays on and on. This music coincides with your emotions that start the process. The genius of the system is that as these musical vibrations flow in and around your whole body, so does your body, using the same instrument to emerge as your awareness of what you are thinking. We are music beings. Think of stones thrown into a little pond. Each of the waves created continue on the way uninterrupted so that when it encounters another wave they slip through each other.</p>
<p>I guess there was a little more scaffold required to understand the answer after all.</p>
<p>Yet, now we are ready!</p>
<p>The anatomical devices that form words out of these directed emotions is physical. Vibration enters the interpreter and from the interpreter, words emerge according to our culture and upbringing. Well, where does free will come into this? When do we control these thoughts?</p>
<p>We don’t. The words that flow through us are a river of words and like a river directs itself on a course of least resistance. There is no free will.</p>
<p>The watched is simultaneously the watcher. This watcher translates these codes into a learned language.</p>
<p>All this is possible because each of us has a personality and it is this that is the course of least resistance. What you say to yourself is heard using your ears, but in this case there is no outside vibrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>As far as water is concerned: There are three common substances in the universe that are liquid over a reasonable temperature range: water, ammonia, and methane. Water has the advantage of being slightly more common than ammonia or methane; in addition, it is liquid at higher temperatures, which means that life forming in water has more energy available to reproduce and move around. So we're not sure that extraterrestrial life forms in water, but water is probably a good guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haldane and Oparin suggested that the early ocean contained the necessary chemicals to form life. They theorized that the Earth's atmosphere was not oxygen rich but reducing which would have allowed catalytic reactions to happen allowing the formation of early building blocks that could form to give complex molecules which can lead to early life.</p>
<p>25 years later, Miller and Urey conducted an experiment that was similar to Oparin's and Haldane's theory. They combined hydrogen, methane, ammonia and boiling water in a flask to represent what Earth was like before life and used electric sparks to catalyze the reaction. The end result was the formation of amino acids and nucleic acids.</p>
<p>If Haldane and Oparin are correct, the nucleic acids would be the simple molecules giving way to amino acids and proteins. </p>
<p>A theory that is widely popular in biology is the idea that life came from RNA because it would fit Haldane's and Oparin's theory. Ribozymes are RNA complexes that can act as enzymes to catalyze RNA expression. If RNA formed, it can form ribozymes which can bind and express RNA. We know that DNA  is read and translated to RNA which is transcribed into amino acids which forms proteins which forms tertiary structures like muscles.</p>
<p>We also know that organisms do not need &quot;nice&quot; conditions to survive. We have already discovered bacteria that live in highly acidic conditions with little oxygen for respiration. </p>
<p>If we're asking about having similar conditions for sustaining life, the answer is yes. Different conditions can sustain life. </p>
<p>If we're asking if different conditions can give rise to life, who knows? If we're going with the RNA-first theory then maybe all we need is carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen along with some catalytic event to create nucleic acids and amino acids. </p>
