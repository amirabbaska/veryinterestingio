		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say the premise of the question is legitimate, but maybe just not posed in the most fitting manner, such as the ends of the emotional spectrum being exaggerated for point making but resulted in a loss of relativity. </p>
<p>Simplified, the question would read, &quot;Why does human memory tend to recall or focus on negative emotions over positive ones?&quot; This is not only a legitimate question, but an accurate assessment. </p>
<p>We are negative beings, by nature. Humans are fundamentally equipped with adaptation traits. This means constantly looking (even subconsciously) for ways to improve; never being truly and completely content. We always instinctively want to have more, go further, be better. In this, our brain finds ways to improve, which requires realizing and focusing on &quot;shortfalls&quot;. That carries over to emotion. Negative events or circumstances tend to be recognized earlier and more vividly; they stand out for evaluation, often times getting cataloged as a warning, then we adapt our emotional behavior. When positive things happen, we accept them, but rarely do our minds flare up in a &quot;from now on let's do THAT&quot; sense. Positives do not excite our animalistic instincts. They do not cause our evolutionary core to pay attention to them. So, our brains will forever put a highlight on each bad experience, and it will remain more significant in our subconscious than many successes throughout our lives, affecting our emotions, moods, mental states, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mania is the psychiatric opposite to depression, it both can last for a long time <em>and</em> cause massive havoc in people's lives even faster than most depression would. Where depressed people get stuck in the thoughts about negative consequences, manic people don't see consequences at all. If it's fun, it's done. (strongly simplified, it varies a lot) </p>
<p>Shopping sprees are very common. No regard for how much debt is amassed. Often people in mania aren't suspicious either, they happily give things away to anyone, or try the weirdest suggestions without any regard for their safety. </p>
<p>During a mania things are awesome, but like depressive episodes, they don't last for ever, and coming back to the smoking ruins of one's life is harsh.</p>
<p>That full throttle, unaware mania is relatively rare. Way more commonly people are aware that something is weird, but they have a hard time controlling themselves. Fighting to control urges to do things that will ultimately hurt someone is as hard as trying to get things done when the brain just doesn't want to cooperate at all. You know well what you <em>should</em> do, but the brain just won't let you.</p>
<p>That happy emotions don't last is a security measure, shared between many animals, not just humans. </p>
<p>The &quot;happy&quot; is just long enough to register as such, and then it's gone, motivating the critter to go and look for another thing that will cause the sensation.</p>
<p>If it lasted longer, life wouldn't work out very well. If the bliss lasted for ever, people would eat one bite of cake and then starve because there's no urge to repeat the experience. Critters would be easy prey if sex left them high for hours. </p>
<p>Positive emotions create strong motivation. The memory of that tree with the delicious fruit last year will be a strong enough lure, to search for it again this year, see if the pleasant experience can be repeated. </p>
<p>Negative emotions better be stronger and even more memorable because bad things can get critters killed. Better be <em>too</em> afraid of the world, than not enough. Missing out a crop of fruit, oh well, happens, there's other food. Missing the snake on the trail can be a mistake you only make once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So Christian music is developed around the ease of singing along- the real money is in licensing songs to be sung by churches during worship, so they have to have some key traits: </p>
<p>A range that can be sung by most people, which means mid-range male voice. Women can harmonize up, but it's harder to fit a vocal range under the singer instead of above. </p>
<p>The tempo and cadence of the singing, likewise, must be accessible for the average singer. </p>
<p>After that; it's a question of style (rock also tends to use common, easy keys and simple drum rhythms).</p>
<p>So the answer is U2 discovered how to get people to sing along to music really effectively and the formula is being used elsewhere that your ear recognizes as U2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most Christian rock sounds nothing like U2 but if we are talking about Worship music then that sounds about right. </p>
<p>Reason 1: Big sound. The big delays and reverbs make it sound huge without having the whole Gospel Choir. U2 pioneered this sound for the mainstream. When you are doing the whole hands in the air thing having a huge sound really puts you in the emotional state for it all.</p>
<p>Reason 2. Worship music seems to follow mainstream by quite a number of years. Hillsong Young and Free for example is far from the U2 approach and has much more of an electronic sound. </p>
<p>Reason 3. Vocal lines all need to be easy enough to join in with after at most one listen. This isn't unique to U2 but it is a feature of popular music. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Edge's sound is heavily modified with delay and reverb pedals. His extreme use of them set U2 apart from other bands. U2 has a very mainstream  clean sound in order to make them relevant and approachable.
Churches have very large rooms surrounded in stone. This caused a lot of natural reverb, so composers who wrote songs with long sustained notes had success with church music because it did not create unwanted dissonance, but instead the reverberations resonated with the notes currently being played. eventually this became the aesthetic associated with churches.
Heavily distorted guitar sounds angry, while cleaner guitar sounds much more calm. Christian Rock combined the reverb aesthetic with popular music, preferring influences that use clean tones for a calm but positive energy.
TLDR U2 was more interested in heavily altering the guitar through effects pedals but provided a similar energy to past successes  in order to appeal to a wide audience. Christian Rock artists used a similar aesthetic because it is similar to both traditional church music and popular music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things led up to this. </p>
<p>First, it's been considered that one way to resolve the issue of information loss in black holes is that the information isn't encoded in the volume of the hole, but the area. That is to say, small fluctuations in the event horizon- the surface- of the black hole carry all of the information for the entire hole. The rationale for this is somewhat involved, and hard to explain &quot;ELI5&quot;, but... a black hole is as much information as you can cram into a given space. That concept &quot;as much information as you can cram into a particular space&quot; has a name, &quot;Bekenstein bound&quot;. That bound is defined by the <em>square</em> of the radius of any region, not the <em>cube</em>... that means the area, and not the volume of a region defines it's total entropic capacity.</p>
<p>So... if that's the case it's argued by some, since that's true of any region (not just black holes), maybe the universe itself is composed of information encoded on a 2D boundary, not within a 3D volume. In essence, we'd be like a soap bubble, rather than a softball. </p>
<p>It doesn't <em>really</em> matter to you and I and our daily lives though; it doesn't imply some kind of unreality or ephemeral nature to things. All it says is that our perception of three dimensions is only valid on the macroscopic scales and very low energy levels we live our lives at. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this one is a case of over-interpretation of scientific language by laypeople. Colloquially we use the term &quot;hologram&quot; to refer to some form of 3d image or illusion without substance such as the ones on credit cards or 3d displays. Which leads to these &quot;uuuh, is our world just a simulation?&quot; type ideas.</p>
<p>To a physicist it just means: some physical property inside this volume can be determined/reproduced by what happens on its surface. Somewhat similar to how I can determine the trajectory of a thrown object by only knowing its velocity and position at a single point in time. That doesn't imply that the remainder of the trajectory is &quot;just a simulation&quot; or &quot;not real&quot;.</p>
<p>The connection between these two terms is of course that you can use the physicists idea of hologram to produce a hologram in the 3d picture sense. This is due to wave phenomena such as light but also sound having exactly this property. If you can capture the wave field on some 2d surface surrounding a volume you can reconstruct what the wave field inside the volume looks like. Classic holograms work exactly like this. You bounce a laser off an object and bring it to interference with a reference laser beam and record the resulting interference pattern on a photographic plate. Which is like a fingerprint of the wave field. If you then shine only the reference beam back at the recorded pattern it reproduces the original wave field which our eyes interpret as an image of the object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) is excellent at breaking up organic deposits such as grease, oils, mildew, mould, soap scum, etc... It's a staple in glass, mirror, and window cleaners.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a powerful disinfectant and organic solvent. Although it can be used as a household cleaning solution, it's not commonly used as such. Rubbing alcohol can be used to disinfect and clean things like needles, knives, jewelry, electronic contacts, etc.. It's more aggressive at breaking up deposits than aqueous ammonia but it's also harsher and more expensive. Rubbing alcohol is also flammable and evaporates quickly. As such, it's not a very ideal surface cleaner. However, it can be used to clean areas which cannot normally be washed or rinsed, such as cleaning spilled soda out from between the keys on a keyboard, where leaving little to no residue is desirable.</p>
<p>Rubbing alcohol is outstanding at cleaning finished metal such as stainless steel and chrome because it easily removes fingerprints and oily deposits. It's also great at removing marker and crayon from painted walls and restoring whiteboards.</p>
<p>Chlorine bleach is an extremely powerful and extremely cheap disinfectant. It's not a cleaner; it's used to kill virtually everything microbial in nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bleach is a disinfectant and should only be applied after the surfaces have already been cleaned.</p>
<p>Eg: to clean a bathroom floor, first you go over and putty knife any large sticky objects, then sweep it, then mop with soap and hot water.  Then mop it with bleach and water and leave the floor to air dry for about 15 mins.</p>
<p>Alcohol, due do it's lack of surface tension, is great for creeping into narrow gaps and edges because it just creeps its way into tight spaces.  I keep it in a spray bottle to disinfect food stuff, like wine and beer making supplies.</p>
<p>Ammonia is great on glass, but I mostly use white vinegar, either picking (7%) or cleaning (10%) over the standard 5% for food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>The explanation for the phenomenon is that, in the cortex, verbal repetition repeatedly arouses a specific neural pattern that corresponds to the meaning of the word. Rapid repetition makes both the peripheral sensorimotor activity and central neural activation fire repeatedly. This is known to cause reactive inhibition, hence a reduction in the intensity of the activity with each repetition. Jakobovits James (1962) calls this conclusion the beginning of &quot;experimental neurosemantics&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In eli5 terms our brains can't keep interpreting the same stimulus at the same intensity because it gets tired. And that's when things get weird. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I managed a porn store for a few years about 4 years ago... and before I worked there, I thought the same... who is buying/renting these movies? As it turns out, lots of people. At least half our business was movies. </p>
<p>I often asked our regulars, who I got to know a bit, why they were in 3 times a week getting movies when free porn of any variety one could want is available for free on the internet. Some were old guys who didn't &quot;get&quot; the internet (some of the old guys were still on VHS tapes, which we had very few, as DVD players were too modern and scary). Some of them were guys who were afraid their wives would find out if they looked it up on their computer, so they snuck DVD's in to watch when the family wasn't around. The rest were typically younger guys who would rent about 5 DVD's at a time, take them home, and rip them onto their computers as part of their collection. </p>
<p>Even still, I don't really get it. I would think you would learn to use the internet and clear your history as opposed to wasting 100's of dollars a year on something you could get for free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays people don't pay for online porn.</p>
<p>They pay for all the &quot;luxuries&quot; and extra's from guaranteed hd videos, fast stream/dl, ad free to knowing you're surfing on a secured website that won't have 15 popups appear ect...</p>
<p>But one of the most important thing: being able to find what the client wants fast and in a reliable manner.</p>
<p>A new performer joins the porn scene of your particular studio ? You'll be the first to know about it.</p>
<p>You want a video to fulfill your specific fetish ? You'll get a proper filtered list in just a few clicks.</p>
<p>You want to know if a certain performer released new material ? You won't have to stalk their social media (if they have any) and search multiple website for confirmation... or wait X amount of time to find a &quot;pirated&quot; version of it...</p>
<p>Now despite all that there's always exceptions to the rule, there's some performers who don't offer the package above because they decide to not sign with a larger studio or to go independent and do their own solo thing.</p>
<p>Yet are able to make a living by having a few &quot;love fools&quot; who will spend ridiculous amount of money trough donations or tiered program a la kickstarter just for a signed picture or shoutout on a video.</p>
<p>However if you've ever been on streaming websites non related to porn that shouldn't come to you as a surprise as some people are already willing to do that just for people streaming themselves playing games, cook, paint ect. </p>
<p>Anyway i'm derailing here, the point being people rarely pay for porn anymore for what's happening in front of the camera but rather for how they get to experience it from pre- to post masturbation.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong everyone has a preferred performer but at the end of the day they can and will get replaced, sadly some believe that their genitalia are made of gold and hence are vividly against &quot;free&quot; porn and often end up quitting partially because of it but that's another story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To combat this at work, I wear slip on dress shoes and take them off under my desk while sitting there, which allows my feet to breathe and stay dry, and thus warm. They slip on easily enough they most people never notice. When I ride motorcycles long distance I'll be riding 20 hours a day or more. Obviously removing my boots would be practical or safe, so I use anti-monkey butt powder between my toes, dri-max socks, and gore-tex boots. I've found this combination to work the best for me, but it is expensive. At home I wear real sheep fur lined slippers.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To build on what others have said, your brain cares a lot more about it's core temperature than the temperature of your fingers and toes. Other than sweating when too warm, or shivering when too cold, the primary method the brain uses to regulate your temperature is by deciding how much heat to lose through your extremities.</p>
<p>Think of your hands and feet like radiators. There is a lot of surface area and they are usually in contact with the floor or with surfaces you are holding, so if you are too warm your body will send lots of blood to your hands and feet and they will feel really warm because they are purposefully radiating away lots of extra heat your body is trying to get rid of. (After you do a lot of exercise, feel how warm your hands or feet are, they are probably burning hot).  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, when you are too cold, your body restricts the amount of heat it sends to your toes and hands because (1) those appendages can handle cold temperatures a lot better than your internal organs, and (2) your brain knows heat that goes that far away from your core will just be lost right away because your hands and feet are exposed to the elements so it's not worth &quot;wasting&quot; heat trying to keep them warm.</p>
<p>What's my point with all of this? <strong>If you have cold feet, it's because your body is colder than it wants to be, not because your feet themselves are cold.</strong> Don't worry about warming up your feet directly, that will help, but so will just putting an extra blanket over your body and raising your overall temperature. It's impossible to have cold feet while feeling hot in the rest of your body. Put on and extra sweater or blanket, then your core temperature goes up and your feet will warm themselves up real quick as your body shunts it's excess heat out to your toes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America#Origin" target="_blank">a good explanation from Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that a part of the Americas has a linguistic affinity with the Romance cultures as a whole can be traced back to the 1830s, in the writing of the French Saint-Simonian Michel Chevalier, who postulated that this part of the Americas was inhabited by people of a &quot;Latin race&quot;, and that it could, therefore, ally itself with &quot;Latin Europe&quot; in a struggle with &quot;Teutonic Europe&quot;, &quot;Anglo-Saxon America&quot; and &quot;Slavic Europe&quot;. A further investigation of the concept of Latin America is by Michel Gobat in the American Historical Review.</p>
<p>The idea was later taken up by Latin American intellectuals and political leaders of the mid- and late-nineteenth century, who no longer looked to Spain or Portugal as cultural models, but rather to France. The term was first used in Paris in an 1856 conference by the Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao and the same year by the Colombian writer José María Torres Caicedo in his poem &quot;Two Americas&quot;.</p>
<p>The term Latin America was supported by the French Empire of Napoleon III during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude Anglophone countries. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install Maximilian of Habsburg as emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. This term was also used in 1861 by French scholars in La revue des races Latines, a magazine dedicated to the Pan-Latinism movement.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, it is specifically because Spain and Portugal were the large European Influences of the region that they are called Latin America. Hispanic is the term specifically for the subset influenced by Spain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dear god, I was born ready for this AMA! Mars colonization has been my prime fantasy since I could barely grasp the concept!</p>
<p>I hope you don't mind me overstretching a little bit, I'll try coming with as few concise questions as possible.</p>
<p>A) What are your thoughts on possible living-quarters alternatives on Mars, which one would you say is the most likely to be picked eventually and why? I remember some alternatives about flying there some sort of inflatable quarters to be pre-deployed before manned missions, some dome-building too. As of me, I think that building underground to avoid the radiation without need of much insulation would be best, but digging on Mars could be tricky.</p>
<p>B) If consulted about the use of nuclear energy in a future human settlement in Mars, given the risks it involves vs the benefits in energy surplus &amp; fuel replacement ratio, what would be your call?</p>
<p>C) Do you see an eventual Mars settlement as a sort of scientific &quot;human heritage&quot; like Antarctica or would you consider practical economic benefits for a colonization as a sort of investment or entrepreneurship?* </p>
<p>Thanks a lot for this AMA, im eager to read responses on other questions too! :)</p>
<hr />
<p>* <em>I remember reading somewhere about the factibility of setting a sort of &quot;solar system trade&quot;, where Mars would work as base of operations for mining the Asteroid Belt (due to sheer proximity) &amp; for further space exploration due to lower gravity (lower take-off costs), while exporting valuable minerals back to earth, in exchange for things not possible to produce on Mars, or prohibitively expensive to do so there.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is a pretty cool system and can be quite efficient. Although not as efficient as an actual physical barrier. A shop may install transparent doors or flaps to save energy. And during night they often cover the refrigerators to make them more efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's good marketing. Putting things behind windows helps slow down &quot;grab and go&quot;, which is a part of good sales. And it also puts a barrier between the buyer and the goods. Seeing things fresh, up close inside of clear plastic, such as meats, tends to encourage lots more buying.</p>
<p>also works with pastas of the many kinds, which are mostly sold inside of clear plastic, or at least windows of plastic, too. We are visual critters, as our brains are organized around the visual systems we use, so that works best.</p>
<p>It's more real that way, too. Imagine how poorly chicken and steak would sell if the beef wasn't reddened with nitrites, and you couldn't see the meat, nor feel it either.</p>
<p>Impulse buying and good marketing, all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
