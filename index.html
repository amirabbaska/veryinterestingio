		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another form of &quot;compression&quot; here that I haven't seen anyone mention.  You've got the literal physical &quot;compression&quot; of DNA around histones, you've got the compression that occasionally occurs where a single strand of DNA codes for multiple overlapping genes.  </p>
<p>But there's also a sort of &quot;compression&quot; that relates to how genes result in actual phenotype.  Genes do chemistry, more or less.  They make proteins, proteins produce other chemicals and join together to make the structures of cells.  Cells come together and make organisms.  But there's often not a 1:1 ratio of &quot;gene&quot; and &quot;physical attribute&quot;.  For example, there's not  &quot;left front leg&quot; genes, &quot;right front leg&quot; genes,  &quot;left back leg&quot; genes and  &quot;right back leg genes&quot;.  Instead there are a number of genes that get expressed in each limb to produce it.  Genes often do &quot;double duty&quot; in different body systems.  And final outcomes are usually complicated relative to the information content of the gene.  Consider a tree growing.  The final tree has a complex fractal branching shape, but this can arise from a relatively few genes that cause the tree to grow, then branch, then grow, then branch, with the same rules repeated <em>on</em> the branches, causing them to branch in turn.  Complexity emerges from interactions in the genes, and interactions between the genes and environment.</p>
<p>And this is the main sort of &quot;compression&quot; that I would say is involved in life.  It's the sort of compression that gives you the complexity of the human brain, with some 100 trillion neural connections storing at least a terabyte's worth of data, coming from a genome only 725 megabytes in size.  You can't describe every important factor of a human in our 725 megabytes of DNA data so we are, in a sense, uncompressed.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

By a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing" target="_blank">alternative splicing</a>, a single gene can be transcribed or &quot;read&quot; in a number of different ways, resulting in many protein variants from a single gene.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells DNA is normally wrapped around histone proteins. These proteins package the DNA and form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are then folded into high order structures eventually forming chromosomes. This process compacts DNA and adds another level of regulation.
An example From Wikipedia: each human diploid cell (containing 23 pairs of chromosomes) has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but wound on the histones it has about 90 micrometers (0.09 mm) of chromatin.
I guess you can argue whether this fits your original definition of compressed. Most of the time information in DNA is unavailable to copy unless the DNA has unwound and unfolded from the protein complexes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out there is a difference between physically packing DNA and coding it algorithmically to represent the same information with fewer bases. Your question seems to be aimed at the later. </p>
<p>Anyone who answers this definitively I think is reaching as it's still open as far as I know. However we do know something's.  </p>
<p>The information in a sequence of characters can be measured with Shannon entropy which gives a limit on how much something can be compressed. A really interesting paper just came out called DNA Fountain (using fountain codes to put binary data into a DNA representation for storage) they claim that coding DNA nears the maximum amount of information in a four character alphabet, implying that even with a sufficiently clever code we would not be able to appreciably compress DNA. </p>
<p>That being said there are vast regions of DNA that are highly repetitive and have little information content. In theory this could be compressed (although practically doing so is still a challenge) but this looks at these regions only from a data perspective. Their physical structure could be functional. eg it might be physical spacing or something, in which case compression could ruin it. Again the function(s) if any of DNA desserts are poorly understood. But this is looking at interactions outside of those normally considered when talking about compression codes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biology and biochemistry undergrad here! (with a couple of grad-level genetics courses under my belt, if that makes a difference)</p>
<p>Sort of! Some viral genomes (including some DNA viruses) have overlapping open reading frames, meaning that you can actually get 3 gene products from one gene! </p>
<p>How this works is let's say you have a gene that looks like ABCDEFGHI. Further behind that A is a start codon, something that tells RNA polymerase (what makes the thing that ribosomes make proteins out of) to start reading here. Later on, when the protein is created, we have 3 letters per amino acid. One way of reading it is ABC DEF GHI. With more of those start codons, you can get more, different ways of reading that 9 letter series! You can have ..A BCD EFG HI., .AB CDE FGH I.., or some in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>In essence, this one strand of DNA can give you up to 6 protein products! </p>
<p>Another method that some other posters mentioned is differential splicing. Let's say you have that same 9 letter strand, ABCDEFGHI. You can make a 3 word protein from the mRNA ABC DEF GHI, or you can take some of the internal letters out to make different words! For example, we can take out CDEF, which would give us a few words ABG HI.! This gives us a different protein product than earlier. </p>
<p>In short, there are a few methods for &quot;compressing&quot; the information contained in a DNA genome. All of these come with their own drawbacks, but in general they reduce the amount of DNA letters needed to create many different proteins!</p>
<p>If you're confused about any of these parts, feel free to ask further questions. I'm writing this to procrastinate revising for my virology exam, but feel free! If you're interested in more information about either of these topics, also feel free to reply to this post!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The hormones in question belong to a family of hormones called steroid hormones, which are small organic molecules. They are not easily gotten rid of unless there's a high level of biochemical degradation, so hormones in tissues, food, drinks, etc. have a relatively long half life, since they are really stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your topic with certainty as I haven't looked into hormones being synthetically injected into animals and whether there is an effect on humans. However, I know a few things and so I will discuss some possibilities.</p>
<p>About absorption of nutrients by the small intestine cells (enterocytes)... Basically, there's some proteases (pepsinogen--&gt;pepsin) that are released due to the stimulus of food entering the stomach. Protein breakdown begins and when the food (bolus) enters the small intestine there are more enzymes released for the rest of the macronutrients (lipids and carbohydrates and more for proteins such as trypsinogen---&gt;trypsin) which break down these molecules further. </p>
<p>I will use sugar as an example to illustrate specificity of channel absorption. There are different kinds of disaccaride sugars such as maltose, sucrose, and lactose. Each has been broken down from its polysaccharide carbohydrate form into each respective dissacaride listed. (Maltose = glucose + glucose) (sucrose = glucose + fructose) (lactose = glucose + galactose) I will use lactose as an example since you are asking about milk. Some people have a gene that codes for the enzyme lactase which breaks lactose into its 2 monomers, glucose and galactose. If you don't have enough lactase then you will be unable to digest large amounts of lactose. If you don't have any lactase then you can't digest lactose at all. There are specific channels that allow for glucose to pass through (Glut2) into the cell and there is another channel that allows for galactose to be absorbed (can't remember the channel). (Side note: sometimes molecules need to be cotransported with another such as chloride, potassium, H+, etc.)</p>
<p>If there is a mutation in a person's genome then they may not be able to absorb certain molecules at all or to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>As far as ingestion of hormones, there are spaces in between enterocytes (cells lining the small intestine) in the small intestine called tight junctions which let water pass freely with concentration gradients and also allow passing of molecules less than 1000MW (molecular weight). Some hormone may be digestible if they are protein or peptide hormones as protease enzymes may be able to break them down. This depends on whether or not the substrate (peptide hormone) fits into the binding site on the enzyme. If it doesn't fit then it may not be broken down. If they aren't broken down then I suppose it is plausible that they could slip through the tight junction and into the enterocytes and from there they may be absorbed into the blood stream. Otherwise they could simply be excreted as waste.</p>
<p>Steroid hormones are usually small and flat and so I would also speculate that due to the fact that they can slide through 6nm cellular membranes, it is possible/likely that they can be absorbed directly from ingestion. </p>
<p>Hormones are highly specific to the receptor in which they bind. It could be that the hormones given to animals will not bind to human receptors at all. Although, it depends on what hormone it is. If there is no receptor for the hormone, then it will have no effect.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider, (probably the most important), would be that the hormone concentration dictates the response. If there is not a lot of hormone, then there will still be no observed response. So a question I would like to know the answer to is: what concentrations of which specific hormones are present in particular types of meat and from which manufacturors?</p>
<p>On top of all of this, growth hormone and IGF-1 (insulin like growth factor 1) have very slow effects on the body. They don't work like epinephrine in which you are almost instantly in a state of heightened arousal with increased heart rate and muscle tone. GH and IGF-1 won't be noticeable at all after ingestion and even then, you would need to ingest lots and lots of these hormones over a long period of time to have any noticeable change in your body. </p>
<p>What change would be noticed? Well, GH increases mobilization of lipids from adipocytes and increases muscle protein synthesis in muscle. GH essentially makes you leaner and aids in cellular repair especially the muscles after a workout. Your body produces GH during and after exercise in response to the stress you induce on your body in order to repair and rebuild damaged muscle fibers. Unfortunately, I can not tell you what happens when you inject/injest GH in a sedentary state as I only have learned it's role related to exercise.</p>

<p>The ozone hole has always been a temporary phenomenon. It occurs in early spring in the Southern hemisphere for a period of a few weeks to a few months depending on conditions. This is due to the dynamics of ozone creation/depletion and the buildup of ozone destroying chemicals in the upper atmosphere along with conditions that maximize ozone depletion (polar stratospheric clouds and, ironically, ultraviolet light from the Sun) overwhelming the rate of ozone creation.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades the acknowledgement of ozone depletion as a serious environmental problem led to international efforts to curb CFC production and emissions which has dramatically reduced CFC pollution and brought ozone depletion under control. CFCs are fairly long-lived in the atmosphere (which is why they were used and why they are problematic) so it will take decades for the ozone layer to fully &quot;heal&quot; but currently we're on track for that to happen within the next 25-40 years or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The rate at which a lithium-ion cell is damaged varies based on how far the cell is from its nominal voltage (~3.7V). The voltage limits for your device are chosen to balance the total cycles, and the capacity available. The deeper you discharge the cells the quicker it will die. So if you are looking to conserve your cells life, it is best to only partially discharge the battery between recharges, 40-70% Depth of Discharge results in a pretty good balance. </p>
<p>Battery University is typically a good resource for lithium-ion related questions:<br />

Even though most battery do have voltage protection, continuous discharge until depletion can cause two problem: mechanical degradation of the cathode and side reaction with electrode or electrolyte. If the battery is brand new you could do it for few times just to induce crack (increase surface area) but if the battery is already in its 1-2 years of use you want to avoid it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers but to provide more depth...</p>
<p>There's no real measure of &quot;mAh left&quot; in the cell.  Your phone estimates the life of the battery by knowing a few things</p>
<ul>
<li>The battery's full voltage (typically 4.2v)</li>
<li>The battery's &quot;empty&quot; voltage (typically something a little over 3.0v)</li>
<li>The rate in change of the voltage over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Newer phones might have better sensors to measure current in various components (gpu/cpu/screen/bt/radio/etc) to improve accuracy.</p>
<p>But more or less your phone's software is learning how long it takes (with various loads) to change voltage.  E.g. (simplified) if every 0.1v change takes an hour than from [say] 4.2v to 3.0v you have &quot;12 hours&quot; of battery left.  So if the battery reads 3.8v then you have &quot;8 hours left&quot;</p>
<p>Of course that's just made up numbers for starters the change in voltage isn't linear.  It also depends on load.  An idle device obviously will stay at the same voltage for longer, etc.</p>
<p>But that's the gist of it.</p>
<p>On older phones you can mess up the software by having non-typical power usage.  E.g. do a heavy load on the battery and the next cycle the OS might think that you have less power left than you do.  Not unlike how cars do distance left on the fuel remaining.  If I do a lot of city driving my car might tell me on a full tank I have 400km left but if I do a lot of highway it might say 550km.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say exactly what. </p>
<p>I find I have the same problem with some people, they strike me as utterly toxic, while others don't seem to be upset by it. It's something like this:</p>
<p>There are certain personality traits I find utterly abhorrent. For example, being excessively self-assured strikes me as unspeakably arrogant. I see shades of grey on everything, and I try to form my opinions and beliefs based of the notion that there are multiple viewpoints to consider, and I can't possibly have considered all of them, so my conclusions can only be a maximum of, say, 97% valid. When stating my beliefs, I tend to preface them with qualifiers like, &quot;in my experience&quot; or &quot;correct me if I'm wrong, but...&quot;. To me, doing so conveys a decent sense of self-doubt, and a willingness to learn or be corrected. </p>
<p>I think I do this because I don't want anyone to feel like their opinion is invalid. I have been made to feel that way on the past, as though my thoughts, opinions, and experiences are without value, and it's completely dehumanizing and degrading. So I try to avoid doing that when possible. </p>
<p>People who don't have that hang up tend to strike me as arrogant, self-centered, and devoid of empathy. It's a trait that really rubs me the wrong way. </p>
<p>More recently, I've come to understand that my reaction to such people is the result of me being overly sensitive to a certain extent, and that the assumption that my opinion is not valued is not necessarily true, I just perceive it that way. Moreover, my &quot;decent sense of self-doubt&quot; is often interpreted as a spineless indecisiveness, whereas I am trying to convey more of a cautious open-mindedness. </p>
<p>I think the bottom line is that we are all the products of our past experiences, and that often, we are conditioned to react negatively to personality traits that we perceive as toxic, when perhaps they are not. </p>
<p>I'll end this with the obligatory, &quot;of course, that's just my experience. &quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As a former restaurant dishwasher for about 2.5 years, these machines would be <em>hugely</em> inefficient for home use. The home dishwasher is made to be more water and energy efficient, as /u/IllyriaGodKing said, while the industrial sized machines are made to be efficient over many, <em>many</em> uses.</p>
<p>Firstly, in the case of the one restaurant I worked for, the machine wasn't owned by the restaurant, but leased from the company that made it. This gave us access to their repairmen when things inevitably and frequently went wrong. Paddles sticking in the on position, paddles sticking in the off position, not drawing on any soap, using too much soap, drain clogs, power failures, heat failures, nearly everything that you could imagine to go wrong did at one point. You need access to these professionals or all of their tools and knowledge.</p>
<p>Second, these aren't made for you to cook throughout the day, load up all your dishes at once, and be done in three minutes. I want one myself for that reason, because that kitchen spoiled me as far as quick and easy cleanliness. What they're made to do is fill up a large, multiple gallon tank of water in the morning, keep it heated all day, wash many large loads through the day, and empty and clean out at night. This is how they become efficient and affordable for a restaurant; they actually have a quantity of dishes to call for it as a need. At home, we'll waste gallons of water and lots of energy.</p>
<p>Finally, all the maintenance that isn't covered by the aforementioned professionals: regular ass cleaning of this giant ass machine. You'll need to do it <em>a lot</em>. Solid food waste will get stuck in the drains, the water jets, the gratings below the wash area. The presence of large quantities of water on rust resistant metal will cause lime to build up in great amounts. In my nearly 3 years at this restaurant, we spent many efforts trying to get all that gunk off, and I never once saw it completely lime-free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked this once when I was working as time worker, and another time when I saw a way bigger version for a work canteen with lots of people coming through.</p>
<p>The smaller versions:</p>
<p>Blast the dishes with high preassuer and lots of heat. Only certain lipsticks dont come off with those. These are used if at &quot;smaller&quot; concert halls with &quot;fine dining&quot; (champagne, red wine, salmon). They basically are cupboards with high pressure system in it that starts as soon as you close it.</p>
<p>These are normaly only used for glasses and small plates, not for cutlery.</p>
<p>The bigger ones in canteens, have conveyor belt system, and are nasty deathtraps. They work with several high pressure nozzles, very high temperatures (if I remember right &gt; 100°C ) and also need quit agressive cleaning detergents, and have 3 compartments, cleaning, rinsing, drying. </p>
<p>They get everything from the plate, glass, cutlery. They proably would destroy and finer porclain. </p>
<p>For why deathtraps: sometimes  compartments with dishes in them get stuck, you need to step in and manually correct them. They are high enough to stand upright, but the visibility is quite low from outside towards service. As with the others, closing the hood starts the process. If you don't lock that down, and somebody starts with you inside the world of pain starts.</p>
<p>Had this happen once in one of our canteens (before it was &quot;ours&quot;) after hours, no more customers; closing down. Kitchen helper hops in to fix something, &quot;assigned dishwasher&quot; closes the hood, &quot;kitchen head&quot; saw the hood closing and rush over to hit the emergency shut of while at the same time calling an ambulance, all withing seconds.  That guy almost was cooked alive in a man sized pressure cooker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You've got someone washing dishes roughly then they get run through the dishwasher as a final measure. It also helps them dry as it's so hot.</p>
<p>If the dishwasher (person) doesn't rinse properly you'll get bits of food stuck to the dishes when they comeout of the machine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historical and geographical reasons.</p>
<p>Most of those islands were colonized by Spain in the 16th and 17th century and used to produce sugar and tropical fruit crops.  The colonial government had little interest in improving infrastructure, education, or standard of living and many of the residents were slaves.</p>
<p>When the Spanish empire started to unravel those islands found themselves suddenly self-governing with little experience or resources.</p>
<p>Since then they've struggled with corrupt governments, meddling from cold war superpowers, and the simple lack of resources on an island.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a complicated question but i'll give it ago: Poor governance and an atmosphere of zero accountability permeates much of the Caribbean. Blatant corruption, often at the highest levels of government, frequently goes unaddressed.
Small islands like the Caribbean certainly dont have it easy despite the year round sunshine. Aside from sunlight, most of these islands have little natural resources of their own, and are forced to import majority of goods which makes the cost of living higher.
It would be unfair to say that a history of slavery and colonialism have not played a role in the Caribbean's current predicament, but as a person who lives here, it would be disingenuous to be blame anyone else but ourselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way is the scale of the energy of the photons. Gamma rays are generally understood to be produced by subatomic interactions. An electron has a mass-energy of roughly 511 KeV (kilo-electron volts. An electron volt, or eV, is the energy to move a single electron through one volt of potential.) and so an electron annihilating with a positron puts out gamma rays that together reach around ~1 MeV. Now, an electron and a positron can only decay into two gamma rays or more (not just one) so usually the energy gets split and you get gamma rays with around 0.5 MeV. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/fermi-thunderstorms.html" target="_blank">This energy</a> is often used to identify matter-antimatter collisions in space.</p>
<p>Gamma-ray bursts are mysterious and we don't know exactly what their source is, but certain types of GRB's are associated with supernovae. These can generally reach very high energies which is part of why we can see them from so far away - these not only reach higher energies than annihilating particles, but the scale of the interaction (an entire star collapsing as opposed to cosmic particles colliding) also multiplies the energy to extremely high levels and produces a wide range of other effects, like longer-wavelength (x-ray and UV) energy bursts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The frequency of a photon is directly related to the energy that the photon carries. In an antimatter annihilation between two particles, a specific quantity of energy is released in the pair of gamma ray photons emitted. Therefore, every annihilation between an electron and a positron releases two gamma ray photons of the same frequency, every time* (0.511 eV to be precise, which is the energy quantity of an electron or a positron). By measuring the frequency of received gamma rays, we can tell that they were produced from an annihilation reaction, rather than, say, a gamma ray burst, which has different properties entirely.  </p>
<p>*this assumes that the particles had negligible momentum. If extremely fast moving particles collide then the photons released will have higher energy, and therefore frequency, because the kinetic energy of the particles cannot be destroyed and so ends up in the photons. However, generally this doesn't really change much, as the particles have to be moving <em>extremely</em> fast for this to make a significant impact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy spectrum. Electrons and positrons have a very specific amount of rest-energy, and when they combine they naturally produce gamma ray photons of corresponding energy levels (511 KeV). Note that even proton/anti-proton annihilations will result in the creation of electrons and positrons as well so they will end up having the same gamma ray photons produced. If you look at a source of gamma rays and you see a strong peak around the 511 KeV line that's pretty conclusively the result of matter/anti-matter annihilations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
