		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the olden days, credit cards were often not scanned with the mag strip, because the equipment was still too expensive for smaller retailers.</p>
<p>What they did instead was use a carbon paper and a roller machine to take an imprint of the front of the credit card with the numbers. This was commonly part of the receipt, and one copy would be torn off and given to the customer.</p>
<p>The problem with this, of course, is that now all these receipts you are just throwing away left and right have your whole card number on them. </p>
<p>This is where the extra numbers on the back to confirm an online(or at the time, over the phone) purchase can be used,  if you only had a receipt you found with the front of someone's card, you would not have all the numbers needed to complete a transaction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>They're in a different spot than the main credit card number, so if you get a picture of the credit card you still can't use it because you don't have the security code.</p>
</li>
<li>On systems that save your credit card number, they are not supposed to save your security code, which means you need to type it in in order to place an order. That means that if someone else gets access to my computer or login, they can't order stuff for themselves because they don't have my security code. The same goes if the seller's system gets compromised, enabling hackers to access our credit card numbers - but they can't use them without the security code.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to /u/Dacke comment... Android Pay is actually way more secure because when it transmits a credit card, it actually transmits a one-time credit card generated just for this transaction, so stealing it is pointless.</p>
<p>As with any security system any time you have <em>static</em> or non-changing information it is considered easy to individually compromise. </p>
<p>The new chip in new credit cards in america means that you never actually transmit the credit card number to the payment system. Instead you transmit an identifier and a rolling code. The code is verified by the server to verify legitimacy. Since reading the code is pointless since it changes by algorithm every few seconds you have a much more foolproof system. So <em>at least</em> the card readers in every store are no longer attack-vectors for credit card theft. Previously you hack a credit card reader provider and you get <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>edit: I'm sorry I think I mixed up android pay and the older Google wallet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just three extra digits, it's a separate code that is used very differently.  The credit card number identifies the card, can be read by card readers from the magnetic strip, and is stored by merchants' systems that store your card information.  Or, if they use the old machines that make an imprint of the card, that number is on the imprint (which means the full credit card number is on the receipt).</p>
<p>The CVV code (the three extra digits) is just written - on the back of the card, with no raised plastic, so it won't appear in imprints and won't be as easy for people to see or photograph.  It is <em>not</em> stored when your card number is stored, and PCI (the standard in the US that companies that take credit card numbers are required to abide by) places more restrictions on where you can keep that number.  It can only be temporarily kept for use during a single transaction, and that's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a set of regulations that dictate the payment card industry called PCI.  if you want to do anything with payment cards you have to be PCI compliant.  One of the major things in PCI compliance is you cannot store the CVV (those digits).  You also cannot store the mag stripe data.</p>
<p>This makes it hard to copy a card from legitimate hardware.  It also allows companies to tell how you used your card.  Merchants are charged different rates for &quot;card present&quot; (you physically swiped your card) and &quot;card not present&quot; (you typed in your card number, like an online purchase).  There are other categories and large companies can negotiate rates.</p>
<p>The numbers are also present on the back of the card, which makes copying the numbers more difficult.  If I wanted to steal your credit card number with the CVV I'd have to see both sides of your card.  This means is most likely need physical possession of the card, I cannot sneak a picture.</p>
<p>When you combine these features it makes it more difficult to steal someone's card number.  It doesn't make it impossible but does out up enough barriers to stop a good amount of low-level thieves.  Furthermore the way the numbers are used with mandatory industry standards they serve a purchase for the men behind the curtains that run the show.</p>
<p>Lastly I've called the digits CVV but different companies and networks may have a different name for them.  They serve the same purpose though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's quite simple. Advertisers pay money to Google/Youtube for the rights to show an advertisement before (or during) a video. Google/Youtube takes a cut of the revenue, and the Youtuber earns the rest.</p>
<p>The amount advertisers are willing to pay in terms of cost per click or cost per view, is dependent on many factors, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The popularity of the Youtuber / video</li>
<li>The target audience of the Youtuber / video</li>
<li>How competitive (from an advertiser perspective) the video is (or its associated keywords are)</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain videos are not eligible for monetization (so Youtubers typically won't earn ad revenue from them). This includes, for example, many videos depicting nudity or sex and videos containing extremely foul language or controversial / offensive topics.</p>
<p>If a video contains commercial music, sometimes the music publisher or record label will file a copyright claim over the video and instead of taking it down will request the Youtuber's revenue share instead. So, in these cases, the Youtuber is not penalized but also does not earn ad revenue from the video.</p>
<p>Youtubers also make lots of money (much more than standard ad revenue) by negotiating product placement deals directly with advertisers to personally use and/or promote a product (such as a mobile app, web service, gadget, etc.) within their video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend is a popular YouTube creator (currently between 150k-250k subscribers). There are three core ways YouTubers make money. </p>
<p>(1.) YouTube AdSense: </p>
<ul>
<li>This is purely getting paid for views on videos, because there are ads on videos, such as display ads (the ads next to the video), overlay ads (ads that pop up at the bottom on the videos), and skippable and non-skippable video ads before the actual content. Depending on the time of the year, the amount a creator is making is roughly between $1 to $2 per 1,000 views. YouTube does this because they are getting a cut of the revenues that the advertiser is paying for on the videos. Some videos are not &quot;monetizable&quot;, so the creator will not earn anything for the views. This is generally because of offensive content within the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) Sponsored Content:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is advertising within the video itself. This form of advertising can occur in many different forms, but a few examples would include companies paying for their products to be featured in videos, merely having the products mentioned in a video, or saying something along the line of &quot;this video is brought to you by [XYZ Company].&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>(3.) Selling Branded Products:</p>
<ul>
<li>This one is pretty obvious. Selling t-shirts, stickers, hats, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>My girlfriend is only involved in (1.) &amp; (2.) at the moment, and she made ~$50k in 2016. Each community within YouTube is different, but in her sphere, the majority of earnings come from sponsored content with AdSense being a nice bonus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ad makers pay YouTube to put their ads on YouTube videos. YouTube keeps a portion of that money (around 30% I think) and then pays the youtuber based on how many views they get. For a non-partnered youtuber, it's about 10 views for 1 cent, 100 views for 10 cents, 1,000 views for $1, and $2,000 for 1 million views (these are all estimates, it varies a lot). I'm not sure how different it is for partnered YouTubers, but I think it depends more on who they're partnered with. It also depends on your viewer base, and more specifically, how many viewers have Adblock.
On videos over 10mins you can put extra ads, and therefor some extra money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the brain releasing neurotransmitters like oxytocin which is normally only released when we are in love or when we feel safe/protected or are caring for children. Allegedly animals we find cute (cats/dogs) were selected for their &quot;cuteness&quot; over centuries but what makes them cute turns out to be the ratio/proportion/distance of their eyes and face face shape, which is nearly that of human children. So, in essence only human children were originally meant to elicit that feeling but we have created/found other things that also stimulate that part of the brain and thus sort of tricks us into finding it attractive/urge to protect it from harm. Baby animals are also like this and there have been citations of adult animals caring for young  of other species probably also for similar reasons: their brains are sort of hardwired to instinctively care for &quot;cute things&quot; which babies of most species are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My question is: why does it matter? It's just your method of heating the water right? Either way you're just going to pour the heated water in a cup and add the tea bag so it's not like the actual tea is going in the microwave.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh good lord. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am a tea snob.</p>
<p>I'll start by saying there's nothing <em>inherently</em> wrong with using a microwave, <em>so long as you're only using it to get the water to the correct temperature</em>. </p>
<p>Tea is a lot more delicate than most people think. You do not -- I repeat, <strong>not</strong> use boiling water for tea, and you never, <em>ever</em> boil the tea in the water! </p>
<p>You need very specific temperatures, and very specific steeping times for different kinds of tea. For example, green tea needs to be steeped for 1-2 minutes in water that is 80 degrees C (175F). That too is generalised - some green teas must only be steeped for 30 seconds! </p>
<p>Steeping the tea for too long will make it bitter. Same with the temperature being too high or too low! That's why people keep dumping sugar and milk in tea. If you make tea correctly, <em>you don't need to add anything to it</em> to make it delicious. </p>
<p>Now if you're using some, shall we say, non-delicate tea, like the kind that comes in tea bags, then it's not a big deal since that's not going to be delicious anyway. And there are more resilient teas that can handle a wider range (in fact, there are some Display Teas that are designed to have hot water added to them for an entire night). </p>
<p>As a sidenote: the people across the pond are in a glass house about tea. They know <em>nothing</em> about brewing. Unless &quot;the pond&quot; is the pacific ocean and you're going to China, and also 200+ years back in time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves don't heat evenly, and hence there are several possible results, none perfect: cold spots in the water, superheated water that boils vigorously on contact with the tea, or water that's been heated long enough in the microwave to come to a rolling boil, at which point there's a good chance that the oxygen has been boiled out.  All of these can affect the flavor of the tea.</p>
<p>Most people who are into tea agree that most black teas should be seeped with water at 212°F(100°C).  A tea kettle or hot pot, whether electric or stovetop, heats from the bottom, creating convection currents that stir the water, allowing the temperature to be uniform. Plus it's easier to know exactly when the water reaches the desired temperature. <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/06/04/microwaving_water_for_tea_why_are_the_results_so_lousy.html" target="_blank">Partial source</a></p>
<p>At the risk of being a tea snob, if you're adding a tea bag to a cup into which you've poured hot water, you're already compounding the problem. The water will cool off from the cup, so when you add the bag, you're dealing with water that's already colder than it should be. Whenever I use bagged tea (mostly just herbals), I always put the bag in first and then pour the water onto it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different teas need to be brewed at different temperatures and for different lengths of time to get their proper flavor.</p>
<p>Black teas for example are usually steeped at higher temperatures (200-212F) for longer periods of time, whereas a white/green tea that is more delicate is generally steeped at 150-180F.</p>
<p>Different teas have different chemical makeups which greatly affect the flavor of the tea, and how long and hot it can be brewed at before it gets bitter and ruins the taste. Brew your jasmine needle at 212F and you're gonna burn the hell out of it, making it bitter and disgusting.</p>
<p>Many pre-packages teas that you would buy from the store (Lipton, store brands etc.) are very fine, sometimes powdery, and generally just low quality tea. The finer the particles are, the more surface area the water hits, and hence the faster the tannins and other flavors infuse into the water.</p>
<p>The proper way to get the best quality tea in terms of flavor would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use loose leaf teas (the higher the quality, the better the taste)</li>
<li>brew the tea at the proper temperature and length</li>
<li>use freshly brewed water, do not re-heat previously brewed water</li>
<li>use the highest quality water available to you (contaminants in the water can affect the taste)</li>
<li>store your tea in an air-tight storage container, away from other materials that may have a strong aroma (spices for example)</li>
<li>store your tea in a dark area (generally keeping it in a metal tin would do)</li>
</ul>
<p>Like /u/sterlingphoenix said, you want to avoid using boiling water, generally 205-210F at the hottest. If you are using a high quality loose leaf tea, and using water that isn't riddled with hard minerals, you should have a great tasting tea without any sweeteners.</p>
<p>You can of course add sugar, honey, etc. but depending on what kind of sweetener you use, this will greatly affect the flavor of the tea, and in most cases, will hide the true taste of the tea. Good tea does not need to be sweetened, and it's healthier to avoid sweeteners anyhow.</p>
<p>I HIGHLY suggest checking out Adagio Tea (www.adagio.com).</p>
<p>They have a large variety of high quality tea available at an affordable price, plus they don't charge shipping over certain amounts. They also have a rewards programs, clubs (subscriptions) and more. They do a lot of free samples, and limited time tea variants etc. Been buying from them for years now and I am very happy with their prices and quality. The shipping is quick too.</p>
<p>The reality is that there IS a proper way to get the BEST flavor out of the tea. If you are drinking tea to just have something hot to drink, that's fine, but you're really not getting the proper tea. It's kind of like playing your Skyrim on an Xbox instead of a PC :^)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here with the alternative answer as many others have given you your expected answer.</p>
<p>I'm going to assume you have, without an aircraft or other pressurised container to protect you, somehow accelerated to a speed above 761mph, the speed of sound at sea level (Assuming 20°C or 68°F ambient temperature). Let's call it 800mph.</p>
<p>Long before you even got anywhere near the 800mph mark, you would be dead. The faster you accelerated to the 800mph mark, the quicker you die, but die you would. Screaming would not happen. The how will vary greatly depending on the speed of your acceleration but many of the principles will be the same.</p>
<p>The first thing to kill you is debatable and again, dependant on your speed of acceleration but at a moderately slow acceleration in my opinion the first thing to send you off this mortal coil would be breathing resistance. As you accelerated somewhere beyond the 400mph mark, the air pressure forcing against you would be too great for you to intake and expel air out of your lungs, even by turning your head away against the wind. You could wear a helmet of some kind to prevent this but then the air around your mouth is moving with you and thus breaks the rule of the question.</p>
<p>But turning your head at this point in time is kind of moot. Because you wouldn't be able to. As you go faster and faster through earths atmosphere, you begin to bump up against air, because even though you can't see it, air has mass. The faster you go, the faster you bump up against it and eventually the air in front of you can't get out of your way fast enough. So the air starts to feel a lot more solid as it compresses. At 600mph it's pretty hard indeed. Too hard.</p>
<p>Although there are many people who have ejected from fighter aircraft at speeds in this range and even higher, many of them suffer from horrendous injuries and most pilots will attempt to eject in a way that minimises their forward velocity if they are able to. <a href="https://theaviationist.com/2015/03/17/sr-71-mid-air-disintegration/" target="_blank">The fastest ejection ever to succeed took place at three times the speed of sound but the pilot had many aids to ensure it was possible</a>. Most jet jockeys of slower aircraft don't have what he had. </p>
<p>However even when they do eject, the air resistance slows the ejected pilot down pretty quick. But your not slowing down, your still accelerating to our magic 800mph. Bumping against that air faster and faster, the air cannot get out of the way any more so it does what a gas does when it can't move. It compresses. That makes it harder. And as it gets harder, it begins to get harder for whatever is compressing it to move through it. In this case we will assume your flying like superman, so it's your head on the firing line. It will be subject to around 3g of force (Three times the force of gravity). This doesn't sound like much but it's a constant force. This isn't a huge problem unless you move your head even just the tiniest little bit, in which case your neck snaps like a twig as you pass somewhere around the 650mph mark from the air resistance, which is too great for a human spine to endure (If your accelerating really fast, this will likely kill you first).</p>
<p>Except you might not feel it because you might have cooked to death a few seconds before, and if you haven't then it won't be long before you will. Because when you begin to go so fast that air can't get out of your way fast enough, the side effect of it compressing is that it begins to heat up and it gets hotter the faster you go and the more it gets compressed. This is the same reason that spacecraft return modules and the shuttle will heat up to extremely hot temperatures as they return to earth, and why most comets and asteroids burn up in earths atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now your not going anywhere near as fast as most spacecraft are when they re-enter earths atmosphere, but at 800mph the temperature is still going to be hot enough to kill a human. Aircraft use special composites and design techniques to bleed the heat off but at 800mph it's not too hot for an airframe to handle. It's definitely too hot for a human though. It's tough to give an exact temperature as it would depend on a huge range of factors but it would be somewhere between 200°F or around 93°C if not hotter. You would only survive a sustained few moments of that at most.</p>
<p>How fast all this happens depends on how fast you accelerate but there's no doubt at 800mph your screaming days are over. If there was any screaming to be done, you did it involuntarily long before you broke the sound barrier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a pressurised compartment or spacesuit or something, the air between your mouth and ears isn't moving relative to you, so things are normal. If the air is moving past you faster than the speed of sound, (either you or the air can be moving) the sound from your mouth may not be able to travel through the air to your ears.<br />
You might still hear something due to sound waves propagating through your bones, but it's more likely that you'd not because the air around your head would be pressurised by ram pressure and probably deafen you.
This reasoning may well be invalid because air behaves differently when it is hitting your face at hundreds of metres per second to when it is unimpeded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A final note; <em>Antivirus software is your last line of defense.</em>  If you're worried about security there are many layers that go on top of the AV.

I don't think Nietzsche was outright saying that there is no God but that if you consider the possibility of no god, that means whatever basis you had for &quot;good&quot; is now gone. </p>
<p>What can happen is since there is no more basis for right or wrong, people will lose hope and find life meaningless and futile and become nihilists. Or if you're a strong enough individual, you create your own set of values and live your life on your terms and become an &quot;uberman&quot; or ubermensch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nietzsche's &quot;Ubermensch&quot; is the goal that society should set for itself in the process of rejecting the morality of religion, particularly the Christian/Catholic Church. Nietzsche saw the Church's influence and power over society as the sick man's victory over the healthy man, as a real perversion, etc. In short, he wasn't a fan.</p>
<p>&quot;God is dead&quot; is simply Nietzsche's way of saying that we do not have to rely on God to give meaning to life. And in effort to stave off nihilism, Nietzsche argues for the need of the &quot;Ubermensch&quot;. </p>
<p>The &quot;Ubermensch&quot; creates new values that must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the Übermensch will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch" target="_blank">Source</a>. So rather than God giving us meaning to life, <em>we</em> give ourselves that meaning.</p>
<p>Nietzsche kind of gets a bad rep, in some instances, as being this incredibly nihilistic person but in fact I think he was looking for a way to usurp the power of religion whilst also resisting nihilism and the concept of the Ubermensch was his attempt at doing so. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other half of this, which Cyclone_1 touched on, was Nietzche's &quot;Genealogy of Morals.&quot;  In ancient times, there was nothing wrong with the strong being strong.  If a person was wealthy and powerful, then it was only natural that they would be the leaders.  They were seen as being inherently better people or (often) blessed by the Gods.  This is what Nietzche calls &quot;Master Morality.&quot;</p>
<p>When Christianity came along, it inverted the moral system.  Christianity's adherents knew they were not powerful enough to overthrow the existing regimes, but they could subvert it.  This is why Christ promises that &quot;the meek shall inherit the Earth,&quot; among other things.  Now to be rich and powerful was shameful, while humility and poverty were considered virtuous.  This is what Nietzche calls &quot;Slave Morality.&quot;  Not in the sense of literal slavery, perhaps, but rather a system of morality designed to appeal to the weak, the poor, and the underclass of society.  </p>
<p>So which system of morality is better?  Nietzche says, &quot;Neither.&quot;  It is better to invent your own system of morality without caring what other people think.  Nietzche's <em>Ubermensch</em> is a person who is completely liberated and lives exactly as they please without being controlled by other people's expectations. </p>
<p>Nietzche gets a bad rap, which is not entirely deserved.  He paints Christianity as being a manipulative ideology that caters to the weakest minds, and I'm not sure he's wrong on that point.  The idea of the Ubermensch also got caught up in Nazi Germany.  So now when people hear the word, they assume you are talking about Hitler's idealized Aryan race.  This is not at all what Nietzche was talking about.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the meaning of life, where Nietzsche is considered one of the more prominent naturalists, he has two main premises.</p>
<p>Premise 1: In order for a persons life to have meaning, they must manifest the Will to Power. The will to power in this instance being overcoming limitations and self-improvement.</p>
<p>Premise 2: A person can manifest the will to power, therefore</p>
<p>Conclusion: A persons life can have meaning, so long as they manifest the will to power.</p>
<p>Nietzsche came up with the concept of the Ubermensch, which is a collection of people who live every day of their lives manifesting the will to power. In his book &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathrustra&quot;, a tightrope walker competed with another more skilled opponent, fell off of the rope and died. The main character in the book, known as Zoroaster, believed that the tightrope walker was one of the Ubermensch, as he lived every day improving himself, and facing constantly overcoming adversity. Even if he isn't the most talented, and even if he eventually is beaten by someone else better than him at his task, his life has had meaning.</p>
<p>For instance, a little old woman can be a member of the Ubermensch, if instead of wallowing in bed all day she pushes herself to walk, even if it's the most difficult thing in the world for her to do. Even if she can never do it with skill or finesse, so long as she tries her hardest to accomplish that goal, her life will have meaning so long as she does this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nietzsche's thinking focused on investigating <em>values</em>. Whenever we think about ethics, try to live a good life, or condemn others for being assholes, we are implicitly assuming some values. But what does it mean to value something? Why do we tend to share values? What is the historical source of those values? It turns out that people in different societies and at different times have different values, and so our values must have historical sources. As an example, we tend to think that cannibalism is terrible, but in some societies it is Ok. In order to understand our society and ourselves we must look towards the sources of our values. Of course, once you realize that our values have a historical source, then you realize that at some point someone made them up. Nietzsche points to several individuals who were sources of our values, such as Socrates and Jesus, as well as to various historical and political factors that contributed to the origin and development of various values systems.</p>
<p>One of the most confusing aspects of Nietzsche is this idea that our value systems are made up. It's confusing because it looks like Nietzsche is criticizing our value system by saying this, but he's not. After all, <em>all</em> value systems, everywhere, were made up at one point, so it's not like our value system is thereby worse than any other. More to the point, the thing that Nietzsche really <em>likes</em> is the activity of making up value systems. That's the way that he thinks that we impose ourselves upon the world (Will to Power). Nietzsche wants us to keep making up new value systems, not to just be stuck with the ones we are given. The &quot;ubermensch&quot; is the person who whom Nietzsche calls on to make up new value systems. The quote that &quot;God is dead&quot; is an acknowledgement that our value systems are already changing and we no longer value God in the way that people used to. As u/Cyclone_1 already noted, it might also indicate Nietzsche's liking for the creation of new value systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Newspaper columns are justified on both the left and right, which means that the left margin and the right margin are both straight (see <a href="http://www.visionengravers.com/support/images/CNCEngravingGlossary/Justification.gif" target="_blank">this image</a> for a visual explanation).</p>
<p>There are a couple of techniques you can use to get both margins straight, and usually you use a combination of both: you can use hyphenation to break up longer words, and you can adjust the spacing between words, or between individual letters.</p>
<p>In most publications you barely notice it, but newspapers typically use very narrow columns. Because they use such narrow columns, it's harder to get the text to justify correctly, and often words or letters are spaced out so far it becomes noticeable.</p>
<p>In the days before computers were used to set type, this was done by hand, and it's a very difficult thing to get exactly right: newspapers had to be printed very quickly, so text justification was often done poorly. With modern technology, the process can be automated, but now the problem is getting the software to understand what looks neat and professional to a human, and what doesn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the space on a news page used to be considered expensive real-estate back in the day. Of course, it still is today, just not so much. Even to this day, there's actually a bunch of rules that are applied to use as much of the available space as possible, and justification happens to be one of them.</p>
<p>Justification is when lines of text are spread out to use the entire line, rather than just moving to the next line when the next word won't fit. This often involves hyphenating the last word after a syllable. However, this isn't possible for single-syllable words, and a highly spaced out line like what you're referencing is the result. </p>
<p>Some other rules involve wording article titles so that the entire width of the article is used (for however many lines long the title is; usually no more than two), and making sure that the story uses the entire length of the column it's allocated--no more, no less. This second rule usually involves omitting sections of the original story, adding a few &quot;needless&quot; lines, or in modern days where we can waste space anyway, adding a quote block from the story. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The heart is identified with love, and with courage, probably because people noticed that your heart beats fast in either instance. No matter what your emotion, you don't feel anything in your brain, but you do &quot;feel&quot; fear in your guts etc . . . so for a long time people associated these organs with feelings.</p>

On the relation to love, back in ancient times, specifically Egypt, the heart was thought of as the center of all emotion and reasoning. Since the heart is connected to all the various body parts using channels, they assumed that the heart must be what controls the body.

<p>This happens most often with carbonated drinks. The lower pressure outside of the can/bottle and the heat of your body makes carbon dioxide to come out of the soda/pop/coke as you drink it. This is what causes the fizzling effect. It's cool and tasty as long as it happens in your mouth.</p>
<p>But what if the fizzling keeps going on after you've swallowed? Your esophagus was preparing to handle an ounce of liquid, but suddenly it has an ounce of liquid <em>and</em> a large volume of gas in it. It's as if you swallowed a deflated balloon and it somehow inflated itself while you were swallowing it! This causes painful stretching of the esophagus.</p>
<p>[Edit] Obviously, this is more likely to happen when the drink hasn't had enough time to fizzle out before you swallow, like when you drink straight out of a freshly opened, cold can on a hot summer day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Aspiration: food/liquid/saliva entering your trachea</p>
<p>Aspiration occurs when you have some type of dysfunction of your larynx (structure composed of and supporting vocal cords that elevates during swallow) and epiglottis (cartilage flap that closes over your larynx to protect airway when swallowing). Aspiration cause you to cough. Typically is not painful. This is what happens when people say &quot;it went down the wrong pipe.&quot; It can become an issue when it leads to aspiration pneumonia. Older folks and smokers (or other individuals whose lungs and windpipe cannot optimally clear mucus) can develop an infection of the lungs if bacteria continues to enter this area and is not cleared properly. </p>
<p>Dysphasia can be divided up into a few different categories. </p>
<p>Oral - involving the mouth, all voluntary muscle movement. Thing of someone with a paralyzed tongue trying to push a food bolus to the back of their mouth. Very difficult. </p>
<p>Oropharyngeal - a combination of voluntary and involuntary muscle movement. This phase of swallowing is basically your active swallow initiation motion followed by involuntary motion of pharyngeal muscles. Elderly with weak pharyngeal muscles, or someone who has suffered a stroke affecting this area. Additionally, at this stage, if the epiglottis fails to descend properly, aspiration can occur.</p>
<p>Esophageal - completely involuntary muscle movement. Dysphasia in this phase can be functional or mechanical. Mechanical occurs if there is some type of obstruction in the esophagus, like a ring, web, or tumor. This type of dysphasia occurs mainly with solid food and not liquid. Functional dysphagia occurs if there is some type of improper muscle motion, like lower esophageal sphincter spasm or diffuse esophageal spasm. It occurs with solid and liquid. Basically there is either a physiologic miscommunication among the nerves or a chronic problem. </p>
<p>All these types of dysphagia can present with pain in different areas based on the location of the dysfunction. Typically in the morning, a short lived cramp/pain with swallowing is likely due to an esophageal spasm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, your esophagus works in tandem with your mouth to time when it needs to start contracting and relaxing to move food into your stomach. Think of this action like moving a bead from the bottom of your toothpaste container to the opening using both hands instead of one.</p>
<p>When you swallow &quot;wrong&quot;, you might grab some air instead of the soda at first, which causes some uncomfortable pressure on your esophagus as it moves the air down into your stomach ahead of the beverage.</p>
<p>Ever notice you can give pretty rad burps after swallowing &quot;wrong&quot; like that, too?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of misinformation in this thread...</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with water going down the wrong tube. What happens is that when you normally swallow, you initiate a series of muscular contractions in your throat all the way down to your lower esophageal sphincter. These contractions will normally work to push food/drink down the esophagus into the stomach (this is why you can swallow upside down and not have food/water come out of your mouth). Think of squeezing a pea out of a straw to visualize how it works.</p>
<p>When you &quot;swallow wrong&quot;, what happens is that the muscle contractions, instead of taking place right above the bolus to push it down, actually takes place at the bolus, causing pain as the muscles squeeze the bolus, instead of pushing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
