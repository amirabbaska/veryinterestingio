The last thing you want is for someone with a vigilante mindset to find someone in their locality with the same first and last name and then &quot;take matters into their own hand&quot;.  They want to avoid mistaken identity.</p>
<p>The other reason is that in the United States it is pretty uncommon for people to go by their full first, middle, and last names.  So if there is an alleged perpetrator named &quot;James Fields&quot; and he gets wide enough publicity as &quot;James Fields&quot;, every other James Fields ends up with a bit of a smudge on their reputation, even among people who know that they had nothing to do with the infamous actor.  In other words, they get &quot;Oh...your name is James Fields, like that guy from Charlottesville&quot;.  OTOH, if the media refers to them in an uncommon way that seems unnatural, like &quot;James Alex Fields Junior&quot;, then it creates a bit of a separation between the alleged perpetrator and everyone who shares the name.  Basically, it's an attempt to avoid &quot;ruining the name&quot; rather than an attempt to avoid &quot;mistaken identity&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since no one answered yet, I'll tell you a bit (I work in a Sleep clinic).  I don't have much time, so I'll keep it truly ELI5.  </p>
<p><strong>Short Version:</strong> We are not supposed to talk in our sleep, so when it does happen it's cause something is going wrong.  And usually the reason it is happening is because of the body's failure to keep the body completely and entirely paralyzed.  </p>
<p>It most of the time takes place during the part of sleep where we more often dream (i.e. REM sleep). During this time, you body is supposed to <em>actively</em> paralyze <em>all</em> your voluntary muscles (i.e. &quot;skeletal muscles&quot;). In other words, your body is making sure you can't move, primarily, it is thought, to make sure you don't act out your dreams.  Probably so you don't kill/hurt yourself pretending to do various things.  </p>
<p>With many people, this active paralysis isn't as complete as it should be.  So occasionally people talk.  But since talking isn't per se that dangerous, there's probably not a lot of pressure for it to be eliminated (throughout the many generations of people).  </p>
<p>Most people who talk, usually don't say very much or say it very clearly/coherently.  And usually only talk briefly.  Those people who seem to have full conversations/speech/confessions are few and far in between.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>e.g. I'm going to church vs I'm going to the church.</p>
<p>The first implies you are going to church for Sunday service or similar.
The second just means you are going to the physical church building.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why they diverged on some things like hospital but not others.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, warming up brings the body from its natural state of rest closer to its exercising state during training, performing etc. Essentially, it makes the transition from rest to exercise much more efficient as our heart rate is already substantially increased due to warming up.  Our blood circulation is subsequently increased, leading to increased delivery of oxygen and removal of metabolic waste products from working muscles. Warming up allows athletes to jump straight into performance without having to worry about the stage known as oxygen deficit, where the body literally needs to take in a greater amount of oxygen to satisfy the increased demand for oxygen by the muscles. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, a cyclist that has warmed up will be able to cycle harder and faster as their heart rate, blood circulation, respiratory rate and more are already substantially increased. A cyclist that has not warmed up will need an increased amount of oxygen delivered to working muscles to satisfy the sudden increase in demand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most important reason for doing a warm up is to allow the body to prepare steadily and safely, thus preventing the possibility of an injury during the performance.  In case an athlete didn't do the warm up exercise and an injury like a hamstring strain did occur that will obviously affect the performance, otherwise a considerable difference in performance is highly unlikely.   Basically it's a matter of safety, gradually increasing the heart rate and circulation thus loosening the joints and increasing blood flow to the muscles. There is also a psychological factor that helps athlete when doing warm-up because it's an opportunity for the athlete to prepare mentally for the performance ahead.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if I'm wrong but I suspect you are asking this because of a simplified understanding of our circulatory system, thinking that arteries carry blood all the way to the end of our limbs, then the blood is carried all the way back to our heart by veins, and severing this flow means arteries are no longer connected to veins.</p>
<p>In reality there are smaller vessels branching off of the main artery constantly which go through your muscles and organs then reconnect to veins at the end. The arteries get progressively smaller as they reach the end of your limbs because of all the branches so they are carrying less blood. Similarly, veins grow larger as they get closer to your heart because of branches entering them and the veins carry more blood.</p>
<p>When you lose a limb the artery is suddenly ended and the blood simply goes through the other branches. There is higher blood pressure in that area for a little while as the artery is now too large for the amount of body it needs to feed but over time the system equalizes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you lose your limb suddenly and don't stop the bleeding, you die. </p>
<p>If you stop the bleeding but lost a significant amount of blood (this is the typical traumatic scenario), in the first minutes-hours, the circulatory system will respond to the blood deficit. The main mechanisms are constricting blood flow to nonvital tissue (the other 3 extremities) and pumping the heart faster; this is the classic picture of shock. The comparisons to manmade systems with circuits misses the enormous capacity of the circulatory system to change vessel diameter / resistance on a second-to-second basis. Long term, the rest of the body will return to its original equilibrium; you would expect a commensurate decrease in blood volume because there is less body mass (adults have more blood volume than children, it's often calculated based on body mass).</p>
<p>If you surgically removed the limb with no bleeding, you can skip the blood deficit / vasoconstriction / tachycardia portion. All the dead ends of the blood vessels will more or less slow to no flow. In the first weeks to months, there can be some pooling, mainly if gravity is pulling fluid down without an opposing muscular force to push it back up. Depending on the permeability of a given individual's blood vessels at a given moment in time, some people would have more pooling, some would have less.</p>
<p>Re: collateralization and &quot;anastomoses&quot;, these are relevant when an isolated section of the limb's circulatory network is disrupted. Cut the radial artery, the ulnar artery will continue to supply the hand. However, if you transect the entire limb perpendicular to the flow of blood, the remaining tissue has all of its circulatory network preserved and collateralization is not really relevant. The &quot;veiny&quot; hand is an example of collateralization - cut one of the veins, the others will still execute the main purpose of the hand's veins, which is to return its blood back to the heart. To correct the &quot;veiny&quot; author, veins don't supply blood, they drain blood. Notably in the hand, the veins are mainly on the back side, the arteries mainly on the palm side. The muscles in the forearm are fed by bigger arteries and drained by bigger veins, consistent with their increased muscle/tissue density; those vessels are however mostly deep to the skin so not visible. The hand is highly collateralized in general because it is an important body part (the amount of brain committed to the hand is much more than its percent surface area).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Once the tourniquet is applied, there is a rise in systemic vascular resistance which leads to increased blood pressure assuming constant cardiac output (pressure=flow x resistance) and non failing heart. This is due to the loss of a parallel 'circuit'.</p>
<p>After some time, the cardiac output will then change in a predictable way (see vascular function curve or Guyton curve if you are interested) depending on blood loss and replacement of fluids, but eventually the arteriolar resistances of all the other vascular beds will adjust (locally mediated and also via the autonomic nervous system) to maintain their own perfusion and another equilibrium point will be reached.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll tackle the &quot;why first&quot;.  So, a computer needs to be able to take input and give you output.  Whether that's deciding what is 2+2 or what it should display on screen.  Thus, we need a device that translates input to output <em>automatically</em> using electricity.</p>
<p>I'll use a MOSFET transistor as an example, as it is arguably the simplest.  There is voltage at one end (power) and ground at the other (somewhere for power to go), but the current flow is blocked by the magic of &quot;chemistry&quot;.  There is an input node <em>next to</em> the path we just discussed.  It isn't on the path, it's just reeeaally close by, separated by a small space.  When you give that node a positive voltage (input), the pathway unlocks, and the current can flow from the high voltage to ground.  </p>
<p>Now, how do we use this awesome little device?  Well, you can take a little wire of copper and connect it to the pathway from before just a little bit above the ground node, and run it to a dead end at the input node of a different transistor.  This means your first transistor's output will determine the next transistors input.  You have now created a digital IF...THEN condition.  &quot;If this happens, then that happens.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of connecting the bottom of a transistor to ground, you can connect it to the &quot;power&quot; node of a different transistor, such that the 2nd is inactive until you give input to the 1st one.  Now you have 2 switches that interact with each other based on two sets of input.</p>
<p>Mix and match these combos of transistors and you can build &quot;logic gates&quot;.  AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.  These transistor networks give a single output based on the combinations of 2+ input.</p>
<p>AND: If Bob and Terry want to get dinner, then you will go with them.  But if only 1 of them (or neither) wants to go, you won't bother.</p>
<p>OR: If either, or both, of Bob and Terry want dinner, you will go.  You just don't want to go alone.</p>
<p>These logic gates can then be wired together to make more complex things like number adders and decision trees.  At that point, you can now control numbers and IF, THEN conditions, so programming is now possible.  Hop, skip, jump, and you're at your smartphone.</p>
<p>Hope that's a coherent overview.  Source: Electrical Engineering graduate, 2012.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the gold /u/the_cosworth!  I tried to keep the explanation ELI5-appropriate, but for those wanting more details, there are some great EE explanations in comment chain below this.  They go into Bipolar Transistors, explain some of the alternate uses of transistors beyond a simple switch, etc.  There's also some linked videos in the comment chain below that are excellent little classes on the finer points.  Visuals help a ton.  I'll try to drop a comment about the &quot;magic of chemistry&quot; in a bit if anyone still wants to know that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others did Why to death (e.g. quite well) but I'm going to give a stab at the How.</p>
<p>(TL;DR :: A transistor lets one wire &quot;act like a knob&quot; to control how much power goes through another wire.)</p>
<p>So you know how they say atoms are &quot;mostly empty space&quot;? Well there are these particles that are really small (protons, electrons, neutrons) but they claim a lot of space around them. All of physics and mechanical science and such is about those &quot;claims&quot; and how they interact.</p>
<p>What do I mean by claim? You can get very close to a small fire, and even wave your hand through a candle flame, but if you build a great big bonfire there's so much heat that you can't get close. Indeed, if your fire is too big you end up standing out in the cold because the margin between close enough to be warm and too close to be comfortable becomes unworkable.</p>
<p>So particles claim space that's larger than themselves. One of their primary effective claims is &quot;charge&quot;. We talk about positive and negative charges. It turns out that those words &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; are pretty much arbitrary. (Many argue that when Ben Franklin assigned the words he got them backwards, but that's another topic for another day.)</p>
<p>So an atom is some number of protons (positive charges) glued together by neutrons if there is more than one because, um, that's how it works. (e.g. we really don't know why, at the ELI5 level, neutrons are necessary.) And for every proton the atom wants one matching electron. This is because plus and minus attract and want to make a big zero.</p>
<p>On the other hand, physics demands that there be circles (or really &quot;clouds&quot;) of electrons around every lump of positive stuff if you want that lump to be stable and happy. The first circle needs to be two electrons, then all the rest of the circles need to be eight. Why eight? Why the exception for two? More stuff that's true with no good ELI5 reason.</p>
<p>That conflict, the push-pull between one-plus-one-minus and two-or-eight is how all of chemistry works. When you see a molecule described, like water, H2O, it might be drawn as H-O-H. The little minuses are pairs of electrons, one from each of the neighboring letters. H, hydrogen, is one proton, so it has one electron, which is not two, so it borrows an electron from the Oxygen so its circle/cloud is two. Oxygen is eight positives, so it has eight electrons. It's inner cloud uses two so it's outer cloud has six, which is not eight. So it borrows an electron from each of the two hydrogens.</p>
<p>But wait! The hydrogen each borrowed one to make two, and the oxygen borrows two, so What the actual fark, amiright?</p>
<p>The electrons are very fast, so they just leap back and forth, doing double duty. So that line is a very hard, very real connection.  It's like cheating, but it's allowed. Like being stuck doing both the grill and the chili at a barbecue.</p>
<p>And that's basic chemistry.</p>
<p>Now silicon (and other things like it) are &quot;Semiconductors&quot;. They aren't good conductors, and they are not bad conductors, they are just so-so. And so &quot;semi&quot;. Meh. (Note that &quot;meh&quot; here is relative. Silicon is <em>much</em> better conductor than air or plastic, but things like gold and copper are just way, way better.)</p>
<p>And if we looked at a perfect crystal of silicon we'd see a very ordered set of lines. And being all pure like that it barely conducts electricity at all (compared to say copper). That's because each electron is exactly doing it's job.</p>
<p>So we take that pure silicon and &quot;dope it&quot;. We force it to accept some non-silicon atoms. Those atoms have just one too many, or one too few protons, which means there are one too many or one too few electrons.</p>
<p>So the resultant block has too many or too few electrons. Too many and the block is negative, Too few and the block is positive. Too many and it &quot;has electrons (it can share)&quot;. Too few and it &quot;has holes (that can accept electrons)&quot;. Either way, there's now more wiggle room for the electrons to literally skitter around and the silicon is a much better conductor than if every electron has its best spot.</p>
<p>So what happens when we mash two of those lumps, one positive and one negative, together?</p>
<p>Well the positive part &quot;borrows&quot; the electrons from the negative part and it's happy but its now back to being crappy at letting electrons through... in one direction.</p>
<p>There's the magic!</p>
<p>If I keep putting electrons on the negative side, it can keep lending them to the positive side, and I can suck them out of the far part of the positive side.</p>
<p>But if I put electrons into the positive part I just make it even more impossible for the electrons to move around.</p>
<p>It's weird, but that's a &quot;Diode&quot;.</p>
<p>Now when that two-part lump is sitting there it's inherently a match of plus and minus. And when I run electrons in part, and suck them out of the other part, the total amount of plusiness and minusiness of the whole block changes.</p>
<p>So I can take that diode and add a <em>third</em> block of stuff that's even <em>more</em> plussy or minusy than the first two. As long as I put it on the far side of the &quot;same kind of stuff&quot;. Bu that I mean I can do &quot;Positive - negative - positive&quot; or &quot;Negative - positive - negative&quot;. It's got to be three layers and one has to be &quot;stronger&quot; than the other two, hence the capital letter.</p>
<p>So after I make this three layer sandwich, when I suck electrons out of the center (in the Npn case) or add electrons to the center (in the Pnp) case, there's that diode between the capital letter and the center doing the normal diode thing.</p>
<p>But now the second magic bit.</p>
<p>As the center gets more electrons added/removed the two ends with the same doping become able to &quot;see each other&quot;.</p>
<p>Understand that a &quot;Pp&quot; or an &quot;Nn&quot; block of silicon will just pass the electrons on after wasting some of the energy as heat.</p>
<p>So as you feed the interruption in the middle the electrons start to be able to go all the way through.</p>
<p>The more you stimulate the middle, the more electricity can get from end-to-end.</p>
<p>If you stimulate the middle &quot;enough&quot; it's like the middle piece was just removed.</p>
<p>So what does that practically mean?</p>
<p>At low currents a transistor is an amplifier. Put a little power on the center and a <em>proportionally</em> larger power can flow from end-to-end.</p>
<p>At higher currents, known as the &quot;saturation current&quot;, the transistor becomes an on-off switch.</p>
<p>So the transistors in your radio amplify the tiny signals received over the air into the big signals necessary to move your speakers and make sound.</p>
<p>And the transistors in your computer, being operated at saturation, can do &quot;logic&quot; because by using switches in groups you do that AND/OR/NOT stuff.</p>
<p>Finally, the smaller a transistor is, they less energy needs to be put on that center part, and the less heat is generated as the electricity flows from N-to-n or P-to-p.</p>
<p>So big honking transistors can operate real-world things (your stereo) and lots of tiny transistors can become a phone or a computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A transistor is a fast, reliable, and miniaturizable device allowing electricity to control itself. There are different types which work somewhat differently, but the basic operation is that there are two terminals plus a control terminal. In operation the current between the two main terminals is controlled by the voltage on the control terminal. The most basic use is as an amplifier: a small signal on the control terminal can control a large current, for example to transform the signal from the needle on a record player to something that can be fed to a loudspeaker. Things get better when you allow a process to feed back on itself. For example if you apply a phase shifted version of the voltage on one of the main terminals to the control you get an oscillator, so can build radio transmitters, for example. If you have a whole bunch of transistors you can do a simple computation on some set of inputs, each input being high or low voltage (representing <code>0" or</code>1&quot;). If you can do simple computations, you can take the output and periodically feed it back as input to the same circuit. You then have a computer.</p>
<p>There are other devices that can similarly allow circuits to control themselves. For example vacuum tubes can in many ways be nicer for radios and such. But vacuum tubes are big, complex, and have a filament that burns out rapidly and breaks under mechanical stress. The size also causes speed limitations. Relays are great for designing computers with, but are also big, slow, and expensive with moving parts to wear out. Transistors on the other hand are produced by chemically altering a solid piece of semiconductor. They are shockproof, and don't have fragile or moving parts. They can be tiny and can be mass produced. The last point is a huge understatement, since now we build millions on the same piece of semiconductor, so you can have thousands of times the computing power of a building full of vacuum tubes in an inexpensive chip smaller than your fingernail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to think of a transistor is like an electronic switch. You can turn off the flow of current by applying a much smaller current to the transistor.</p>
<p>So imagine the flow of current in a circuit like cars on the street. The transistor is a stop light. When the light is green, the cars can flow. When the light is red, they stop.</p>
<p>Because electricity wants to keep flowing, with multiple transistors you can control the flow of electricity and use it to perform simple (or not so simple!) tasks. Imagine a circuit with two transistors. You could set it up so that if one transistor is on, a light lights up, and if both are on, two lights light up. Now you've made an extremely simple calculator that can only do 1+1.</p>
<p>Modern electronics are built off of the Integrated Circuit, which is actually thousands and thousands of extremely tiny transistors on a silicon chip. So imagine my silly little two transistor circuit. If you had many more transistors, you could make it do all kinds of things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some comments here have addressed what task the transistor performs but it is not just the transistor that can perform these operations. We have other components that can perform the same task but they can't be shrunk. Computer circuitry is actually immensely complicated. It has to be shrunk down to a microscopic level to be capable of the sophisticated computations of the modern era while still fitting in one room. The transistor is a device that we can make at a very small size. Before transistors we had vacuum tubes and before them, relays. They were used to do essentially the same thing but those parts are far bigger and less reliable than a transistor. Vacuum tubes also get too hot, another one of several disadvantages. If we tried to build a modern desktop computer with vacuum tubes or relays, it wouldn't fit in your house. Being able to built a massive circuit with parts that are smaller than a blood cell is a big reason why transistors are seen as crucial to the existence of modern computational capabilities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you try to squeeze out the peanut butter, especially if you don't open the ziplock first, you risk popping the bag, getting poolwater in your ziplock and/or peanut butter in your pool</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pimples that don't bleed tend to be really close to the surface and the skin is usually prety healed up around them.  These don't bleed because they're in the epidermis (top layer) or the very top of the dermis (2nd layer).  These parts of the skin don't have a lot of blood in them. Also, the inflammation is usually already gone. </p>
<p>On the other hand, bleeders are usually the big, deep, tender pimples or fresh ones. These are in a deeper part of the dermis, where there's more blood to begin with. Also, inflammation brings liquid with it.  When you squeeze out a pimple, you might notice some clear fluid along with the blood and pimple gunk. This is a sign that the blood vessels in the area are leaky (also because of inflammation).  Squeezing the area to death can result in squeezing out blood vessels as well as pimple goo. </p>
<p>Tldr: little, healed pimples don't bleed because they're healed. Big, new, or inflamed pimples bleed because inflammation brings in blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh man I have done so many dermatology electives in medical school for this one question.</p>
<p>Comedones or acne, form in the skin from a couple of factors:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Fatty acids from acne bacteria  </li>
<li>Your body maxing sebum that is more scaley  </li>
<li>Inflammation factors from the agitated immune system  </li>
<li>Male hormones  </li>
<li>Smoking  </li>
<li>Milk products  </li>
</ul>
<p>The pores that produce sebum are a kind of gland cell that ruptures and pours out all it's contents. If it gets inflammed it makes a closed comedone or a whitehead.
If it gets clogged in the outlet, you get more blackheads or open comedones.
Sometimes the material that gets stuck dries up, but the sebum gland keeps adding to it underneath. When you &quot;pop&quot; the blackhead you tear the skin holding it in and bleed a bit.
With whiteheads if they have enough of a layer of skin on them they need a good effort to pop, and that effort ruptures the blood vessels to the skin, or the blood vessels in muscles that attach to the skin (lip muscles, chin muscles, forehead muscles) that have a blood supply right near the surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

She also read lips by touch. My question is, how did she get there? I know many words can be taught by touch (sign &quot;Apple&quot;, have the person touch an apple), but what about more abstract stuff? Or the alphabet, for that matter? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse that works with DeafBlind individuals, hopefully I can explain this well! </p>
<p>For most things, it's all about teaching the concept behind the idea.  And using all other available senses. Also, repetition. </p>
<p>For an apple, you can sign with AITSL (adapted interactive tactile sign language - hand over hand) the sign for apple. Have them eat an apple, sign it again. Smell apples, sign it again. Feel the apple, sign it again. Etc. </p>
<p>For more abstract concepts - for example, laundry - seems simple enough.  It's easy to teach someone the <em>skill</em> of doing laundry, but <em>why</em> do we do it. Because things are dirty, of course.  But if you cant see the dirt, or get the concept of the clothes being 'dirty', it seems silly as to why we put out clothes in this machine.  So we have to start with teaching 'dirty', go I. The garden, get messy, feel/smell the dirt on your clothes.  Then teach the concept of clean.  Then putting it all together, explaining that the machine takes the clothes from dirty to clean.  This is a painstakingly long process, and also relies alot on the DeafBlind individuals cognitive abilities. </p>
<p>Also, keep in mind, most DeafBlind folks have some residual hearing and vision.  One client I support just requires that we sign for her about 2-4 inches right in front of her left eye, as that's where her visual field is. </p>
<p>I hope that helps! </p>
<p>Edit: Gold?!?! Thank you, a hundred times over, kind strangers!!
Also I've had a lot of requests for an AMA, I'm totally going to do it, stay tuned! And thank you all for the overwhelming interest in what I have to say!! And especially to OP for asking the question that started all of this awesome dialogue :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a newer communication system, Protactile, which came from the Deafblind community. It involves signing in a tactile manner, as well as 'backchannelling&quot;, which is tapping on the speaker's body to indicate you are following, like a sighted person would nod or make noises like hmmmm to indicate being engaged in the conversation. This allows persons with Deafblindness to speak directly with one another. An awesome Deafblind writer, John Lee Clark has very interesting pieces on Tumblr, if you are interested in work by someone who lives this experience.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's been a long time since i read that but it essentially involved a form of the tactile signing others have explained, plus a lot of repetition and exposure. She gave the example of being taught the signs to spell the word water, and having her hand placed under running water by her teacher. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The wind turbine has a rotation rate that extracts the maximum energy, as a function of windspeed.  If all the turbines are made by the same company, and they are all in the same wind, then that optimization process is likely to have them turning at very similar rates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
