Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are both things you wouldn't want to ingest by themselves, but mix them in just the right quantities and you get salt water. Reactions like this are called <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_ocr_21c/chemical_synthesis/whychemicalsrev10.shtml" target="_blank">neutralization reactions</a>.</p>
<p>That said, <strong>do not try this</strong>, as even a small imbalance will leave behind enough of one or the other to give you serious chemical burns. For an example, look at the titration curve in the linked example. It swings very suddenly from being a very strong acid to a very strong base -- you would have to be extremely lucky to get anything near neutral.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>0*3 = 0</p>
<p>3 = 0/0</p>
<p>3 = 0 which is false. Therefore 0/0 cannot be equal to 0.</p>
<p>But the problem is that they are contradicting themselves, and here is why:</p>
<p>If we were to go crazy and assume 0/0 = 0,</p>
<p>lets do the similar problem again</p>
<p>3 * 0 = 0</p>
<p>Now, to send 0 to the other side we have divide both sides by 0, so</p>
<p>(3*0)/0 = 0/0</p>
<p>Then, we can rewrite it as,</p>
<p>3*(0/0) = 0/0</p>
<p>Since this is a special case where we are assuming 0/0 =0</p>
<p>it again becomes, 3*0 = 0 which in fact is just 0 = 0</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>3 * 0 = 0</p>
<p>(3*0)/0 = 0/0</p>
<p>3*(0/0) = 0/0</p>
<p>3 * 0 = 0</p>
<p>0 = 0</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let's look at an equation like 3 • 5 = 15. Easy. Now watch how we can take that equation and turn it into 3 = 15 ÷ 5. Also easy.</p>
<p>Now let's put zero in the mix. 3 • 0 = 0. Okay. So then it would follow that 3 = 0 ÷ 0. And if we change 3 to 4, we would get 4 • 0 = 0 and 4 = 0 ÷ 0.</p>
<p>Division by 0 is undefined because it isn't equal to any one value. It could be equivalent to anything we like using the above reasoning. This is a problem because the arithmetic operations are actually functions like you learn about in algebra, and functions are only allowed to have one single output for any given input.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that zero isn't just a number, it represents &quot;something&quot;.  Or in this case, zero represents nothing and you can't divide by nothing.  If you tried to divide 1 by 0, that's impossible because you can't divide by something that isn't there.  Same goes for when you try to divide 0 by 0.</p>
<p>Another example.  Let's say you have four apples.  You have to define how you're going to divide up those apples.  You can divide by two, so you'll have two groups, but you can't have no groups at all -- you'll always have at least 1 group with 4 apples in it. </p>
<p>Now, you can divide 0 by 1 because you can divide nothing up however many times you want but you'll still have nothing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p>Let's &quot;pretend&quot; that 0/0 is defined and has a numeric value. If we do so, then let us write this:</p>
<p>0*3=0</p>
<p>By algebra, let us divide by zero:</p>
<p>0/0=3</p>
<p>Let's try it again, but this time using 0 instead of 3.</p>
<p>0*0=0</p>
<p>0/0=0</p>
<p>Since we stated above that zero divided by zero is equal to three and it is also equal to zero, then:</p>
<p>3=0</p>
<p>Since 3 is definitely not equal to 0, there is a problem in the math. This is part of the reason why the value is undefined. It appears that we can let zero divided by zero equal anything, which is not arithmetically possible. That is why it is undefined in mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coolness often rests in detachment - a character isn't affected by their surroundings or showing much emotion. Smoking allows a character an opportunity to exhibit this detachment in a way many activities can't. Eating is noisy, both in visuals and sound. Walking generally puts the focus on the surroundings, rather than the character, and involves a lot of movement. Smoking is much more reserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoking is very &quot;analog&quot;. You have fire, smoke, caustic smells, so it suggests the character in question is sort of unpretentious, down to earth. It also has a long history with society, so regardless of its actual nature, it does have a pedigree of sorts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoking is hazardous to your health, but a character who smokes clearly doesn't care for such sensibilities. This is related to coolness-as-detachment - it's a mild, relatively clean way of showing that the character does not feel obligated to respect a common societal norm.</p>
</li>
<li>Smoking lets the audience connect with the character during otherwise uncrowded scenes. If a character is smoking, the viewer doesn't need to constantly wonder where the scene is going or what they are supposed to be paying attention to. In such scenes, the cigarette means the character is relaxing, clearing their mind in solitude. Without the cigarette, the mental state of the character is less clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an aside, I am sometimes  jealous of smokers from time to time, because if a smoker goes outside and just feels the night air for a bit, takes a few minutes to themselves, then no one questions them. If I do the same, then people are looking out the window, asking you what you're doing out there, why are you outside, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple reasons in my mind as someone who is starting now to work on feature films. </p>
<p>Firstly, cigarettes are relatable and have been around forever. So even if we may know they are bad we can still see them as something that the &quot;bad guy&quot; has been doing in movies forever! And a lot of times the good guy too. Cigarettes are more widely known and relatable than vaping, though some movies are now using that too. Relatabilitty to a character is key whether they are good or bad. And this plays into the next part...</p>
<p>Smoking allows insight into a character and can often be a flaw despite it looking &quot;cool&quot;. For example of a bad guy, let's imagine Grimsrud from &quot;Fargo&quot;. He is a bad dude and his demeanor, his silence and his smoking clues is in on this almost immediately. As a matter of fact I believe Steve buscemis character even mentions the smoking and asks to roll up a window. So smoking is a negative, silence is a negative, and being a silent smoker who is a behmouth of a person is a negative. Right away we know he is out villain. Now imagine a good guy who smokes like McClane in &quot;Die Hard&quot;. This guy is our hero and a total badass. Now, the smoking does lend itself to the feeling of a badass but also resonates with the audience as a character flaw. Here's this dude going through a rough patch and he's a smoker who becomes a hero. The smoking deepens our understanding of who he is without us being told. </p>
<p>Another reason it may be this way is to show antime period. &quot;Mad Men&quot; is the easy example here. People smoked everywhere back then! The show even deals with the early fallout for advertisers as research on cigarettes and health developed. And the characters think it's bullshit. This really helps sell us this time period and provides some irony. Here are advertisers working for lucky strike who think the cigarette health risks are bullshit. But we are in 2017 and we know better than them which gives us a bit more emotional investment. </p>
<p>Lastly, smoking just looks good on camera. Whispy smoke=cinema good. Flammable things=gold. Hazy rooms that create nice pillars of light=wet dreams for directors and cinematographers. It just lends itself to looking great on camera and because it looks great on camera we think it looks cool.</p>
<p>The last reality is that today smoking is bad and we know this. And things that are taboo or are wrong always look cool! Do any of us want to go blow up a hospital? No, but god did the joker look badass doing it! Do any of us want to rob a bank? No, but every time we watch a movie about it it sure looks fun! Taboo activities are fun and exciting to see because it allows us as normal folks to get a tiny little taste of what it might be like to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;. </p>
<p>I predict in another few decades (if vaping isn't halted by the FDA) that we will see a lot of movies start to use vaping in films. But the cigarettes won't vanish. Both will be in play. I myself have written a feature script (unproduced as of yet) that takes place 70+ years in the future where the American legal system had been revamped into a type of very strict law enforcement that dishes out eye for an eye punishment. My main character in the film vapes. Why? Because it is a flaw since he is not all good but also because in this world cigarettes have been outlawed and only vaping remains allowed as a safer alternative. So all at once it serves to demonstrate a character flaw, the world my characters live in, and provides us the same type of cinematography and aesthetic appearance that cigarettes would have. And likewise, one side character still sneaks real cigarettes from a stash he's amassed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is to highlight a character's rebelliousness and all that this represents. However, I believe that it is the cinematography of smoking which is what keeps it alive in movies. It's because burning things and smoke do cool visual things, more than &quot;this character is inhaling tobacco&quot;. Which is why you never see vaping. It also allows for nonverbal dialogue enhancers.</p>
<p>Smoking can affect the lighting in different ways. A lighter close to the face lights up a face in the dark. So can a slow drag on a cigarette. The smoke can obscure things and dance around in the light. </p>
<p>The actor has a prop that can say things that dialogue can't. Especially in close ups. Blowing smoke in someone's face shows contempt. Fidgeting with a cig can show stress or anxiety. A slow pull with a raised eyebrow shows contemplation. No character <em>needs</em> to smoke, disrupting dialogue to have a character take a smoke break won't happen for realism. Smoking just allows visual shorthand to a lot of cliches that smokers and nonsmokers understand without dialogue easier than other nonverbal cues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The moment you feel the slightest inkling of a canker sore coming on (or you bite your cheek or otherwise injure your mouth), immediately rinse with standard H202. Do this a few times a day until the threat has passed. I just take a swig out of the bottle and swish it around for about 30 seconds. I don't rinse with water (or drink water) for at least 15 minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>Using this method I have been mostly canker sore free for years. Even when one gets started, prompt and consistent application of Hydrogen Peroxide makes the sore heal quicker and be much less intense.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you fellow sufferers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a great question! The mouth and eyes tend to swell more than other parts of the body (like the back, for example) likely for a couple of reasons. One the eyes and mouth have many many blood vessels which means there is going more edema (fluid leaking) and more inflammation (more immune cells which release chemicals or cytokines that can promote swelling). Second, both the areas have very thin skin which means the swelling is more pronounced. That why if you get punched in the eye or lip (vs the back), the area swells fast. Clinically it changes the way I practice. For example, when I do surgery around the eye/upper cheek or do filler in the lip, I have the patient ice for a few hours immediately after to reduce the swelling. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am a dermatologist but I can't offer medical advice via Reddit, and anything I say is not a substitute for a personal consultation with a doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><em>The cause is not completely understood, but involves a T cell-mediated immune response triggered by a variety of factors.</em></p>
<p>T-Cells are big part of your body's response when you have an allergic reaction or are fighting an infection.  So it makes sense that, since canker sores are caused by that action, that they would swell up (and hurt and be hot) just like a cut that is infected.</p>
<p>It's basically your body having an infection reaction without actually having an infection (since research has shown no evidence of bacterial causes).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now there is a particular switch (NaV1.9) that gets turned on by the cold and it has the effect of making the other switches easier to activate. So if it's cold, NaV1.9 is in the on position and that makes the pain switches trip faster and more frequently...enhancing the pain sensation.</p>
<p>Basically it sort of sucks that the same switches that cause pain are also sensitive to temperature changes. The reason for the cold pain is that you probably want to know your finger is freezing   <em>before</em> it dies of frostbite. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they do. To reiterate a few other comments, there's a part of the brain called the fusiform face area (FFA) that becomes more active when we're viewing a face. </p>
<p><a href="http://vpnl.stanford.edu/documents/golaraigrill-spectorgabrieliTICS2008.pdf" target="_blank">Here's a review article</a> about how this part of the brain changes as we grow up. It's from 2008, which is relatively early days of studying the development of FFA, so the findings that it reports on are a little mixed, but the general result is that the face-specificity of the FFA emerges as we grow up. In other words, that region of brain starts off not so good at distinguishing between faces and objects, but with age (and experience) comes to only activate when viewing faces.</p>
<p><a href="http://vpnl.stanford.edu/papers/GolaraiCerebCortex2015.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> had 7 to 11 year-olds and adults look at faces of kids and adults while undergoing fMRI scanning. They found a portion of adult brains around the right FFA that processed kid and adult faces differently, whereas that same region in kid brains processed kid and adult faces similarly. This doesn't exactly answer your question, but it does at least suggest that age and experience change how our brains process faces. </p>
<p>If you're interested in finding out more, I pulled these papers from <a href="http://vpnl.stanford.edu/publications.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Kalanit Grill-Spector's lab at Stanford</a>. She's a face-processing expert, and one of the few who is also doing brain imaging work with children.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>tl;dr there is a reduction in face recognition memory, facial emotion recognition, and other face processing tasks as we age; these changes may be due to reduction of neural response specificity to various stimuli (&quot;dedifferentiation&quot;), but these may be offset by some compensatory cortical reorganization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;helium shortage&quot; is actually a reaction to massive helium stockpiling of the US starting with the Helium Act of 1925 for use in airships and later on as a coolant during the Cold War and the Space Race. The idea was that it may be a critical natural resource similar to oil, but the progression of technology determined that it wasn't really that important and it was decided that the billion cubic meters of the gas we had collected should be sold off.</p>
<p>This dramatically dropped the price of helium for decades, as the US government was selling a seemingly unlimited supply off at bargain prices. The &quot;shortage&quot; is that the US is coming to the end of their fire sale of helium which means the price will begin to rise to the actual cost of production, which means applications designed around the historically low cost of helium now are looking at a big price bump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a shortage, and there isn't likely to be much of one in the future.</p>
<p>Helium can be collected as a by-product of natural gas extraction.
The US has large, helium-rich natural gas reserves, and during the Cold War, stockpiled it into strategic reserves.  When they decided to liquidate those reserves starting in the 1990s, it depressed the price of helium.  People go used to cheap helium, and it became unprofitable to collect from natural gas and was simply allowed to escape into the atmosphere.  In addition, one particularly large helium reserve in the US is starting to run dry, and is expected to be depleted by the 2020s.</p>
<p>Should there be a shortage of helium, the price will rise, and it will once again become profitable to collect it, increasing supply.  This is  in fact already happening.  Qatar has nearly tripled their helium production since 2008, and has become the second largest producer in the world.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Basically, we waste so much helium when going after fossil fuels, that if helium were to become more valuable, they would extract the helium instead of just letting it go into the atmosphere.  With the price of helium as it is now, it's not worth their time to extract it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a very good question. It's not that there is a shortage of helium it is that while the supply of helium is steady, the demand is increasing. As long as there is uranium in the earths crust, we will have helium getting trapped in non porous rock and mixing with natural gas and petroleum. </p>
<p>The constant but limited supply, changes in usage and storage, and increased demand has however caused prices to rise. Novelty uses for helium simply charge more for their products to make up the difference, but it's use in science is usually not for profit. And so it puts a dent in the budget of universities and scientific research. </p>
<p>Scientific use scenarios often reclaim any helium used in the experiments so the net loss is low. But novelty uses allow the helium to leak into the atmosphere, float up to space and literally float away. That is the real problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not in most medical situations.</p>
<p>X-rays behave roughly the same as normal light, but have a much higher energy. This means they go through objects easier, which is how we're able to use them to look at bones and other things. This is obviously handy for medicine and engineering, but not very useful for taking photographs with them.</p>
<p>There are ways of steering and focusing x-rays, that usually work with a complex array of mirrors as it's easier to reflect the x-rays than change their direction using normal lens effects. This is both complex and expensive though, and is usually only used for very specific applications. As always, more info on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>To get around this problem, most people use a very large sensor, or piece of film, and place it directly behind whatever they want to look at. If the x-rays come through straight enough, you can get a sharp enough image to be useful.</p>
<p>So to answer the original question, yes, x-rays can have a depth of field, but only if you're working with focusing x-ray optics systems, which most people don't.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, there is no lens used to create an x-ray image, so there are no depth of field problems. Ideally the part of the body that you are imaging is placed directly on the imaging detector, and then you get an accurate image caused by an attenuation pattern. There are a whole bunch of other exposure issues, but these are related to other issues such as the amount of radiation used, and the energy of the x-ray photons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of misconceptions in many of the answers here. X-rays are just light. They are electromagnetic waves. The same equations dictate how light works at all wavelengths and energies. People just don't seem to know much about cutting edge x-ray imaging.</p>
<p>Medical x-rays project from a small source, through your body, onto a detector. That's called &quot;point projection.&quot; There is blurring but it's not a &quot;depth of field.&quot; Blurring in point projection comes from the source not being a point, and from the subject not standing still, and from diffraction of x-ray light through the subject.</p>
<p>Beyond medical x-rays, scientists have <em>numerous</em> ways of controlling x-ray light. At synchrotron and free-electron lasers, the source is incredibly bright, and incredibly small. They can even generate coherent light, like a laser. X-rays have diffraction, interference, attenuation, just like any light.</p>
<p>The most common x-ray lenses are <strong>curved, glancing-incidence mirrors.</strong> They work by a phenomena called &quot;total internal reflection.&quot; Think about visible-light and water (or window glass). At normal incidence, water (glass) is mostly transparent. But at glancing incidence (like when you're at the beach or on a boat) light at low angles is strongly reflected. The same thing happens with x-rays. At normal incidence, reflection is weak. At glancing incidence (think 1 or 2 degrees, or smaller), the reflection can be strong, <em>if the surface is exceptionally smooth</em>. So if you put a smooth curved mirror into an x-ray beam, you can steer the light to a focus. A two dimensional version is a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror pair: one for horizontal and one for vertical, often displaced along the beam.</p>
<p>Another way to focus x-rays is with <strong>refraction.</strong> This typically works at high energies only. The index of refraction is slightly less than 1 for x-rays, so refractive lenses have a shape that's <em>the opposite</em> of regular lenses. Think of an empty space in a material that the x-rays can penetrate. So take a block of Beryllium, or Aluminum, drill some holes in it, and the x-rays will bend and focus.</p>
<p>Another way is to use what are referred to as <strong>Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP) lenses.</strong> They are typically alternating rings of light and dark (i.e. binary) or alternating phase-shifting material. They work by diffraction. So if you know how a diffraction grating works, imagine making one that's circular or cylindrical. Tune the line density so that all the rays focus to one point. FZPs are essentially holograms of a simple, single lens. Because of the short wavelengths involved, FZPs are typically small. There are big ones beyond 1 cm, but most used for high quality imaging are well under 1 mm.</p>
<p>Another kind of x-ray lens is called a <strong>multilayer laue lens</strong> (MLL). It's similar to a zoneplate, but made in a different way that allows the zones to be smaller.</p>
<p>All of these are ways to focus x-ray light: reflection, refraction, diffraction. They all have a wavelength, numerical aperture, a focal length, and a <em>depth of focus</em>. The diffractive ones are miraculously good, but suffer from chromatic aberrations, meaning that the properties change with wavelength.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are different energy ranges called x-rays. Medical x-rays are called <em>hard x-rays.</em> At lower energies there are <em>tender x-rays</em>, and below that <em>soft x-rays</em>, then <em>extreme ultraviolet</em> and <em>vacuum ultraviolet</em> before coming to the parts you're more familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>Why do scientists care about x-rays?</strong> Good question. Soft x-rays are amazingly good probes of matter. Every element, and every chemical has a signature in the absorption spectrum that allows us to identify very minute amounts of materials, and to see how they are bound to their neighbors. With circularly polarized x-rays you can study magnetism. With their short wavelengths, you can take x-ray images and resolve features down to about the size of chromosomes, around 10 nm. You can label biological samples and probe them at that length scale. You can make non-destructive measurements of things like soil samples, batteries, and comet pieces captured in space. Another killer app for x-rays is protein crystallography. The wavelength is close to the spacing between atoms. So you can take a small amount of something like a new drug or a protein in the body, and with diffraction and reconstruction, you can see precisely how the atoms are arranged, structurally. You can see how proteins fold and give molecules the properties they have.</p>
<p>TD;DR: X-Rays are awesome. They are also just... light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With typical radiographs, the biggest factor in the &quot;focus&quot; of the image is actually what's known as geometric unsharpness. </p>
<p>The geometric unsharpness is determined by the source size (smaller is sharper), source-to-object distance (farther is sharper) and object-to-film/detector distance (closer is sharper). </p>
<p>It works much the same way as casting shadow puppets on your wall. Moving the flashlight away from the wall and your hand closer will produce a sharper shadow, while moving your hand away or the light closer will cause enlargement and loss of definition of the shadow. </p>
<p>There are other things, like using lead screens, which reduce the number of low-energy photons that interact with the film, which can help produce a sharper image. </p>
<p>Additionally, an improper film development process can ruin what should have been a sharp image. </p>
