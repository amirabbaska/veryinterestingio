		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an adult who was diagnosed with ADHD as a child (called ADD at the time). Thanks to the video that was on the front page a few days ago, I was recently introduced to the work of Dr. Russell Barkley. Much of what he said about ADHD being primarily an impairment of executive function sounded like it made a lot of sense, and it matched up very well with my own experience of my disability. Is this a well established theory of the cause and nature of ADHD? Is it well supported by the work of other researchers, or is Dr. Barkley on the fringe? If it goes against the consensus, then what is the consensus? Or what are competing theories?</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR1IZJXc6d8" target="_blank">video</a> that summarizes his ideas.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR</strong>: <em>Executive function deficit is widely accepted as an effect of ADHD but not as a cause. It fails to explain the entire set of common ADHD symptoms.</em></p>
<p>The most commonly accepted explanation for ADHD symptoms relates to the the production and uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Shortly, the idea is that failures to adequately utilize these neurotransmitters (associate with reward, alertness, and arousal) causes the people afflicted with ADHD to seek other easy sources of these. This means that high reward tasks are more attractive and novelty is more important.</p>
<p>It's also true that executive functions are impacted by this neurochemical deficiency. Executive functions require the ability to self regulate and the ability to essentially force reward temporarily in exchange for greater reward later. If one says, &quot;I must complete this homework so that I can play outside later&quot; part of the process is simply making the decision, but another equally important part is keeping the brain engaged and active during the 'low reward' part of that task. People with ADHD experience difficulty with that second part.</p>
<p>To answer your question directly; yes the executive model is widely accepted, but moreso as a partial model of the symptoms and as a note on the practical implications of non-pharmaceutical / behavioral therapy. The executive model is not a pathological model nor does it explain 100% of ADHD symptoms. The most accepted pathological model (see above) explains the executive deficits as well as other symptoms such as hyperactivity, fidgeting, and sleeping difficulties seen acutely in children. The neurochemical deficit model also points to the obvious and effective pharmacological treatment for most suffers; stimulants.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm afraid of my post getting deleted because I didn't include sources, so here's a random metanalysis (not that linking even 20 metaanalyses would prove concensus). In a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00439-009-0694-x" target="_blank">2009 meta-analysis of genetic causes of ADHD</a> plausible genetic components for ADHD were reviewed. The authors point to variations in DAT1 (dopamine transport), DRD4, DRD5 (dopamine receptors), 5HTT (serotonin transport) HTR1B (Hydroxytryptamine receptor), SNAP25 (a synapse transport protein), and DBH (enzyme for dopamine-&gt;norepinephrine conversion). I think the genetic components themselves go pretty far to support the most widely accepted cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered how credit processing fees effect large businesses (and various size businesses).  Here in Oregon we have very large grocery store that does not accept credit cards.  It also seems more and more common for gas stations to have cash prices different from credit prices.  I carry cash for small purchases like a soda from a minimart, but how does it add up for the store owner if I use my credit card for my $1.50 purchases?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how much can a company save if they do not take credit cards?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other commenters have done a great job explaining credit card transaction fees, but the answer to this particular piece of your question is quite subjective and somewhat intangible.  Businesses save money <em>per transaction</em> by accepting only cash - there's no doubt about that.  This is a great business model for your local ice cream parlor, barber shop, or small business where they tailor to a specific community.  Here's the kicker - how many transactions/customers are you losing because you only accept cash?  Many people carry little to no cash in today's digitally-driven world and therefore don't patronize cash-only businesses.  Businesses therefore need to plan accordingly, whether by having cash-specific prices (gas stations), minimum electronic transaction amounts (popular in bars/pubs), or pricing products/services accordingly to cover the expected transaction fees.  Credit card companies have obviously figured this out and have made themselves indispensable, ingraining themselves into the global economy and introducing strategic new products (cash back rewards, frequent flyer miles, etc.) and services (fraud protection, purchase protection, global helpline, etc.).  Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like some others said, 2.5-3% but it's a complicated question because the interchange rate is dependent on a few things (merchant, merchant type, purchase type, amount charged, platform).  </p>
<p>Merchant is just the store that has the credit card terminal.  All of the interchange rates can be negotiated by the merchant. So for example, Walmart has a lot lower fee that your local mom and pop's store since they have a lot of leverage. </p>
<p>Merchant type is grocery store, gas station, retail, etc.  Because of the different margins of those businesses the interchange fee can be different.  </p>
<p>Purchase type is card present, card not present. These are different because fraud rates differ depending on how cards are used.  You can probably guess card not present (online purchases) have a higher fraud rate and thus a higher interchange rate.</p>
<p>Amount charged mattered because in a lot of cases there is a minimum charge of a few cents for each transaction + a percentage of the transaction (e.g. $0.15 + 1.5%).  So small purchases can actually be more costly to a merchant on a percentage basis.</p>
<p>Platform and network is the probably the most important. You have MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express,  for example. And  they all have their own payment systems and fee matrixes. Here is Visa's matrix in PDF. Amex tends to be the most expensive. Furthermore, within each matrix there are different platforms.  For example Visa has (had) Visa Platinum, Visa signature and some others.  The reason they have these is to attract different types of spenders through additional benefits.  Visa signature people tend to spend a lot more than Visa Platinum so the interchange rate is higher.</p>
<p>Anyways this was just an overview. It's a little bit more complicated than this.  I used to be a business analyst for a major credit card company for years so I was just going off the top of my head.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1.5-3% of the transaction is what I pay.  AMEX is the highest and pretty much set by AMEX.  There isn't a lot of negotiation room with them.  Visa and MasterCard have more haggle room with them.   You also pay some additional flat fees.  There is a small swipe fee on some cards + the transaction %. If I hand key in the card number there are additional fees because that is considered a higher risk transaction.   Debit card cost me less since there isn't reward and kick back programs the fees have to cover.
Then there is a batch settle fee.  Whenever you settle your terminal with the cc processor.  Some companies will only do this once a week to save this fee and that is at some transaction will sit on your card as &quot;pending&quot; for so long.  We settle nightly.  Cost a bit more but we get paid faster.</p>
<p>The actually bill I get each month is several pages long and confusing as heck.   So many little charges that really add up. Ra</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, the currency argument becomes a thing. While many webbased businesses don't handle cash or cheques, the personnel cost involved in handling these currencies is lighter on credit card purchases than the other types, so while you do see a cost on many cards, there is also a saved cost due to less cash/cheque handling. </p>
<p>I live in Denmark which for many people outside our country is kind of utopian. We have had to send our cheque system on pension this year and are also currently discussing to allow corporations to reject cash payments. This isn't because we don't like money, but people are simply advancing into card and mobile payments at a scale you don't see elsewhere, which eases the administration required by maintaining a currency cashier position.</p>
<p>So while the cost for card payments are 0-3%, those corporations save the time to run the daily cash to the bank and the time needed to count the days incoming payments/sales. Propably salaries in the amount of an employee on a five year basis.</p>
<p>Also credit cards allow the corporations to dip into sales that would otherwise be postponed because now, people have it in a credit option in their wallet - this increases revenue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animations are compressed when they are imported into a game engine. Each bone may lose a tiny bit of accuracy on its rotation information, starting at the root and moving down the chain. The root is the pelvis (usually). The ends of the chain are the feet, hands, and head. The further you get from the root, the worse the compression results get.</p>
<p>Normally you can't tell that anything is wrong. But when an animation requires <em>extremely precisely matched movements</em> between two different ends of the chain (for instance hands and head in a drinking animation), you may notice that the animation winds up off by an inch or two.</p>
<p>Errors are compounded by the fact that models are often changed after the animations are done, meaning that what the animator was working with isn't what's in the game.</p>
<p>Any time two different skeletal meshes (like people) interact, that's a whole nother headache, because in addition to compression you've got to precisely match their position in the game world to whatever it was when they were animated shaking hands or kissing or whatever. If there are even tiny errors in their world position and world rotation, the animations will be off.</p>
<p>And when you've got procedurally generated characters, or characters that the players created, then you can basically kiss any hope of accurate animations goodbye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly in order for a motion to occur someone has to create a rig to support it. This is essentially turning a stiff statue into a deformable living thing with bones and muscles, and you design exactly how things bend and move. Setting up a general skeleton is fairly easy, while more complex and subtle muscle movements and deformations have to use different sort of deformers and are often hand sculpted in different positions. You want to be 'cheap' and have as few controls as possible to preform a minimum action instead of a bunch of tiny adjusters.</p>
<p>Second is budget and importance. If you are making a game about slaying dragons then the animation needed for combat and slaying are far more important than an extraneous drinking animation, which can take just as much time to animate. If the game were about being a musical master then the animation of instrument playing would have higher importance. There also may not be enough time to set up a rig with complicated controls. Adding more polygons and more controls take up processing power, and if a game is limited in this regard simplifying a rig and model is worth a smoother game.</p>
<p>Another is unpredictability. The designer often cannot account for exactly where a character is or what they are holding when an animation executes. Like in Skyrim for example it would have been great to pick up objects like a normal person. However there are hundreds of items with different sizes and weights, which would have to be set up so holding it would look normal. Most animation you see in game is essentially a pre-recorded video that plays when you press a button. But a motion like this is handing over control to the player, and you would then have to make sure the arm and body rig can be automated to move in such a way that it won't break while also looking convincing. This is why they just opt for a floating item instead. </p>
<p>Lastly is perception. Unlike animated films audiences for games have a much higher tolerance for uncanny animation, and motion is much more utilitarian and interchangeable. The camera is often farther away, so larger motions such as running and fighting can look 'right' where as subtle animations up close involving micro-movements can feel wrong. Your mind is also wired to be hyper-focused on the human face and very subtle changes, so anything involving that area will fall into the uncanny valley. So long as the camera is far away the character just 'pretending' to drink can look convincing enough without having to animate all the details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the difficulties with some of those things is that human bodies are soft and squishy.</p>
<p>Models in games are made up of lots of triangles. To make part of the model deform means moving and stretching those triangles. You need a lot of triangles to make it look convincing.</p>
<p>This is why there tends to be a lot more triangles in a character's face than the rest of their body. Faces deform in lots of complicated ways when someone is speaking, so you need a lot of detail to recreate that.</p>
<p>In real life when someone presses something against a part of their body, such as another persons lips, it squishes a bit. Recreating those &quot;squishes&quot; means you need even more triangles. And more triangles means more processing power is needed.</p>
<p>Also you'd probably need some kind of soft body physics simulation to work out exactly how those triangles need to move when something presses on them. However that doesn't necessarily need to be done by the game itself for things like cutscenes.</p>
<p>This is far too expensive for most games, both in terms of processing power and amount of work/money needed to do it. So most games don't, and just settle for an awkward &quot;wooden&quot; look when characters interact with things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have covered the fact that it's hard to model soft things flexing correctly in a computer, since you can't actually simulate, say, all of the molecules of a face without a computer that fills the room and runs at smelter temperatures.</p>
<p>But also, consider part of your premise. If you're talking about accuracy alone, in every game I've played, the destruction of that firebreathing dragon? It actually looked like shit. It's the exact same sword swing animation the character'd do to open air, except it intersects (and usually goes straight through) the dragon, the dragon maybe flashes and maybe does a flinch animation. Its appearance is probably unchanged unless in some games it passes some HP threshold and suddenly the entire dragon looks more beaten up (even though I've been taking advantage of a cheesy weakspot and hitting nothing but its left leg).</p>
<p>Accurately animating this would involve a weaving sword path to slip past defending claws or plates, individual scales breaking and falling, rents appearing in flesh, and the weapon stopping and drawing back or bouncing based on depth.</p>
<p>Instead we're only just getting to things like hitboxes that closely match the onscreen models, accurate physics for destructible stages, or viable inverse kinematics for non-cartoony motion.</p>
<p>But the whole &quot;weapon animation phases through the enemy and they take HP damage&quot; is just an accepted shorthand for how damaging an enemy in a video game looks. <strong>So yeah, you're right</strong>: it's about the interaction. An attack animation doesn't need to care about the shape, exact position, or composition of the enemy; correctly modeling a grasp, a kiss, playing an instrument, etc, does.</p>
<p>This may not directly be about animation, but one of the things that surprised me when I started learning how to program is how little of it is automatic. That is, almost everything that happens in a program, every button placement, every procedure, every edge case, is something that a specific human person thought of and then put into instructions for the computer. Sure, we have lots of standards, and shared resources (so buttons all look the same unless you don't want them to), and are getting more clever, but every little thing, including things you'd probably never think of if you didn't have to do it, is something that has taken up real person hours for every little bend and fold and placement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. They were probably discussing <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/ahlswede/homepage/public/199.pdf" target="_blank">identification codes</a>. And, yes in some way, you can represent 2^(2^n) different states using an n bit sequence. </p>
<p>But to understand how, you have to understand the operational definition of representation here. ID codes operate under the assumption that there is one source and a large number of readers, each reader wants to identify whether the message the source sends is some unique message (the original example was wives of sailors wanting to know if their husband had drowned). There are two operational requirements for ID codes, when the source does produce their message the probability that the correct reader positively identifies the message must go to one, and if the source does not produce their message the probability the reader miss-identifies it must go to zero. Replacing the last condition instead with the probability that there is a reader that miss-identifies goes to zero instead results in only being able to represent 2^(n), instead of 2^(2^n).</p>
<p>As one might expect then from the preceding, with an ID code there <em>will be errors.</em> Just the probability of it being any particular reader will go to zero. And this hints at the design, but lets walk through it using n bits. With n bits, there are 2^(n) different sequences, and to each reader the ID code will associate some fraction, q2^(n), of the total. When the source wants to send a message to a particular reader, the source produces a n bit sequence by randomly choosing from those associated with the particular reader. This scheme works because the amount of overlap between any two of these sets can be made relatively small.</p>
<p>More specifically, from a Lemma in the originally linked paper, it is possible to create at least N = exp(q 2^(n) - n ln2) different subsets (A1, A2, ... AN) from the set of n-bit sequences, such that these sets satisfy</p>
<ul>
<li>|AI| = q 2^(n)</li>
<li>|AI intersection AJ|/|AI| &lt; ln(2e)/ln(q^(-1)-1) .</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting q = n^(-1) results in at least 2^(2^n-2log n) different sets, and the intersection between any two sets is basically 1/ln(n). As n gets larger the percentage in any particular set intersection decreases, and as a result the probability of a randomly selected message being in that intersection also decreases. What you have at the end is that reader A will identify a message when sent to it, and that with high probability reader B will not miss-identify the message. The number of unique messages though, is double exponential with the block length.</p>
<p>Perhaps more remarkable is that given those two operational definitions it is possible to show that 2^(2^n) is also the maximum number of messages which may be identified. This leads what we call ID-capacity, which is defined as the log(log( # messages that can be identified)). Furthermore, If you were to add a channel the messages had to be identified over, the ID-capacity would equal the channel capacity (in other words you can send 2^(nC) messages or identify 2^(2^nC), where C is the capacity of the channel).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can represent more than 2^n states using n bits if you allow for some error. For example, you could make groups of uniform size k, have an error rate of 1-1/k, but be able to count k 2^n states. Like /u/ericGraves showed, you can also make sure that those groups are randomly selected.</p>
<p>If you get clever with your groups there are interesting applications.</p>
<p>One such application is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_counting_algorithm" target="_blank">approximate counting</a>, allowing for you to <em>count</em> to arbitrarily high values with limited precision. </p>
<p>For example, say you have only 1 bit but want to be able to count to 1 million. Then each for each event (say a person passes by) you could simply chose to count with probability 1/1000000, and do nothing with probability 999999/1000000. On average, it will require 1000000 events for your bit to flip to 1, hence if you see 1 it's likely you've gone over 1 mill. The two groups might represent '0'-&gt;[0-999999] and '1'-&gt;[1000000-inf] in this case.</p>
<p>There's one way to generalize this such that with high probability, the number you are counting has good <em>relative precision</em>. This way n bits allow you to count up to ~2^(2^n) with any fixed relative precision (e.g. you could tolerate at most a 10% error). This is achieved by making the group sizes proportional to the numbers: small numbers belong to small groups, large numbers large groups; and by using randomness to increment your counter*. </p>
<p>This technique is actually used in practice afaik.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another completely different way to think about having more than 2^n states using n bits is simply through compression. If some states are more likely than others, you can use <em>on average</em> less bits than n to identify each of 2^n states. This is done by associating shorter codewords with most likely states, and using the longer ones for less likely states. In this manner, you don't lose any precision, but may need more than n bits to identify a state if you're unlucky. The best average number of bits you can achieve with this scheme is given by the entropy of the state distribution.</p>
<p>Those two approaches are roughly lossy compression and lossless compression respectively.</p>
<hr />
<p>* Note there's a technical caveat: to generate the random numbers themselves (unless you're given them from an oracle), you need to generate a number of bits and count them. Usually this means you need log(log(x)) bits of memory to generate x, which is actually not a problem in the case above, since log(log(2^(2^n))) = n; but if you want to count higher (like in the case where you use 1 bit to count to 1 million), then that's a problem. Of course, you can realize you've fallen into another counting problem, which really allows you to use the same algorithm again (at another loss of precision). So you can count up to 2^2^2^2^1 = 65536 by using a 2^(2^1) = 4 bit counter, but you could also again use a probabilistic counter to count up to 2^(2^2^1)=16, which loses precision but requires counting only up to 2^(2^1)=8, plus a register bit. You see you can continue until you have to count up to 2 and there's no probabilistic improvement. So even tolerating for large uncertainties I believe the utmost k you can count up to using this kind of method uses log*(k) bits (which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_logarithm" target="_blank">iterated logarithm</a> function). But this is an extremely slow function, that is, you can count up to absurdly high values: using only ~5 bits (multiplied by some constant) you could approximately count to 2^65536 ; much more than the number of atoms in the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does not make sense that you would be able to represent more than 2^n states and I do not believe it is possible.<br />
However you can use those available states to do neat things.<br />
As a simple example you can compare integers to floats, the integers represent evenly distributed numbers, and floats exponentially increasing numbers.<br />
The float can only represent a tiny fraction of the larger integers exactly and &quot;uses the gaps&quot; to represent small decimal numbers and astronomically large numbers.<br />
Also with hash sums you can identify a file larger than the numbers of bits in the hash, there is principle a vast amount of hash collisions but the chance of an actual collision in practice happening for any specific file is vanishingly small.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not positive but I think you meant you can use 4 bits and store more that 4 states? If that is the case it works like this:</p>
<p>It's called binary which works as a base2 number system, our typical system is base10. Each position is either on (1) or off (0). And each position(n) is equal to 2^n.</p>
<p>Eight bits is equal to one Byte, not super relevant info but still important.</p>
<p>00000000 = 0
00000001 = 1
00000010 = 2
00000011 = 3</p>
<p>So as you can see, 2^0 = 1 but you can represent two states, 2^4 = 8 but you can represent 15 different states 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111... you get the idea. </p>
<p>Each time you increase n by 1, you increase your possible states by 2^n+1 because the first bit is 2^0</p>
<p>4 bits=15 states, 5 bits=31 (15+16), 6 bits=63 (31+32)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: It is late-ish, and I'm doing this all in my head, so if I've done my math wrong somewhere, or I've been super confusing, let me know and I'll try to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers make conventional sense, but they don't get to the heart of why this is really true, /u/maphhifi.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: maps differ depending on who draws them, and more importantly, where those people are from. A map that the Haudenosaunee (aka Iroquois) people would have drawn to lay out their territory would look very different than what White Protestants would draw. Generally, when the people who have historically lived in and thrived in one location draw maps, they do so with those considerations in mind: <strong>when locals make maps, they usually try to divide up populations, territory or villages based on culture, economics, politics or language, not simple geography.</strong> Why would they? After all, knowing what village is allied with which tribe, or knowing which town speaks what language or follows which religion, is much more important to everyday life than knowing where a mountain or river is.</p>
<p>Now, look at a map of the world, and count how many countries, provinces, territories and states have borders with straight lines. Notice anything? Yeah: <strong>almost all of those straight-lined borders</strong> are in Africa, the Middle East, Australia, the western and north-western US/Canada. What's the common element here? <strong>These are all nations and provinces that were subject to colonialism and colonization.</strong> And colonialism/colonization, as systems employed by the empires of the world (as well as the US), had one goal: the <em>extraction of value</em> from nations, the same way you'd extract value from a mine or farm you own. And if your goal is to extract value instead of show borders between different cultures or towns, you're going to draw that map very differently. More specifically, you're going to draw it with a lot of simple, straight lines so you don't waste time or energy mapping it out or considering what the land is like, who is on it and what they might feel about it. </p>
<p>Probably the worst example of this (and that's saying something, if you've ever read about the tragedy that was the Scramble for Africa) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement" target="_blank">Sykes-Picot Agreement</a>, which the British and the French formed between themselves to divide up formerly Ottoman territory after World War 1. The map of the area (which encompasses parts of what is now Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and, most importantly, Syria) was almost entirely <strong>a straight line</strong>, with the Brits taking one half and the French taking the other. That boundary was one of the deciding factors that split up dozens of cultures and people who spoke dozens of languages and dialects, believed different religions, and had radically different cultures and political philosophies. It split communities that were probably better off together, and put communities who were enemies together. If you've ever wondered why Africa seems to have so many civil wars in relation to other continents, <em>this</em> is one reason you can trace it back to: cultural conflicts that force opposing interests into one space.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is the real reason why there are so many nations with straight-line borders: because they were almost all colonized nations or territories of a former empire, which usually had really bad consequences.</p>
<p>One of my favourite professors ever in the History department summed this up best: &quot;Any time you see straight lines on a map, you can bet money that the person who drew that map didn't live there.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boundaries between states can broadly be separated by whether the people responsible for drawing up the lines lived there at the time they were made or not.</p>
<p>Boundaries between states (in the broader sense of the term) where people have lived for a long time tend to follow geographical features -- rivers, mountain ridges, etc.</p>
<p>Boundaries drawn up by outsiders or over unoccupied territories tend to be much less complicated, because there's no one (important) there to care about the conflict.  Very important geographical obstacles, like rivers that can't be forded, may be considered, but the &quot;empty space&quot; between is often divided by straight lines.</p>
<p>The eastern US's borders were largely defined by the original 13 colonies, and the borders between those colonies were geographically defined.  There was however <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd/british_colonies_1763-76.jpg" target="_blank">a lot of unsettled territory to the west of the initial settlement sites</a>, and borders more or less turned straight east-west past the point at which people lived and cared.  <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a3/c1/b0/a3c1b01b243391b0334bc9717810f661.jpg" target="_blank">As states like Alabama &amp; Tennessee were carved out of the territory claimed the Georgia and North Carolina</a>, their latitudinal borders stayed straight lines extending from established states until they hit a powerful geographical border that could not be ignored -- the Mississippi River.  Similarly, Kentucky was defined by the Ohio River to its North and a straight line to the South.</p>
<p>That began a pattern that followed after territories were gained with the Louisiana Purchase, the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, the annexation of Texas, and the Mexican American War.  We'd take large territories that we now owned and largely cut along the latitude east to west.  We started making straight lines north-to-south too, except when a river got in the way, because no one lived there to get in disputes over minor adjustments back and forth like they do in densely populated territories.</p>
<p>You can see a similar pattern in the way that Europe divided up colonial Africa and the Middle East with no regard for the natives living there.  Rivers where they were big enough.  Straight lines to keep thing simple beyond that.  Quick and dirty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That means it is not just random in the way a coin toss is random: If we would know exactly the velocity, angular momentum, mass and some other properties of the coin in the air we could predict the outcome but since we do not know these properties with enough precision we say the outcome is random. This is called chaotic randomness. </p>
<p>Quantum effects like nuclear decay are purely random. That means there are no hidden variables and it is not only technically but in principle impossible to know the outcome (the time of the decay).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One issue is that free trade naturally means more competition. Say you've got a good little business making and selling gizmos in the US. No one in the US does it better and cheaper than you, so you're doing well.</p>
<p>Now a free trade agreement is signed with China, which means they are suddenly allowed to export gizmos to the US and sell them there. Wages are lower there so their gizmos are 40% cheaper than yours. For all the people who buy gizmos, that's wonderful, and if you look at the economy as a whole it might even boost growth (because all the gizmo buyers now have more money let to spend on other things, plus whatever they build using gizmos can now be made cheaper and in greater numbers), but it <em>also</em> threatens your job. It may create new jobs, but it <em>also</em> costs existing jobs. </p>
<p>For your country as a whole, the free trade deal might be a net benefit, but for some individuals in that country, it means a loss of their job or their family business. If this process runs unchecked for a long period, you end up with large areas of the country where virtually no jobs and no industry exists, where unemployment and poverty is rampant, even while he country <em>as a whole</em> becomes wealthier. This has happened in both the US and the UK, for example. The cities are doing great, but in other areas, people have <em>nothing</em>, because their old coal or steel mines closed, as free trade agreements meant the same could be imported more cheaply, and while new jobs were created in the big cities, nothing happened in these desolate areas.</p>
<p>Another problem is that these &quot;modern&quot; trade agreements have tended to have some dubious provisions in them allowing huge corporations to sue countries if they introduce laws that make it harder for the corporation to sell their goods. For example, some countries have been sued by big tobacco corporations because they introduced laws to discourage smoking. Others have been sued for blocking mining companies from creating new, environmentally harmful, mines in populated areas. The EU has dropped bans of certain harmful pesticides in anticipation of TTIP, because such a ban would risk a lawsuit if the trade deal was ratified.</p>
<p>The especially problematic thing about these lawsuits is that (1) these corporations often have greater revenues than the GDP of many smaller countries, and the country might simply be unable to afford losing such a lawsuit and be forced to just do what the corporation wants them to.
Additionally, these cases are not taken to actual courts, but are run by special tribunals which are effectively above national law: they judge <em>solely</em> based on the text of the trade deal, not on what is actually legal in the country in question.</p>
<p>Such investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS) have the potential to be devastating for democracy, as you end up with corporations effectively coercing governments into writing or lifting certain laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: The benefits of free trade are massive, but divided into very small bits spread across entire populations, making them very hard to notice. The harm of free trade is smaller but extremely focused on small groups, who are therefore more vocal in their opposition.  </p>
<p>There's 2 main issues (and a whole whole lot of smaller issues, but keeping it ELI5...)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>While the entire population benefits, that positive impact is not as noticeable to an individual as the negative impact of losing their job. (Though Free Trade does not destroy jobs, it does re-locate them.) So if 300 million people save $10/year from cheaper free-trade goods, that's $3B, which is way more than the $500M in wages lost by the people who lost their job as a result. However, you and I don't think 'wow, i saved 2 cents, thanks free trade!' when you're buying paper towels - but the company that shut down knows exactly why, and is vocal about it. </p>
</li>
<li>Free Trade Deals are never Free Trade - more like Freer Trade.  NAFTA, TPP, and others are all about loosening of restrictions, but there are still TONS of restrictions.  And when you're negotiating these complex things, you have to give and take, when means you prioritize some industries over others and playing favorites.  Again, less restrictions are overall better, but if you're not one of the groups with well connected lobbyists or a strong influence on voting, then you may end up seeing your market become freer while others still enjoy federally-protected monopolies.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason free trade deals are criticized is that their benefits are largely invisible while their downsides are readily apparent.  </p>
<p>The costs of a free trade deal are concrete; factories close, people lose their jobs, communities that rely on those jobs suffer.  Its easy to understand and communicate these losses.  You can publish photos of decaying empty factories and send a news crew out to interview unemployed men sitting in their kitchens and see it as you drive past a shuddered small town main street.  The pain is real and immediate but it can also be misleading because relative to the size of the economy the losses are minuscule.  Its like how people overestimate the risk posed by terrorism or shark attacks because it is so emotionally raw and reported on when it does happen.  </p>
<p>The benefits are harder to visualize.  While some industries are hurt others begin to expand thanks to increased demand from exports and go on to create new jobs and open new factories and generate new wealth.  But unlike the losses which are centralized the new gains are diffuse and harder to pin down.  On top of the growth, free trade deals drive down the cost of consumer goods improving the spending power of working class people.  But once again the savings are small and spread out making the gains impossible to see day to day.  </p>
<p>Free trade also generates huge political gains but those are even more amorphous than the economic ones.  Free trade deals bind countries together diplomatically, give them strong economic incentives for peace, and provides them with a legal framework to settle their differences. These things are incredibly important for world peace and stability but you can't put a value on them; you can take a picture of them to show next to the rotted out factory.  </p>
<p>Look at NAFTA.  NAFTA affected an incredibly small portion of the economy.  It cost the US roughly 700,000 jobs and closed some auto plants as we transitioned into the deal.  But the best estimate is that the resulting growth and price saving generates roughly 100 dollars per US worker per year indefinitely.  That is a huge value.  It is fair to say that we didn't do right by those 700,00 people who were hurt --that we didn't do enough to retrain them and soften the pain-- but that is an extension of the failure on the part of US government to do right by the entire working class and not a failure of NAFTA.</p>
<p>Free trade is a lot like global warming.  The economic science is in and ninety-nine percent of economists agree that free trade is good for countries and beneficial to their citizens, but its a value that is hard to see while the immediate cost in jobs is apparent to everyone.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loss of control.</p>
<p>Imagine X Land and Y republic both make products and sell them.  </p>
<p>They want to sell internationally.  </p>
<p>XLand could &quot;cheat&quot; by making all sorts of taxes and laws in order to artificially to make YR products more costly to buy in XLand, in order to help Xland companies (and the XLand economy) by making sure XLandians &quot;buy XLandian&quot;.  </p>
<p>Of course, this is kind of unfair, and YR might retaliate by doing something similar, which just stifles trade and makes less products available at good prices for all the people.  </p>
<p>Instead, both countries agree to &quot;free trade&quot; they won't do anything to block each others' sales.  They'll just allow open market competition.  Best products win.  </p>
<p>Problem: </p>
<p>What happens when YR starts cheating in another way?</p>
<p>YR products are competing with Xlandian products.  Obviously, its good for the YR economy is YR companies are doing better.  </p>
<p>So, YR companies start intentionally targeting Xland companies, making their own versions of the same products, fighting for the exact same markets, knowing that they don't have to play by the same rules.  Xland has strict rules about minimum wage, and safety regulations, and environmental protections.  YR doesn't have any of that.  Thus their companies can make competing products at a cost Xland can't match.  </p>
<p>Then, YR cheated the exchange rate. They intentionally under report the value of their own currency.  1XL dollars should be worth 2YR dollars, but YR lied.  They claim things are going worse for them and that their dollars are weaker than they really are.  The set it up so that 1XL dollar is valued at 4YR dollars.  This phony exchange rate makes XL dollars twice as strong as they should be.  (Read: YR products twice a cheap on the Xland market).</p>
<p>To make it worse, YR is outright copying Xland.  Their companies are copying Xland companies designs.  XLand company can't sue because the YR companies aren't in their country, so they can't take them to court.  YR won't enforce Xland patents  or copyrights.  In fact, there is evidence to show that YR companies straight spied on XLand companies.  It even seems like the YR government's official spy service helped private companies spy on their XLand rivals so they could get an edge.</p>
<p>So, YR is doing all these shady things to fix the market so that YR companies are beating Xland and Xlands businesses and economy are suffering for it.  </p>
<p>Normally, Xland would just say &quot;WTF? From now on, any product that isn't produced fairly, by a company following our rules, can't be sold here.  It will be blocked, or at least taxed unless it plays by our rules&quot;</p>
<p>BUT, the trade agreement says XLand isn't allowed to do that.  They have given up their right to do that.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main issue is that Free trade agreement means that companies might freely stretch into a lot of different countries, and all of these have specific taxes, and different ecological laws.</p>
<p>Well if you make a free trade agreement, the companies, to be more competitive, will split there activities where it's the least expensive, so they will put their corporate seat in the country that has the lowest corporate tax, their heavy factories in the country that has the least social protections and lowest wages, their R&amp;D pool in the country that has the lowest taxes on high wages, ...</p>
<p>Before the agreement, if your raise the taxes by five percents, you are risking a slowdown of your economy, more or less proportional to the raise in taxes. After the agreement, any law that make your country less competitive than any other country in any given sector will give all your industry of that kind an invective to leave.</p>
<p>It also means that ecological laws have a much amplified effect on industry : if it makes, say coal 10% more expensive to extract than in the neighboring country, and provided that they have enough supply to satisfy the demand, ALL of your coal industry is going to die overnight.</p>
<p>All in all it put a huge pressure to the governments to lower taxes on companies, and get rid of ecological laws far above what it was before the free trade agreement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before answering the question, consider the easier task of determining the likelihood of your distribution given you know the true underlying distribution. Once we know the probability of the outcome given the true distribution, we can begin to look at the set of distributions which could lead to the observation with some bounded probability. We will also show that this set becomes increasingly smaller for more samples, and as a result the distance between the true distribution and any distribution in that set decreases. I will be assuming a discrete probability distribution, but this should not be seen as overly restrictive as that you are considering histograms after all.</p>
<p>Beginning, denote by Q the true underlying distribution, and denote by P the empirical distribution after observing n-independent samples. Writing t(P) to denote the set of all possibilities which lead to an empirical distribution of P, we have</p>
<p>| -n^(-1) log Q(t(P)) - D(P||Q) + (|X|-1)(2n)^(-1) log(2πn) + (2n)^(-1) log ΠP | &lt; (|X|+1) log( 1 + (12n)^(-1) )</p>
<p>where D(P||Q) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence" target="_blank">KL divergence</a> of P to Q, |X| is the alphabet size of X, and Π is the product of the probabilities of the distribution of P (for instance equal heads and tails would result in .25).  Indeed this formula comes first from observing that the probability of any sequence with empirical distribution P has probability exp(-n ( H(P) + D(P||Q))ln 2 ) and then summing over all possible values which result in that empirical distribution. The bounds occur by use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation" target="_blank">Stirling's approximation</a> in estimating those quantities. </p>
<p>Note that from the formula, n^(-1) log Q(t(P)) converges to D(P||Q), or in other words Q(t(P)) converges to exp( -n D(P||Q) ln 2 ), which is actually fantastic for your purposes. Indeed one can interpret D(P||Q) as a distance (which strictly speaking it is not, since D(P||Q) does not equal D(Q||P) ), between P and Q. Thus, intuitively, the probability of P occurring given Q is exp( -n (distance between P and Q) ). In fact, for the remainder of this discussion I am going to equate Q(t(P)) with exp( -n D(P||Q) ln 2) for simplicity, obviously those extra terms would have to be added back in for a more detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Now we move to the situation where we do not know Q, and instead just know P. Take the set of Q which could result in P with probability greater than n^(-a). Using our formula we see that D(P||Q) &lt; a' n^(-1) log(n) for all such Q. In essence, we have now bounded the &quot;distance&quot; between P and Q, based upon the number of samples of samples. </p>
<p>From that bound, we also have
d(P,Q) &lt; a'' √( n^(-1) log n ),
where d is the L1 distance between distributions, which follows by a simple application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsker%27s_inequality" target="_blank">Pinsker's inequality</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you claim your distribution looks normal, assume it is. Now try to construct a histogram of the the normal distribution parameters (mean and variance). A fairly simple way to do it would be to repeatedly resample your population with replacement (called bootstrapping, I believe). A more sophisticated method would involve creating Bayesian priors of the parameter distributions and updating them based on you samples. I don't know of a nonparametric  method, but I'm sure one exists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Use a Z test against the probability histogram. You know the population mean and standard deviation and the sample mean and standard deviation. From there you can calculate the probability of your sample occurring in the population. For example, you have a population with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 that is normally distributed. You take a sample of size 1 ( the equation changes depending on how many samples you take but we'll use 1 for simplicity) and get a value of -1. We know that ~67% of results will fall within one standard deviation of the mean, leaving 33% that would be outside of 1 standard deviation with half falling above 1 standard deviation above the mean and half falling below one standard deviation below the mean. Essentially, the probability of getting a mean below -1 or above 1 is 33%. In order to find the probability of getting a result at or below -1 (ex -2,-3 etc) we take 33/2=16.5%. That is, the probability that a sample of size 1 taken from the population has a value of -1 or below is 16.5%. This is obviously a really simple example to Illustrate the point and real samples of larger sizes are obviously more complex but I hope this is sufficient to answer your question. Feel free to respond with any other things you feel are unclear or any other questions you might have and I'll try my best to answer them. </p>
<p>Edit: one more point, because probability distributions involve using integrals, the probability of getting an exact value is 0, which is why we use ranges rather than specific values when calculating probability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In summary: There are 4 stages of dying. CAS stands for Cardiac Arrest Stage.  </p>
<ul>
<li>CAS 1 - Final heart beat to Final pulse of blood containing oxygen  </li>
<li>CAS 2 - Final oxygen containing pulse to &quot;Delta blip&quot; (short burst of Delta waves on EEG)  </li>
<li>CAS 3 - Delta blip to EEG recordings below 10 microvolts  </li>
<li>CAS 4 - Low voltage (&lt; 10uV) to no electrical activity  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
What's interesting is that in CAS 3, there was an increase in synchronized gamma waves, indicating </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a highly aroused brain, and collectively, the data suggest that the mammalian brain has the potential for high levels of internal information processing during clinical death. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gamma waves are EEG waves that are associated with wakefulness and conscious attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The return of these neural correlates of conscious brain activity after cardiac arrest at levels exceeding the waking state provides strong evidence for the potential of heightened cognitive processing in the near-death state</p>
</blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: Near Death Experiences may result from a burst of coordinated gamma waves which occurs after the blood is deoxygenated</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To summarize, just before death, it was expected that the brain would wind down and slowly stop, but the brain surges with activity. This study was <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/12/in-dying-brains-signs-of-heightened-consciousness/" target="_blank">done on mice</a> and also on <a href="https://www.seeker.com/brain-waves-surge-moments-before-death-1764727850.html" target="_blank">terminally ill humans</a>. Similar results were found in both cases. (The story about mice includes some crap about &quot;heightened consciousness&quot; but that is clickbaity, newspaper-selling bullshit.) You start to die, your brain goes haywire for a bit possibly due to a failure of whatever regulates your brain activity, and then it calms down and you pass away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
