This footage is likely from that area, which you can see in the link above has many docks similar to the one seen in the video.

Submerge a standard 20 ounce cup and lift it out the water upside down. You'll lower the water very little in the tub as it's now sucked up in a glass above the surface. Let's assume that's a category 1. Now do the same thing with a five gallon bucket. That's our category 5. So due to forces in the storm low pressure, wind and what not there's a column of water higher then the normal level in the center of the storm. The water has to come from somewhere so it's lower in the video and higher in the storm. Once the storms influence passes the water will flow back to its normal level.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the strongest winds of Irma are in its northeast quadrant, and are blowing water away from the region offshore of the Bahamas.  In effect the winds are piling up water ahead of them, leaving a depression where the waters are blown from.  This sucks in the surrounding waters, especially noticeable in the Bahamas which is a very shallow, broad submerged area in the direction of Irma.</p>
<p>Contrary to what others are saying here, it's <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/" target="_blank"><em>mostly not the result of the low air pressure of the storm itself.</em></a>  Pressure drops result in about 5% of the surge of a powerful hurricane, and that would be directly under the eye.  Wind surge affects a much larger area and much greater height.</p>
<p>This makes sense if you do a back of the envelope calculation: One inch of mercury of pressure difference is about 13 inches of water. The center of a strong hurricane may be <del>two</del> three inches of mercury lower pressure, e.g. ~27 vs <del>~29</del> ~30, which converts to around three feet of water difference. So the sea level difference due to pressure is negligible- at most a bit over <del>2</del> 3 feet vs a total of 30 feet or whatever from a strong surge.  </p>
<p>In this case the effect of the wind-driven storm surge leaving land high and dry is exacerbated by the shallow shelf area that the Bahamas rest on.</p>
<p>Edit: Normal atmospheric pressure is closer to 30 not 29 inHg, so adjusted my numbers.  Also, <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/surge_world_records.asp" target="_blank">storm surge can be up to 50 feet, although such large surges depend on the interaction with seafloor and land topography</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Pictograph languages.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese are straight up being killed by typing. Young people can recognize and read the characters, but since writing them isn't a practiced skill, it is basically fading out. It is receptive only. Given a pen and paper, Japanese young people in particular will resort to phonetically writing out words, instead of using Kanji. Simply because they do not remember how to write them.</p>
<p>Edit: I gather that most of the answers are talking about cognitive skills OUTSIDE of writing gained by handwriting, so I thought I'd take a different approach. I've found it interesting because it is something that utterly doesn't come up with English-centric thinking. The English character set is so small that there is little risk of losing it. Whereas Japanese/Chinese is tens of thousands of characters. Basically infinite, as no one really knows ALL of them, like you would expect in English.</p>
<p>So the opposition to 'devices' in classrooms has a whole nother angle to it in these countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuropsychologist here - I would start by saying this is a question you could ponder for hours...
There have been a lot of good points raised, but I haven't seen one discuss the concept of a motor program. A word generated graphomotorically (pen and paper) is generated one letter at a time, where each letter is it's own motor program. Typing generates words in several-letter sequences, like a chunked string to be linked with other chunked strings. The physics of it all is that a proficient typist creates letters faster than the brain can receive feedback on each confirming the completion of a goal-directed action. Rather, typing is an execution of a program of several letters (like the brain launching a .exe file) in combinations to form words. Graphomotor writing is different and is done by an execution of a program of one letter at a time. It is still a sequence of motor movements (remember practicing them way back when?), but the goal is to ultimately create one letter before executing another motor program towards a new goal/letter. This is a meaningful difference from a neurocognitive standpoint as it is evidence of a functional dissociation (hence, some can type well but have a hard writing or vice versa). As a side note, this is why we make so many more errors typing, we are executing incorrect motor programs and once they have started, they are hard to stop. If you read up on Tadlock or Fitt's motor sequence learning stages, it becomes more clear what I mean. In fact, I just accidentally typed &quot;learning 'states'&quot; because I executed the wrong motor sequence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Memory is determined by connective paths between brain cells. When you think a thought, cells in your brain twist and shift to create new pathways (or break old ones). The more times you think a thought, the more rigid these new pathways become and the longer you will retain the memory.</p>
<p>Each brain cell is capable of being part of dozens of pathways at the same time. If you connect a new memory pathway with older pathways that already exist, you are more likely to retain the new information and it becomes easier to recall it when needed.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do#t-21903" target="_blank">interesting Ted Talk</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>So when you write something by hand, several things are happening: 1) you are going slower, which means you have to repeat the information to yourself while writing, 2) you have to think about how to phrase what you are writing or drawing, 3) you have to decide how your phrase will fit with the other notes you have made (list, diagram, new paragraph, etc), 4) you have to translate your desired phrase into muscle movements, 5) because of the time and focus, you are more likely to tie the new memory path into existing memory paths.</p>
<p>If people type notes instead, they spend less time processing the thought, use fewer muscles, and the computer does the formatting and organizing rather than the body/brain. Computer screens also cause the brain to focus less on the task at hand - meaning that reading notes from a monitor is less effective than reading the same notes printed on paper. <a href="http://www.co.twosides.info/download/Computer_vs_paper-based_tasks_Are_they_equivalent.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a neat study</a> about how computer screens make people less efficient at tasks compared to using paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the printing press.  That's the reason.  I think the printing press is more responsible than any other single cause.  Gutenberg was 1440, but remember it took time for the devices to actually be used for more than religious propaganda.</p>
<p>The printing press allowed for accurate, large scale reproduction of knowledge.  Printed words don't change with people's memories, and with presses, they can be distributed to a large number of people.  This is what allowed knowledge to be distributed and stored past individual people's lifetimes.</p>
<p>In addition, now that there was a large pool of knowledge in many people's hands, it would have been obvious that the knowledge was <em>conflicting</em>.  One person said one thing, another another, about the same physical process.  This is where the scientific method came from - you needed a formal way to determine who was right.  </p>
<p>Once you had the scientific method plus printing press, the current age was more or less inevitable.  Printing press is a method that allows for an ever growing pool of knowledge to be stored.  Scientific method acts like a slow filter, winnowing out bad knowledge in favor of good.  </p>
<p>If you think about it, high density computers are a super-printing press.  All the books ever written will almost fit on your tablet, you can send information around instantly, etc.  And the growing age of artificial intelligence is going to let us fix the other problems - there's too much accurate, scientific information for any one human to know all or even most of it, and we can't store the personalities of our best engineers so their skills are lost when they die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short version of the answer is that technological, academic, and economic progress were tepid at best during the dark ages. [Edit: I use the term 'dark ages' here lightly, 400-~1400 AD represented a seismic shift in philosophy that turned toward superstition rather than empirical knowledge. This started changing around perhaps 1000 or 1100 or so; but as with all history, transitions between epochs are generally not neat and tidy. The term is not great, but it's what I've got].  It was not until after the protestant reformation firmly took hold and had a couple generations of history behind it that enough of the percentage of Europe's population felt confident enough being &quot;revolutionary&quot; to seed the mindsets that ultimately led to the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>The Greeks and Romans made good progress in terms of art, mathematics, science, and technology and may have made the jump to an industrial society (or at least birthed a society that did this). By about 300 AD or so they had developed geometery--the same that we learn in high school today, in fact; as well as most trigonometry that we understand today. They had toy steam engines and (analog) vending machines that would do tricks (sort of like those fortune teller boxes from last century). We aren't talking about food dispensing here, more like blessings from the temple god/goddess sort of thing. They had small steam engines, though they never made the leap from &quot;amusing gimmick&quot; to &quot;useful machine&quot;. The machinists and tinkerers were playing around with geared wheels. They were working on problems like surveying, architecture, canals, and what we might loosely call railroads. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria" target="_blank">This guy, Hero, is perhaps the most well known</a> but there were a good many others doing similar things in the region.</p>
<p>The Dark Ages are most often marked as beginning with the abolition of Paganism by the rising Holy Roman Church, most notably with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria under Bishop Cyril. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia" target="_blank">Hypatia</a> is the character to watch there. For various reasons she was seen as a political enemy of Cyril. She was an academic and had a wide following in the area, and was pagan. She was a perfect target for someone with authority who claimed the church as a backer, and who adopted from (other) pagans the idea that the natural world is dirty and dangerous and to be expelled. That mysticism and withdrawal from study of the empirical was the way to salvation.</p>
<p>These ideas were widespread in the church at the time, and with Rome's political power waning it was less and less likely to find practical support for academia, for classical arts, music, math, etc. The church very much accepted the idea that came to signify the middle ages--that the road to holiness involved rejecting empirical study, aesthetic pleasure, fine art, practical trades, and pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. [Edit: yes, the Church did ultimately come to support many academic and art personalities, though those were almost exclusively after the Rennaisance had started. At the onset of the Church's rise to power these factors were heavily discouraged].</p>
<p>There were several times in the ensuing 1200 or so years where it appeared the west was on the cusp of breaking out of this mold, but until the protestant reformation made it possible to foment ideological revolt we lapsed back to the veil of mysticism each time. That is not to say protestant denominations embraced academia or capitalism, indeed many such religious doctrines were just as oppressive of these things as the Catholic Church. But the seeds of freedom of thought had taken root, and the benefits the reformation built into society benefited the intellectuals and the tinkerers just as much as they did the religious. This took off in the late 1400s, and really hit its stride in the early 1600s (Columbus was a 2nd gen product of the initial stages of this process, the American colonies a product of its peaking; 1492-1670ish or roughly the time from the American Civil War to today).</p>
<p>The rise of capitalism as a form of economy allowed ideas and innovations to flourish. If an inventor did not or could not take advantage of something, someone else was sure to see their gadget or discovery and find a way to exploit it. Unintended consequences spilled over into academia, like Galileo using a spyglass to study the heavens instead of terrestrial distances. Even though Italy and the church did not like these discoveries, they were celebrated elsewhere. The fragmentation of political vs. religious power vs. economic power had a significant role in this, though the threads are difficult to separate.</p>
<p>With that fragmentation of political vs. religious power came the capacity for whole societies to evolve with wildly differing variables, some for better, some for worse; most up and down. New economic practices could be tested, new gadgets and philosophies could be fought over without fear of political discipline (at least in some areas). In order to for one power to keep up with another it now became necessary to fund innovation, and not simply wait for someone in their workshop to fiddle around and stumble across something curious--this is where the rise of the great artists and inventors came from. A lord or a state would finance individuals who had a propensity for art or invention (Leonardo de Vinci was one such). This was a distinct break from earlier times in the dark ages where superstition and mysticism and illiteracy combined to keep populations in a quite literal intellectual darkness. Copernicus and da Vinci and others arguably used references from the earlier Classical personalities to jump start their ideas. They picked up where the much earlier generations had left off when Cyril (well, the Church really) had interrupted.</p>
<p>Today, in what we might call 'late stage capitalism', a lot of people are talking about changing economic structures; and that is a conversation worth having. But in its earlier stages capitalism was almost inarguably responsible for the wild success in technologies, philosophies, political, artistic, and intellectual changes that gave rise to the Renaissance (and the subsequent industrial and political revolutions).</p>
<p>One last note--India, China, and many Arab nations did not lose the maths or academics during the Dark Ages. If anything, they gained as many of the individuals fleeing the onset of the Dark Ages in Europe and the near-East ended up in one of these areas; and the early European voyages of discovery brought back to western shores the long-descended notes and knowledge of these people.</p>
<p>These empires did make some use of these discoveries, and indeed introduced many of their own discoveries to the world. Gunpowder, the compass, paper, movable type, and others. For whatever reason, however, they never made the jump to industry. Like the Classical Greeks and Romans, these things remained the purview of the wealthy or the powerful. Or when they were available to the masses, these were simply a garnish on daily life. Why that philosophical shift never occurred I do not know. They certainly had all the materials and knowledge and yet the shift to an industrial approach did not happen until it was instigated by Europeans.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the Chinese, at least, had a mini-dark ages. They set a fleet off to explore the world in the early 1400s (1421, I think); but while they were gone the political powers underwent a seismic shift and upon their return the fleet was mothballed and the empire's interests were turned inward, the outside world was something to be avoided. Would China have made the shift 200 years before the West? <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/china-zhenge-he-treasure-fleet-elite-free-trade-2017-2" target="_blank">A very fluff piece on the topic</a>.</p>
<p>Who knows. What I do know is that as we construct the next evolution of economics and politics in society, we would be wise to consider the long arcs of history and learn from the efforts of those who came before us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion the exponential progress is due to how we value human life and all that it brings. The more we value human life the less we're able to exploit them as a work force. During ancient times we probably could've had some sort of industrialisation but, simply put, there was no need for it. No one needed to invent better agricultural tools or mechanize work because slaves were naturally below their masters. </p>
<p>During the dark ages we had serfs doing work. This also meant that there was no incentive for anyone to invest in tools or mechanization. It wasn't until the enlightenment that we actually started viewing humans as having rights. Rights meant that the serfs wanted to own stuff and maybe even have a coin or two of their own. Thus there was an incentive to invest in inventions. Humans have always invented what they need, and until the enlightenment not much was needed because the elite didn't have to pay for labour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Americans drive larger vehicles because they cost less (no VAT or other high taxes), taxes/registration is based on broad class (passenger car, truck) rather than engine displacement or other more granular determination. Also, our roads and towns were built for cars, so no tight spaces where small cars are necessary. Now, we're actually seeing small SUVs like Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue surpass even the most popular sedans in sales, which trades the cargo security for higher driving position and AWD capabilities in bad weather..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Way back in the 70's we had the &quot;oil crisis&quot;, and people dumped their big Detroit type cars for small, fuel efficient Japanese ones. There was a HUGE stigma with the WW2 generation that Japanese/Asian products=Cheap crap, and buying Japanese stuff was &quot;un-American&quot; (my Dad is still this way, in 2017 🙄) Not many American cars (other than small &quot;economy&quot; cars, and maybe some &quot;sporty&quot; ones the average &quot;family&quot; buyer wouldn't get) were sold here with hatchbacks. Once the economy turned back up and gas prices dropped, anything with a hatchback became the un-cool car you got because you HAD to , and dumped ASAP. Yes there are some people here who actually LIKE hatchbacks, but they're few and far between. Kind of like manual transmission cars, but that's another whole issue...

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat counterintuitively, as an object gets bigger, its properties don't all get bigger at the same rate.  10 feet is twice as long as 5 feet, but a 10x10 square is four times as big as 5x5, and and 10x10x10 cube is eight times as big.</p>
<p>The weight of an object is determined by its volume, but strength is determined by area, the thickness of the objects cross section.  So if you take a bone or a steel beam, and double its size, it will become twice as long, four times as strong, but eight times as heavy.  Weight, in this case, increases twice as much as strength, so eventually you get to a point where the weight can no longer be supported.</p>
<p>And isn't just a matter of strength.  Blood vessels, digestive tracts, airways, they are all limited by the area of the cross section but must supply a volume.  All these systems start to break down as size increases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This topic is <strong>amazingly interesting</strong>. It has to do with scale, efficiency, and<strong> an extra dimension</strong></p>
<p>Another poster did a great job of answering your question directly, so I thought I'd expand on the subject. </p>
<p>Yes, the square cubed law shows how some features of the animal grow in 3 dimensions but did you know we can predict an animal's lifespan based on the specie's weight?</p>
<p>Lifespan will scale to WEIGHT^(1/4). That's the one-quarter power. Remember that (1/4) power for later. It's not just lifespan but you can use weight to predict:</p>
<ul>
<li>metabolism (how many calories the animal needs per day)</li>
<li>resting heat rate</li>
<li>brain size compared to intelligence</li>
<li>required oxygen</li>
<li>number of offspring over lifespan</li>
</ul>
<p>All for the average animal of that given size. </p>
<p>But it isn't only true of animals. It works for trees. It's true of similar features of organizations like ant colonies or publicly traded corporations. It even true of cities. The pace of life is faster in larger cities and you can predict by how much and the lifespan of a company based on size of organization. They are both exponential on average. </p>
<h2>So... <strong>why does this happen</strong>?</h2>
<p>What's common between mice, elephants, humans, trees, and even cities to some degree?</p>
<p>They all need resources delivered to every part of their structure.
As mass scales up, you have to deliver blood (oxygen and nutrients) to every single cell in the body. Once you have a <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>, you have a branching series of tubes that have to go to every single cell, the same way that every road has to be able to deliver a piece of mail to every single address. Each road (including driveways) has to meet or end in a house. This is basically a fractal - a repeating self-similar structure that looks the same at every scale (like the branches of a tree). </p>
<p>As animals scale up, this structure gets more efficient. There is a 25% savings that you get with scale (1/4 power). Highways can go faster than local roads and the more highways you can build the better you are at delivering things. </p>
<p>This 4 from the 1/4 power is better described as 3+1. 3 for the three spatial dimensions we scale in and 1 for the fractal nature of the structure.
Animals scale in 3-Dimensions and the fractal nature of our cardiovascular system scales in 4. We end up with a 1/4 extra bonus efficiency at scale. </p>
<h2>Extra dimensions</h2>
<p><strong>Wait what? 4 dimensions?</strong> Yeah <em>sort of</em>... This is gonna get deep. Fractals are <em>weird</em>. They sort behave as if they add an extra dimension, mathematically. </p>
<p>The best way I can help you to understand this is with coastlines and weird questions about 4D spheres. </p>
<p>What is the length of the coastline of Iceland? Which country in Europe has the largest coastline? These seem like questions with straightforward answers but for centuries, mapmakers got different answers and couldn't explain why. The issue is that coastlines are fractals and asking about there length is asking a 1D question (length) about something that behaves as though it has an extra dimension. </p>
<p>Imagine a sphere. Now let's ask a question that makes sense about a sphere what's the volume? What's the surface area? We can find formulas to answer these questions. </p>
<p>Now let's ask a question that doesn't seem like it makes sense about a sphere. What is the <strong>total area of the interior?</strong> this doesn't seem like it makes sense because there can't be an area of a three-dimensional object could there?</p>
<p>If we imagine the sphere as a infinite series of two dimensional circles in three-dimensional space, in other words, as slices of a sphere sitting on top of each other, then we can say what the area of each of these slices and add them together.</p>
<p>Since there's an infinite number of these circles the surface area is infinite. Sometimes when you ask a question that applies to an object of a higher number of Dimensions you end up with infinity as the answer. Area is a 2-D question and I asked about a 3D shape, so I got infinity. </p>
<p>What if I told you that there was a real two dimensional shape that can be no wider than a quarter but has an infinite perimeter? The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake" target="_blank">Koch snowflake</a> is a fractal that can be defined so that the perimeter is infinite, just as if we were asking a 1D question about a property of a 2D object. </p>
<p>This is very similar to the discovery of the coastline problem in map making. Depending on how small you let your smallest measurement be, the coastline gets longer. </p>
<p>The branching nature of our cardiovascular system is similar. It isn't infinite but it is almost like an extra dimension. Even though we're only a couple of metres tall, our cardiovascular system has a surface area larger than a tennis court. <strong>We're bigger on the inside. </strong></p>
<h2>Where <em>is</em> the Extra Dimension?</h2>
<p><strong>it is a what not a where </strong>
Some dimensions are <em>where</em> dimensions like left, right, up and down. Some are what dimensions like pressure, time (sort of) or volume. The thing being increased in a fractal is information over scale. In order to define a fractal, I need to cheat. The information for the fractal isn't stored in the shape, it is in the definition. I need to give you an algorithm. And the shape actually changes depending on the resolution that you choose to measure it. If you change the scale or resolution, you change the shape because the shape is defined <em>in terms</em> or its resolution or scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A really cool side to this is the cellular level. The way that a cell channels energy into a usable form is by pumping ions across a membrane. A membrane is the surface area of the cell and is proportional to x squared. It's also common to see many infoldings of the membrane (similar to cilia) to increase surface area. Despite these infoldings, the volume of a cell, which is proportional to X cubed, increases much faster than X squared. Basically the exact same concept as considering giant mammals, but on a tiny scale.</p>
<p>The reason cells like ours, which are much bigger than bacteria, can exist is because we have mitochondria, lots of tiny little membrane pockets that do the membrane pumping thing on their own. There's storing evidence to suggest that mitochondria are actually descended from a primitive bacteria themselves. If our cells need to get bigger, we can just increase the number of mitochondria in them (which is relatively simple; muscles and liver cells have high energy demands and therefore have many mitochondria in them).</p>
<p>Bacteria can't expand their membrane area any way other than just growing, but increasing their volume increases their energy demands even more. It's like if you were thirsty and you needed to run through a hot desert to get a small amount of water; you'll make yourself thirstier by running, it might not even be worth it to go get the water at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The strength of an animal is generally a function of area (the surface area of a muscle or bone), not volume. Weight is a function of volume. Since area increases exponentially slower than volume, hence the &quot;square-cube&quot; name, muscles and bones can't &quot;catch up&quot; to support the weight of giant organisms if the proportions would have to be the same: if you double the size/height while keeping the same shape you end up with four times the muscle power moving eight times the mass. </p>
<p>The bigger the increase the, worse the problem. Make something 3 times bigger and you have 9 times the muscle power moving <em>27 times</em> the weight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Say you're somewhere called 'university' or 'library', if you're within a radius of those buildings your avatar will say studying. As for the listening to music part: it's very easy for Snapchat to tell if you're running a music-streaming app. If you start the app <em>or</em> play music, Snapchat can change your avatar in the background simultaniously. Travel with a speed higher than 10-15km/h and it can assume you're driving a car or using public transportation etc. etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>An infant does not have the strength yet to completely lift her head and turn it if she can't breath.  This may happen when a baby is placed face-down to go to sleep.  It's super difficult to prove if someone has died from suffocation when there has been no violent incident.  That makes it that much harder to diagnose.</p>
<p>There are no doubt other causes as well.  Basically SIDS is just a term for any mysterious death of an infant that can't be explained.  Babies are vulnerable and we may never know what every infant death is from.  Babies just die sometimes and it has always been that way.  SIDS is not a new phenomena, its just a new term.  We can try to eliminate some reasons for infant mortality as they become obvious to medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<hr />
<p>We usually hear the term &quot;SIDS&quot; when discussing safe sleeping habits with our labor and delivery nurses before we take our babies home and from our child's pediatricians. There's a lot of fear and anxiety surrounding Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a lot of misinformation.</p>
<p>What is SIDS?</p>
<pre><code>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old. SIDS is sometimes known as crib death because the infants often die in their cribs.

Source: MayoClinic</code></pre>
<p>SIDS is not the cause of every sudden infant death. Each year in the United States, thousands of babies die suddenly and unexpectedly. These deaths are called SUID, which stands for “Sudden Unexpected Infant Death.”</p>
<p>SUID includes all unexpected deaths: those without a clear cause, such as SIDS, and those from a known cause, such as suffocation. One-half of all SUID cases are SIDS. Many unexpected infant deaths are accidents, but a disease or something done on purpose can also cause a baby to die suddenly and unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“Sleep-related causes of infant death” are those linked to how or where a baby sleeps or slept. These deaths are due to accidental causes, such as suffocation, entrapment, or strangulation. Entrapment is when the baby gets trapped between two objects, such as a mattress and a wall, and can’t breathe. Strangulation is when something presses on or wraps around the baby’s neck, blocking the baby’s airway. These deaths are not SIDS.</p>
<p>Other things that SIDS is not:</p>
<pre><code>SIDS is not the same as suffocation and is not caused by suffocation.
SIDS is not caused by vaccines, immunizations, or shots.
SIDS is not contagious.
SIDS is not the result of neglect or child abuse.
SIDS is not caused by cribs.
SIDS is not caused by vomiting or choking.
SIDS is not completely preventable, but there are ways to reduce the risk.</code></pre>
<p>How can I reduce the risk of SIDS?
There's no way to prevent SIDS, but there are ways to reduce your child's risk.</p>
<pre><code>Always place your baby on his or her back to sleep, for naps and at night, to reduce the risk of SIDS.
Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib, covered by a fitted sheet.
Keep soft objects, toys, crib bumpers, and loose bedding out of your baby's sleep area to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of infant death. (Disclaimer: this is a blanket statement, use your best judgement to decide when your baby is ready to have a thin blanket or stuffed animal in their sleep space.)
Keeping your home or child's room at a comfortable temperature has been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS.
Consider using a pacifier for naps and bedtime.
Room sharing (not bedsharing) for the first 6 months of your baby's life.
Breastfeeding (about 60% less likely to die from SIDS than infants who didn't receive any breast milk).
Avoid products marketed as reducing the risk of SIDS.</code></pre>
<p>The FDA has never cleared or approved a baby product to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS, but a lot of baby products have unproven claims to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS, such as:</p>
<pre><code>heart rate and breathing monitors
mattresses
crib tents
pillows
crib bedding, including bumpers and blankets, and infant positions.</code></pre>
<p>This is not to say to avoid all of these things all together, but to avoid items that have false claims of preventing or reducing the SIDS risk with the expectation that it WILL reduce or prevent SIDS. Most baby items (such as mattresses) have to meet certain safety standards defined by the CPSC.</p>
<p>For example: Infant positioners can be recommended by a pediatrician for a number of reasons but should be used under the guidance of a pediatrician based on circumstance.</p>
<p>Can I use a home heart or breathing monitors to reduce the risk of SIDS?
I'm sure I'm not the only parent who has hovered over my newborn wondering, &quot;Is he breathing?&quot; According to Dr. David King, a pediatric researcher at the University of Sheffield, there's no research to suggest that the information provided by these new devices provides a reliable indicator of danger, or indeed any reliable information about your child. &quot;It's not registered as a medical device.&quot; His findings were published in The British Medical Journal - April 2014.</p>
<p>Home heart rate or breathing monitors can't reduce the risk of SIDS in a healthy child and having additional items/wires in your baby's crib can actually increase the risk of strangulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The procedures proved to reduce the rate of SIDS include placing an infant near the bottom of a cot, on their back, no pillow at all, and if using a blanket, have it made so it is tucked in securely at the bottom of the cot and rises only just high enough to reach the baby's upper chest as they lay with their feet almost touching the end of the cot.</p>
<p>Also: ban cigarette smoke from the house.  No indoor smoking.</p>
<p>Lastly, breastfeeding helps.   The combination of these three techniques dropped the incidence of SIDS by 83% in Australia between 1985 to 2005.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, the exact cause is not known. Several studies have noted that there appears to be abnormalities in the brain stems of infants who died with no known cause that suggests they may have issues with arousing during distress while sleeping. Normally if an infant's breathing in obstructed while sleeping (ex. If they have sleep apnea or a pillow is to close too their face), they will wake up and gasp for air, move their head, etc. to reset their breathing. It's possible these babies with abnormalities may not be able to wake themselves up to correct the situation. This may explain risk factors such as sleeping on stomachs and breathing in cigarette smoke. </p>
<p>This article mentions several studies that corroborate this theory: <a href="http://www.parentingscience.com/what-is-SIDS.html" target="_blank">http://www.parentingscience.com/what-is-SIDS.html</a>  </p>
