		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coming from an aquarist who works with sharks- Great White Sharks are what are called ram ventilators. This means they constantly have to keep swimming to keep water passing over their gills. Sharks have what is called a glide pattern- they have a burst of swimming, then having a gliding portion. When kept in human care, sharks need many things, including a certain shaped tank to allow for this glide pattern. If they do not have enough space or the habitat is the wrong shape, they cannot fully use their glide pattern to the greatest efficiency. If they have to cut their glide short, they use more calories swimming, and this imbalance makes them very hard to keep. Great whites have a huge special need for their glide pattern, so they are very hard to keep in human care. No one has ever kept an adult great white, but Monterey bay aquarium will collect and hold juvenile great white sharks for a few months before releasing them back. They never keep them longer than 6 months and there are a lot of rules about when  they can have them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For one, it takes a massive amount of resources to be able to house a Great White. They are open ocean creatures who don't stay in the same place for very long, and need lots of room to swim.  They travel long distances throughout the open water, rarely changing directions unless necessary, so the ones in captivity have been observed continuously running into walls at relatively fast speeds, causing visible damage. </p>
<p>Even more so, while many fish can get water/oxygen to pass through their gills simply by opening and closing their mouths, Great Whites need to physically move forward with their mouth open. This makes transportation difficult because even a short period without this type of movement can have a lasting negative effect on the shark's well being. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMbHLF_zwjs" target="_blank">Here's a pretty interesting video about the Monterey Bay Aquarium's attempts at housing Great Whites.</a> They've been the most successful, having built special transportation equipment and a 1 million gallon tank, but of the 6 Great Whites they've housed, all were released in less than 6 months from being aggressive / not adapting to the tank. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Watched a short video about this a little while back. I think it was in a nat geo youtube video. Most of the sharks that do well in captivity spend most of their time closer to the shore. Great whites spend more time in open water. The smaller sharks are used to having solid ground around them, so a tank with solid glass is a fairly easy transition. Whereas deep ocean sharks have trouble with swimming into the glass. They get a lot of wounds and scars on their face from collisions. The tanks we build now just arent big enough for them to last more than a few months. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

At higher temperatures the gas molecules have higher energy of motion (kinetic energy) and are able to more easily escape the solution. This lowers the solubility of a gas at higher temperatures. Interestingly, this is the exact opposite effect seen with the solubility of salts which have higher solubility at higher temperatures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Bell 230 and the 212 are mediums that have two blades.</p>
<p>Both those were replaced by 4-bladed versions (the 430 and the 412).</p>
<p>There are many factors that determine the number of blades. But in general, the trend you see in looking at the results of many development programs is this: smaller, cheaper, and slower helicopters have the fewest blades. Bigger, faster, and more expensive ones have more blades.</p>
<p>Notice that the 412 (4 blades) has a max speed about 20 kt faster than the 212 (2 blades).</p>
<p>In general you can say the following:</p>
<p>For hover, low disk loading is most efficient. That means longer blades and therefore fewer blades.</p>
<p>But for speed, more blades are better. The blades turn slower and the tip speed is slower, allowing higher airspeed before the advancing blade tips approach supersonic.</p>
<p>This is illustrated by the 212/412 helicopters.</p>
<p>-The 212 has two blades with a diameter of 48 feet and max weight of 11,200 lb. 100% rotor revs are 324 rpm.</p>
<p>-The 412 has 4 blades with diameter 46 feet and max weight of 11,900 lb. 100% rotor speed is also 324 rpm.</p>
<p>Disk loading
212 = 6.19 lb/ft^2
412 = 7.16 lb/ft^2</p>
<p>Tip Speed
212 = 813 ft/s
412 = 779 ft/s</p>
<p>Vmax
212 = 120 kts
412 = 140 kts</p>
<p>So the 212 has lower disk loading, it should perform better in hover (I don't have data on that). The 412 has lower tip speed and higher airspeed.</p>
<p>Edit: re-wrote it with some numbers to illustrate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ElMachoGrande" target="_blank">ElMachoGrande</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sound. Listen to the Bell 204/Bell 205 (the classic Vietnam helicopter). It has two blades, and it makes a very heavy, booming &quot;chop-chop-chop&quot; sound that is very rough on the ears. More rotor blades make a more &quot;brrrrrr&quot; sound. As helicopters are often used in urban areas, sound levels are a serious concern. For example, you don't want to plop down an ambulance heli at a hospital when it's makes the windows &quot;pump&quot; with the noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotor diameter. More blades means shorter blades. This means that it uses less space, which is useful in many situations. Edit: This also means a shorter tail boom is possible. For example, compare the Bell 205 with the Bo105 and look at how much shorter the tail boom is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed 1. Longer blade will have higher tip velocity, and if the tip goes supersonic, bad things happen, which means that with longer blades, you need to have slower rotation, which means less efficiency. As the forward going blade is traveling at tip speed plus the forward speed, this limitation is the main limitation to the speed of the helicopter.</p>
</li>
<li>Speed 2. Longer blades will have higher tip velocity. On a helicopter, the forward going blade will always move faster than the one going backward, and the higher the tip velocity, the larger the difference. This means that you'll get more lift on the side where the blade moves forwards, and if you go too fast, this can become a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also advantages of fewer blades.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's a simpler construction, which is important on cheap helis or if you really want to mass produce them. It also simplifies maintenance, which is important in some military situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two blades takes less space in the hangar.</p>
</li>
<li>Rotor blades are expensive. Once again, a factor on cheap helis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall trend, on anything but the smallest helis, is towards more rotor blades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, that is not true.  The first Sikorsky military helos in the US were a three blade design, while the popular civilian Bell 47 had two.</p>
<p>The lift you get is based on the total length of the blades and their velocity.  However, the more blades you have, the closer together they are, and the more they interfere.  The most efficient configuration is 2 very long blades, but it takes up more space and it more demanding on the blades.</p>
<p>Early helicopters were limited, because piston engines had poor weight to power ratios, leading to more 2 and 3 blade designs.  Once turbine engines were introduced, they produced enough power per pound that more compact designs became feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Grapes are mildly electrically conductive and their size is close to the wavelength of the microwave.

Plasma is also conductive so the oven continues to drive fucktons of current through it keeping it twisting around in there at several thousand degrees.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the temperature you can achieve can go higher still, but practical matters make higher temperatures increasingly difficult, such as sufficiently insulating the molten material you are heating so that the heat doesn't leak away faster than you can add energy, and doing it without heat-damaging the oven, etc. People line the oven interior with brick like a kiln.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. As something gets hotter, the rate heat is conducted and radiated away increases. However, your microwave doesn't increase its power output as the food inside it gets hotter. So, if you put something in a 600 watt microwave (made up that number) and turn the microwave on for forever, eventually whatever is inside the microwave will heat up until it is conducting and radiating away 600 watts of heat. At that point it is in equilibrium and the temperature will not increase or decrease. This maximum temperature depends on how much contact it has with the air and microwave (since I will conduct heat to them) and it's surface area (more surface area means more area for heat to radiate away from). So, if you wanted to get something incredibly hot, you should get something very small and use magnets to suspend it in midair, then create a vacuum inside the microwave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwave energy strongly interacts with water because it is a polar molecule. Therefore, foods containing lots of water will heat up more strongly than those which lack a great deal of water.</p>
<p>Simple experiment:</p>
<p>Place a slice of bread into the microwave for one minute. It should heat a little bit, perhaps 5-10 degrees C.</p>
<p>Then if you put 0.3 L of water into the microwave, you heat it from room temperature to close to boiling, an increase of 50-70C, in one minute.</p>
<p>Because of the impact of water, it is hard to get anything in the microwave above 100C.</p>
<p>A few foods do contain enough polar molecules which have differing thermal properties than water, and can be heated above 100C. I believe certain cooking oils, including coconut oil, are among them. I don't recommend trying it, as I can't find any reference for how hot it can get!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

By mixing the concentrates, it gives a uniform blend to their juice throughout the year. For example, when the winter oranges are harvested, part of their juice is added to summer concentrate, and part of it is frozen or canned. Then during summer, vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For soaps and such, it just means it's more concentrated, as the name would imply. Dish soaps and laundry detergents are typically mostly just water. The water added makes it mix easier and measure out easier. It also makes it look like you're buying more of something on the shelf, so you think you're getting a better deal (12oz soap for $1 vs 24oz for $1).</p>
<p>Most of the top juice replys are somewhat wrong.  Juice (like orange juice) goes bad after not too long, even stored and refridgerated, and orange growing season is not steady all year. So science (florida university in the 1940's) figured out that  heat and pressure can remove most of the water and many other compounds/nutrients from the juice to store for much longer, and then add it back when they need to use it. This leaves it tasting not the same as fresh squeezed, though.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;not from concentrate&quot; juice isn't really much different.  Instead of freezing after removing water, they de-oxygenate it and store it as a liquid. This also strips much of the flavor and vitamins out of it, which are added back (usually added back from extractions of the orange peels. This is for concentrate and not from concentrate.) to it after being stored for up to a year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the product. Concentrate normally means they've taken water out of something to make it 'stronger'. </p>
<p>For cleaning products, I suspect it is marketing. The thinking with that would be we assume and associate concentrate with with being stronger, so a concentrate cleaning product must be X times better than a non concentrate product.</p>
<p>For juices, again it can be marketing. <strong>NB</strong>:Where I live, juice from a supermarket has no concentrate. If it did, it would be a fruit <em>drink</em>, not fruit <em>juice</em>. A fruit juice has 100% fruit juice, a fruit <em>drink</em> has some fruit juice (usually not much) + all these additives, sugar etc. In this context concentrate means they have taken some water out of the juice to make it stronger. They've then put some of this concentrate juice into the drink along with other things to make a new fruity drink. </p>
<p>Another possibility (common in fast food joints), concentrate means they've taken some water out, transported it and added water back in, all to cut down on transport costs. In McDonald's (again, at least where I live), they link the concentrated drink, whether it be Coke or juice, directly into the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib-ce2z5PSAhVHxrwKHck5CgYQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flist25.com%2F25-fast-food-restaurants%2F&amp;psig=AFQjCNFyehn3AI7bsVZ7B01YsVLxn5GDhw&amp;ust=1487300265781751" target="_blank">dispensers</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is we sorta didn't. When people say we don't know how they built the pyramids, it's more about us not knowing their exact methods, not about how they were so advanced and we could never do it today. We do have plenty of plausible theories but we can't say we know exactly for all of them. The amazement is about what they managed to achieve with what they had, not about us not being capable of replicating it at all.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind the amount of time and effort that was put into some of these megastructures. They took many decades to build and were huge efforts that often took the resources of powerful kingdoms/states/empires. I'd say it's better to compare the building of the pyramids to something like the Space Race and moon landing rather than to buildings today.</p>
<p>Also note that it's not as if these megastructures somehow prove that ancient peoples had better building technology. They would've found it impossible to build the skyscrapers we can put up in a few short years. The Roman ancient roads were an amazing achievement at the time, but they would not have found it possible to build the US highway system. And just because stone tablets will last hundreds of more years than paper doesn't mean that they are somehow more advanced to develop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So, we don't surpass the massive stones, and we remain awed by the real achievements of engineering that used them.
Similarly, entering a structure made all of wood with no nails can impress us for achievements that we do not emulate today. The examples abound of architectural practices that awe is that are out of vogue: gargoyles, stained glass, spires, even large scale brickwork is not seen so much and impresses me when I see the beautiful rows of bricks, and the devil's bridges, and the mud skyscrapers of Yemen, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you mass produce tools? First, you sort of cobble a tool together using whatever you've got. Then you have your proto-tools, you use those to bootstrap yourself up to the next level, hand-crafting your nice tools. Ok, now you have some actual tools, but you still haven't gotten mass-production. So you use your nice tools to build some tool-building tools, and then once you have those, you build some tool-building-tool-weilding automation systems (you could call them robots, or factory lines, depending which era you're talking about). And so on.</p>
<p>It's basically just bootstrapping again and again and again. Somebody took the first circuits and said &quot;if I connect these two wires in this way, I get this output&quot;. Somebody else said &quot;well let me take some circuit boards and print them in such a way that it's easy to switch the inputs around to get different outputs&quot;. Then somebody said &quot;cool, now that you have that, I'm going to come up with a set of common rules on how best to get a certain output using these circuit paths. As long as your circuit machines follow this convention, other people can quickly bang out circuits using that same convention without having to build it from scratch every time&quot;. That's assembly. Then somebody else said &quot;ok cool, but some people don't really understand circuits, so I'm going to abstract that one level further&quot;.</p>
<p>If you are a programmer, any time you abstract some concept into an easier to use API, you are doing the exact same sort of process the early programmers were doing. They just didn't have so many shoulders to stand on as you do. When I write fetch('/foo').then(r =&gt; r.text()).then(console.log.bind(console)), I am not actually thinking about all the various pieces that breaks down into. But somebody else at some point said &quot;you know what, javascript needs a way to make http requests&quot;. And somebody before them said &quot;you know what, there should be a quick and easy way to make a standardized tcp connection to a server, receive some data, and close the connection&quot;. Somebody before that said &quot;I wish there were a protocol that would help me send packets of data across a network in a standardized way&quot;. Before that somebody said &quot;I wish there were some way to beam bits of light across ethernet cables&quot;. etc.</p>
<p>Obviously take these generalizations with a grain of salt, I'm sort of making it up to prove a point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am enjoying this topic, so let me try my hand at explaining it.</p>
<hr />
<p>First, you must understand that a computer is essentially a really complicated series of switches.  Each switch does something specific with a bit (1 or 0).  Flipping a switch may send a bit to one place or another.  A different switch may save that bit for later.  Yet another switch may flip a series of other switches which all preform a more complicated action like binary multiplication.  It may even do something really fancy, like light up a pixel on an external display.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, a computer has a lot of these switches in the processor.  Millions or billions of them in fact.  Basically, way too many to set individually.  So, when we design a chip, we make a few switches that control all the rest of them.  We call this an instruction.</p>
<p>An instruction for a simple processor may just be 8 bits, something like '11001100' which means we turn on the 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 8th switches, while leaving the others off.  When you use the switches this way, it may cause a cascading action that adds two bits together, and outputs the result.  Now that there are easier instructions, users can just input the instructions that they want the computer to run, one at a time!  This is effectively a language, called machine code.  Old-school processors came with a thick book of instruction decodes (Add A to B is 11010001), and you would have to run it that way.</p>
<p>Okay, so users can put in one command at a time.  Too Slow!  So what we do is save commonly used commands that handle standard tasks, such as reading a keyboard press, displaying text on a screen, or reading a harddrive.  All these simple tasks can be saved to a memory chip that runs the moment we press the power button, and continues running as long as the computer is on.  So that way, it knows when you press the keyboard for example.</p>
<p>But still, no person programs in machine code these days.  Instead, we abstract that by making a language that is easier to read and write.  Something like C, or Python.  So what we do is write code in those languages, and then another program turns that language into the machine code that runs the computer.  </p>
<hr />
<p>TL;DR - Basic tasks that are necessary to get a computer to a point where you can program it are hard coded 1s and 0s that drive the transistors in your processor to a state where you can load more complicated code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Step 2: Get sick of that, so create a computer that can read those ones and zeros off a physical medium, such as a long strip of paper, or cards.   This is called programming in &quot;Machine Language&quot;.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get sick of writing ones and zeros for the commands, so give names to the various opcodes, such as &quot;LSR&quot;, for Left Shift Register.   This is called &quot;Assembly Language&quot;.   Write a program that does a 1 to 1 translation of assembly command to machine command.</p>
<p>Step 4: Realize that you keep doing the same sequence of assembly language instructions over and over, so you create a program that can convert a special command, such as &quot;loop X times&quot; into that sequence of assembly language commands.</p>
<p>Step 5: Keep adding more commands, and realize that symbolic addresses are useful, too.   Before you know it, you have a compiler for a high level language, written in assembly language.</p>

To write a program for this monster I would get a piece of paper and work out what i wanted it to do. I would then write (by hand) the machine code instructions and then refer to another sheet of paper with the binary equivalents for each instruction. </p>
<p>I then used some graph paper on which i had columns for memory address, op code (the command) and the data, all written as 1's and 0's. I would then use the keyboard to enter the memory address (in binary) and the command or data i wanted to enter. After many hours I would then hit the run button and watch as the bank of 8 Light bulbs would flicker in a set sequence, and have to start all over again as the computer had no long term memory.</p>
<p>Earlier than that, NASA and other organisaitons used &quot;braid memory&quot; which is literally bundles of wires braided together into the binary patterns for the program to be run. This means that rocket's flew into space running computer programs entered into them by little old ladies basically knitting miles and miles of wire. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory</a>)</p>
<p>And even earlier than that the Bombe (a code breaking computer from 1939) had rotating switches for memory, you programmed it by turning dials for each memory location before running it. Although the bombe was only capable of running one &quot;program&quot; without physically re-building it, and the memory was more like a saved configuration file for that program in today's terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you asking us how programmers programmed programs when they didn't have any programming programs to program programs with?</p>
<p>If you look at the predecessor to Windows, MS-DOS, you will notice how simple it is, and how little it could do. So somebody wrote compilers for it, which allowed people to write more complex programs for it. Then people wrote graphical Software Development Kits, and slowly the beast just grew and grew. What was important here was the fact that everyone settled on using the same computer - what was known as the IBM-compatible, or as it's called today: The PC.</p>
<p>I had an 8-bit machine back in the eighties, and we could buy magazines with programs to enter. It would come in the shape of a page of machine code, and a tiny BASIC program that you could enter the machine code into in order to write it to disk. Oh, yeah, and if you got any of the bytes wrong, you'd just crash and would essentially have to start over. I'd say &quot;Good times&quot;, but damn it, it wasn't.</p>
<p>The 8-bit processor would itself come with a ROM - read-only-memory, which would provide basic functionality. To the best of my knowledge, this was actually hardware. As in, the programs were written with logic gates. I did have a PASCAL compiler back in the mid-eighties, but the compiler itself took up most of the disc space itself, so you couldn't really do much with it. :p</p>
<p>TL;DR: With logic gates and machine code. And very slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

De-gassing water to prevent corrosion or make very clear ice is done by repeatedly boiling and cooling water.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume your question asks about why the oxygen concentration decreases with depth in the ocean.  If not, please clarify.</p>
<p>Atmospheric oxygen equilibrates with the ocean at the seawater/atmosphere interface.  Whatever temperature and pressure are for a given water mass is when it is at the surface defines its starting oxygen concentration.  If the water then cools and becomes more dense it sinks.  It does not increase in oxygen concentration since there is no source of additional oxygen.</p>
<p>Oxygen is consumed by biological processes, i.e respiration.  As organic matter is metabolized it consumes oxygen.  Organic matter falls through the water column and as it is consumed it must use oxygen whether the consumer is a microorganism or other heterotroph.</p>
<p>Therefore, as you get deeper, the &quot;older&quot; water, that is water that has been away from the surface longer, decreases in oxygen concentration.  In fact, when there is abundant surface productivity raining down organic matter it can drive the oxygen concentration all the way to zero, creating so-called &quot;dead zones&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bco-dmo.org/parameter/527499" target="_blank">Apparent Oxygen Utilization</a> is a handy tool to measure productivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In freshwater or marine systems Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) is the difference between the measured dissolved oxygen concentration and its equilibrium saturation concentration in water with the same physical and chemical properties. Such differences typically occur when biological activity acts to change the ambient concentration of oxygen. For example, primary production liberates oxygen and increases its concentration, while respiration consumes it and decreases its concentration.</p>
<p>Consequently, the AOU of a water sample represents the sum of the biological activity that the sample has experienced since it was last in equilibrium with the atmosphere. In shallow water systems (e.g. lakes), the full water column is generally in close contact with the atmosphere, so oxygen concentrations are typically close to saturation: AOU values are low. In deep water systems (e.g. oceans), water can be out of contact with the atmosphere for extremely long periods of time (years, decades, centuries) and large AOU values are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>edit: OK!  so, I went to r/science <em>after</em> reading r/askscience questions.  I now assume your question relates to this post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5u9cr3/new_study_has_detected_a_decline_in_the_amount_of/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5u9cr3/new_study_has_detected_a_decline_in_the_amount_of/</a>  </p>
<p>In any case, the answer is well provided there: as the ocean warms the water can dissolve less oxygen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean.</p>

<p>Also, in 1997 Congress signed an act that limited Secret Service protection for presidents to ten years after office. Obama reversed it, though, so now all presidents receive lifetime protection again. But the protection becomes much more limited. When I was in school in Boston 3 years ago or so Bill Clinton walked through the bookstore and all he had was a few agents with him. Contrast that to the current president where they close off highway exits that lead to where he is at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is part of counterintelligence to consider this. If a person is compromised, then whatever information they ever had access to is considered compromised. That's why security breaches are so painful. It's also why the modern intelligence aparatus must be compartmentalized. Most of the incriminating information is about how we collect information. </p>
<p>For instance, if we have a record of who the attaches are in an embassy that belong to that nations intelligence service, it's not as important as the how we got it. All of them will be replaced, and as long as our method of obtaining information is secure, we can continue to monitor the correct people. Generally speaking, the president won't know, the how we get something. He doesn't have time for it, he'll just know the what. </p>
<p>As for the how, it can get pretty dicey, especially when we get it from a third party. Everyone spies on their allies, since often our allies know the kinds of things we want to know about our enemies, but they can't tell us because it would compromise their sources. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And you don't gain anything. &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; is the easiest practical approach if you want to work with it. While the Copenhagen interpretation is not directly &quot;shut up and calculate&quot;, it is closer to that.</p>
<p>There is also the historic argument. Copenhagen came first and made it into the textbooks. If all interpretations would have started at the same time, and with today's knowledge about decoherence, I would expect Many-Worlds to be much more popular.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
