<p>edit: </p>
<p>Hello everyone, I appreciate all the feedback received from this post and I'm grateful for such well presented answers. I realise that this sort of question can raise many different answers due to the question being too general. </p>
<p>But as I understand from most of the replies... The reason the light from those stars will never entirely vanish is because even when the star/galaxy passes the cosmological event horizon, the space between us and them is only expanding and so the light that was sent before the star/galaxy passing the cosmological event horizon will only stretch due to the expansion and continue to reach us but through other spectrums of light as it continues to redshift. Would this be correct? </p>
<p>I would also like to bring forward a question that has been brought up by a few other redditors. However as it may seem there is no exact answer to it, I'd like to ask a question similar to it:</p>
<p>Which stars/galaxies have most noticeably redshifted or faded from visual light? I'd definitely like to read up on this topic so any names or articles would be great. Thanks again guys!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two relevant horizons for this discussion. The Cosmological Event Horizon, and the Cosmic Microwave Backgound.</p>
<p>The Cosmological Event Horizon is a distance away from us beyond which if a photon is emitted right now it will never reach us due to space expanding between it and us faster than it is traveling towards us. Space is expanding everywhere, so the amount of expansion between us and another object is determined by how far away it is. For something that is close the expansion will be unnoticable, for something far enough away, it will be larger than the speed of light. You could also imagine a Cosmic Rock Horizon where if someone is beyond that distance from you, and they throw a rock at you it will never reach you because of the expansion of space between you and the rock - this is very far away, but much much closer than the Cosmological Event Horizon.</p>
<p>The Cosmic Microwave Background is the edge of the observable/visible universe. Remember that as you observe galaxies further and further away, you are observing the universe when it was much, much younger. At some point soon after the big bang the universe switched from being an extremely hot and dense non-transparent particle-soup to mostly-empty space that allows light to travel large distances without hitting anything. The CMB is the light that was emitted by this particle soup just as the universe became transparent. It is the furthest thing away in both space and time that is possible to see. And we can see it in pretty amazing detail! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background</a></p>
<p>No object in the universe has ever redshifted out of view due to being further away than the Cosmological Event Horizon. The first thing that this will happen to is the CMB itself, followed by the galaxies nearest it. Right now the number of galaxies in the visible universe is expanding as the CMB gets further away and we watch new galaxies form (they formed billions of years ago, but the light of their formation has not yet reached us.)</p>
<p>So let us think about the oldest galaxy we have ever observed with the Hubble telescope. Is there intelligent life in that galaxy? Did they just broadcast a signal this morning trying to communicate with someone outside their galaxy? No matter how powerful a receiver we build we would never hear it, because it is beyond the Cosmological Event Horizon. Space is expanding between us and that galaxy faster than their broadcast is traveling toward us. The fact that this galaxy is outisde of the Cosmological Event Horizon has nothing to do with whether or not we can see it. but it is why the signal will never reach us.</p>
<p>Its worse than that, the signal is getting further away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: i wonder whether their light gets shifted to universe-scale wavelengths before reading the cosmic horizon.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an answer that leads to losing galaxies: &quot;How many galaxies emit light today (in comoving coordinates) that we can see in the future? How does that number look tomorrow, in a week, in a year, ...?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer is something like 1 galaxy &quot;lost&quot; per day. There are about 1E12 galaxies in the observable universe, but only ~1/30 of them, or 3E10, are still in our future light cone (~13 billion light years radius today). The galaxy distances at the edge of this increase roughly (but not exactly) with the speed of light while the radius of our future light cone just expands slowly, so every day we lose the galaxies in a spherical shell with a thickness of 1 light day. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3E10*4+pi+(13E9\)%5E2+*+1%2F365+%2F+(4%2F3+pi+(13E9\)%5E3\" target="_blank">Putting everything together</a>) we get 0.4 galaxies per day. As this is just a rough estimate, let's say 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way to picture the effects of expanding space-time is the raisin bread model: Before baking the dough with the raisins in you plot out the relative positions of each raisin within. Once cooked though you will witness that the dough has expanded between the raisins, more so if there is more dough between each point, but the raisins themselves have not moved much, if at all.</p>
<p>I wrote an investigation piece on Dark Energy for my 3rd year dissertation. We will loose galaxies over time along the line of sight, but not at a noticeable rate, nor at a calculable rate due to their varying distributions throughout space. Also much can change over the timescales that it takes for a galaxies light to reach us from such distances as near the limits of the observable universe.</p>
<p>TL;DR space expands like bread dough between raisins, moving stuff away from each other. We will lose sight of some objects, but not soon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't bad for our health.  They are essential for life.  When we lived in the wild those were the things that retained water best for us (salt), and had the highest calories (sugar and fat).  Our brains don't know they live in a time where food=fridge in a sense, so it is still in 10,000 BC where when you find sugary and fatty food you pig out on it to gain fat to hold over until you can get your next bit of fat.  </p>
<p>Think of a gas engine.  Give it gas, and it functions.  Give it 40L of gas and it will function longer.  Give it 100L of gas and it will function even longer than with 40L. Sure, it'll weight more having a bigger tank attached to it, but It'll just keep humming along for that much longer because it has that much more gas.  The gas engine will only last as long as it has gas, and because it doesn't have knowledge of when it will consume some again it will allow you to fill it as much as possible.  Exactly like the body.</p>
<p>That part of the brain only functions in the now you could say, and that is why it goes &quot;FAT/SUGAR/SALT!!!! GIMME GIMME!!!!!!!!&quot; because it knows that eating 1lb of those foods will make it survive far more than foods with very little of it.  So due to being &quot;cut off&quot; from the other parts of the brain that could think &quot;we can just eat more in 3 hours....fat ass&quot; it will just forever crave it as long as it knows it's in front of you.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit/sidenote:</strong>  It's trans fats that are bad for us, processed sugars(in relations to it often being found in empty calories), and TOO MUCH of those.  All those metals we need in our body do wonders for us, but my god can they do damage to us if we consume too much of them.  Much like anything we consume: moderation.  It's all good in moderation, and all bad without. Look at fibre.  It can constipate you, but can also give you diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Should've mentioned a bit more detail about sugar.  Its the only energy source for the brain. While people explained to me we, as mammals, can make our own. With that being said, it is still easier to just consume some instead of making the body do it all itself.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit2b:</strong> I have been informed by many of you that recently science has discovered that the brain can survive on ketones made by the liver with fats.</p>
<p><strong>Edit3:</strong> Thanks for the gold and the upvotes everyone!  </p>
<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Many people pointed out I screwed up on my explanation when I said sugar=high calories. What I should've/wanted to say was that sugary foods were highly beneficial to our survival due to often being rich in nutrients (apples, berries, etc), and being found in abundance (apple tree with 800lbs of apples).  I didn't mean to make it sound like gram to gram sugar (carbs) has more calories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Being able to eat the calorie dense sugar and fats means that we would be able to survive more days without food, improving our overall &quot;health.&quot; We needed salt to replenish all the salts lost through sweat because humans are built for endurance running (early human hunters would jog along until the prey runs out of energy). The humans who didn't crave sugars, fats, and salt would not build up enough energy and wouldn't survive as well as those who did crave them.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the food industry takes advantage of our primitive brain cravings to sell us more food. Normally, a person only eats a constant amount of food. If that was the case, for the food industry, the profits will never increase. They have to make people eat more food to generate profits. Thus, there is a strong incentive to put more sugars, fats, and salt in our foods so we eat more of it, regardless if it was healthy for us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We're programmed to seek out the biggest bang for the buck, nutritionally speaking.  For most of our history, resources were scarce, so we needed to be encouraged to seek out the stuff that would do us the most good.  That's why we like those flavors.</p>
<p>The problem is in modern time, that scarcity doesn't exist anymore, but we're still programmed to act like it does.  If you eat &quot;bad&quot; stuff in moderation, you'll be fine.  It's only when you regularly gorge (eat more than you burn) that it really becomes a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our instincts and tastes evolved long before we became civilized and technologically advanced.</p>
<p>In our natural, pre-mega-technological state, things that are bad for us to overeat were rare and valuable to our diet - salts, sugars and fats were hard to get, and virtually impossible to get too much of. </p>
<p>In small amounts they are all vital to our health, making us strong and powerful. This positive effect became a strong selective force that pushed us to evolve the instinctual desire to eat them.</p>
<p>Lethargy and bad body habits were also difficult to achieve - you didn't have a choice to sit in an air-conditioned apartment and binge netflix. You had to interact with community/nature for food, materials and entertainment. Any extra rest you could 'steal' was a bonus, so we evolved to desire lethargy even though we couldn't maintain it. It used to be impossible.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2017, we mass-produce everything and live cushy lifestyles. The impossible combination of sloth and overeating is now possible. Our instincts are outdated, but they don't kill us before child-bearing age. Thus we are unable to evolve a counter-balancing set of instincts, stuck in the loop of the desire to eat chocolate cake until diabetes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Higgs boson was the last major prediction of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, but for many years it's discovery eluded physicists.  The Higgs mechanism tells us how elementary particles get their mass.  You can imagine the Higgs field being like treacle.  Particles which couple to the Higgs field will slow down from the speed of light in the field.  If they do so, they have mass, like the electron.  If not, they are massless, like the photon.  There Higgs boson is an excitation of this field, like a vibrating spring in a mattress, and finding one confirms that the field exists and the mechanism is correct.  </p>
<p>But the Higgs boson was predicted to have a very high mass (although the exact value could not be predicted), and therefore would be very short lived because it could quickly decay to lighter particles.  This means you don't see many of them hanging around, so you need to put a lot of energy into one place to make one.  This is one of the reasons why scientists built the LHC, as it allows us to accelerate particles to extremely high energy, smash them together, and see what the energy of that collision makes by analysing the products.  They managed to do this in 2012.  </p>
<p>So, finding the Higgs boson confirms the last major piece of the Standard Model.  But it also has more potential than that.  While the Standard Model does a great job of explaining everything it tries to, it leaves a lot out, namely gravity.  If we can find any irregularities in the properties of the Higgs from what the Standard Model predicts, we might be able to find a lead to the new physics we desperately need to connect quantum field theory with gravity.  More analysis of the Higgs will be done in the coming months and years to see if we can find any such leads.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so quick tl;dr version of  quantum field theory. </p>
<p>1: A field is a function defined over some region space and time. If that sounds scary it's not. You're used to some of these, think gravitational fields and magnetic fields. </p>
<p>2: In the case of quantum fields, they're what give rise to the fundamental particles. Individual particles are excitations in their related quantum field. Basically this means there is for example one electron field and every election can be described as an excited state of that field. That's a littreal scarier, but the nutshell is that if you find a fundamental particle, it means it's field is also a thing. </p>
<p>3: The interactions between those particles can be described by the interactions between the corresponding quantum fields. The higgs field in particular is of major interest, because interactions with it are why some particles have mass, which is why everything isn't traveling at light speed and why we're here talking about this. You'll note the lack of qualifiers in that sentence, a couple years ago the words &quot;we think&quot; would have been included there. </p>
<p>4: Those fields are a PITA to study directly. You can use QFT to make empirical predictions and etc, but you can't realy point at something and go &quot;yup that's the higgs field&quot; </p>
<p>5: fortunately if the field exists it has a corresponding particle, and particles are things you can point at. So if you find the higgs boson (which is the particle associated with the higgs field), and its properties  match the theoretically predicted ones by extensions you've gone a long way to confirming the existence of and the properties of the higgs field. Which is kind of a big deal, if you do that you get to move from &quot;we'll this is probably right&quot; to  &quot;yup this is definitely how things work&quot; </p>
<p>In the case of the higgs boson it was a big deal because it had been predicted to be a thing back in the 60s and half a century of waiting for confirmation is a long time to build hype, especially when it proved to be much much harder to create and detect than initially expected. The LHC was built in large part to finally find the damn thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, so in ELI5 terms: you're in first grade.  A bully is going around shoving people, putting his fist in their face, demanding they be friends with him. </p>
<p>Now, if you turn around and befriend him, start giving him some of your lunch money, hanging out with him, <em>it only validates that his actions of bullying were effective to get people on his side</em>.  And it makes all the victims of their bullying even MORE fearful, because now the bully is gaining allies from doing very bad things. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with peace.  But Russia has not been content with peace since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Many people in Russia who are still in a seat of power feel embarassed that the West basically pushed them into economic collapse.  They're angry and they want their seat at the table.  They want world power. </p>
<p>Now, while all nations participate in a lot of shady shit, on a regular basis, Russia has <em>a lot</em> of really disturbing problems.  For one, under Putin, they're a dictatorship.  His political opponents regularly &quot;get sick and die,&quot; the government blackmails and bullies and bribes people regularly. </p>
<p>We sanctioned Russia economically because they <em>invaded</em> the Ukraine militarily.  Remember, this is exactly the way that Hitler began his rise to power.  Autocrats seek to expand their territory.  Crimea, which was a part of Ukraine previously, had access to a powerful strategic sea port, and a lot of resources.  They made a power grab.  They bullied a weaker nation. </p>
<p>Befriending them now sends a statement around the world: &quot;we are OK with this behavior.&quot;  We would be endorsing territorial expansion into sovereign nations. </p>
<p>Importantly, though, none of this is new.  Russia has almost <em>always</em> behaved like this post-WWII.  The stereotype of the Russian spy goes back many decades.  This is how they've set up their government and intelligence agencies, and in many ways, Putin, who was raised by the Russian Intelligence community, is a consolidation of all of Russia's worst attributes.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  I see a lot of people comparing Russia's invasion of Crimea to the US invasion of Iraq.  </p>
<p>Firstly, yes, invading Iraq was wrong.  We did so based on faulty intel and questionable reasoning, we destabilized the region and people died.  What we did was bad.  As a nation of voters, we were largely manipulated based on powerful sentiment after 9/11 by a deceptive government.  Whether Bush was tricked into endorsing it by more savvy operators like Cheyney and Rumsfeld, we may never know. </p>
<p><em>HOWEVER</em>, there are major differences that we need to draw between the two actions: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Russia lied about even BEING in Crimea</strong>.  For months they perpetuated a charade where their military wasn't involved in Crimea, and that this was just a rebellious faction seeking to rejoin Russia.  But this is a lie.  What they did was a military invasion.  With genuine Russian military.  That level of deception on the global stage is deeply, deeply concerning.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Russia ANNEXED Crimea</strong>.  They absorbed the territory into themself.  When we invaded Iraq, we eventually turned the government back over to them, for better or worse (and it turned out worse, of course).  But Russia <em>stole</em> territory from a sovereign nation.  This is a HUGE red flag that perhaps you can't understand if you don't follow politics.  It is very bad to invade a sovereign nation under nearly any circumstance; but it is <em>much more concerning</em> to annex their territory.  Because ultimately, politics is a land game.  Like Risk.  You expand your territory, you expand your power.  That is why Hitler began his push.  This is the biggest red flag. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Americans justifiably turned AGAINST the Iraq War</strong>.  We have, still to this day, miraculously, a free press.  And that free press slammed the Bush administration for their actions.  People were allowed to speak out against it.  Politicians ran campaigns where anti-war was a major political point.  The people in power made a bad decision - and we had an internal debate about it, one we still have to this day.  <em>We are capable of change.  We are capable of course correction</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>That doesn't exist in Russia.  There is no media that isn't a surrogate for Putin.  Opposition parties opposed to their actions are arrested.  Their leaders are disappeared or wind up dead.  There is <em>no dissent in Russia</em>. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT #2</strong>:  I see many people here, as they do in the real world, conflating a country's people with its government, and a nation's past with its present. </p>
<p>Russia isn't evil.  Russia is an enormous land mass with a hugely diverse group of people and a thousands-of-years-old history.  There are evil people there, and evil people in power, as there are anywhere.  The Russian people are a great people.  They have made incredible contributions to philosophy, literature, mathematics, and science.  </p>
<p>The last 100 years has not been kind to Russia.  Where the US has been relatively stable, they went through three <em>major and total uphevals</em>, the wake of which left them disorganized and destabilized. </p>
<p>This isn't the fault of the Russians.  If the US experienced similar turmoil, we would be similarly destabilized.  People like Putin rise to power easily in chaos.  Because he imposes order - even if he does so through condemnable means.  The powerful like order, and so Putin gains favor with oligarchs and the old guard. </p>
<p>The Russian people deserve freedom.  As do all people.  Putin is deceptive, autocratic, manipulative, abusive to his people.  He is against the free press (they have state-run media), and he's also vindictive.  He is following, publicly, a text called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics" target="_blank">The Foundations of Geopolitics</a>, written by Russian political thinkers.  He doesn't even make much of a secret about following this agenda.  And this text lays our <em>very specific</em> mechanisms for returning Russia to power through extremely subversive means.  Rather than looking internally, FoG looks to destabilize and worsen other regions, to allow Russia to thrive through more corrupt means. </p>
<p>I'm not a big nationalist.  I want global peace and stability.  People like Putin reject this mandate.  They want to consolidate national power, and by extension, their own.  America has had presidents like this - and I reject them, too. </p>
<p>When we speak about &quot;Russia&quot;, occasionally we are doing so as shorthand to mean &quot;the Russian government in power&quot;.  I want nothing more than for Russians to have a free nation.  But they don't get that <em>by appeasing Putin and his tactics</em>.  That will only empower Putin and make life much worse for his domestic opposition. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I dont like Putun, neither I like his politics. But actions of your government harms us, russian people, not Putin. He only exploits these actions to show that you are our enemy and to unite the majority against common enemy (it's not that bad actually, just most people don't like your government). For example, Putin's rating  increased to about 90% after Eu and Us sanctions. On other hand, prices increased significantly, and the quality of products dropped(russian cheese, for example, is just garbage). So I was really happy to hear that our relationship may stabilize, because I don't think that you can help us to get rid of him. It's our problem and it's up to us to help ourselves.

Without it, large quantities of hydrogen is lost to solar wind. Without hydrogen there cannot be water, hydrocarbons and almost every other building block of life. Even today atmosphere of Venus is very dry because the planet doesn't have hydrogen to form water. </p>
<p>Even if you switch it's location with mars it would still lose its hydrogen. It would perhaps be a cooler version of Venus, but calculations are needed to predict how cool or hot would it be compared to earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since Venus is about the same size as Earth and made of roughly similar proportions of elements, it should be a cooler version of Earth if it were in Mar's orbit.  The main factor that is different is the absence of a moon like ours.  It is already assumed that Venus could have had water in its earliest days but that its oceans, if any, evaporated and the water molecules were broken apart in the upper atmosphere by solar radiation, hydrogen was lost to space (being lighter) and oxygen combined with carbon to help form the dense CO2 atmosphere it has today.  From what I understand, Earth and Venus have about the same amount of carbon, the key difference is that it is all up in the air in Venus due to its high temperatures which would melt limestone or any other form of carbon that would otherwise be sequestered in the crust.  Lack of water means no plate tectonics to keep most carbon out of the atmosphere nor oceans to absorb lots of carbon dioxide.  It is possible that Venus in Mar's orbit could be a frozen world too, as this has happened to our own planet more than once before significant animal life evolved.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that it counteracts excess of calcium, and helps the body use potassium better, and a bath would reduce pain from muscle cramping, not just any pain.  However when I went to find a way to explain this clearer I came across this site <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0048475/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0048475/</a>
from the US National library of medicine with a study that concluded:</p>
<p>&quot;Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy‐associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed. We found no randomized controlled trials evaluating magnesium for exercise‐associated muscle cramps or disease state‐associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease).&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Floating in water helps relieve pressure on joints and so/also lets muscles relax.</p>
<p>The denser the water the more, and more easily, you float.</p>
<p>Tubs are kind-of small.</p>
<p>So if you could float vertically in a pool you'd get a lot of relief, but your mouth and nose holes would be beneath the water line. So the optimal floating system would be basically a pool deeper than you are tall with a SCUBA or snorkel deal to let you breathe without struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Most people can't afford that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So adding Epsom Salt to a regular bath tub of water increases the density of the water and so you &quot;float more&quot;. Regular salt would do the same thing but it's much, much more expensive for the same results.</p>
<p>The salt isn't soaking into your skin or anything, it's just making the water into a solution that supports your body weight more effectively in the restricted space and so lets your muscles relax more fully and takes more pressure off your joints.</p>
<p>Now back in the day (say a hundred years ago) the average bathtub was longer and the average person was shorter. So the average person could lie down fully in the average tub. This made Epsom Salt baths particularly effective. It also led to a lot of drowning and such, particularly since laudanum, alcohol, and other sedatives were really popular. So for safety the tubs have been made significantly shorter. Short enough so that the average person can get/keep their head above water by just straightening their legs.</p>
<p>With this infrastructure change the efficacy of an Epsom Salt bath has been greatly reduced, so it's fallen out of favor. You have to isolate the part you need to float. So treating a knee is pretty easy, but treating a shoulder or back requires some contortion that may not be available in a built-in tub, by putting your legs up outside the tub at the far end.</p>
<p>But if you can ever find a nice six-foot cast-iron tub from a hundred or so years ago, I definitely recommend the experience. Just don't fall asleep and let your head go under. It's really unpleasant to inhale that stuff. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you assume that the one man and one woman are the only source of genetic information, then you have short term issues with incest.</p>
<p>Long term, variations will come about through genetic mutation which will allow for a genetic base for a sustainable population.</p>
<p>The key to doing it right is planning.</p>
<p>The first couple needs to make a large number of children, at least 4 boys and 4 girls. Those children will have to mate with each other, one boy having a child with each of the four girls, making 16 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Then pair off the grandchildren so no pair shares a mother and father, increasing the possibility of a variety of genetics to emerge. </p>
<p>After that, you track the genealogy of all members of the growing society. The 16 grandchildren make up 8 starting families. For the first few generations, make it so no children mates with another from the same parents. The next few, restrict it to grandparents as well. By the 10th generation, you can restrict it to great-grandparents and stop directly planning the families.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The problems associated with incest are statisitical, not absolute, so the more offspring, the more likely it is to have a child that is not a carrier for a given recessive gene.</p>
<p>That said, many offspring a couple of generations in <em>would</em> likely be suffering varrious developmental disorders. As the rest of the human population wouldn't be around to judge them, this would likely cause a rediscovery of the ancient practice of &quot;exposure&quot; where deformed young would be discarded to die in the wild rather than consuming the limited resources of the community.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There would be a number of genetic flaws that would come out over time, but these could be culled by natural selection. People inbreed animals all the time in labs to preserve genetic traits, and the results aren't as bad as we are led to believe. It's still not a good idea to inbreed, but it would work as long as the two source parents didn't have any major genetic flaws. </p>
<p>As far as how long it takes, this depends. One woman recently died after matching the record at 69 children in her life. This is an outlier obviously, but let's go with some assumptions. The two people are 18 years old, and the woman should be fertile for 25 years (no twins). Assuming some small gaps without children, let's say they give birth to 32 children. 30 of those survive to adulthood and are not sterile (50/50), and each woman makes another 32 children (30 who survive). You would have about 6-8 generations in 100 years or nearly 1 million people. So, this could happen quite rapidly. </p>
<p>Now, in reality, the genetic flaws will result in some number being excluded from breeding for health sake or not survive as a result of them, but it's quite feasible to have a very significant population in a few hundred years from only two people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Yes it produces health problems, but in normal circumstances in developed countries those problems are treated. A couple on a desert planet would fail to start a civilization not because they were inbreeding but because they don't have any doctors or hospitals. If they <em>did</em> have medical care, perhaps because they've got a spaceship full of robots and computers to do it for them, then they'd certainly be able to expand the population. It might be 'unhealthy' but with a sufficiently advanced medical system that doesn't matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kraft-Macaroni-Cheese-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B00NGJSCMK?th=1" target="_blank">Cheap to manufacture/Cheap to buy</a> - At $0.12/ounce, you're essentially looking at ~$0.03/ounce manufacturing cost (possibly less), which is basically like printing money for Kraft or any other manufacturer. A box of Kraft Mac N Cheese goes for about $1.30 at Dollar General, and there are 3 servings per box. If you eat that 3 times a day you're only spending $1.30/day on food. Talk about a poor college kid's dream. These two aspects are the root cause of Mac N Cheese being everywhere in the US. It's cheap to mass produce, so supply is through the roof. The next few points explain the demand piece. </li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_10_17/624139_Real_shelf_life_of_Kraft_Macaroni_and_Cheese_.html" target="_blank">Practically impervious to spoilage</a> - Shelf life discussions that I've read show Kraft lasting up to 5 years after expiration date. For grocers, expiration dates are about a year out from when they arrive to stores. This means that it's cheaper to buy in bulk and keep massive inventories of the stuff, and slowly sell over the year. For consumers, it's cheap to buy in bulk and just eat whenever. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/diet-fitness/information/comfort-food-guilty-pleasure2.htm" target="_blank">Salty, Fatty, Starchy, Sugary</a> - A box of Mac N Cheese has salt, fat, starch and sugar, which are the 4 main drivers of food cravings. Simply put, Mac N Cheese is delicious, and scientifically manufactured to be something that children crave. </p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://nerdist.com/star-wars-kraft-macaroni-and-cheese-gets-nostalgic-in-new-ad/" target="_blank">Nostalgic</a> - Because of the reasons above, people associate Mac N Cheese with their childhood. This means it remains a staple <em>through generations</em>. This is perhaps the most powerful factor in the perpetuation of its popularity. </li>
</ol>
<p>*<strong><em>Edit</em></strong>  - Just a note to those commenting that this doesn't necessarily explain why it's an American phenomenon. There are a ton of sociological and economic issues involved here, the most important of which is post-WWII expansion and the baby boom. </p>
<p>Through the 50s and 60s, prosperity in the home was measured by having a well-stocked pantry. Largely due to lean years of their youth, Americans in the 50s prided themselves on having a big, full pantry. As a result, the average american home bought lots of non-perishables (soup, spam, canned meats, dry goods, etc), and loved keeping their pantries stocked. Mac N Cheese was one of these non-perishables, and its popularity in the 40s, 50s, and 60s would make it a staple for generations to come. </p>
<p>That and marketing. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like American Ramen. You can put basically whatever you want in it. It's cheap. I, for instance made pulled pork last week. So I added my pulled pork with onion, sweet peppers and mushroom. Then threw in a little cheddar and Greek yoghurt (makes it creamy). It's molto bene, I look forward to lunch</p>
<p>Edit: I'd like to report that I'm about to get to the office and partake in macaroni ecstasy. My knees are weak and arms spaghetti/macaroni</p>
<p>Edit 2: it is done. There's a mixture of satisfaction and shame. It was worth it. The gods have been sated</p>
<p>Edit 3: someone asked for recipe. Pulled pork tenderloin. Hit it in the smoker for about an hour(optional, unless you're Texan, apparently) then 10 hours in the crockpot with cumin paprika oregano and a touch of Worcestershire. Made regular Mac and cheese out of a box (actually 3 boxes, this is a week of lunch). Before the pasta goes back in the pan, saute a medium red onion, 2 bell peppers worth of whatever sweet peppers you like  (I like the jalapeno size sweets that come in a bag, chopped into rings), 1 of the small square containers of mushrooms (sliced). Saute that veg, toss in the pulled pork to warm it up, get it all happy. Add in the pasta and start adding the cheese you like. If you like the box stuff, use it. Melting cheeses like cheddar, little mozz, little gouda couldn't hurt. I used the cheese in the box and then about half a cup of white cheddar extra, because fuck you, that's why. After that starts to melt, add in yoghurt until it gets to your preferred creamyness  (no homo. Or all homo, I don't judge, and who gives a shit). Cover it with hot sauce. Or don't. I'm not your father and I assume you live in a free country. Shove it in your filthy maw until you hate yourself. I'm American, it's what we do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of reasons for this. It was first popularized by Thomas Jefferson, who apparently loved the pasta and cheese dishes he encountered in France and Italy when he traveled. He even went so far as to buy a pasta-making machine, which apparently didn't work because the ambassador who bought it didn't know anything about pasta. Then Jefferson just imported it and European cheese. He served Macaroni and Cheese at dinner parties, much to the chagrin of the attendees, who were not used to such food at the time.</p>
<p>In the 1800s, Macaroni and Cheese was considered a relatively fancy dish and was basically a butter-cheese-pasta casserole. By the end of the century, pasta had become more common, and it was no longer a fancy dish.</p>
<p>It really hit its stride in American (and Canadian) culture as a part of the processed food revolution driven by the World Wars and industrialization of supply lines. Processed cheese was patented in 1916 by Kraft, and its long shelf life and cheap production made it an ideal product for the Depression and WWII rationing. It was remarkably cheap (you could get multiple servings on a single ration ticket) and filling and didn't require any meat (expensive and difficult to get during rationing). Women were also entering the workforce in response to labor shortages, and Mac N Cheese was easy and quick to make.</p>
<p>This boom exposed a huge number of families to Mac N Cheese, and it continued to grow as parents had fond memories of being able to afford a dinner that tasted and felt indulgent, even if it was very inexpensive. It grew from there, and the latest wave of interest has been fueled by the growing artisanal food movement, in which families that have climbed the class ladder can afford more expensive fresh ingredients and are reexploring the original European roots of the dish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
