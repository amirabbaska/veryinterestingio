		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers here are too simplistic and generalized which is fine for an eli5 but most  are somewhat inaccurate. </p>
<p>It's hard to say what specific component of the soup makes us feel better. But there was a study released in 2000 that looked into potential mechanisms of how chicken noodle soup makes you feel better. </p>
<p>Summary: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/10/001018075252.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/10/001018075252.htm</a></p>
<p>Paper: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11035691" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11035691</a></p>
<p>So generally, the symptoms you feel when you catch a cold aren't directly the result of the bug that caused the infection, but rather, a result of your immune system targeting the affected areas (ex. Throat, nose, lungs etc). </p>
<p>For example, you know how your nose gets all runny and you cough up phlegm? That's a result of your immune system reacting to the threat (typically a virus) and does so by kicking mucous production into overdrive. This traps the bug and makes it harder for it to get to its target tissue. A sore throat? That's a result of all the killed throat cells releasing chemicals (called cytokines) that make your throat swollen and tender.  </p>
<p>These cytokines are super important in directing an immune system response to the infected tissue. It directs the immune cells that are circulating in your blood stream to the site of infection. It also helps to fight the infection, and as a result makes you feel shitty (one such cytokine, TNF-alpha, is why your body aches when you have the flu. </p>
<p>What the researchers I mentioned found was that certain components of chicken noodle soup inhibit the ability of a specific type of immune cell (neutrophils) to find its way to the site of infection. Neutrophils will kill infected cells, and also make the area a hostile environment (by releasing cytokines) which all ends up making you feel shitty. </p>
<p>By stopping the neutrophils from migrating to the area of infection, it  makes you temporarily feel less shitty. </p>
<p>This is all shown In the lab, so it needs further studies to show a real effect in live humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They said the chicken in the soup releases fats that help you feel good and, since the root vegetables are cooked down, they are easier to eat. Which all helps in restoring nutrients and the steam helps loosen mucus, like others have said. Also liquids need to be restored which is easier to do if it taste good instead of plain water. </p>

A 2000 study claimed to have shown that it also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can relieve congestion too, although this is still uncertain. Eating chicken soup when you have a cold helps because you're breathing steam, which loosens up congestion. In some cases, store bought chicken soup was actually more effective in &quot;curing you&quot; than homemade chicken soup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>WHO did an extensive study about how to re-hydrate children orally because you just can't start an IV on every sick kid in Africa. </p>
<p>It turns out that pure water is HARDER to absorb than water with some salt and carbohydrate in it. So, the <a href="http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/fch_cah_06_1/en/" target="_blank">ideal re-hydration solution</a> is water with a little salt and sugar added. Add a small amount of protein and fat for calories and you basically have a recipe for chicken soup. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I put a year of effort to recover from bad posture, I do agree with many of the things said but one important thing is missing and it plays a big part in why it isnt actually more comfortable, but sorta is.</p>
<p>When you start with bad posture it suddenly becomes difficult/tiring to support yourself as the muscles have to work harder to hold shape (excaserbated by school, job / long sitting etc).  This mean you naturally move towards that extreme slouch / worst positions where as others have said your joints / ligaments take the stress and muscles do less, so it feels &quot;easier&quot; and &quot;more comfortable&quot; because its no longer difficult.</p>
<p>When you are in those positions over time your muscles loosen or tighten in places to accommodate / reach neutral positions.  For example,  slouching, the muscles in your chest and front of shoulders tighten up and your ones in your back loosen / stretch.</p>
<p>If you then try to have &quot;correct&quot; posture, i.e. pull your shoulders back a bit, stand up more etc you then have to fight the bad form of the muscles, i.e. your back muscles are weak and have to work harder to expand those tight chest muscles which dont like to be stretched.</p>
<p>This makes having &quot;correct&quot; posture hard and painful, which is then why bad posture / those extremes feel comfortable.</p>
<p>So the real way to correct bad posture is with stretching and strengthening.  I.e. stretching chest muscles every day, strengthening back muscles to tighten them up.  Essentially developing good core strength / form.  There are specific stretches  and exercises, or things like pilates or yoga are great -- but it takes a good 6 months or a year of regular activity to make actual real good progress</p>
<p>If you fix the muscles they will start to pull your spine etc into shape and then your skeletoncan start supporting itself.</p>
<p>So yeah long story short,  good posture should be easy if you break into a back habit it quickly becomes hard and your body adapts then to the bad posture.</p>
<p>Something worth mentioning here is Alexander Technique.  Word of caution I think there are many good lessons in it but some (bad) teachers on the extreme take it to the point of almost faith healing ailments.</p>
<p>Frederick Alexander was a public speaker and I believe did some Shakespearean acting in the 1890's but no amplification in them days so had to project voice loudly.  And basically voice started to suffer, weakened, hoarse, out of breath and along with it back pain etc.</p>
<p>So he spoke to doctors and there was no reason they could find, i.e. his throat looked fine.  So he made the assumption its his speaking / the way he was doing that was wrong.</p>
<p>He then stood in front of a bunch of mirrors and analysed what he looked like when he was speaking, noticed he was bending his neck and slouching.  With the mirrors he set out with practice to correct that, and lo and behold, his voice came back full and strong.</p>
<p>He then studied this more and studied other people with issues, sportsmen etc and noticed more things about how posture can affect performance of the body.  Basically then wrote a book about it and taught it.</p>
<p>I think its really good as its a thorough study into posture, and more importantly, movement. </p>
<p>A hopefully obvious example is sitting.  When sitting you need to lean forward, bend kness and plant bum on seat, sounds easy, not so much...</p>
<p>A common thing there is most people when they sit as I did seem to fix there eye line, so as you sit your head crinks backwards as your body moves forward, this puts all sorts of tension on your neck.</p>
<p>Where its gone bad though is some people then have taken this on as a one size fit all &quot;cure&quot; for back pain/hypertension etc and its not.   Take it as a detailed study into posture and movement and there are definitly things in here that can help / promote good practice and in many cases can actually help reduce / fix back pain / chronic pain. </p>
<p>Its helped understand my posture which getting that good has helped my relieve tightness across my chest, my singing and my back/neck pain from a car accident / whiplash injury.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Little off topic but personal trainer here: The fastest possible way to correct posture (in my experience, and for a HEALTHY, uninjured, non-senior individual) is to skip stretching and instead implement functional strength building moves with proper form. </p>
<p>I am not saying stretching isn't beneficial but I myself spent 5+ months stretching to rehab an injury and avoiding what I knew would work best because the chiropractor advised stretching instead and I found that almost immediately after focusing on strength my posture returned to normal, whereas stretching and lighter physical therapy exercises provided almost no results for months. </p>
<p>The key factor here is I am young, fit and not injured / senile. This will not work if you have injuries or are an older person but if you're healthy give it a shot. By strength building functional moves I mean compound barbell or dumbbell exercises and TRX is amazing for upper body posture as well. Some exercises that are general basics are the barbell squat, barbell deadlift, dumbbell or barbell Bench and row, and my personal favorite for upper body posture : TRX row or TRX facepull. Please google the form and make sure it's correct!</p>
<p>Edit edit: just dropping this here, I'm not an expert so don't take my advice as such. I'm also 23, hiker, rock climber, snowboarder and been working out for a decade. I know my body extremely well in and out. I can assure you 100% without a doubt stretching didn't do jack shit for me and never will. Also consider my fitness level, I'm not against stretching I'm just saying for fit athletic individuals such as myself who may have postural issues I have found quicker and more efficient success from strength training than I have stretching. Stretching has numerous benefits and I'm not knocking this at all I'm just saying personally for me (and those of similar athletic builds) that stretching was far inferior and far slower than straight up weights and strength building!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Gonzotronic has it right.</p>
<p>It comes down to energy and efficiency. Using our muscles takes energy and work. If we're in a position where muscles aren't working, less energy is being used.</p>
<p>Slouching is the best example. You're essentially just relaxing the muscles of your spine and trunk until most of the weight/pressure is being held by ligaments and joints (or leaning on your arm, etc). </p>
<p>It's also why people default to lifting with a bent back. We know the dangers to our lower back in doing this yet it's more energy efficient as it uses less muscle.</p>
<p>The second part of the question - why are these the worst positions? When we're in one position for a long time our tissue undergoes &quot;creep&quot; in the same way silly putty would if we held it in the air and let it fall (although much more slowly). Things slowly stretch out (ligaments, joints) and can cause discomfort as well as trigger our muscles (remember they're meant to take pressure off these tissues) to reflexively tighten to protect the now compressed or stretched ligaments and joints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean mostly your back? If so no one has addressed the elephant in the room. </p>
<p>Our general spine design was forged in the evolutionary fires eons ago, and that design was for supporting ourselves on four legs. It's not something that's easily changed. Despite that fact that we started our path to walking on two legs millions of years ago, our bodies have not yet evolved a way for walking upright to not totally fuck up our backs, eventually. </p>
<p>Think of the spine as a chain, meant to be suspended between the two poles of your shoulders and hips. Most of the force of gravity---particularly as you move---would go into your limbs that way. But since we walk upright, we're taking that chain and pretending it's a solid and rigid flagpole. Every moment you spend upright is crushing it in a direction it was never meant to be crushed.</p>
<p>Our muscles are constantly working to prevent this as much as possible, so relaxing them feels good. But the muscles being tense is what's preventing the links in your chain from collapsing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>If you wish to ease your lower back pain, practice to sleep with a thin pillow between your legs. Also take a near foetal position, not a hard one, but whatever degree of curling makes you comfortable. </p>
</li>
<li>Another hack. You can also try to lie on the floor on your back and then set your lower legs on a chair seat ( horizontal) which will make your thighs ( vertical). Adjust yourselves into the most comfortable position. This will take the strain off your back muscles and backbone. You can sleep in this position throughout the night. You may have to spend a little time and money in finding a chair with the exact height to suit your leg length.</li>

<p>Edit to elaborate on everyone else's experiences by adding my own:  Using Mach 3s and all that newer stuff I always broke out on my neck.  Switching to a safety razor(a big part of this is also finding the right blade brand for you skin, Feather was way too sharp for me and caused razor burn, I ended up going with Derby), using a badger hair brush and shaving soap and making my own lather, shaving while showering and your hair is moist and skin is warm from the steam, and rinsing with ice cold water after the shave are what I found work the best.  Hard to nail down exactly what helped the most cause I switched to doing all that at the same time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly a problem with people of ethnic background, because our hair tends to be more curly. That's the biggest source of the problem. </p>
<p>When you shave with the grain, you slice the hair in such a way that the end is relatively flat. Think of an unsharpened brand new pencil. When you shave against the grain, you slice an angle into the hair and make it sharp. </p>
<p>Now, if your hair tends to be thin and straight, this isn't much of a problem. The area will inflame a bit immediately after shaving, but the hair still grows straight out of the follicle. If your hair naturally curls, though, we have an issue. There's a chance that your spear-shaped hair will get caught in the inflamed skin. </p>
<p>If that happens, it's easy for the hair to loop around or otherwise stop growing out of the follicle. Congratulations! You've irritated your skin to produce a razor bump or graduated past that to an ingrown hair! </p>
<p>The best method I've found, which works for all humans regardless of ethnicity, is to use a safety razor and shaving cream. Shave very lightly in the direction of the grain only. This cuts the hair off flat and flush with the skin. Immediately follow with shave balm or after shave and lotion. </p>
<p>Hope this answers your question thoroughly. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With vs against the grain is really dependant on what kind of facial hair you have, skin sensitivity, and also how you prepare to shave. </p>
<p>The best shave will always be in a hot steamy shower after you've already washed everything and gotten your face/wet/steamy/hot. Softening up the hairs and just making everything easier to work with.  Go to an old school barber shop and the hot towel on the face thing was done for a reason :) </p>
<p>Shaving a few days growth?  1st pass with the grain to get the bulk, 2nd pass against the grain to get it baby smooth. </p>
<p>I like saving money but those disposeable single use bic safety razors are shit and no matter how slow or careful, I get cut to hell with them.  Currenly use a Schick Hydro 5 (little cheaper than the gillette stuff) and does an awesome job.   Even tried those dorco razors (dollar shave club) and found them to be of inferior quality. </p>
<p>Speed shaves in front of the mirror while you are running late, will never be as smooth or irritation free when you are in a rush, more irritation as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Even the food I do eat would not be considered a balanced meal in the slightest. With working and going to college I became irresponsible with my eating habits, eating out mostly due to the convenience factor and low-cost. However I have been noticing that I get way more sleep at odd hours, (14 hours on off days) and it has become a nuisance when it comes to waking up for class on time. I'm wondering if a sub-par diet has any relation to sleeping more and imbalance of my circadian rhythm? </p></div></div>

I was in the same position as you in November, I didn't understand why I was sleeping all the time or why, after a full night's sleep, I was waking up exhausted. As I worked irregular hours I would never eat proper meals or eat well at all. The lack of healthy food in my diet was essentially starving my body of iron, leading to constant fatigue. The best thing you can do is try to eat more red meat (I.e. Steak) or get more dark, leafy greens in your diet (ideal would be kale, but spinach is also great!). Try to get more protein in your diet as well, so maybe take a bag of mixed nuts as a snack if you're on the go. It's difficult changing your diet, especially if you're busy, but you'll start to feel much better for it pretty much immediately, and it can help get your sleep schedule back on track too! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>For any goods that are imported, yes (which is a lot of them, at least in part). The idea is this incentivizes people to buy domestic goods, which will create more jobs domestically.</p>
<p>It also tends to hurt exporting businesses, because other countries will retaliate with their own tariffs. In addition, depending on what trade agreements are in effect, we can be fined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are American citizens being helped by paying more for the same products?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that making jobs at home is worth the higher prices. It's generally accepted that isn't worth it (at least nationally. on a smaller, industry specific area it can help).</p>
<p>Part of the problem with globalization is that certain areas tend to get hit extremely hard. In the U.S.'s case, one big example is manufacturing (because it's cheaper labor). In theory, the decrease in price makes us more than rich enough to help those people who lost their jobs out, and still be richer. In practice, we haven't done a particularly good job of having those people switch to a different job, relying on the market to sort it out (which can often be a long and painful process).</p>
<p>tldr:
Yes, it will basically just hurt us. But people are extremely upset with the status quo, and it's not obvious to the average person that it won't work. It sounds very compelling.</p>
<p>edit:
As a couple people have mentioned, i did leave out the impact of automation (for simplicity. Although, it's larger than globalization). While the above explanation still holds, technology just makes things even worse, since tariffs clearly aren't going to put the technology genie back in the bottle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>His import tax has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with politics.</p>
<p>Economics generally agree that free trade and globalization is good on average. Keyword here: <strong>average</strong>. Free trade and globalization is the reason that your iphone, which has parts and rare earth minerals from all over the world, doesn't cost $1500.  When the entire world assigns different people to make different products in the most efficient way, and then sell to each other, instead of having one country struggle to make everything by itself, everybody wins. That's the upside of globalization.</p>
<p>However, the downside of free trade and globalization is lower skilled people in developed countries lose their jobs en masse to poorer countries with lower cost. </p>
<p><strong>On average</strong>, free trade is good for the US. However, the benefits and downsides are not symmetrical. The upside of free trade is that everybody gets cheaper Iphones, cheaper fruits, cheaper T-shirts, cheaper TV shows, cheaper everything, improving the standard of living. However, these are subtle changes that affect everyone, and people generally just take it for granted, and rarely base their political decisions on it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the downside of free trade is much more visible, much more striking, and affects a smaller number of people, but in much deeper ways. When a factory or a plant is shut down, the entire town might lose its job, and spiral into disrepair, drugs, and population loss. And the people who lost jobs definitely think about it as they enter the voting booth. That's why it's much easier politically to be against free trade than for it.</p>
<p><strong>By placing his chips against free trade, Donald Trump is betting that the people he is trying to court (disaffected Rust Belt working class voters) will notice and credit him as they vote, while the people that he will hurt (everyone else) either won't notice or will forget the rising prices in storefronts by election day.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It might spur some American industry but far from enough to create the change and jobs that he is falsely promising.  If we all only bought American and kept all the money in our own businesses in theory companies would be able to pay more Americans, but reality is that we cant become self sufficient or reach autarky. </p>
<p>His tactics are also bully tactics and PR stunts that do not help Americans. The &quot;Carrier Deal&quot; is a total sham and crony capitalism.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the sun goes through the main sequence part of its lifecycle, it's slowly getting hotter. We have about a billion years before it gets too hot for life as we know it to persist on Earth, about 10% more luminous than it is now. The sun will turn into a red giant in about 5 billion years, but even though it will expand out to past Earth's current orbit, it will also lose a lot of its mass by then - right now, about 600 million tons of matter in the sun's core is converted to energy every second. On top of that, lots more of the sun's mass will be thrown off in solar wind when it becomes a red giant, so it will only have about 2/3 its current mass when it expands to the Earth's current orbit, which means the earth will spiral outward and orbit farther away, so it will be spared being swallowed by the sun, at least at first, though it will long since have become a charred dry rock, with all of the water in the atmosphere boiled away. Eventually, even though the Earth's orbit will be about 1.5 times as big as it is now, the sun will overtake it and the drag of the sun's atmosphere will slow the Earth down, causing it to spiral inward as the sun continues to grow until it is eaten by the sun. The sun will continue to grow until it's almost twice the size of the Earth's current orbit, then shrink and heat up, then expand again in pulses until it runs out of fuel, at which point it will be a white dwarf roughly the size of the Earth's current orbit. It will then slowly cool to black over trillions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question has some pseudo-scientific implications because, as you probably know, we can't move at the speed of light. </p>
<p>So let's say we're moving at 99.9999% the speed of light away from the Sun. If we look back at the Sun, what do we see? Well, first of all you probably wouldn't seem much because the light from the Sun would be redshifted by about z=1400. That is to say that the optical light that we see from the Sun (peaking at a wavelength of about 500 nm, green light) would be shifted into the sub-millimeter/radio part of the spectrum (at about 0.7 mm). So you wouldn't be able to see the Sun (or any other stars) whilst looking behind you.</p>
<p>What about looking in front of you? Well, at these speeds the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background</a> would be blueshifted from the microwave part of the spectrum to the infrared part of the spectrum. You would begin to see a red glow everwhere in front of you.</p>
<p>What if you were travelling <em>at</em> the speed of light? Well, like I said, you can't. &quot;But what if you could?&quot;... You can't. &quot;But <em>what if</em>?&quot;... OK, fine. <em>If</em> you were a photon travelling at the speed of light and looked behind you, what would you see? Photons probably don't experience time. (Note that this is all pseudo-science.) If our understanding of relativity holds for reference frames travelling at the speed of light, then a photon experiences infinite length contraction. It travels across the entire length of the Universe instantaneously in its own frame. So, you'd never have a chance to look behind you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You wouldnt think it but unlike most smoke THC smoke is a bronchodilator.  It was an active ingredient used in the early 1900's in asthma cigarettes (like <a href="http://antiquecannabisbook.com/chap7/CGrimault.htm" target="_blank">Grimault</a>'s) laying some doubt on the idea that it causes an increase in COPD related illnesses.  One of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1099949" target="_blank">few studies done on it in the 70s</a> showed it was comparable to medicine prescribed for asthma patients (namely isoproterenol which wouldnt be prescribed for it today) and using it in an inhaler it could stop a full blown attack in its tracks.  </p>
<p>People might downvote me for the over used comparison with Tobacco Smoke, but there is a big misconception that all smoke is equal.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1277837/" target="_blank">It isnt</a>.  Yes there are carcinogens in the smoke and people are generally getting more tar since there aren't really any comparable filters for weed as there are for tobacco cigarettes.  But two things that happen with Tobacco smoke are increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis#Tumor_angiogenesis" target="_blank">Angiogenesis</a> which is the bodies ability to create new blood vessels, in this case specifically for cancer tumors. As well as being anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" target="_blank">apoptotic</a> which is the process our cells go through when they reach their end of life, meaning they don't die properly, or in other words mutate and increase chances of cancer.  These aren't seen happening with Cannabis smoke.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There is also evidence that using earlier and using more often correlates with psychosis that starts earlier and is harder to treat than expected.</p>
<p>However, it's also possible that people who smoke a lot more often are self-medicating for symptoms that are actually the prodrome of psychosis or another mental illness. (So of course then people who use more, more often would be more likely to be diagnosed with psychosis or a psychotic disorder.)</p>

Smoke every once and a while mainly for social reasons      But I don't give in. Ps I have just been distracting myself with work and working out here and there. P.S. I am pretty normal health wise. No heart problems never been paranoid while under the effects of pot. Mainly just wanted to hang and chill with my lady and friends. But like I said this is just me and some people like cigarettes I preferred pot. I suggest if u are going to try it. Don't make any plans of going out and being in a very public place. Don't do it around children and mainly don't have any responsibilities for a couple of hours and just find a good friend or life partner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While many drugs have symptoms that appear rapidly weed has a longer span of time needed to produce effects. Some people can smoke weed for their entire life and have no issue similar to some people being able to handle other drugs. Only recently have scientists found results that weed (THC) has ill effects. The main reactions that happen are symptoms of withdrawal e.g. mood swings, that do tend to clear up over time. THC has been linked to mental health issues by worsening the effects of depression or interfering with medication. </p>
<p>Now here comes the less supported parts. Many people in the business environment feel that people who smoke weed are less ambitious as time goes on. Since it is hard to measure ambition it is just stated and hard to support. </p>
<p>It has been found that 1 in 10 users become addicted to weed. From what I have looked into I am unsure as to if this is an effect of  THC or the act of smoking but those who smoke weed over time also have a higher risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular issues. </p>
<p>Edit: THC, the compound responsible for the &quot;high&quot; of weed affects people differently. It is also hard to separate the difference between THC's and smoking's effects. If you want to read some of the sources I have found there is a mixture of government, organizations, and educational pages. I encourage you to read them but there will be bias as many government sources are against the use of weed. </p>

Does it feel empty? depending on where you are floating say in your space suit it would feel rather disorientating, you might be very slowly rotating. You would certainly see stars around, although as soon as you face the sun it would be pretty blinding, your eyes would take a bit to adjust and so you would see mostly blackness around. </p>
<p>Plasma in space are usually around stars ( or planets with magnetic fields) or star forming regions. The reason we see them is mostly due to long exposures in astrophotography. And remember that often a nebula is several hundred light years across so we are seeing an accumulation of light from a huge amount but spread out over a vast distance. </p>
<p>If you ended up in a region between two galaxies space might appear a bit darker, though if you had some binoculars would be able to make out other galaxies around you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to understand is that there are no absolute physical boundaries marking what is and is not &quot;outer space.&quot;  The density of matter and energy, as well as the chemical proportions of matter, just changes from place to place across the universe.</p>
<p>We arbitrarily say that space begins (with respect to Earth) at something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line" target="_blank">Kármán line</a>, at 100 km above sea level because this is a convenient number and the density of atmospheric gases is quite low by that altitude.</p>
<p>Similarly arbitrary points would denote where space ends and the Martian atmosphere begins, or the stellar corona, or the beginning of interstellar space, or what have you.  This is not to say that these points have no physical basis - the heliopause, for instance, is roughly wherever the solar wind and interstellar wind are in balance - but these are not absolute locations, but rather vague statistical regions.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the universe is completely devoid of matter/energy, so it just changes as you go.  If you encounter a solid object, the densities and compositions change very quickly, but even then the change is not instantaneous from one microscopic location to another - there are atoms constantly in motion, being blasted off of a solid surface by impacts from particles in the stellar and interstellar particle flux.  </p>
<p>This is what is meant when researchers say that a body otherwise in vacuum like Mercury or Pluto has an &quot;atmosphere.&quot;  They don't mean there is any practically significant amount of gas around it that you would experience, but simply that there is some small amount of molecules that linger in a gaseous form near the object.  </p>
<p>The amounts never go to zero as you get farther away, the numerical density just decreases until it meets another environment where it increases again.  If you were to travel from the surface of Mercury to the surface of Earth, the density of (for instance) oxygen would go from some small number and keep decreasing over the space between until it came close to Earth, then start increasing more and more until it was very high at Earth.</p>
<p>As to what space <em>is</em>, that's a deeper matter that delves into quantum theories and various alternative models (etc.).  One thing that has been observed is that &quot;empty&quot; space - lacking in massed particles - is not in fact empty, but rather a froth of mutually-canceling particle pairs with opposite energy to each other (thus not changing the net amount of energy in the universe).  </p>
<p>The opposite way that gravity affects the constituents of these pairs is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">Hawking radiation</a> can cause black holes to lose mass and evaporate over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>William James explained the difference between voluntary and involuntary attention. Voluntary attention requires effort - an example is concentrating on a demanding task like driving in traffic. But anything effortful can make you tired. Cognitive psychologists don't have a good idea exactly what inside of you is &quot;getting tired&quot; but we use a term called &quot;cognitive resources&quot; as a metaphor for the whole thing. The idea is that this kind of effortful attention drains those resources.<br />
In contrast, involuntary attention requires no effort. In voluntary attention you have to decide what to attend to and how to respond. In involuntary attention, something just grabs your attention and holds it. No decision making is required. It has been compared to a state of fascination.<br />
Many have used these ideas to explain why taking a walk in the woods feels restorative, because you can stop using those &quot;resources&quot; and just let yourself explore.<br />
Spacing out could easily be seen in the same light. You are not doing anything in particular, so you are resting and restoring those so-called &quot;resources&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spacing out is basically meditation.  You are allowing your conscious mind to rest. It also acts as a reset, since your mind may be stuck in a loop of thoughts.  Like, maybe you're anxious/stressed that you have an exam.  You want to study, but your place is dirty.  You want to clean, but can't because you need to be studying.  You know you're running out of time, because you have an exam.  Repeat.  </p>
<p>There's a lot of information out there about the benefits of meditation. The benefits of meditation in relieving stress and improving concentration are well documented.  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858" target="_blank">Here's Mayo's article, but there's a lot out there</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's one of the rare times when you're conscious that your brain is just allowed to rest. Thinking is healthy, but imagine if you walked or jogged endlessly. Oddly, we typically try to &quot;rest&quot; our brains from shifting it from one brain demanding activity to another (e.g. stop working to read an article, watch a video, talk to someone, etc.). &quot;Spacing out&quot; is necessary for healthy brain function and increasingly people have formalized/incorporated this in the form of some sort of regular mediation practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always had trouble initiating the same feeling of &quot;spacing out&quot; when I've tried to meditate. As a bonafide hypermanic, any attempt at forcing &quot;spacing out&quot; just creates an vacuum for anxious thoughts to rush in. </p>
<p>Most times &quot;spacing out&quot; just kinda sneaks up on me. How to get it to come around more often?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
