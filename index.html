		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One idea is to let the roll-1 be a digit in the base-6 expansion of a number. So if the roll is <em>n</em>, record the digit <em>n</em>-1. All integers from 1 to 100 can be expressed with 3 base-6 digits. So you need to roll the die 3 times.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it's possible to get numbers that are greater than 100. Indeed, there are 6^(3) = 216 numbers you can get by this process. If you get any number greater than 100 just try again. (Or you can have the numbers 101 through 200 correspond to 1 through 100, and then only try again if you get a number from 201 to 215 or 0.) Then all numbers from 1 to 100 have an equal chance of being rolled.</p>
<p>For example, if your three rolls are (3, 1, 6), you record the digits as 205<em><em>6</em></em>, which is equal to 77<em><em>10</em></em>. If your three rolls are (5, 2, 3), you record the digits as 412<em><em>6</em></em>, which is equal to 152<em><em>10</em></em> (which is 52<em><em>10</em></em> in our modified game). But if your three rolls are (6, 5, 5), you record the digits as 544<em><em>6</em></em>, which is equal to 208<em><em>10</em></em>, and so you try again. The chance of having to try again is 16/216 = 2/27, or about 7.4%. Thus the expected number of rolls is 3*(27/25) = 3.24. So you shouldn't expect to have try again too many times.</p>
<p>I'm sure there is probably some other very clever way, but that's the first that comes to mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another option is to divide the numbers 1-100 into 5 equal groups (1-20, 21-40, etc.). Roll the die once. If you get a 6, roll again. Otherwise, your roll puts you in one of the 5 groups (roll 1 for 1-20, roll 2 for 21-40, etc.). Then divide your group into 5 more groups (so 1-20 is now divided into 1-4, 5-8, etc.). Roll the die a second time. If you get a 6, roll again. Otherwise, your roll puts you in a new subgroup (roll 1 for 1-4, roll 2 for 5-8, etc.). Then roll the die a 3rd time, rolling again if you get 5 or 6. Your final roll gives you the number in the final group.</p>
<p>So if your rolls are (3, 5, 2), ignoring any rerolls, that gives you the subgroups 41-60, then 57-60, then finally 58. The expected number of rolls needed to get a result is (6/5) + (6/5) + (6/4) = 3.9. You can probably modify the scheme by keeping track of your rerolls to determine later rolls, or maybe just by being cleverer about the divisions, to get a smaller expected number of rolls.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> An interesting question is whether there is an optimal method (in the sense that it minimizes the expected number of rolls) and what that method is. Clearly any such method needs <em>at least</em> 3 rolls. Just 2 rolls gives you 36 possibilities, which is too few to distinguish between 100 numbers. But 3 rolls gives you 216 possibilities. My first method based on base-6 representations tries to &quot;waste&quot; as few of the 216 possibilities as possible by having each of the 100 numbers correspond to 2 possible roll configurations. But you have to waste 16 of them. So the question then becomes whether there is a method that utilizes those 16 wasted possibilities. I would not be surprised if 3.24 expected rolls really is the best you can do.</p>
<p>Generalize this method to the problem of using a <em>d</em>-sided die to get a uniformly distributed integer from 1 to <em>n</em>. With my method, you need at least <em>r</em> rolls, where <code>[; r = \left\lceil\log_d(n)\right\rceil ;]</code>, which is the smallest integer <em>r</em> such that <code>[; d^r \geq n ;]</code>. Then the expected number of rolls for my method is</p>
<p><code>[; E = r\cdot\frac{d^r/n}{\left\lfloor d^r/n \right\rfloor} ;]</code></p>
<p>(Note that for <em>n</em> = <em>d</em>^(<em>m</em>), we get <em>r</em> = <em>m</em>, and the whole thing simplifies to <em>E</em> = <em>m</em>, as expected.)</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Any method must have <code>[; E \geq r = \left\lceil\log_d(n)\right\rceil ;]</code>. But is the expression for <em>E</em> above optimal?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit2:</strong> The problem has been solved! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5qch8u/how_do_i_use_a_fair_6sided_die_to_generate_a/dczwsvz/" target="_blank">See this post</a> by /u/ericGraves and the follow-up comments.</p>
<p>(Note that the notation used in his post and below is slightly different from the notation I have used previously.)</p>
<p>If we want to use an <em>s</em>-sided die to generate uniformly distributed integers from 1 to <em>d</em>, then the optimal method (in the sense that it has the least expected number of rolls) is a minor modification of the first scheme I proposed based on base-6 expansions, and the optimum number of expected rolls is</p>
<p><code>[; E = d\left(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}{jx_js^{-j}}\right) ;]</code></p>
<p>where *x*<em><em>j</em></em> is the <em>j</em>th digit in the greedy base-<em>s</em> expansion of 1/<em>d</em>. In the case <em>d</em> = 100 and <em>s</em> = 6, we get an expected value of about 3.16, slightly better than my initial method that gives 3.24.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Now add the Base to the specific number. If you can specify the order of the die, such as designating different colored dice specifically as Die 1, Die 2, and Die 3, you can roll all three dice at once.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can make this simpler by asking how to use a 6 sided die to generate a number 1 through 10 (or 0 through 9).</p>
<p>Roll 2d6.  If the number on the first die is 6, re-roll until it is 1-5.  If the second die is even, add 5 to the first roll.  Now subtract 1 from the total.  This gives us a value between 0 and 9.  Do this twice.  Multiply the first value by 10 and add the two together.  This gives you a normally distributed random number from 0-99, or add 1 to the final total to get 1-100.</p>
<p>Ex: We roll 2d6, we get a 4 and 3.  3 is odd, so we ignore it.  Subtract 1, we get 3.  3 is our first number.  We roll 2d6 again and get a 6 and a 2.  We re-roll the 6 and get a 3.  Since the 2 is even, we add 5 to the 3, so we get 3+5 = 8.  Subtract 1, we get 7.  7 is our second number.  Multiply 3 by 10 and add the 7, we get 37 as our random number from 0-99, or 38 from 1-100.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>role 1 dice. if you get a 6, re-roll, the result is 2n-2, 2n-1. Now roll a second time to determine if you pick the first or second number. For example:</p>
<p>If you roll a 1 you get 0,1.</p>
<p>If you roll a 2 you get 2,3.</p>
<p>If you roll a 3 you get 4,5.</p>
<p>If you roll a 4 you get 6,7.</p>
<p>If you roll a 5 you get 8,9.</p>
<p>Now roll again, if you roll 1-3 it is the lower number, if it s 4-6 it is the higher number</p>
<p>Now you have generated your tens column, do the same thing again to generate your ones column. Four rolls (except for the occasional reroll of a 6) to get a number from 00 to 99. Treat 00 as 100.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps fastest nearly 100% efficiency:
Similar to midtech, roll 3 dice.
Use base 6 to generate a number 1-216
1-200, divide by 2 to get random number 1-100</p>
<p>201-212, subtract 200 then divide by 2 to get a number 1-6.
Use this number and 2 dice rolls as above. </p>
<p>213-216, subtract 212 to generate a base 4 number.
When thus happens twice, a number 1-16 is generated.
1-12 generate a die roll as above.
13-16 generates a base 4 number that can be recycled into this loop. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wall served two main purposes: stopping raids and providing warning of attacks. It wasn't really meant to hold back a large invading army.</p>
<p>It was pretty easy for nomads to raid Chinese farming villages in the north with just a few men. The wall was someone effective in deterring that because it's hard to destroy a wall with a very small force and it only takes a couple people on a wall to fight you off.</p>
<p>When it came to large invasions, the wall's main purpose was to provide warning and maybe slow invaders. In fact, the wall has signal towers all along it so that a warning could be sent to wherever it needed to go. The wall was too big to man with a large, permanent force that could repel an invading army, but an invading army would still either have to spend time getting through the wall or around the wall. While they were doing that, the warning signal would be making its way to the capital and/or army.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original wall wasn't built to keep the Mongolians out - they wouldn't be united until 1200AD by Ghengis Khan. It was built mainly around 200BC to keep the XiongNu out. The XiongNu were Asiatic Huns and consisted of small tribes of nomadic peoples. Not too much is known about them because they didn't leave much archaeological evidence and it was very early in China's history, so Chinese historical accounts weren't too reliable.</p>
<p>The Great Wall is actually relatively close to Beijing - about 100km away (the part designed to protect Beijing and vicinity). From the Great Wall, you can see the skyscrapers of Beijing on an unpolluted day, and you could probably see signal fires on the Great Wall before modern light pollution and tall buildings got in the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

We think that quantum fluctuations near the event horizons of black holes cause them to emit mass/energy in the form of Hawking Radiation.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black holes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">gradually lose mass on their own</a> and eventually explode, leaving nothing behind. You can't really accelerate this process artificially, it's just something that happens on its own and will happen fastest if you just leave the black hole alone and allow nothing more to fall in. Anything you throw into the black hole just makes it bigger, and the bigger it is, the longer it takes to lose all its mass and disappear; the 'lifetime' of a large black hole into which no more material is falling is proportional to the <em>cube</em> of its initial mass, so for instance, if you merge two black holes of equal mass into one of twice that mass, the resulting black hole will take <em>eight times</em> as long to disappear as either of the two original ones.</p>
<p>However, in the real world, everything in the Universe is constantly bathed in the dim light left over from the Big Bang. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background.</a> This leftover light gets eaten by black holes, so if a black hole is sufficiently large that it emits less Hawking radiation than the equivalent of the CMB, it is actually <em>gaining</em> mass even if no normal atomic matter is falling in. Right now, any black hole with a mass greater than roughly that of the Moon is too large to be decaying yet- it swallows CMB radiation faster than its own mass evaporates from it. Typical black holes formed by supernovas have a minimum mass of about twice that of the Sun, so they are much too large to be decaying yet. However, as the Universe expands, the CMB gradually weakens, so eventually it will account for less than the radiation emerging from any black hole, allowing all black holes to eventually evaporate away. The decay of large black holes is thought to be the slowest process in the observable universe, with the largest ones finally disappearing somewhere around a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years from now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you know when the task needs to be done by for example a school assignment, you will work towards completing this task and once you realise you are mostly done you will think about the deadline. This may be a while away.</p>
<p>Therefore you will relax and take a breather when it comes to this task as you know you are close enough to being done that you can do something else for now and do this task at a later date. This procrastination then gets worse until you eventually have come close to the deadline and do it. </p>
<p>Basically you would rather have everything 80% done than one thing 100%. Just do things straight away in future to prevent this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Well, first thing is, you can't &quot;misspell&quot; Chinese per se. Maybe you can get the strokes wrong or have missing strokes (Like writing 日 or 由 when you actually wanna write 田), they can be two totally separate characters.</p>
<p>Or, you can just use the wrong character (since Chinese has limited sounds, a lot of words share the same pronunciation, like 鸡蛋 (chicken egg) and 鸡弹 (literally &quot;chicken bomb&quot;, but just FYI this isn't a thing, just an example) are pronounced exactly the same, but if you wrote the latter the teacher would probably underline it, because that isn't a thing.</p>
<p>Grammar wise, I guess the order of the words matter? Like in English.   “Home I am&quot; is grammatically incorrect, and it's similar in Chinese.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Singaporean who has been learning (Mandarin) Chinese as my second language from young, so maybe I can help. It's my first time answering a question on ELI5 so I hope my explanation is easy to understand.</p>
<p>You might know that Chinese uses logograms, which are like pictures instead of stringing letters together to form words as in English. Just as how pictures are drawn using lines, logograms are also formed by drawing lines.</p>
<p>In English, a misspelled word is one with, well, a wrong spelling, like spelling 'word' as 'ward'. I think you can agree that the letters 'o' and 'a' are both circular and thus may look similar to a person who is unfamiliar with the Latin alphabet, but they are different. Now, take a look at this three Chinese characters. 己 已 巳。They all look the same, yes? But they are really different--you can see that the vertical line on the left does not protrude out of the middle horizontal line which leaves some sort of gap or cave, or it's only drawn halfway, or it's drawn fully which closes up the gap or cave. The first character has the meaning of 'self', the second of 'already', and the third of 'snake' or '9am to 11am'. They look the same, but their meanings are vastly different. &quot;My friend is in hospital word one.&quot; Huh???</p>
<p>With respect to ungrammaticality, Chinese does have grammar (surprise!?). Just as in English where a word order wrong make your sentence nonsensical may, the same thing applies to Chinese. If you were to swap the positions of the first and third characters of the sentence 我吃饭。 to get 饭吃我。, you would have said that &quot;The rice eats me.&quot; instead of &quot;I eat rice.&quot; A person who speaks a language with an Object-Verb-Subject sentence structure may find it hard to get used to the Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure in Chinese, and may potentially use words in the wrong word order which leads to ungrammaticality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unlike English and most European languages, Chinese does not distinguish between singular and plural, so nouns are simply abstract in number, with context determining whether something is singular or plural.
But when you have to specify a certain number of something, you combine the number itself with a measure word, followed by the noun.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English, you ask &quot;How many people?&quot; In Chinese, it would be 几个人 (jĭ gè rén)? </p>
<p>几 is how many and 人 is person/people while 个 is the measure word for people. A lot of people who are learning Chinese for the first time tend to omit measure words.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also another common mistake would be the usage of number 2: 二 (èr) and 两 (liǎng). Using the previous example, if I was to answer &quot;Two people,&quot; 二个人 would be incorrect. The correct answer would be 两个人.</p>
<p>二 (èr), is when you want to refer to the digit, for example when you are count from 1 to 10 or when you are telling someone your phone number.</p>
<p>两 (liǎng) is used when quantity is involved. Like the example I showed above, two people- 两个人.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chinese here. One thing that people actually do and is wrong grammatically is speaking an incomplete sentence. When a sentence is really long, sometimes it would miss crucial elements, like objective or subjective. sometimes it is very difficult to tell that if a sentence consist of two or three sentences. I remember doing a lot of those questions in the Chinese equivalent of SAT/ACT but I can't really think of an example right now.</p>
<p>most &quot;typos&quot; would consist of using a character of the same pronounciation but different writing. It is somewhat easy to tell, unless it involves some less used characters.</p>
<p>the most common type of mistakes is the misuse of idioms. Unlike English idioms, Chinese idioms are usually based on some ancient text and consist of 4 characters. For example, &quot;空穴来风&quot;/empty cave causes wind means a rumor is not unreasonable. but some people think it just means the rumor is unsubstantiated, and they'll use it wrong. there are hundreds of idioms like that, and some have even changed meanings during the years. This is by far the most common &quot;typo&quot; or grammatical mistakes in Chinese imo. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answer about cost effective solutions to meet the current needs, where both the needs and costs change over time, but your point about discovering new techniques should be addressed. </p>
<p>New, better, coding techniques (for errors correction and recovery) allow you to send more bits in a given symbol. Essentially, if you and I are talking and we want to communicate the most complete sentences with the fewest words, we can agree on a code book.  Something like: heyu = how are you?, hiya = I am fine,  etc.  but in binary.   If I just send those four letters, but you only get h_y_ you cannot decode my message.  I can add extra letters to the message (redundancy) with some type of agreed coding so if you lose some of the letters you might be able to figure out which were missing, up to some point.  </p>
<p>In communication systems, this can extend to 256 bits or more in a single symbol (sent as a single transmission waveform), and with coding techniques available I will chose how to encode my data and what kind if symbols to use based on how likely it is that there will be errors (how much noise there is on the channel).  At the same time that processing power has gotten better and cheaper, so we can process long messages to decode them quickly, and we have moved from hardware processing to software, people have also discovered new codes which can give me as much or more ability to decode the original message with better chances of success.  In some cases the math was simple (turbo codes), it just took someone having an Aha! moment, in others (LDPC) the math gets pretty out there.  Also,  new codes are great on paper, but not always possible to process in the time required for real two way real-time communication. </p>
<p>Beyond an ELI5 post as well, new antenna designs, multiple input multiple output antenna arrays and cross antenna interference cancellation techniques, as well as new more efficient  multiple access strategies, have been developed that would not have been reasonable, or in some cases possible, with older systems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wireless N draft was 2007, released 2009. Since then, we haven't had any strictly better standards for 2.4 GHz. ac is an improvement over short distances, but not over longer distances. It is not strictly better.</p>
<p>ac wireless has several advantages:</p>
<p>1) Does not use 2.4 GHz. 2.4GHz spectrum is massively congested now, since wifi is everywhere. 5 GHz has more room, and less things on it. This is an advantage which in 2007 really wasn't all that big, because there were less wifi devices everywhere (the iphone only came out in 2007, no smart watches, etc.). Also, less interference from things like microwave ovens.</p>
<p>2) Higher frequency = more speed. ac starts at 450 Mbits per second. Not really much call for that in 2007.</p>
<p>3) Beamforming / MIMO. This uses processing power to increase the throughput by focusing the signal. Wireless n was already a significantly higher throughput than most people needed, and if you needed really high throughput you'd use ethernet.</p>
<p>4) Extended battery life. This advantage has improved over time, as the power drain of other items such as CPU has gone down, laptops have gotten thinner, and batteries smaller as a consequence.</p>
<p>However, there are downsides:</p>
<p>a) More processing power. Which means more expensive, a cost which goes down over time as chips get faster.</p>
<p>b) Using 5 GHz means you need antennae for two frequencies, since otherwise you would not be able to use 2.4 GHz networks. More cost.</p>

The same is true of having wide hips, and having shiny hair indicates good health. Breast firmness indicate age, so having developed and firm breasts indicates you are still young so potentially able to have more children, and having larger breasts indicates you have access to a stable food source so are a good potential mate. </p>
<p>But these biological indicators are just starting points to things. Most of our infatuation is socially developed and due to a myriad of social factors including how taboo sex is or is not, and how taboo nudity is or is not. The more taboo something is, the more attractive we tend to find the things that skirt the limits of that taboo, or the violate it completely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Women with symmetrical breast are more fertile than those asymmetrical breasts. An evolutionary theory is that, since it's easier to tell symmetry from bigger breasts, men gravitated towards that.</p>
<p>As a side note, evolutionary psychology has found some pretty amazing things. For example, men are more attractive when they're surrounding by other women but women are more attractive when they're not with a man. (This applies to long-term heterosexual relationships)</p>

As I was rereading <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233285975_A_Brief_History_of_the_Theory_of_Evolution" target="_blank">the chapter</a>, I realised I misread a word: breast size is not associated to milk production but it is to fertility.

There is an instinctual response as the shape and movement of a woman's breasts CAN indicate perceivable fertility and likelihood of successful child rearing.</p>
<p>Humans vary, so hormonal variances, social stressers, and biological influence can factor into the level of sexuality breasts are designated. There are also psychological elements, experiences, and fetishes that can complicate matters further.</p>

<p>Brin speculates that attraction to breasts is an evolved pedophilia-avoidance behavior: he writes that most of the common desirability signals for women are youth indicators, so attraction to boobs is your genes' way of distinguishing 'young and fertile' from 'way too young dude'. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it could be visual snow, but more likely what you're seeing is called eigengrau.</p>
<p>To explain, the way your eyes see in dim light is for particles of light to enter the eye and strike the rods of the eye, specifically activating a protein called rhodopsin. This protein is extremely sensitive to light, which enables us to see in very dim light, but is also so sensitive that it can be activated by the heat of your body. Since, even in pitch black, some of this rhodopsin would be activated by the heat of your body, you see a dark grey when you close your eyes instead of pure black. When your eyes are open this dark grey is actually the darkest color you can see, your brain just  compares it to the other lighter objects around it and you interpret the object as a pure black.</p>
<p>True ELI5, your eyes can never see pure black because the chemical in your eyes that let you see in dim light is so sensitive they can activate from the heat of your body, making your brain interpret a dark grey instead of a pure black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably not visual snow, which should be visible at all times. The reason is because in darkness your eye and brain essentially turn up the volume on the signal from your eyes. It's like when speakers hiss if you turn the volume up to max without anything playing - tiny random fluctuations are amplified so that they are perceptible.</p>
<p>In normal conditions the sensitivity is turned down or other bright objects swamp the noise so you can't hear it, but this doesn't happen in the dark. The advantage is that you can find your way out of the bedroom for a slash without waking up your wife.</p>
<p>Fun fact: your brain also tries to maximise your ability to see in the dark by using several seconds worth of data from your eyes to form an image. This makes moving objects look blurry and hard to discern in the dark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
