		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>actually, clicking the box is a rather trivial part of what those CAPTCHAs are looking for.  What they're actually looking for are things like:</p>
<p>did the 'user' instantly move their mouse to the exact coordinates of the box, or did they traverse thru the page like a human would?  </p>
<p>is the user scrolling to the box, or are they remotely executing javascript to trigger a scroll to the box?</p>
<p>how long after page load did the user find the box? Too quickly is obviously a red flag, but taking too long is also. commonly, to get around reCAPTCHA you'll need to find out 4-5 areas to click in addition to the initial click. The way that most people do this is using CAPTCHA services, which are real people solving them and returning the answer to you (i.e. for a text captcha, you'd send them the image and they'd send back the letters/numbers).  The way you do this with reCAPTCHA is sending a screenshot of the computer, and you are returned the coords that you're supposed to click on to answer the question properly. [e: apparently this method is old, and a new method where the CAPTCHA is actually served up to the person within the service that will solve it for you!] However, it usually doesn't take a legitimate human 5 minutes to answer a few questions about 9 images.  if you take too long, they'll make you do another image check challenge.</p>
<p>basically, it's really, really difficult to make a bot move the mouse, scroll, and react naturally to a page load. and even if you do manage to fool reCAPTCHA, you'll be thrown to a few image tasks which may serve to block you out from the website completely, due to the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>e: as others have mentioned, this type of stuff is only part of what reCAPTCHA relies on to determine human/non-human - particularly, your referring information &amp; whether or not you have a logged in Google account.</p>
<p>e2: there are a bunch of people claiming that mouse movement tracking is impossible to do. in chrome, hit ctrl+shift+j, paste</p>
<blockquote>
<p>onmousemove = function(e){console.log(&quot;mouse location:&quot;, e.clientX, e.clientY)}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in, and hit enter. then move the mouse. it's easily done.</p>
<p>e3: there are <em>still</em> a ton of people claiming that I just made up the ability to track end user mouse movements. <a href="http://www.javascriptsource.com/page-details/mouse-coordinates.html" target="_blank">http://www.javascriptsource.com/page-details/mouse-coordinates.html</a> is another example</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google is great at keeping its algorithms a secret, so we'll probably never know for sure, but we can make some guesses. </p>
<p>One thought is to track a users mouse and keyboard actions and see if that is consistent with a human, but I'm not entirely sure this is the system that it uses since it would be easy to replicate such actions with a simple bot.</p>
<p>I'm partial to the idea that Google is taking advantage of it's massive database of what you've been doing on the web the last few minutes. Have you checked your GMail? Made some Google searches for a new cat sweater? That's all stuff a human would do, and I am able to associate your captcha request with your previous internet requests and see you're probably human.</p>
<p>Of course, if this is a brand new computer connecting from an IP that has just been assigned, you probably don't have the sufficient background for Google to think you're human, so you'll receive a more difficult captcha to solve.</p>
<p>This means that if a bot was to check off that box, it wouldn't follow the history pattern we associate with a human and Google would return a further captcha check which the bot would fail. Usually these secondary captchas are going to be some sort of computer vision problems that would involve far too much resource intensive computing to solve.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a Google blog that gives you a bit of info (but of course nothing particularly useful) <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html" target="_blank">https://security.googleblog.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html</a></p>
<p>Edit2: Somebody tried to see if they can pretend to be a bot and see what would happen. Turns out that without having sufficient history, he was blocked out of a site he could normal access without captcha: <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/101906" target="_blank">http://security.stackexchange.com/a/101906</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>[Correct me if I'm wrong here]</p>
<p>As far as I've heard, Google is able to replace an actual CAPTCHA with this simple textbox only if they know enough stuff about you - This little checkbox is basically a plugin from google, thus (via cookies, sessions, knowing your IP etc) google knows on what pages you surfed in the time before arriving at that CAPTCHA. Knowing that you surfed for dank memes for the past 3 hours, Google can be pretty sure you're not a robot - having to actually click on that box is basically only for &quot;enabling&quot; that plugin.</p>
<p>If google doesn't know enough about you, they will by the way simply show the original reCAPTCHA, where you solve OCR (or street number recognition) tasks for Google (Streetview). You can simply test that by restarting your router, using incognito mode and going to a website using reCAPTCHA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I DO know that specifically for the Google CAPTCHAs, it checks if you're logged in to a Google account and if your account has had suspicious activity recently. If no suspicious activity has been logged, you'll simply receive the check box, if there has, or you're not logged in, you'll get a more difficult prompt, such as the picture matching. </p>
<p>Try going to a site with a check box in an incognito tab and you'll see for yourself! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually read a paper about fooling the recaptcha system awhile ago.</p>
<p>When you get the check box you're getting one of several possible &quot;challenges&quot;. To get the box challenges you must pass automated tests such as checks for common frameworks commonly used with bots, not being from an IP that's failed a challenge or answered too many boxes on other web sites among other things. As mentioned above once the chance of you being a bot is assessed to be low before page loads then you get a simple challenge. Depending on these pre assessed factors (some which are only known to google) the difficulty of the captcha is determined.</p>
<p>So as mentioned above clicking the check box is easy and there are minimal protections such as mouse movement patterns and timings however, by the time you get the check box challenge it's been determined that the odds of you being a bit are so low that the test it's self can afford to be weak.</p>
<p>In this case text is the hardest challenge, images the medium challenge and the check box the minimal challenge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Adaptive optics can also be used to cancel out atmospheric turbulence.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edit3:</strong> <strong>This should not be the top-upvoted post.</strong> If you want a good, concise answer to the actual question, go read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kbvkj/eli5_why_is_suspension_from_school_a_punishment/dbmyhyk/" target="_blank">this fantastic response</a> by /u/lightaugust instead. My comment talks about the concept of punishment in very general terms and tells you to make your own mind up. Thanks to /u/NothingtobeDon3 for pointing out that I'd become the top comment somehow.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you're thinking about punishment, it's worth considering punishment <em>in general</em>. There are five purposes typically associated with punishments, but often we as individuals can only think of one or two, when asked. The five purposes of any punishment, whether we're talking about unruly children or criminal adults, are one of more of: incapacitation, restitution, retribution, rehabilitation, and deterrence.</p>
<p><strong>Incapacitation</strong> is <em>stopping somebody from doing it (or other unacceptable behaviour) again</em>. Suspension from school achieves this goal by taking the child out of school: there's no way that they can break school rules when they're not there! Consider also punishments like losing privileges (being forbidden from doing something, or having something confiscated if you misuse it) or imprisonment (keeping you out of the way of possible victims), both of which are incapacitating.</p>
<p><strong>Restitution</strong> is getting something back for the victim of somebody who misbehaves, to compensate them for that which they've been deprived. Suspension probably doesn't achieve this, although you could argue that in the absence of the unruly child the other children each gain a larger slice of the teacher's time and attention. But if you do something wrong and you break something of somebody else's and you have to buy them a replacement, or if you have to pay a fine part of which goes to the victim of your misdeeds, that's restitution.</p>
<p><strong>Retribution</strong> is about fulfilling the sense of 'getting your own back' that most of us feel, and it's a major part of what we as a civilisation talk about when we say we  want justice. It doesn't have to be 'an eye for an eye' - losing something the same as, or equal value to, what your victim has lost - and in practice it's more efficient to run disciplinary systems (whether we're taking about schools or justice departments) with a simple and unimaginative system of punishments: consider the sheer number of different possible crimes in your country and then consider the fact that the vast majority of them are probably punished by fines and/or prison (or depending where you are in the world, corporal or capital punishment). There's an element of this to suspension from school (excluding somebody from their social group is a form of retribution), but the retribution is perhaps mostly against the <em>parents</em> of the child, who may have to arrange other forms of childcare, for example: this in turn may encourage the application of secondary punishments from the parents (&quot;You got suspended‽ No TV or video games for two weeks!&quot;). Those who feel that our prisons are unnecessarily pleasant (or who call for greater application of corporal/capital punishment or for more inclusion of victims in the sentencing process) are often thinking that retribution is the primary objective of punishment. </p>
<p><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> is about giving offenders the means to live normally and return to the group from which they came. It's one of the hardest elements of punishment to get right. For some offenders and especially children, it can be sufficient to encourage empathy and personally provide restitution: for example &quot;You deliberately broke Alice's favourite toy: I think you should say sorry and give her <em>your</em> favourite toy to play with for today, and then tomorrow we'll use your pocket money to buy her a new one.&quot; provides restitution, retribution, and helps the offender to understand what they've done and how it affects others, aiding rehabilitation. Encouraging empathy as a mechanism for rehabilitation can be tougher in adults, and furthermore some commit crimes with no clear identifiable victim (making empathy harder), but other techniques are available. Combating the causes of misbehaviour can help, such as reducing social exclusion, teaching the skills necessary to integrate, breaking down barriers, and providing more-satisfying life opportunities. In some cases, medicine can help, by providing offenders with a balance of brain-chemicals that makes it easier to control their behaviour. Rehabilitation can be a factor in school suspensions, if we assume that he parents of the child will take responsibility for administering an appropriate programme of rehabilitation... but in practice that might be unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>Deterrence</strong> is about reducing the likelihood that misbehaviour will occur in the first place, because of the perceived risk of getting caught and/or punished. Deterrence is a major factor in many people's decision as to whether or not they will commit some offences (other offences, though, might simply be unthinkable to many of us regardless of whether or not they were considered crimes: we just consider them <em>morally wrong</em>). The risk of suspension can act as a deterrent to other children for the reasons described above, especially those under retribution and to a lesser extent those under rehabilitation and incapacitation. It's worth noting though that study after study have shown that, in adults and in children, the <em>severity</em> of retribution associated with misbehaviour does not have a very large impact on its deterrence factor: it doesn't matter whether exceeding the speed limit attracts a fine of £100 or £1,000 or whether buying drugs gets you 10 months or 10 years in prison... most of the people who were going to do it will do it anyway: there's a threshold of punishment after which increasing the punishment yields diminishing returns.</p>
<p>When you ask people &quot;What is punishment for?&quot; they'll usually only be able to identify one or two, maybe three, of these important factors, which shows that people often have very specific and sometimes polarised ideas about how we should as a society maintain discipline (whether of children or adults). But while we may disagree on the relative weights of the importance of the different factors, we must agree that they're all important in some way.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and here on Reddit, we punish people who disobey subreddit (or site) rules with incapacitation (sub bans, site bans, shadowbans, moderation), retribution (downvotes as a mechanism to exclude from conversation and to socially ostracise), and occasional rehabilitation (education as to the rules of the site, &quot;remember the human&quot; empathy building, temporary bans to give time to reflect), and maintain deterrence via the (some would argue weak) threats of the above. See: we're a society too, just like a school or a country.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: In considering what a punishment is <em>for</em>, consider it in terms of whether it achieves any or all of: incapacitation, restitution, retribution, rehabilitation, or deterrence. This provides the tools to answer not only this question but also every other &quot;why punish <em>this</em> way?&quot; question too.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Typo. Shouldn't have done this on my phone.</p>
<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Another typo. As amusing as cake fines are, I really shouldn't trust my phone's autocorrect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a kindergarten age son who has been suspended multiple times this year.  My son is not autistic, but he has very similar traits and is definitely a special needs kid.  He doesn't know how to properly interact with other people and has trouble controlling his emotions.  When he feels emotionally hurt, or threatened, or feels like he doesn't have control over his situation he quickly escalates to an angry and violent state.  He screams, bites, and kicks.  He tries to run away.  He is very difficult to bring back under control, so often the school staff decide to suspend him.</p>
<p>From the staff's point of view this the only way to handle the situation.  Schools are understaffed as it is, and when my kid goes off they just can't spare someone to wrangle him back under control, especially if he's being violent.  They need to get the class back in order and keep the other kids focused on learning.  They need to make sure the students and staff are all safe from harm.  Suspension is absolutely the right thing for them to do when my son is out of control.</p>
<p>However, on our side things are a bit different.  My son feels safe and comfortable at home.  He's scared of the other kids and the difficult social situations they put him in.  He resents teachers and staff he's not comfortable with taking control of his day and pushing his boundaries.  When he's home none of that pressure is on him.  It doesn't matter how miserable I make his day when I bring him home, he'd still rather be there than at school.</p>
<p>I've tried making him do all the school work he was going to do that day.  I've tried making him do a boot-camp style workout.  I've tried making him help me do chores around the house.  I've tried talking and talking with him.  I've tried yelling.  Hell, I've tried spanking.  He always looses any special privileges like TV, video games, or toys, but it doesn't help. Once he's home, nothing works.  He just can't associate the punishments at home with the poor choices at school.  His mind just doesn't make that connection.  Maybe it's too long of a delay between action and reaction, I don't know.  He can't see the punishments as consequences for his actions, so he sees it as having a hard day and then dad bringing him home and treating him like crap.  Somehow that little boy would still prefer a shitty afternoon at home to a good day at school.</p>
<p>It's a tough situation for everyone.  The school has to protect their students and staff, but at the same time they're teaching my son that if he's uncomfortable with his situation he can just hurt someone and get to go home.  Obviously that's not the intended lesson, but it's what he gets out of it.  The school knows how he perceives going home, but what choice do they have?  Being suspended is a reward for him, no matter how bad I make his day at home.  I know consciously that suspension is the right choice for the rest of the kids, but I can't help feeling a bit selfish and wishing there was a choice that was better for my son.  Also, suspension forces me to leave work, reschedule appointments, and screws up my day (or days).  I hate wasting my time just to teach my kid the wrong lesson.  The things he needs to learn are at school, not home, so it's a waste of his time, too.  The whole situation is mind bogglingly frustrating.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  Suspension can be difficult for everyone, especially if the child has special needs.</p>
<p>Edit for all the people still messaging me:</p>
<p>1- My child has been extensively tested, observed, and analyzed by both the school and a team of doctors at the local childhood development clinic.  They all agreed that he does not have autism or aspergers.  His doctor chose to give him a diagnosis of ADHD to qualify my son for special education benefits, not because it was an accurate diagnosis or reflected his actual condition in any way.  He is continuously evaluated and the doctors will revise his diagnosis if necessary.  I appreciate your stories and the support you've given, but please stop diagnosing my child and leave it to the professionals.</p>
<p>2- We already have an IEP in place.  He is getting help and I do not believe the school is failing him.  We continue to tweak the IEP to ensure his needs are met.  The staff and teachers bend over backwards to help my son.  I'm impressed with the improvements they have helped my son achieve so far and I think they're on the path to future successes.  My post was not written to complain about the school, merely to show how frustrating and difficult our situation can be.  I appreciate all the advice in this area, and I have absolutely learned things from your comments.</p>
<p>3-  I said that I TRIED spanking and other things to highlight my desperation, not to describe my daily routine.  I do not abuse my son, and I did not continue spanking him.  I don't believe I'm a failure of a parent for spanking my kid one time, but if that's your opinion, so be it.</p>
<p>4- Yes, we have tried positive reinforcement rather than punishment.  It's my preferred method of raising the kid, and seems to work well with his brother.  However, when he's giving teachers bruises and making kids bleed I HAVE to acknowledge what he's done and find a way to make him understand that it's wrong.  I did not punish him to make him feel bad for things outside of his control.  I tried to make suspension a negative thing in his mind so that maybe he'd finally make the connection that hurting people is not a solution, but a greater problem.  I know how strong positive reinforcement can be, and I appreciate the suggestions you all have shared, but my son needs more than that to realize that he can't hurt people when he's scared or angry.  My son isn't &quot;throwing temper tantrums&quot;, he's having a fight or flight response to things that wouldn't normally require one.  That's why it's so hard to teach him not to hurt, and why positive reinforcement hasn't proven to be enough.</p>
<p>5-  My son is a twin.  His brother has no special needs and does really well socially at school.  The twin has been greatly affected by the difficulties my son has had, and every decision we make about our home life or educational situation requires that we take the needs of both children into account.  Because of that homeschooling or a special needs school is just not an option.  Maybe that will change in the future.  I appreciate all your suggestions, though.</p>
<p>When I posted this reply I was just trying to show OP that yes, sometimes suspension is what the kid wants and doesn't help them learn, but is still often necessary.  I ended up venting a lot of my frustration into my reply.  I never expected it to receive 1000s of upvotes or a gilding.  I am amazed by, and truly grateful for, all the support and advice that people have shared with me.  At the same time, it's really difficult to read messages saying that my son should die or that I need to &quot;old yeller him&quot;.  Those kinds of things are fucking awful and people who send them should be ashamed of themselves.  I'm all for constructive criticism, though, so if you can disagree with me without being an asshole, by all means, go for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>17 year school admin (Asst. Principal for 10, Principal for 7) here, so I feel like it's my time to shine on reddit!  A lot of the replies here are good, but are missing some pieces.  Yes, suspension has a role, especially where the law says it's mandatory for the offense. In the case where it absolutely keeps kids safe or keeps the learning environment intact, it is a necessary thing.   </p>
<p>That said, suspension has been very, very overused throughout education history, and the thinking about it has changed over the last few years, much for the better.   In cases where the above conditions aren't true, there's really not much of a point to suspension.  It doesn't help kids learn or stay safe, it costs the offender learning, which fixes nothing, and it usually has no causality with the offense.   In non-safety/ mandatory uses, it only aims to give everyone a break, which sounds kinda nice, but is bad for actual student growth and learning.  In short, it rarely really does anything to change behavior, outside of a kid basically scared they could be suspended again.   In shorter, outside of the deterrent effect, it doesn't do shit.   </p>
<p>The goal of disciplinary systems used to be to keep order, whereas they should be to CHANGE the behavior for the better, so it doesn't happen again, and suspensions for stupid shit rarely do that.  There are MUCH better ways to educate towards changing a behavior than suspension.   Furthermore, suspension very much is handed disproportionately to students of color, boys, students at a socio-economic disadvantage, and students with special needs.   In my experience, what ends up happening is the discussion with the parents ends up being about the appropriateness of the consequence rather than what the kid actually did and what needs to change for that kid.   </p>
<p>tl;dr:  Suspensions for safety, mandatory by law stuff are fine and sometimes necessary, other than that, they're kinda dumb.  </p>
<p>Edit:   Wow! Thank you so much for the gold, and I hope the gilders have an especially great New Year.   The response for this have been crazy, and to think I was trying not to talk about work on the Winter Break.   Anyway, lots of responses from people who got suspended for dumb stuff and lots of people who see suspension as a necessary thing as well.   All good, the hope is we at least think through what effect we're creating in our kids and we have a purpose when we react to what kids do.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</li>
<li>Wake up call from the school to the parent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately most repeat offenders aren't going to care about some other scolding from mom and a chance to not be expected to go to school.</p>
<p>As a teacher though, I've found that kids that have behavior problems are the ones that typically never miss a day of school nor do they want to. For disruptive kids, school may be the only place where they're getting attention.</p>
<p>EDIT: To be clear, OSS has been found to be largely ineffective for repeat offenders (the basis of this question), though its effects as a looming consequence for others has been less conclusive. </p>
<p>Most schools nowadays are trending towards training teachers in counseling skills to attempt to deal with issues in the classroom, but these are either expensive to do right (counseling skills require sometimes extensive training, teachers I highly recommend the Flippen Group's <em>Capturing Kids' Hearts</em>) or are ineffectively taught (district sends one person to a seminar who then teaches it to others and so on). </p>
<p>However to truly bring down OSS numbers staffing of counselors is a major issue. Most schools have cut dedicated counseling positions since 2008 and the result has been disastrous. Please support your local schools by petitioning your state for an increase in funds to school districts and by asking schools boards to restore these cut positions (as well as seeking counseling training for all teachers). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has taught young and troubled kids before, suspension is more about moving the responsibility onto the parents.</p>
<p>When you're teaching a class of 40 kids and one child is being so undisciplined that you have to spend most of your time keeping him in line just to get through the day, you have to weigh your options. Do I keep trying to work with this child, knowing that all of these other kids will suffer? Or do I try to move this problem onto someone else knowing that the child in question will suffer and probably not improve?</p>
<p>I tried to never kick kids out of my classes, but there just is not enough time for it. All of those other students - those deserve your time and attention just as much. Kids who are quiet and obedient shouldn't suffer because one kid needs to constantly play the clown and impress his friends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a source right now but if I remember correctly adding a massive amount of water to the sun would actually make it burn hotter. The reason is that at these scales we can't think of water as something that extinguishes fire. What's going on in a star is a nuclear fusion reaction triggered by the massive amount of energy coming from the combined gravitational pull of all the components of the star. So by adding a massive amount of water to the star you're adding a lot of weight which means more gravitational energy meaning more fusion. You're also adding fuel that can be fused in the form of water molecules. </p>
<p>Soeone please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm by no means an authority on the subject but I remember seeing something like this on a PBS spacetime video a while ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you keep heating it, it will get yellower and yellower as more yellow light gets emitted (relative to the other energy it is emitting).</p>
<p>Eventually it does reach a point where it emitting enough higher energy light that it has a considerable amount of green or blue light being emitted. However, at this point, so much light is being emitted (and a lot of it is still red light) that the object will just appear white to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called black body radiation. Objects that aren't at absolute zero have thermal energy. The electrons present are constantly gaining and losing energy - which is emitted as light, one photon at a time. The color/wavelength of a photon is determined by how much energy it has. An electron will emit basically any energy it gets, almost immediately. At higher temperatures, more of the electrons can occasionally attain higher levels of energy and therefore emit &quot;hotter&quot; colors, but more electrons are gaining and losing the lesser quanta also.</p>
<p>We can only see a tiny range of light energy - from red (lower energy) to blue and violet (higher energy). Infrared, microwaves, and radio are examples of low energy light, below our threshold, while ultraviolet and x-rays are &quot;high energy&quot; colors of light. Anyways, even cold objects emit this thermal radiation, and continue to emit it in addition to that red glow. When you see red-hot metal, it's infringing into the visible spectrum, but there's far more light being emitted that we can't see - red is just the edge of the spectrum of light being produced by that hot knife. As it becomes even hotter, the spectrum shifts, we see even more red light in addition to the higher energy colors.</p>
<p>Because of the way human vision works, we don't see these colors separately. Instead, colors add up to appear more white. Ever see an RGB projector?</p>
<p>On a side note, that blue sky you see is actually mostly violet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Every object in a room emits light at not just one wavelength, but across a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Changing the object's temperature will shift the <em>predominant</em> wavelength being emitted, but the other wavelengths continue to be emitted as well. That's why you get a transition from red to orange to white to blue, rather than a full cycle through the rainbow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When something is heated the atoms or molecules respond by moving more and in different ways. Air doesn't glow a color until it gets really really hot because it can move in 3d space, vibrate, bend (such as in water vapor), or rotate (but not about an axis of symmetry such as along the bonds between oxygen or nitrogen in the diatomic molecules of oxygen or nitrogen).</p>
<p>But metals (such as steel in a knife) are bound together in a lattice, they cannot move the way air can, so most of that heat energy goes to exciting electrons or vibration. Every atom or molecule has different energy states that electrons can occupy. When the energetic electrons go back to their less energetic ground state they release the energy as a photon that often is in the red spectrum. </p>
<p>However some metals can produce other colors and any impurities would cause different colors as well. Because each of these elements or atoms can have  different energy levels available to their electrons that may or may not be available to those in iron or carbon. And a lot of energy can cause a lot of different energy levels being accessible causing a white light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other reasons, it's not easy to donate eggs, it is a long and painful process with many doctor appointments. Psychological tests, blood work, ultrasounds, multiple medications, self-injections over a period of days, and egg &quot;retrieval&quot; which  requires IV sedation and a real big needle. The donor and recipient have to carefully align their cycles and the donor has to make sure they take the medications correctly and on time and give themselves shots without fail at the same time everyday within 15 minutes of the set time. Often times the hormones will affect a woman's mood. You can't just take an egg like you can take sperm, you have to chemically alter how your body works for months. A lot of work, time, and dedication goes into it. The recipients want their money's worth and don't want to waste their time with a mentally/physically unprepared donor who quits half way through. Some of the restrictions are a bit too much I think, but I guess if you're gonna spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on an egg with no guarantee it work, you'd want the &quot;best&quot; you can get. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Egg donors get paid large amounts (£8000 isn't uncommon), and the process is very expensive for company who are paying for it- unlike sperm, it isn't a single trip to a clinic, it's weeks of hormone injections and then an invasive procedure done under a general anaesthetic to surgically remove the matured eggs.<br />
Therefore, it is much cheaper and better for everyone involved to screen out anyone who has any potential to have low quality eggs as early into the process as possible by having very high standards.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the conceptual models that adequately explains a fair few things about our brains' behaviours is the linked data model.</p>
<p>Each piece of data is linked to other pieces of data, like sights, or smells, or people you were with, or things you were also thinking about when you learned that thing, or previous times thinking about the thing.</p>
<p>And links degrade and become overwritten with time. More like a half-life thing than a 'in precisely 3 years and 47 seconds I will forget this thing'. </p>
<p>If <em>every</em> piece of data can form links like that, then so can meta-thoughts. Like, &quot;the plot of this movie is linked to the title of this movie&quot;. And perhaps, at one point, it was. You know a link was there. You know that if you hear the title, it'll feel right in an inexplicable way. But damnit <em>what was the name of it</em>?</p>
<p>Conceptually, this model also explains why we can sometimes remember stuff like this by looking for more related information. Lead actors names? Director? Where you first saw it? All things that also might have links to the movie title, and the links might still exist. </p>
<p>Some people express that they remember looking at the book cover, or title screen, or cd case or whatever, but not being able to remember what it said. </p>
<p>But that's just a conceptual model, and was not constructed with any physical properties of the brain in mind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So when you eat or have sex, your brain produces lots and lots of Feelgood dust, which makes you feel awesome. But then the Feelgood dust leaves through the drain and you feel normal again.</p>
<p>Now, there's this poison, nicotine, that clogs the drain, and that means that the Feelgood Dust stays in your head for longer. Isn't that wonderful?</p>
<p>The problem is that the drain is very delicate. If the Smoke Poison clogs it too many times in too short a time, it breaks and it becomes wider. And then the feelgood dust disappears immediately and you don't feel good ever. So you need to get more and more of the Smoke Poison just to feel normal. That's called Addiction.</p>

<p>Adhesion is a fancy word for sticking to each other. So air molecules also want to stick next to water molecules.</p>
<p>The strongest force by far is water wanting to stick next to water, though, so big bubbles tend to split up. If you think of a big bubble and then cut it in half, you've added lots of space where water can hang out next to water. It's called surface tension.
