		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation/abuse where you deceive someone to the point where they begin to question their own reality and sanity. It is probably better explained via an example.</p>
<p>Let's say you had a brother growing up. Then, one day, you came home, and there was no trace of him. He isn't in any pictures, all of this things are gone, and no one you talk to recalls him.</p>
<p>Let's also say that this is a big deception. Everyone is in on the conspiracy. Your brother has moved away, your parents replaced all the pictures and got rid of all of his stuff, and everyone else is feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>But the deception is so thorough, and they are so adamant about the lie and stick to it so well that you begin to question your own memories of your brother to the point where you begin to consider not that everyone is lying to you, but that they are right and you are just crazy.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Some people are getting this confused with the Mandela Effect. I'll admit they are similar but there are some crucial differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They both involve questioning ones memories, but in the Mandela effect the memories are false, with Gas Lighting the memories are true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandela effect originates with the person experiencing the effect when confronted with a contrary but true reality. It is not fully understood and is a psychological phenomenon. Gas Lighting is a form of psychological abuse that originates externally, from the person presenting the false reality.</p>
</li>
<li>The Mandela effect is unintentional whereas Gas Lighting is malicious and deliberate.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT2:</p>
<p>Yes, the Asian-Jim joke in the Office is a humorous example of Gas Lighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to use a more feasible example than some of the ones above. Let's say you see your wife kissing a coworker at your office Christmas party. You're shocked and hurt, and don't know how to react, so you just stand there stunned for a second. Your coworker sees you and pulls your wife out of your sight line and into a room with people.</p>
<p>You follow and tell your wife you two need to talk. You ask her what's going on. She pretends she doesn't know what you're talking about. You say that you caught her kissing your coworker.</p>
<p>Then she says she's been in that common room with the large group of people all night. You must have seen him kissing someone else. Also, haven't you had a few drinks? And weren't you smoking a cigarette while some other coworkers were hitting a joint outside? Maybe that joint was laced with something weird, that one coworker is kind of sketchy. It feels like maybe you aren't in the best place to be <em>sure</em> that was her you saw. You two should go home, she'll drive since you're a little drunk. You aren't a little drunk, but you're mad and also want to leave, so you can talk about this more.</p>
<p>All night you argue, and all night she denies. You talk about breaking up, she calls you crazy and gets angry. You're angry too, but eventually you decide to sleep on the couch and deal with the logistics of probably breaking up the next day.</p>
<p>At first you're so sure. But then...you aren't. The next day, the memory is a little more faded. It was dark in that side room. If you ask your coworker, he'll probably deny too. So there's no point in asking him. Should you ask some other people that were in the common room? But then if you're wrong, or they didn't see, you'll look like kind of a crazy person in front of other coworkers.</p>
<p>Behind all of this, there's a big part of you that doesn't <em>want</em> this to be happening. Deep down, you kind of hope you're wrong. And eventually, you start to believe it. The more time passes, the more the memory fades, the less certain you can be. Your wife, meanwhile, is steadfast and resolute in her rightness, and angry at you for questioning her fidelity. Maybe you'll always sort of know what you saw, but you'll never be able to really talk about it without sounding crazy and you'll never act on it.</p>
<p>This is gaslighting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was in a relationship with a guy who gaslighted me constantly for almost two years. It would range from small things like he would ask for a cup of tea and then when brought it deny he ever asked for one. We would argue about things and he would say the most horrible, malicious things to me, but when I brought them up later he would twist everything to make it seem like I was the sole aggressor in the argument so I would end up apologising to him instead of getting the apology from him that I needed. We would make plans together but then when it came to it he would deny any knowledge of it. One time we were out with friends and I gave a guy he didn't like a hug/said hello, and he later accused me of kissing this person (which I absolutely did not and would not do), insisting that I was drunk and I didn't remember and that all of our friends witnessed it. This blew into a huge argument and he kept making up more elaborate scenarios and continuing to insist I was so drunk I didn't remember (I wasn't that drunk and I remembered everything, though by the end of the argument I started to believe him). One of the most bizarre instances was that he got a couple of books for Christmas once, and when I was gathering my books from the house to move out he insisted that they were my books so I should take them, and began to get angry, which led me to question my sanity even as I was moving out and so I took the books, but that was one of the most fucking weird occurrences in the entire relationship. He was also repeatedly physically aggressive, often for no apparent reason, but afterwards would claim that I started the fight, that he never hit me, that I needed help/I was making it up/was losing my mind. </p>
<p>When I first met him I was quite confident, outgoing, fun-loving. After two years I was an agitated nervous wreck, having regular panic attacks, in a pit of despair and depression, genuinely believing that maybe he's right, maybe I am crazy, questioning all my friendships (because he did a very good job at making other people believe I was crazy as well as myself) which led to me pushing many of my friends away because I didn't trust them anymore, blaming myself for every argument we had and desperately seeking forgiveness because I believed he was the only person I had left. It's a process of slowly chipping away at a persons sense of self and their sanity until they no longer even believe or trust their own thoughts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>C'mon, /u/hamsterberry, this'll be the third time today I've explained gaslighting to you. Are you not smart enough to understand or do you just not respect me enough to listen? This is why everyone calls you a scatterbrain and no one wants you around. You're lucky I love you because no one else would be willing to put up with this. Anyway, that's what gaslighting is. Now did you remember to pick up the thing? Seriously, we talked about it this morning and you promised you'd pick it up for the party. Oh, <em>of course</em> you don't remember the party. Heaven forbid you remember something that's not entirely centered around you. Luckily I'm used to you disappointing everyone, so I did it myself. This is why our friends never come over anymore. They just can't stand being around you. Is it my fault? Is it something I did to make you like this? Oh there you go, blaming everyone but yourself. Typical /u/hamsterberry. You're lucky I love you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia: &quot;Gaslighting is a form of manipulation through persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying in an attempt to destabilize or delegitimize a target. Its intent is to sow seeds of doubt in their targets, hoping to make them question their own perception, memory, and sanity.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a common tactic used by abusers. </p>
<p>In simpler terms: Person A (usually a narcissist or sociopath) does something harmful or wrong to another, often dependent/trusting Person B. When B tries to call out A or question them concerning the wrongful act, A insists that B was misunderstanding or misremembering the situation and blowing things out of proportion, even though B was really in the right. Over a period of time, B will begin to doubt themselves and will be less capable of addressing any abusive or harmful situations because, after all, they have a history of &quot;blowing things out of proportion.&quot; Person A is now free to continue to harm B and get away with it so long as no outside party that has not been gaslit notices what's going on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How do you consider the problems associated with maternal and environmental effects when considering the problem of resurrecting extinct species?</p>
<p>Just to elaborate a minute...a ll organisms living today have ancestors to give them not just genetic inheritance, but to teach them behaviors, give them hormones and yolk and nourishment and mitochondria and social systems and much more. All the serious conversations I've seen on this topic fail to account for these dramatic sources of inheritance , so I fear we by focussing on simply one aspect (nuclear DNA), the vast number other sources of missing phenotypic determinants will mean that what we do create will be much less than the original.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we are crying, our body is essentially in a state of stress. Stress activates our sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for the fight or fli8ght response. This increases blood flow and respiration. To allow for the extra respiration, a muscle called the glottis opens up for more air to pass through. Now when you need to swallow it creates tension in this muscle, resulting in that lump-like sensation.

<p>As other people have pointed out, there are some cars that use the heated wiring up front. I sat in a Range Rover that had it. They were very, very fine zigzag wires across the windshield that could only be seen when focusing your eyes on it. When driving, it wasn't noticable in the slightest.</p>
<p>Something that new cars have now is what's called a PTC. This is essentially an electric heater that provides warm air before the engine has had time to warm up the coolant running through the heater core. The air that comes out of it isn't hot, but it's still warm and instantly available on a cold day. Also, most cars offer remote start, which does wonders for clearing the glass in the morning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As you cool the system down to absolute zero, it must approach its quantum-mechanical ground state. In this state, all electrons occupy the lowest available state. The Pauli exclusion principle prevents any two electrons from being in the same state, so the electrons in the Fermi gas at absolute zero pile up into higher and higher momentum states.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geneticist here!  CRISPR (or CRISPR-Cas9, if you want the full name), is a big improvement in how we genetically modify organisms.</p>
<p>All organisms, from single-cell bacteria, to plants, to animals, to humans, have long molecules inside of them, called DNA.  The pattern of different molecules in this chain of DNA, called the <em>genetic code,</em> provides instructions for building those bacteria/plants/animals.  Tiny little machines inside those cells read the genetic code and use those instructions to make every part of the organism, so that it can grow and reproduce!</p>
<p>Now, one of the really cool things about DNA is that, because it's the &quot;blueprint&quot; for making an organism, we can make changes to the DNA and see the results in the resulting organisms!  For example, if we insert the instructions for producing a green fluorescent protein (called GFP for short) in a bacteria's DNA, that bacteria will make the protein, and will glow green under fluorescent light!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, inserting a new chunk of instructions into DNA isn't as easy as making a change to a set of blueprints.  We can manipulate DNA when it's isolated from an animal, on its own, but there's no way to build a new organism around that naked DNA.  If we want to change an organism, we need to get at the DNA inside the cells, without killing them.</p>
<p>In addition, cells don't like getting random chunks of DNA shoved at them.  They see this as a threat, and will destroy that DNA.  So in order to get a chunk of DNA to stay in a cell, we need to incorporate it into the cell's own DNA - merge it in, like glueing a new sheet into the blueprints.</p>
<p>In order to add a chunk of foreign DNA, we need to add our chunk inside the cell, break the cell's own DNA somewhere, and then get the cell to fix its DNA by sticking our inserted chunk into the gap.  Three tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> getting the foreign chunk of DNA into a cell, can be accomplished by using electricity or soap to temporarily &quot;pop&quot; the cell's membrane.  Obviously, this doesn't work well on adult humans, but it works great on bacteria and single cells.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Breaking the cell's DNA somewhere.  This is the really tricky part.  Using certain (very nasty and dangerous) chemicals can make the DNA break in random places, but this is dangerous; what if we break the DNA in the middle of a gene that we need?  Our cells will die!  </p>
<p>This is where CRISPR comes in.  CRISPR is a combination of a scissor-like protein and a DNA guide that lets it only cut at very specific chosen locations.  Unlike old methods, we can be very precise with where we cut the cell's own DNA.  We can cut to turn off a gene, or cut at a place where there's nothing but junk so that we can insert our own foreign DNA pieces!</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Close the DNA back up, fixing those cuts - with our inserted chunk inside.  Fortunately, cells have the machinery to repair DNA cuts on their own!  That was easy!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>So, CRISPR is a molecular pair of scissors that cuts DNA in very precise locations.</strong>  There are still big challenges with genetic engineering - it's tough to get these scissors into a cell, the foreign chunk of DNA doesn't always get inserted, and the CRISPR scissors can still miss and cut in the wrong places.  But this is a huge advancement in making more precise cuts, a very important part in creating an organism with new abilities.</p>

<p>The most popular thing that people bring up when talking about what CRISPR can do is designer babies.  CRISPR allows for editing our DNA very precisely when compared to previous methods.  As the methodology on how to use CRISPR is worked out it will likely become more accurate and safer.  Once it's deemed safe enough to use on humans we'll be able to cure all genetic diseases by changing who people are at the root, their DNA.</p>
<p>The sci-fi trope for this technology is where a living person can change their genetic code to make them faster, smarter, stronger, or even change hair color or physical features.  Currently though most of the talk is about making these changes during fetal developmental stage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Background: Served on Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for a major Canadian city. Involved in design/implementation of roadworks, including intelligent stoplight systems. </p>
<p>Some background on stoplights:</p>
<p>There are multiple kinds of stoplights, the most basic just running on a simple timer-based system. Every so many seconds, the lights change, but there is no awareness of the traffic conditions.</p>
<p>Some more advanced stoplights contain vehicle sensors embedded in the roadway at or before the stop line. These sensors feed information into the light control system, allowing it to make intelligent decisions. For instance, if you have a minor road intersecting a major road, there may be sensors placed on the minor road, so that the lights only cycle when there is a car waiting to cross. Sometimes they are used to signal a preemptive left turn light. The civil engineers will space out two sensors 4-5 car lengths apart, and if both sensors are covered it means there are at least that many cars queuing, and the advance left will allow those cars to proceed first. Most major intersections have at least a few roadway sensors. </p>
<p>The most advanced systems allow the lights to communicate and can be timed to allow waves of traffic. In my city, there is an Intersection Control Centre, with live feeds from cameras at each intersection, and the ability to adjust intersection timings on the fly. Priority routes are identified, along with traffic flows during certain times of the day. The stoplights along these priority routes are then synchronized, taking into account the relative speed of the traffic and the speed limits. If you're going with the priority flow of traffic, you'll hit at most one red light, after which point you'll be synchronized with the traffic flow, and you should hit all greens, as long as you drive the speed limit. If you drive too fast, you'll hit each red just as it turns green. </p>
<p>If you're hitting all the reds, you might be going in the wrong direction, or you're just really unlucky. I highly doubt that your city is specifically engineering the light cycles to slow you down. If anything, they'd be aiming to speed you up. </p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>So this blew up overnight. I'll try to answer a bunch of questions that people have had.</p>
<p>I'm not an industry professional, I've just been in the scene with them for awhile. I work in IT, not traffic engineering.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There's no big &quot;Traffic Engineering&quot; bible that every engineer uses. Different cities can do wildly different things, and all we can do is speculate. There's no way to answer &quot;My road is optimized for exactly 42mph at 11am, why is that?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are really good at finding patterns where there aren't any. Conspiracy theorists abound! If the lights in your city are messing with you, they probably aren't. Having said that, weirder things have happened. <em>shrug</em> It's certainly possible for clever engineers to slow traffic down or to speed traffic up. I'd bet dollars to donuts that they do this in Vegas, as many people have mentioned. A few people have also mentioned that the lights are used to prevent speeders, another plausible possibility. It really depends on your city and the engineers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;aiming to speed you up&quot; is meant within reason. I'm talking about a jam packed 6 lane road where coordinated light cycles can mean the difference between 40km/h and 50km/h. At night, the lights probably ARE optimized to dissuade people from speeding/racing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buses and emergency services usually have preemtion devices to allow them to hold a green or switch to a green (usually respectively. I know that buses where I live aren't able to force a red to a green, but fire trucks can)</p>
</li>
<li>The roadway sensors use magnetic induction to detect when a large chunk of metal is above them, e.g. your car. It's not by weight or pressure, you don't need to hit them exactly or run them over, you just need to get your car near them. The preemption devices mentioned above use special strobe lights (or wireless in higher-tech systems), so flashing your high beams probably isn't gonna do dick, unless you can flash your high beams 20 times per second.</li>

<p>In this case it may be poor design or it may be part of a bigger traffic plan.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, an ELI5 I feel qualified to answer! I'm a graduate student in transportation! Signal timing is actually a very complicated process, <strong>but it really comes down to the fact that you can't please everyone all the time</strong> (this is the tl;dr of every life problem probably). </p>
<p>Let's illustrate it with a simple example. You want to time three signals, they are split with 30 seconds green and 30 seconds red. If you drive at the speed limit, it takes you 10 seconds to go from the first to the second signal, another 10 seconds to go to the third signal. So how would you time them? Well, it seems easy, set the second signal to start green 10 seconds after the first signal, and the third signal to start green 20 seconds after the second signal. The problem is this only works in one direction! Imagine, now, you want to go in the opposite direction using these timings. If you pass signal 3 when it first shows green, signal 2 will already have been showing green for 10 seconds (20 seconds of green left), and signal 1 will already have been showing green for 20 seconds (only 10 seconds left). Since it takes you 20 seconds to reach signal 1 from signal 3, it's easy to see that someone going in the opposite direction is going to have to stop. Add in cross streets and you've got yourself even more priorities to juggle! </p>
<p><a href="http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/-/media/Travelandtransport/Roadandtrafficinfo/Traffic-Signals-Information/Figure3.JPG?w=650&amp;h=430&amp;as=1&amp;la=en&amp;hash=8C38C03F431B6B03CBF231DB963781581CBCC1E1" target="_blank">Here's an image I found on Google to illustrate this</a>. In this figure, the green arrows represent the &quot;greenband&quot; (the &quot;window&quot; where arriving vehicles will get green along the whole corridor) for the major direction, and the signal timing is plotted out as horizontal bars. You can see that the opposite direction's &quot;greenband&quot; shown in blue arrows is not as wide, and many vehicles will stop at one of the three lights. </p>
<p>The reality is, transportation systems are designed to minimize the total system delay, which means spreading the delay around such that the total (volume*delay time) is minimized. This means that not-so-busy directions will see red more often, and you may see red at cross streets. Roads where both directions are busy are also really hard to time. Vehicle tracking technologies and things like this are used to adapt the signal timing so that less people have to stop. Usually most cities will time their signals a few times a year based on volume demands, and they may have special timing plans for bad weather (which changes how fast people drive) and special events that add extra demand on certain streets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be poor planning by the city or you could simply be travelling on a less important road than the cross streets whose lights you are getting stopped at.</p>
<p>An example.
I work for an engineering firm that includes highway/street planning and construction division. The highway dept starts 2 desks away from mine. Our office is located next to a very busy city street/limited access highway intersection.</p>
<p>The traffic coming out of my office park and onto the city street is usually crappy and the lights cycle in VERY short cycles. Cars pile up into the office park and citizens are constantly complaining to the city. My company did the design on the intersection when it was upgraded about 3 years ago. The city has asked us to do a traffic study to determine if the street traffic can be reduced or wait times in the intersections reduced.</p>
<p>I was discussing all this with a coworker at lunch just the other day. I asked why the lights were on such short cycle and what could they do about it. The problem as he explained to me was not the city streets but the highway. Because the highway has much higher speeds the potential for deadly crashes is much higher if the exit ramp backs up onto the highway so the timing of the lights is designed to not let the exit ramp fill up. All the other surrounding streets are less important than making sure there are no stopped cars sitting on the highway to get rear ended.</p>
<p>TL:DR maybe your road isn't as important as the other roads</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was talking with my buddy about CO2 emissions and got on the subject of natural sources. Volcanoes and forest fires and such. Then it proceeded in to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_oil_fires" target="_blank">Kuwaiti oil fires</a>, so I googled it.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The total amount of oil burned is generally estimated at about one billion barrels. Daily global oil consumption in 2015 is about 91.4 million barrels;the oil lost to combustion would last 11 days at modern usage rates.&quot;</em></p>
<p>So I assume that this would cause a spike in the atmospheric CO2, but when I look up charts, I don't see a spike? What's the best most accurate chart? I'd assume something like the NOAA would be up there. When I look up others, like <a href="https://www.co2.earth/co2-acceleration" target="_blank">CO2.Earth</a>, there's actually a big drop in emissions around that time. </p>
<p>I'm not a data guru, maybe I'm missing or misinterpreting the data. Can someone maybe shed some light on this? </p>
<p>Update: The idea before this was answered was, with all that extra CO2 belching into the atmo with little effect, is CO2 really that bad if the Kuwait fires aren't causing a huge spike. And I didn't like this, yet if it was the case and what my conclusions drew to, then I guess I'd accept it until someone taught me better. But thanks to thanks to /u/CrustalTrudger, for cranking out some math so my brain could understand and see the big picture and 180ed the train of thought that was heading down a track that I disagreed with. Now I'm thinking, if all the oil being burned barely made a dent in overall CO2 emissions, man, we humans pollute <a href="http://thewritepractice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Alot-vs-a-lot1-600x450.png" target="_blank">alot!</a></p>

They didn't all start at once and were not all put out at once, but from the link you posted, the peak of oil fires was late February 1991 and concerted efforts to put them out started in April 1991 and the last one was put out in November 1991. Even if they only burned from February to April, you have the equivalent of 11 days of CO2 combustion spread out over 3 months (when in reality it's spread out over longer), so there's really no reason to expect to see much of a spike.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your premise includes a false assumption: You're conflating pollution from an oil fire with CO2 being released into the atmosphere. </p>
<p>This idea may be easier to understand with wood, if you have any experience with fireplaces or camping fires. When you get a good, hot fire going there is relatively little smoke and virtually nothing left of the wood. When your fire is not burning efficiently then there is relatively thick smoke (and big husks of charcoal left over that didn't get hot enough to burn). That thick smoke contains carbon from the wood and it collects elsewhere as soot. If you monitor the CO2 around a &quot;clean&quot; burning fire compared to a &quot;smoky&quot; fire you'll find the fire that appears dirty is actually producing significantly less CO2, even as your sensors would collect ash and soot from the poor combustion.</p>
<p>Which leads us to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daily global oil consumption in 2015 is about 91.4 million barrels;the oil lost to combustion would last 11 days at modern usage rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...if it were refined and very nearly 100% of it burned, leading the carbon in the oil into atmospheric CO2. That isn't even remotely what happened in those oil fires. All of that thick black smoke contained unoxidized carbon. To be clear, that is some very nasty pollution, but burning a billion barrels of oil in open fields will generate far, far less CO2 than if it were burned as fuel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Go to <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/graph.html" target="_blank">https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/graph.html</a>, click on the <em>Interactive Plots</em> tab and scroll down to the first chart, labelled <em>Mauna Loa Monthly Averages</em>. Zoom into the region at the beginning of 1991. If you hover your mouse over the chart, it will tell you which data point matches which month.</p>
<p>Look at the blue line, which filters out the seasonal fluctuations. Notice that little peak in April 1991. That's your spike.</p>
<p>Why isn't the spike more pronounced? There's a lot of smoothing going on. The gases will be thoroughly mixed by the time they reach Mauna Loa – that's why we measure the gases there – and the mixing is temporal as well as spatial. Not all of the CO2 release in Kuwait in early 1991 would be detected at Mauna Loa in 1991. There are lots of other places where the CO2 can go!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Union flag is made up of three crosses:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.flags.net/images/largeflags/UNKG0100.GIF" target="_blank">cross of St George, representing England</a>, is a red cross on a white (representing silver) background;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://flagspot.net/images/i/ie-stpat.gif" target="_blank">cross of St Patrick, representing Ireland</a>, is a red saltire on a white background;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.greensofgloucestershire.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/c/scotland-sky-st-andrews-cross-53-eyelets_1.png" target="_blank">cross of St Andrew, representing Scotland</a>, is a white saltire on a blue background.</li>
</ul>
<p>The white in all of these flags is known in heraldry as &quot;argent&quot;, meaning &quot;silver&quot;, and is one of the two &quot;metals&quot;, the other being &quot;or&quot; (&quot;gold&quot;) which is represented as yellow; the red and blue (or &quot;gules&quot; and &quot;azure&quot;) are &quot;colours&quot;. One of the rules in heraldry is that you can't put a metal on another metal, or a colour on another colour. This already causes a problem if you try to put the cross of St George on the blue background of the cross of St Andrew, because then you'd get gules (a colour) on azure (another colour), which isn't allowed. To avoid that, the red cross is &quot;fimbriated argent&quot;, meaning it's given a white outline.</p>
<p>The original Union Flag (or Union Jack -- it's a myth, apparently, that you can only call it the &quot;Union Jack&quot; if it's flying from the jack mast of a ship) was created when England and Scotland were united as Great Britain, and so only had the crosses of St George and St Andrew: it looked <a href="https://www.awesomestories.com/images/user/915520df7d.gif" target="_blank">like this</a>.</p>
<p>Later, Ireland entered into a union with Great Britain, and it was represented by the cross of St Patrick. But if you put the cross of St Patrick and the cross of St Andrew on top of each other, all you see is whichever cross is on top -- you don't see the one below.</p>
<p>So to depict both crosses, they were <em>quartered</em> and <em>counterchanged</em>: they were split so that each &quot;arm&quot; of the &quot;X&quot; showed half argent (St Andrew) and half gules (St Patrick). And then the quartered saltire was fimbriated argent to avoid the &quot;colour on colour&quot; problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f528d63c33ec28dd8bd0cab4a852ee4f?convert_to_webp=true" target="_blank">This is what you see if you take away the cross of St George</a>. The &quot;red lines&quot; aren't continuous, but they meet at a point. The narrow white strips are the fimbriation; the wider white strips are what is visible of the cross of St Andrew.</p>
<p><a href="http://m.eet.com/media/1175608/union-jack-03.gif" target="_blank">This diagram will help you to understand the counterchanging and fimbriation</a>: for the purposes of illustration, the crosses are fimbriated or.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because then one set of 'lines' would be superior to another.
The UK flag is a combination of three different flags.<br />
The Flag of Scotland: Blue with a White 'X'<br />
The St. Patrick's Cross: White with a Red 'X'<br />
The St. George's Cross: White with a Red '+'<br />
If you combine these three you get the UK flag. However flags are  also symbols of heraldry, which means that there are rules for how these things can be combined. In the case of the UK flag the Scottish flag and st Patrick's cross are 'quartered per saltire' and 'countercharged' which is a fancy way of saying that in each of the four triangular areas formed (quartered per saltrie) that the forground and background colors are reversed (countercharged). This makes it so that the flag of Scotland isn't 'superior' to St. Patrick's cross (or vice versa).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually no documented reason other than &quot;that's what the specifications say&quot;.</p>
<p>The flag was invented when the United Kingdom was formed in 1801, by combining the crosses of St George (patron saint of England), St Andrew (patron saint of Scotland) and St Patrick (patron saint of Ireland). As <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Flags_of_the_Union_Jack.png" target="_blank">this diagram shows</a>.</p>
<p>The exact text of how to combine the crosses is full of obscure vexilogical terms, and reads: <em>&quot;the Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter charged argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].&quot;</em></p>
<p>Translated into diagramatical form, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/United_Kingdom_Flag_Specifications.svg" target="_blank">it means this</a> -- so as you can see, it's designed that the cross of St Patrick is offcentred.</p>
<p>One advantage this provides (although probably not the original intention of the flag's designers) is that you can fly the UK flag upside-down. It's subtle, but there is a definite difference. In the British military an upside-down Union Flag is used as a secret distress signal (e.g. when a ship is being boarded by enemies), because it was believed that the enemy probably wouldn't notice the upside-down flag, but any British ships in the vicinity certainly would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the most mysterious things about the Orangutan.  We really don't know much.  The Orangutan is of the slowest maturing mammals - 7 to 10 years to reach reproduction age for males, and about 5 years for females - however, most male Orangutans don't mate before about 15 years of age.  Our knowledge on when the flanges start developing is unknown.  Our understanding is they start growing once its convenient for them socially.  Once the development starts, it will take about a year for the flange to fully grow in.  This flange also comes with muscles around the throat, longer hair, and a musty odor.  Once one male develops his flanges, it is unknown why other males suppress their flange development.  It is unknown how this suppression takes place, but we speculate that it might be through hormones.  There have also been studies that show that the presence of a fully flanged male does inhibit the growth of other Orangutans' flanges, but not indefinitely.  There are some scientists who believe that instead of hormones suppressing the growth of the flanges, it could be stress.  The testosterone levels of both flanged and non-flanged orangutans are the same so that crosses the thought that testosterone could cause it.  <strong>BUT</strong>!!!  There is one difference.  And that is the level of oestrogen in the urine of flanged males which breed; it is significantly lower than those who don't.  Some believe that flanged males who are aggressive to other flanged males create social stress, in turn causing the less dominant flanged males to produce oestrogen and be turned away from mating.</p>
<p><em>TL:DR - No one really knows anything about the weird mystery that is the flange</em></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I kinda went off on a tangent about Orangutans.  I get excited.  They develop them once their body starts maturing and they start becoming of age for reproduction.  But that can take anywhere between 7-15 years.  It takes about a year to fully develop.  Scary big flanged Orangutans usually suppress other orangutans into not growing flanges.  Even bigger scarier flanged Orangutans supress big scary flanged orangutans into not mating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your flanges will grow when it's the right time for you, not all orangutans develop at the same speed and that's not a bad thing :) try not to let the other orangutans get you down bro, you'll be the jungle V.I.P soon enough</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took a primatology class in college and was told that there are two types of male orangs. The flanged males are big dominate guys and they will fight over females with other males to gain dominance and the right to mate. The unflanged males are sneaky bastards. They chose not to waste energy fighting other males for territory and instead they tend to sneak into flanged males dominated territories and rape females. While sad, it has been shown that rape is definitely part of orang society and some anthropologists have controversially used this behavior to try to prove that rape is actually a natural and normal occurrence in humans. Controversial stuff for sure!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
