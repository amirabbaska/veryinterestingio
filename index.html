Recent research suggests that humans are indeed still evolving, but modernization is affecting the way that natural selection and other mechanisms of evolution affect us today. Technology, medicine, demographic changes, and globalization all seem to be having an impact on our ongoing evolution. But our long-term fate as a species may depend on how we choose to utilize emerging technologies, like CRISPR gene editing or the ability to establish permanent colonies on other planets.</p>

I'm not really talking about removing genetic disease, but parents picking and choosing desirable traits for their children: making them stronger, better looking, smarter etc. Do you think it could potentially create an even greater disparity between the rich and poor? Richer parents being able to afford to give their children far better traits than the poor for example. Or is this unlikely? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier#Internal_circuitry_of_741-type_op-amp" target="_blank">schematic for an operational amplifier</a>, you'll see that it's actually a bunch of transistors (among other things).</p>
<p>That's why they come in little <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/experiment/lab/expt6/oa.gif" target="_blank">integrated circuits</a>.</p>
<p>So to understand the inner workings of the device all the way from the fundamental motion of charge carriers, there are sort of two steps: you have to understand how transistors work on a microscopic level, and then at the circuit level you have to understand how all these transistors combine in the schematic above in order to achieve the function of an operational amplifier.</p>
<p>I'm assuming since you're asking the question, you are studying (or at least interested in studying) electronics. So are you familiar with how transistors work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OPAMPS are first of all designed based on a schematic. So at first we choose a specific circuit of either BJTs or MOSFETs that will behave the way we would want them to. In case of MOSFETs for example, we'll decide what kind of gate length and widths we need. Then depending on the performance requirements we decide if we need specific materials or other designs. Some OPAMPs are there to push the limits of what is possible and others are just supposed to be cheap.
Finally, when we know the schematic, the people of Integrated Circuit Design will figure out a layout on a chip but the layout doesn't only look at what doped regions, doping levels and transistor designs etc. They also look at whether it is possible to construct cheaply or efficiently with the production steps they have available in their factory. </p>
<p>I don't think it will be possible to provide you with an entire design of P and N regions but at the operational level, OPAMPs are designed on a lumbed element level first where the insight on their inner functioning is much more insightful then when you would try to understand it at a doping level completely. </p>
<p>If you need more information on the inner mechanics it would be easier to first know if you know how transistors work in P and N regions and if you know how an OPAMP works in a circuit schematic design. </p>
<p>Could you elaborate on your understanding on those fronts before I'll go in depth on concepts like current mirrors, current sources, differential pair gain stages, Miller capacitors etc? You might already know that. But that is unclear in  the way you phrase your question. </p>
<p>If you understand what you see in the images below (or not), we could help better. Maybe not me but others. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well recently -  Panama Papers investigation has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting.</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/04/where-are-they-now-mixed-fortunes-post-panama-papers" target="_blank">article</a> - Written on April 3rd</p>
<p>When the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and more than 100 media partners began publishing the Panama Papers investigation on April 3, 2016, almost no country was untouched by its revelations.</p>
<p>Governments in more than 70 countries have launched over 150 investigations, inquiries, audits and probes into the affairs of thousands of people and corporations linked to Panama Papers. Just last month, Malta’s tax office announced it had recovered more than $10 million as a result of investigations sparked by the Panama Papers and another ICIJ project, Swiss Leaks.</p>
<p>One year after the Panama Papers first became an international catchphrase, here’s a globe-hopping update on the people and institutions caught up in the scandal:</p>
<p><strong>The law firm and the eponymous jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>In March, Mossack Fonseca, the Panama-headquartered law firm at the center of the Panama Papers affair, announced that it had been forced to dismiss 250 employees from its offices worldwide due to the “current media, political and economic environment.”</p>
<p>Authorities in Panama have detained Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca, the firm’s founders, since Feb. 9 on money laundering charges.</p>
<p>The men’s lawyer, Guillermina McDonald, denies her clients are guilty of wrongdoing and has accused Panama’s government of “selective justice” in its investigation of Mossack and Fonseca.</p>
<p>Last month, a Panamanian prosecutor held a press conference to update the public on the investigation into Mossack Fonseca, and claimed to have a “solid case” against the firm. Mossack Fonseca’s lawyers denied the government’s accusations and called for the men’s release.</p>
<p><strong>Iceland votes, but what has changed?</strong></p>
<p>Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, who resigned as prime minister two days after the Panama Papers story first broke, remains a member of parliament.</p>
<p>Gunnlaugsson, who was forced to step down because of reports linking him and his wife to an offshore company, maintains an active Facebook profile, posting about Icelandic banking, new hospitals and the delights of raw meat on crackers.</p>
<p>When his replacement, Bjarni Benediktsson, took over as Iceland’s new prime minister in January 2017, critics noted that his name, too, had been included in the Panama Papers. Benediktsson used an offshore company to hold four apartments in Dubai, he said in response to the Panama Papers revelations.</p>
<p><strong>Can’t stop the music in Russia</strong></p>
<p>Sergei Roldugin, a classical musician and close friend of President Vladimir Putin, has played on even in the wake of Panama Papers documents that place him inside a circle of Putin friends who used offshore companies and bank account to secretly move some $2 billion around the world. Roldugin played the cello at a concert in Palmyra, Syria, in May 2016, one month after Panama Papers reports about him made global headlines.</p>
<p>Later in 2016, Putin gave the cellist and conductor a national award to recognize his contribution as an “outstanding citizen.” In February 2017, Russian media reported that the government had granted a tax exemption to an education foundation established by Roldugin in the city of Sochi.</p>
<p><strong>Fallout differs in Pakistan and India</strong></p>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been under pressure for a year in the face the Panama Papers’ revelations that his children owned shell companies that held homes in London.</p>
<p>In September, thousands of protesters swelled Islamabad’s streets to call for Sharif’s resignation. Opposition parties have been attacking him in court, alleging that Sharif failed to declare his family’s offshore connections. Sharif and members of his family deny wrongdoing. A decision in the case by Pakistan’s Supreme Court is expected any day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the border in India, focus has been fixed on the efforts of the multi-agency taskforce created to investigate India’s black cash scandals: just last month, regulators announced that their probe has expanded to 424 Indian clients of Mossack Fonseca.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainty reigns in U.S. political upheavals</strong></p>
<p>With Donald Trump in the White House, it’s unclear what will happen with Panama Papers-related investigations started during the Obama administration by the Senate Finance Committee and by the office the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan.</p>
<p>In March, Trump fired Preet Bharara, long-time U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, raising concerns about whether aggressive investigations by the office would be stymied. The Senate committee did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for information on the status of the investigations while the Department of Justice refused to comment.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr - Still a lot of investigation is going on even though the process is slow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>People checking on the bad people win a prize for their hard work.</p>
<p>The bad people's company fired a lot of their people because everyone was looking at them and doing bad things that make money became hard to do.</p>
<p>The most important person, like the president, in a country called Iceland lost his job, but was given another big important job anyway. The person who got his job was also doing bad things, so many people wonder if more change should happen.</p>
<p>A big musician in Russia who is friends with the president-guy of Russia was caught with lots and lots and lots of bad money he probably shouldn't have. The president forgave his friend, which makes people look at the Russia president guy and wonder why.</p>
<p>Other countries, called Pakistan and India, have a lot of people running around and shouting for people to lose their jobs, because they also had bad money. Also, in our own country, the USA, a lot of changes (like the new president) have been going on, so no one really knows what is going on just yet. But some people who are supposed to look into the bad money were fired, so it's a good guess that less people will get in trouble.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Mossack Fonseca wasn't some tiny firm hideaway. They were a global player with a decent reputation. So showing up their radar isn't the smoke people think it is. </p>

<p>The most useful aspect of it is verifying client information since a lot of bank due diligence relies on the customer. You can see connections you wouldn't have otherwise been aware of and can follow up to measure your risk. </p>
<p>Considering the massive scope of the leak, it's surprising there isn't more out there. It doesn't really fit the narrative the icij puts out there. </p>
<p>Edit: don't get me wrong. This exposed a lot of actual mechanisms for how peps and individuals hide their wealth for various means, but nothing here is really new except for the few headlines and specific people involved A lot of people doing things legally have a lot of their private info out there now. Being rich isn't a crime yet, and I think people forget that. </p>
<p>Edit2: Some people seem to think that there's one guy in a room somewhere going through all of these docs and hasn't found the big prize yet. A lot of thy data can be checked with analytics and cross referenced. Not to mention anyone can and likely has searched all know PEPS celebrities and powerful names. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see you talk about engineers in ontario and so I am going to go ahead and assume you are an engineer.  This means certain things that we should understand.  First it means that in a professional capacity you are not a gambler.  You want things to tick along with mechanical precision, regularity and reliability.</p>
<p>You need to appreciate however that this is a bias on your part and is just one option among many.  You like things to be orderly, but they don't necessarily have to be.  </p>
<p>Which brings us to freedom of expression.  There is not some kind of formulaic rule that says &quot;Free Expression + regulation that is equal to or less than X = Good social outcome&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead freedom of expression is a gamble.  At the time of its founding america was called &quot;the grand experiment&quot;.  This was specifically because of things like free expression being a wager.</p>
<p>So, what's the bet?  The bet is that if we get a large group of people together, let them say whatever the hell they want to (including lie and deliberately try to trick each other), that good information will tend to rise above the lies and society will tend to operate more efficiently than if expression is restricted.</p>
<p>And it turns out we won that bet big time.  It turns out (luckily) that generally speaking people prefer the truth and smart people make better arguments when supported by the truth than they make when trying to lie to the degree that it is in fact very difficult to get away with a lie in an open debate (you ever see people being called out brutally on reddit for lying?).</p>
<p>Now, like anything else we did discover that there were some... exceptions... that needed to be made.  It turns out letting people threaten to murder other people isn't good.  it turns out letting people incite violence isn't good.  It turns out allowing people to commit fraud isn't good.  But just because there are some exceptions doesn't mean we can get away from the fundamental wager and try to simply prohibit &quot;bad&quot; expression.</p>
<p>It isn't neat.  It isn't formulaic.  It isn't guaranteed and reliable.  But not only does it tend to work out, we see again and again that the alternative universally results in societies jumping off a cliff straight to hell (look at Russia).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stalinism doesn't exist. It's basically a slur for anyone who loves Stalin. But usually it references the tendency of Marxist-Leninism.</p>
<p>Before showing what the difference between Marxist-Leninism, Trotskyists, and Maoism (short for Marxist-Leninist-Maoism) you must know what Marxism is.</p>
<p>Marxism is a body of analysis and critique of capitalism. It forms the basis of the worldview of communists and it is the utter rejection of liberalism. Marxism is considered by communists to be a science in that it is a constantly developing theory shaped by a cycle of making theory, practicing it (applying it to the real world), and then changing the theory to accommodate for what works and what doesn't. Marxism also assumes the world to be ever changing so it develops as the world evolves. </p>
<p>Marxist-Leninism is considered to be a major scientific advancement of Marxism and also differs from Marxism in that it isn't solely analysis and critique, but also a description of how revolution should occur, how we organize the workers, how society should look like, and how to continue combating capitalism and liberal ideology after revolution. Some of the major advancements include:</p>
<p>-<strong>Analysis of imperialism</strong>, how rich Western countries maintain overall high living standards, wealth, and decadence by exploiting the Global South (what some people today would call world systems theory, neoliberalism, or 'globalism').<br />
-<strong>The vanguard party</strong>, posits that the revolution must be organized in order to be successful. The most devoted workers form what is called a vanguard party which acts as the central leadership in revolution, and after revolution becomes the government.<br />
-Indepth analysis of the state and how it can be a tool of oppression depending on which class controls it.<br />
-Posits and proves that revolution is more likely and more successful in developing and more exploited Global South countries.<br />
-<strong>The Peasantry is Revolutionary</strong>, it is recognized that the peasantry is also an oppressed class with similar interests to industrial workers. In agrarian societies like Tsarist Russia, uniting the proletariat and peasantry is necessary for successful revolution.<br />
-Creates the idea of <strong>Left wing nationalism</strong> as a nationalism for oppressed people/nations that is compatible with communist internationalism.<br />
-<strong>Socialism In One Country</strong>, the strategy of a socialist state after revolution should be to rebuild and fortify itself against possible counter revolution or invasion/coup/embargo by the West, rather than take an immediate active stance in exporting revolution to other countries.</p>
<p>Trotskyism is in opposition to Marxist-Leninism. Leon Trotsky, Bolshevik revolutionary, believed the Soviet Union was abandoning internationalism and was also losing touch with its workers, so he created a new theory that is based on Marxism, is similar to Marxist-Leninism, but rejects some of the advancements and contributes new analysis of its own. Some of these things were:  </p>
<p>-Rejection of Socialism In One Country for <strong>Permanent Revolution</strong>, a socialist state after revolution must immediately devote as many military and economic resources as possible to exporting revolution to the entire world, so as to subvert capitalism as fast as possible.<br />
-Posits the <strong>Degenerated Worker's state theory</strong> which says that the USSR was becoming 'degenerated' or slowly giving way to a new bureaucratic class with interests of its own to the detriment of the workers.<br />
-<strong>United Front and Antifa</strong>, Trotsky was the first person to recognize that fascism was not only worse than liberalism but the greatest threat to communism ever faced. He believed that communists should do whatever it takes to combat fascism, including fighting on the streets AND temporarily siding with liberals (United Front). This is also Trotsky's most important contribution, so important that all tendencies of communism from anarchism to Maoism have accepted it and implemented it.</p>
<p>Maoism, short for Marxist-Leninist-Maoism​, is a scientific advancement of Marxist-Leninism as the name suggests. Currently it is the most popular communist tendency in the world, especially in the Global South. Maoism is not as a big jump from Marxist-Leninism as Marxist-Leninism was from Marxism. Here are a list of some of its advancements:</p>
<p>-<strong>Protracted Peoples War</strong>, strategy for revolution which says that the best way to win is to use guerilla warfare and make the war last as long as possible so as to outlast the state and bleed out Western support.<br />
-<strong>The Mass Line</strong>, the best keep the Communist party in tune with the people by taking the unorganized ideas and aspirations of the people and forge policy out of it.<br />
-<strong>Theory of Social Imperialism</strong>, in many ways this is similar to Trotsky's Degenerated Workers State theory but Social Imperialism theory is considered more accurate, developed, and comprehensive. It posits that the USSR succumbed to revisionism (which is the unscientific rewriting of Marxism) and started engaging in imperialism, an act previously thought to be exclusive to capitalism. Many also conclude from this theory that the USSR was no longer socialist after Khrushchev took power.<br />
-<strong>Cultural Revolution</strong>, Mao recognized that a threat to communism would not just come from the outside but also from the inside in the form of revisionism, and if nothing was done to stop it then it would slowly deteriorate and destroy socialism. Cultural Revolution is a method of stopping revisionism by actively finding and removing members of the party and the state who pretend to be communist and do not believe or care about workers liberation, and to continue the fire of revolutionary fervor in the population by having the people take an active effort in fighting dated or oppressive cultural traditions, and destroying positive symbols of the capitalist past.<br />
-<strong>&quot;Class struggle only intensifies under socialism&quot;</strong>, a new understanding of socialism that reinforces the importance of taking defense very seriously and actively. It is said that class struggle intensifies under socialism because instead of strikes, riots, and insurrection, there is now proxy wars, coups, spies, covert warfare, and more. The capitalist class will do whatever it takes to hold power, and so will the workers, resulting in intensified struggle on a global scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's probably a lot of tedious differences that the nice folks at /r/socialism will be happy to explain to you in way too much detail but the main differences are these:</p>
<p>Trotskyism: Trotsky believed that the only way to achieve long-lasting communist utopia was to ignite a &quot;global revolution&quot; where capitalism worldwide is overthrown and replaced with a single communist society. This is contrasted with...</p>
<p>Stalinism: which believes in &quot;socialism in one country&quot;, i.e. the USSR could survive as a single communist entity and still compete with the capitalist world. Stalinism is also what you think of when you think of the stereotypical USSR: purging political dissidents, rapid, centrally-planned industrialization, and collectivized resources.</p>
<p>Maoism: Maoism was Mao's take on socialist revolution as applied to the socio-political climate of china at the time. Mao believed that the peasant class, as opposed to the worker class in Russia, was the key class of a socialist revolution in China, and his policies were mainly geared towards (in theory) improving the lives of peasants through policies like teaching all of the peasants how to forge iron and having them keep small-scale forges on their property or teaching them to exterminate pests to increase their crop yields. These policies would turn out to massively backfire but that's neither here nor there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is by no means a comprehensive answer but Stalinism is usually identified with Socialism-In-One-Country (as opposed to international workers' revolution) and totalitarianism. Maoism assumes an agrarian peasantry instead of urban proletariat and calls for a mass peasants' uprising instead of an ivory tower vanguard party. It also considers cultural revolutions necessary, since it does not promise socialism will sweep away capitalism quickly at all, and expects to fight ideological battles domestically (possibly forever)
Trotsky is tougher, he means different things to different people. He rejected the idea of socialism in one country and insisted it was global or nothing. He took an active part in the revolution (which he would have understood to necessarily include the executions of civilian capitalists) but later on developed a reputation as less fanatical and/or violent than other communists- possibly because he opposed Stalin and flirted with anarchists. If you hear the word &quot;trotskyism&quot; IRL though it's probably uttered by a leftist referring to wimpy pseudo-communists who don't read the books and think of communism as &quot;super-super-liberalism.&quot; Such people are usually drawn to Trotsky because he's more palatable to liberals.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stalin and Trotsky were both proletariat communists. Mao was an agrarian communist. In more simple words Stalin and Trotsky believed in the workers struggle (more in line with Marx though Marx thought it would happen in industrial nations). Mao believed in the farmers struggle.  </p>
<p>Stalin believed in communism in the nation. Stalin wanted to strengthen the USSR rather than expand the revolution. I also believe Stalin wanted to get rid of the SFSR Russia and SSRs in the USSR. Rather than a federal nation have a one nation policy similar to the former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Stalin was more to the right (in the bolsheviks so still very far to the left).  </p>
<p>Trotsky was a military commander and wanted a global revolution, the USSR should invade the other Bourgeois nations and make them good SSRs. His view on this is similar to the French President and Emperor Napoleon I. Trotsky was to the left in the Bolsheviks. Trotsky was also the legitimate successor to Lenin as leader but a conspiracy led by Stalin robbed him of this.  </p>
<p>Mao didn't believe in the workers struggle but the farmers and focused his revolution on this. If you look at a GDP chart in china you can see the industrial revolution comes much later than the communist revolution. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have high functioning autism and while I don't do the hand flapping thing, I will on rare occasions drum my fingers. I don't do it often enough or in rigid enough contexts to consider it a full blown stim, but I do find myself doing the motion in mid-air when I'm trying to remember something during conversations. I usually drum my fingers against something when I'm extremely stressed or trying to find a solution to a problem or scenario.</p>
<p>Like a majority of people with autism I have Sensory Processing Disorder, sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity. It dials my senses up to eleven and my brain does not have the ability to tune out portions of my environment or any surrounding stimulus, everything is processed at roughly the same level and understandably can be very overwhelming. It takes a lot of focus to be able to 'tune in' to certain things; in my case spoken words if there are multiple sources of background noise, but it can be almost anything you would try to process/learn. Visuals, smells, questions on a test, etc.</p>
<p>Stims are self stimulating behaviors that sort of comfort and calm the person doing them. In the cases in which I'm drumming my fingers I can very clearly feel the interior movements of my fingers joints and how that interior motion is unbelievably smooth within the joint itself. Combine that with hearing the clicking of my nails and the vibrations feeding into my fingers as they connect with whatever surface I'm tapping on, and the tiny twinges of the ligaments and muscles after I've done it for an extended period of time... It's incredibly pleasant to process. Also if you can't glean from my description it's a distracting and strong sensation, enough to distract me from all of the extra outside stimulus the average person is able to automatically filter out. You could almost consider it a form of mediation, at least in my case (remember, this disorder is a spectrum, so experiences can vary wildly) since it can calm me down when I'm under a lot of pressure but it also allows me to focus significantly better when needed.</p>
<p>I hope that helps, I'm happy to try and answer more questions or elaborate further if needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a common physical tick that feels good and relieves stress. Another common tick is spinning or running in circles, as well as rocking and turning their heads. Doctors sometimes call these behaviors &quot;stimming&quot; and it is commonly believed that autists are more sensitive to physical stimulation than most people. This also is thought to be a reason why they can be extremely averse to touch, and are hypersensitive to seams or scratchy fabrics in clothing. This is the general reason why people with autism tend to have so many physical ticks, but why hand flapping specifically is so common isn't well understood.</p>
<p>One theory is that since they are so prone to physical sensation, and since our hands are incredibly sensitive, hand flapping is akin to yelling for people who tend to communicate with their hands/gestures. This would explain why hand flapping so often accompanies laughter, anger, or just excitement in general. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's mainly in puritan societies that are heavily influenced by religious entities. In many European movies nudity is not such a taboo. </p>
<p>Violence is a reflection of a society that's focused on war and guns, where physical strength is important to subdue &quot;enemies&quot;.</p>
<p>Since the US has a huge influence over global entertainment you end up with a skewed view.</p>
<p>Go check French movies and Brazilian TV. Nudity is not a big deal there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying this is an acceptable or reasonable argument, but in general it seems to be based around the fear of imitation.</p>
<p>While some violence can be imitated, most of what we see in films really can't. Your kid isn't gonna be able to fire off a missile or get in a sword fight or fire off a machine gun or stuff like that unless you're a <strong>really</strong> bad parent. But a kid with some free time and a friend of the opposite (or same in some cases) sex and some curiosity? That can go places.</p>
<p>Combine this with a heavily lobbied focus on abstinence-only sex education (the argument generally being that teaching them how to be safe during sex &quot;encourages&quot; it) means that there's a paranoid fear of sex among more heavily conservative parents, which means they don't want their kids exposed to it at all under fear of them doing it. And that fear can tie back into the heavily puritan roots of the founding of the USA, which focuses a lot on the &quot;original sin&quot; of man being sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of a deep rooted mentality in America of Sex being Taboo or something not to be talked about. This first cane out of Puritan ideology during early America and rose again during the late 1800s and 1900s.
This conservative nature can be seen in portrayal of the Gibson girl vs the &quot;Flapper&quot; where freedom of expression (of ones body) was shunned and so on...</p>
<p>We've became more liberal as a society as time goes on but sexuality and nudity still is a big NO because of this old way of thinking. </p>
<p>It's funny because this wave of puritan Ideology with began England long ago never really rose back up like it did in America. Moreover, Europeans have a great understanding of Nudity used in Art as they have been subject to it in their history and culture unlike Americans. Just look at the statues and paintings around old Europe and then look at the younger but still older American paintings... you will see a variation in the amount of clothing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming by caveman you mean early humans (homo sapiens sapiens), the answer is stone tools. Humans have had stone tools since before we became 'humans' - i.e. since about a million years ago (and some are argued to be over 3million years old). </p>
<p>Stone tools were the standard item for cutting and trimming - including nails and hair. Despite popular imagination of them as just rocks they were highly crafted and sophisticated tools, carefully shaped for purpose. We can see this behaviour described in the historical record when different cultures meet. People did also of course wear/break nails through daily use and tie their hair back, both of which happen today. Some cultures used animal fat in their hair as a kind of grease to hold it back or make it stick up and make them look bigger. </p>
<p>Medieval people used scissors for hair but the scissors that existed were too big for nails. They did it the same way Romans did - with small knives (think paring knives rather than daggers). </p>

<p>Enceladus is much smaller than Earth and therefore has far weaker gravity, which would correlate with smaller pressure at a given altitude. However, its ocean seems to occupy a larger percentage of the planet's volume compared to Earth's, in addition to being buried under a thick sheet of ice.</p>
<p>Given Enceladus' size, gravity, and nature of it's sub-surface ocean, what would its water pressure ranges be? Could a human swim in it without a pressure suit? Could a submarine reach any depth?</p>
<p>Bonus question is to estimate the temperature range of the ocean. Since it's liquid, it'd have to be above zero celsius unless it's highly saline. Is there expected geothermal or tidal friction heating? How warm would it be purely from solar exposure, or radiation coming from Saturn?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can calculate this with the equation:</p>
<p>pressure=density <em> force of gravity </em> height. </p>
<p>This gives you the pressure of the fluid column above you, but this works pretty well for very large amounts of solids. We are assuming that gravity doesn't change much over that distance, I suspect it might since Enceladus is so small. Wikipedia says that Enceladus has 30-40 km of ice and has a surface gravity of . Pushing this all through <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=30+km+*1%25+earth+gravity*density+ice" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a> gives a &quot;sea level&quot; pressure of 3.11-4.15 Megapascals. This is equivalent to being 320-420m(1000-1300 ft) underwater on Earth. That's about as far as any SCUBA diver has ever gone, but it has been done. The world record took 12 minutes to descend, but 14 hours decompressing on the way up. Deeper dives can be made, but you start needing a rigid pressure suit. It's also close to the pressure limit for military style submarines made of steel, but titanium submarines have gone to 10 MPa. Submersibles made for extreme deep sea diving definitely could. </p>
<p>The temperature is unknown but depending on how much ammonia is mixed in, it's anywhere from somewhere above a brisk -3 C that you could dip in for a minute or two without dying, or a -103 C ammonia water slurry. What we do know is that it is <em>deep</em>. 20-30 km(18 miles) deep. That's three and a half Marianas Trenches or Mount Everests. The water pressure down there (again, assuming the equation holds) is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=40+km+*enceladus+gravity*density+ice%2B30+km+*enceladus+gravuty*density+water" target="_blank">about 7.5MPa</a>, within the limit of some submarines and diving hardsuits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things about the Earth's oceans: its main sources of energy are wind, the sun, tides and fish (funny, right?). Enceladus' ocean, if completely covered by ice, gets no energy directly from the sun or any kind of light, but must get massive forcings from ice movements above (equivalent to wind forcings here on Earth) and tides from Saturn's gravitational pull. Geothermal could be a large source of energy too, although so far we have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Now, we usually talk about sea pressure in pneumatic, or relative terms, meaning that we take pressure at the sea surface to be zero and then vertically integrate density times gravity to estimate pressure at any given depth. We do that because humans are &quot;tuned&quot; to live at sea level, or absolute pressure 1 atm = 1010 hPa, so we define that as zero to measure deviations from atmospheric pressure. However, estimating absolute pressure would require integrating the density of our entire atmosphere. </p>
<p>If you wanted to do the same for an ocean that's buried under miles of ice, then you would have to take into account the weight of all the ice above a given point. Glacial ice is about 0.92 times as dense as water, so being under 1 km of ice is equivalent to having 920 meters of water above you. We know very little about these oceans, and since gravity is not the same in Enceladus as it is on Earth, I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty confident that no human could swim there. Considering that ice sheets in Greenland are up to 4 km thick, glaciers in Enceladus must be huge everywhere, creating gargantuesque pressures.</p>
<p>Given the mass of Saturn, maybe it could create tides strong enough to drastically reduce bottom sea pressure, as it 'lifts' water and ice upwards. Also, vertical shear during these tides must be a really important source of turbulent kinetic energy and thus provide heat to these oceans. So that's the only way I think humans could, at least momentarily, exist in an ocean like that.</p>
<p>This is all a theoretical construction, and the reality might be different, but if we could make a cruise to explore these seas for the first time, that's what we would base our experiments on before knowing any better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I can weigh in on as I'm looking at Enceladus as part of my PhD. </p>
<p>Basically it depends on which model you use. Currently the thinking is that there is a localised subsurface ocean around the southern pole that probably forms a lens shape with the thick part of the lens  only 5-10km beneath the South Polar Terrain/Tiger Stripes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0063" target="_blank">1</a>. And the deepest part being 50-60km beneath the ice shell <a href="https://twitter.com/NatureAstronomy/status/849212317552259073/photo/1" target="_blank">So for visual purposes</a>.</p>
<p>Now depending on the densities and thicknesses you use for the ice and liquid and the rocky silicate core you will get various values.</p>
<p>With varying thicknesses the sea floor pressure will be anywhere between 28 and 45 bar or 2.8-4.5Mpa <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-015-9475-9" target="_blank">2</a>. . Which is equivalent to 250-450m below sea level on Earth. This pressure is entirely habitable by known barophiles (pressure loving organisms!) which have been known to survive up to 50Mpa and plenty of multicellular organisms live happily below that depth in our oceans (Hadal Snailfish have been found at 8145m!) </p>
<p>The Pressure within a porous silicate core is likely to only be around 30Mpa which seems pretty tame too<img src="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910351500250X" alt="3" />. </p>
<p>What we can say is that pressure isn't going to be a problem for biology under Enceladus type conditions.</p>
<p>Now yes this new evidence suggests that there is hydrothermal activity and geochemical energy available but to form multicellular organisms you need a fair bit more energy - which may be available but at the moment this is only a theory.</p>
<p>So for temperature this gets fairly complicated. The temperature will depend on: the heat source - which may be down to tidal heating from Enceladus' resonance orbits, or from a possibly warm core thats lasted since formation; The chemistry and thickness of the ocean/shell - If its a relatively low salinity NaCl-H2O system or whether there is ammonia involved; And finally the amount of heat that is being stored/lost.</p>
<p>Geochemical evidence from the plume suggests the ocean is warm. Silica nanoparticles have been found in the E ring <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/ering_cassini_big.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> which is maintained by Enceladus' activity. These nanoparticles can only form in alkaline high temperature environments 323K-373K (50C-90C/122-194F)<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7542/full/nature14262.html" target="_blank">4</a>  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9604" target="_blank">5</a>. Other evidence such as radiation around the tiger stripes shows that the temperature of the vent systems are 30K warmer than the surroundings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0063" target="_blank">1</a>.
Other simulations suggest the core could be anywhere from 20-150C <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514006459" target="_blank">6</a>.
The chemistry of the ocean matters too, if there are significant concentration of ammonia salts, the melting point may be depressed up to 16K at 0.1%wt NH3 so there may be liquid but it may be below freezing temperature of pure water.</p>
<p>The combination of geochemical and geophysical data points to the ocean being warm i.e. above the freezing point of pure water, whether its been warm for its entire history or whether this activity is recent is another question.</p>
<p>In important distinction should be made between habitable and inhabited. Maybe this ocean is habitable but uninhabited and therefore a pristine niche that could be invaded by Earth species.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, this is cool and maybe the idea of a Biosphere doesn't stop at the stratosphere, but extends to the outer reaches of the solar system!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Anyway this is a fascinating question. I'd want to posit the same one for Europa of Jupiter. </p>
<p>A few unknowns would make these calculations difficult. The amount of geothermal activity at the ocean floor, and the thickness and uniform distribution of ice above. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
