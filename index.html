You won't see the IR or UV levels when their relative intensity is less than the blue scatter background.  If you are unlucky enough to get a near IR laser in your eye you will see a red dot, but you would not see that frequency in the rainbow. </p>
<p>On the UV end you are more limited by what is absorbed by the rest of the eye,  but a sufficiently bright source could still be seen.  </p>
<p>The actually sensitivity of the rod and cone cells has been measured.

If it was green, it would have made a very bright spot that you couldn't directly look at, if you stuck an index card in the beam.  At 800nm, though, it would make a little red dot on the card.  What 'shade of red'?  Just plain old red, is how I would describe it. Not 'dark red' or 'maroon'.  The red you see when just the red sensors in you eye are stimulated. As you would tune it to 900nm, the hue would stay the same, but the spot would just get dimmer and dimmer. Even though the beam would burn a hole through your black tee-shirt if you weren't careful when bending over the table to adjust the optics.</p>

<p>So let's say you owe your credit card companies $25,623 and you don't really have any way of paying that back. You might file bankruptcy, and the credit card companies would get little or nothing. OR they could agree to take $5,000 and just give up on the rest. This is probably a better option than forcing you into bankruptcy, because $5,000 &gt; $0. </p>
<p>So these companies work with your credit card companies and other creditors to arrange a settlement. It usually looks like them paying $5,000 to the credit card company to wipe out the debt, and then you end up paying them $6,000 over time, so they make money too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey, one I can answer... worked for a bank for over a decade, used to do credit bureau disputes.</p>
<p>Depends on the quality of the company. And most of the time they’re misleading.</p>
<p>The bigger companies usually do settlements. That is, you owe say, 5k, and they get us to take 2k. That could be before or after your account is charged off.</p>
<p>What they aren’t advertising on the phone is that this is going to negatively impact your credit. Now, if they’ve already charged off the account as a loss, the hit isn’t going to be that bad. Gets reported as settled, paid after charge off. Not too bad. A prospective creditor will see you had some trouble, but paid on it after a charge off.</p>
<p>If the account has not charged off, and the bank settles, it gets reported as settled, then charged off. Which is a little worse. A prospective creditor will look at that as you basically saying ‘I can’t pay anymore, but here’s a little bit.’ These are rare. Most of the time, the creditor is going to wait for the person to charge off. Why? Because people would do this more often if they weren’t in trouble. Just call in and claim some emergency to get a lower payoff.</p>
<p>Any time we’re dealing with debt management, if you’re account was open, it’s automatically closed, and will report closed by grantor. Also keep in mind that you’re going to receive a 1099 form on any debt that’s settled. If you settled that earlier mentioned 5k for 2k, that 3k counts as income for tax purposes. Sure, you could try and not report it at tax time, but that’s a risk you’re running.</p>
<p>As per the shadier companies... They’re a pain in the ass. A lot of them will send us documents that accounts were opened fraudulently. Whether you told them that or not. I’ve seen ever thing from repeated form letters claiming fraud to phony police reports, some from real agencies, others from agencies that don’t even exist. Some will threaten to sue for basically nothing, with no details. Just threatening ‘attorney’ letters demanding we remove delinquencies or stop reporting accounts.</p>
<p>Long story short, don’t expect a miracle. If you have valid delinquencies, the banks aren’t going to remove them. When you go onto TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian’s websites and dispute negative marks- oh, did I mention you can and should do this yourself? Saves $$$- those disputes go to the banks to review via a system called e-OSCAR. The bureaus themselves, they don’t review shit.</p>
<p>The same goes for trying to settle. Try dealing with the banks yourself. No sense in paying someone else money that you could be using to get back on your feet to settle your debts. In most cases, if you get into a lot of debt due to some trouble you find yourself in, consider bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Please don’t think of that as some nasty, evil word. Or that we at the bank are looking down on you. We recognize that shit happens. The only people we get annoyed at are the people that blast out their cards on purpose, then refuse to pay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can work out a settlement directly with your cc company without going thru a third party. The damage to your credit report is done when your bills are reported as late. If you were to file bankruptcy when your bills were still paid up to date, your credit score will not take as much of a hit. The third party settlement companies are a scam and will eventually hurt your credit more than helping. They’ll take your payments and hold on to the money til the account is about to charge off, then make a settlement. Meanwhile, you’ll still be getting collection calls, etc.  Also, a settlement is viewed as (almost) just as bad as bankruptcy. If you qualify for a chapter 7, that’s the way to go to save the most money.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these companies are just rip offs. Here's the deal, if you are broke and can't pay your bills, you have two options. Wait until your creditors start suing you and garnishing your wages and attaching your bank accounts or file for bankruptcy. Only 25% of your income can be garnished, so if you owe a lot of money, they aren't going to get much back.</p>
<p>But you can also negotiate with creditors to reduce the amount you pay back. Many times they will stop charging you interest and penalties and let you pay back the money you owe with no further accumulations.  You can lower the amount you pay back. It's all just a negotiation. You can do it yourself, or hire one of these companies. to negotiate for you. </p>
<p>But these companies make no promises, you have to pay in advance, and in the end, you can't force them to do anything, so you just lose you money and probably file bankruptcy. But you can do the same negotiation yourself. Show your creditors you are close to filing bankruptcy and they will get more out of you settling than in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>But it still screws your credit until you get them paid off, to whatever you agreed to. So if you are a great negotiator and have a lot of time, you can try to do it yourself. But most companies don't really have a reason to talk to you or someone you hire to negotiate for you. I mean, they will talk, but they just say &quot;see you in court&quot;.</p>
<p>I recommend trying yourself to negotiate with creditors and if that don't work, hire a bankruptcy lawyer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of medications in the inhalers, which are known as metered dose inhalers, or MDIs.</p>
<p>First, you should understand what asthma is. Asthma is a reactive obstructive lung disease which causes air trapping, which means the patient can breath in, but has trouble getting rid of the air in their lungs due to narrowed pathways in the lungs caused by inflammation and tightening of the smooth muscles that makeup these pathways.</p>
<p>The most common medication used that most people are probably familiar with is Albuterol, and this is what is most commonly used in rescue inhalers. Albuterol is a bronchodilator, and specifically a beta agonist. A beta agonist is a medication that specifically targets beta receptors (receptors are sites on cells which cause specific reactions when triggered by specific matching molecules), which are found on smooth muscle, like those in the airways in the lungs. The reaction between the beta agonist and the beta receptor on the smooth muscle triggers the smooth muscle to relax, which expands the airways, allowing the patient to expell that trapped air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most inhalers for asthmatics work because they are bronchodilators. This means that they work to relax the muscles in your airways (bronchi and bronchioles) in order to decrease the resistance and increase airflow into the lungs. They also can help to reduce inflammation, which has the same result of widening those airways.
The medicine mimics the signals that your body normally makes to carry out this action.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a myth that white collar crime is punished less harshly. You can spend a long time in prison for white collar crime. The thing is, most white collar crime isn't as damaging, so the sentences don't tend to be as long.</p>
<p>The thing is that stuff like robbery, rape, murder, assault, and burglary can badly traumatize their victims, leaving large amounts of lasting damage. The greatest damage in a $50 robbery in a gas station isn't the money stolen, it is the trauma to the victims and the community. It makes people feel unsafe, and they <em>are</em> directly unsafe, because a violent asshole has threatened someone with death or serious injury for a trivial amount of money.</p>
<p>Violent crimes show a reckless disregard for the life and psychological sanctity of others. That creates damage far beyond the mere dollar amount stolen. It disrupts people's lives very badly and can cause psychological trauma, and things like robbery threaten serious bodily injury or death, which are <em>extremely</em> serious (millions of dollars of losses to society in many cases).</p>
<p>Most white collar crimes don't cause nearly the same level of damage to people. Those which do tend to be much more heavily punished.</p>
<p>Bernie Madoff got 150 years. Sholam Weiss got 845 years in prison. Norman Schmidt got 330 years.</p>
<p>It isn't like white collar crime can't put you in prison for the rest of your life. But generally speaking, it has to be fairly egregious, and involve multiple charges, rather than just some single event.</p>
<p>I think there's an interesting argument to be made that we should increase penalties for multi-million dollar offenses - if someone defrauds someone else for $1 million or more, I think it is reasonable to argue that that merits more than a 5 year jail term. But most fraud law doesn't actually have scaling sentences for increasingly large amounts, in part because most fraud cases don't actually involve huge amounts of money. It might make sense to have a scale for them like we do with drugs, where if you have more drugs, you get a longer sentence.</p>
<p>The problem is that most of these offenses are too esoteric for people to really get a visceral grasp on them, and most of the really bad offenders commit multiple crimes rather than just one, so there isn't a big push for it.</p>
<p>We're also seeing an increase in 20-30 year sentences for people engaged in such activities, which may be indicative of judges cracking down on the behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What did the CEO know? What did he do exactly? Is there proof? Was the CFO doing it behind the CEO's back? Was he in cahoots with the internal auditors? Which ones exactly? Did these people understand what they were doing? Were they just incompetent? What work was performed by the external auditors? Did they not report something? Did they miss something? Why did they miss it?</p>
<p>And perhaps the biggest question: <em>exactly what crime was committed?</em> If you're thinking about the financial crisis of the late 00s, you have to remember that it essentially boiled down to risky, but legal, investments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way: you have $50 in hand and you go to buy $50 worth of goods. Lets say for the sake of argument that the goods hold their value. After you've made the purchase you still have $50 worth of stuff, before the purchase it was US currency now its some physical items. </p>
<p>The way this applies to a business is the following: In your business you have your income vs your costs, the difference is your net profit. The government only taxes you on this amount, so if you made $100 and spent $50 to do it your net is $50. </p>
<p>Here's the key, if you keep this money as currency the government is going to tax it, so out of those $50 you will lose 30% or so. However, if you &quot;dump&quot; the money into physical goods like I said earlier you end up with $50 worth of stuff, on your taxes you write off the purchase as a business expense and at the end of the day you end up with $0 net to be taxed on, thus you will pay $0 taxes. </p>
<p>To finish the picture lets expand the definition of what that money can be spent on: basically anything, including just giving it out as a bonus to the executives in the company. So if my company made 200k this year, on my taxes I'd write that it made $0 and I was given a 200k &quot;performance bonus&quot;. If I'm a small company and I'm not greedy I might decide to buy stuff I can see myself needing anyway, like new computers, company vehicles, etc.  but, either way, my goal is to get that number as close to 0 as possible. In certain circumstances the number can even be negative which allows me to pay 0 taxes this year and be untaxed on whatever money I &quot;lost&quot; the following year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most microphones that are designed to capture the human voice tend to favor higher frequencies, also higher frequency sounds tend to be reproduced better in computer sound systems. These differences in a normal scenario are subtle but when you create a feedback loop, any slight advantage one set of frequencies has over another will quickly become apparent as the loop cycles very very quickly.</p>
<p>So it's not that the pitch increases per se, but rather the signal gets more and more refined until only the high frequency parts of it remain. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feedback loops can be positive or negative. Negative feedback will cancel out, positive feedback will add up. This is determined by the phase relationship of the input and output signals. Due to fixed-time delays involved, the phase difference from being received at the microphone once to being received at the same microphone once again increases with frequency. With every cycle through the loop, the signal gets amplified, but only when the two are close to being in phase. Where they are 180° out of phase, they cancel out, and for other phases it is somewhere in-between. That means with every cycle, you get more resonance at particular frequencies, hence it eventually degenerating into a screech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the pitch is caused by a standing wave who's form is defined by the distance between the mic and the speaker. It gets louder because the amplification is getting compounded onto itself. So the pitch is the stable frequency between the mic and the speaker. if you move the mic closer it gets higher, you move it away it gets lower. Interestingly this setup is essentially a phase locked loop since the system self corrects the signal phase as the mic moves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that any given microphone or speaker will reproduce some given frequency most efficiently. Some common frequency between a mic and speaker will feed back first, along with some harmonics, and secondary feedback frequencies are only manifested when the primary has been EQ’ed out. At least that’s the premise I’ve been laboring under for the last 20 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tendency to increase in frequency is actually due to clipping, not the frequency response of the system.</p>
<p>When operating normally, every part of a sound system is linear in that it can only output a frequency if it is there in the input. Microphones, amplifiers and speakers can all have different frequency response curves (ie. favour a frequency over another) but they will not &quot;invent&quot; a new frequency to output.</p>
<p>When the system saturates it clips and this is a non-linear effect. Non-linear systems CAN introduce new frequencies. There are many ways to think about this, but the most intuitive for me is to consider this square wave visualisation.</p>
<p>When the clipping occurs, you take a nice signal and you cut the top of it similar to the square wave and it has the same effect as that gif: introducing harmonics (at the frequency of the system clipping). The harmonics are always at a higher frequency than the signal being clipped.</p>
<p>These harmonics are what drive the perceived pitch up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

She'd changed her name, and had been largely estranged from her family for decades. There was no family in her home town anymore. My wife changed her name and we live a long way from their home town in the US.</p>
<p>Somehow that Canadian detective figured out that my wife was the deceased's sister. He would have had to dig through many years of records, received help from police in Ontario, Texas, California and Utah to track down my wife.</p>
<p>It took about 8 hours before the police in our town rang our doorbell to give us the news.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The MKUltra project wasn't about some kind of mysterious &quot;mind control&quot; ability.  It was a research project to investigate a wide variety of drugs and forms of torture that could be used to further the CIA's agendas.  The reason it's often called the &quot;CIA mind control project&quot; is because part of the project was investigating drugs such as LSD that they hoped would make victims vulnerable to suggesting and manipulation.</p>
<p>Experiments of the project mostly include administering various drugs to people and then conducting behavioral tests, sometimes without the victims' knowledge or consent.  LSD was their primary focus, but they also tested a number of other drugs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Other_drugs" target="_blank">from the Wikipedia article</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine, cannabis, alcohol, and sodium pentothal</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think less 'mind control' and more 'using drugs to torture people'. For instance, say you recruit a bunch of college students to do a scientific test, and have them sign non-disclosure agreements. This is a relatively rich market, as there are always college students willing to spend a few hours being poked in exchange for a token sum that can be spent on food or alcohol. Tell them whatever you want; it's enshrined in American law and scientific ethics that it's 100% ok to lie to test subjects about what you actually plan on doing to them, so long as they know they're being tested in a broad sense. Give them each their own room, pump half of them full of saline solution, the other half full of LSD, and blast them with light and sound and see if the LSD-dosed students beg for mercy before the saline crew. Afterwards, write down your results, hand each kid $20 and remind them that if they break their non-disclosure agreement you will send them to federal pound-you-in-the-ass penitentiary. </p>
<p>As for how they found out, the MK-series experiments left a pretty broad paper trail, and as time went on more and more of it made it out into the open air. At first it was mostly rumor and hearsay, hence how ULTRA got it's killer rep as a &quot;mind control&quot; program. But as the years ground on, stuff got declassified or released via the Freedom of Information Act, and the actual paperwork started entering public knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back off of other people's comments, apparently only 20,000 pages of the original document was found because the rest were destroyed. That's noteworthy, especially considering people claiming to be MKUltra victims went into extensive detail about how the program also entailed sexual abuse, the attempt to produce people that could wage psychological warfare through psychic means, and the act of inducing dissociation to create personalities that would do their bidding, kind of like pawns or figureheads. </p>
<p>It sounds crazy, but governments, which are comprised of people in positions of power, do crazy things in order to keep a grip on the power they already have or to obtain even more. I can't imagine that anyone wanting that much authority is sane, so it really doesn't seem like a far stretch that they actually tried all of those known things and worse. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The series &quot;Manhunt&quot; on Netflix about the Unabomber has an absolutely amazing depiction of Ted K's version of what he went through in MKUltra at Harvard. Some people are convinced that his experiences in MKUltra led him to what he became. The scenes are so sad I definitely felt bad for him. </p>
<p>In the series, a very young and lonely Ted turns to a larger-than-life professor at Harvard for support. The professor spends a year encouraging Ted's anti-technology ideas and builds-up his ego and trust. Ted absolutely worships the professor and participates in his experiments to please him. During the second year, the professor does a complete 180 and belittles Ted, destroying his ego and ideas. It is revealed that the professor never cared about Ted and only used him for his twisted experiments, and Ted is broken forever. I'm sure it's dramatized to some extent, but I believe much of the content of the show is taken from first-hand accounts and interviews. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
