		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>For this explanation to make sense, it's important that you know what bits and bytes are, and how a computer uses them to store information. This is a topic of its own, and you can find ELI5 threads that explain it.</em></p>
<p>A simple algorithm is counting how many there are of each byte in a set of data. Remember that a byte consists of 8 bits. You then replace the most common byte with a single bit, 1. The second most common one is replaced by two bits, 01. The third most is replaced by 001, etc.</p>
<p>In the end, you end up with a lookup table, and a bit pattern.</p>
<p>The string &quot;AAABBC&quot; looks like this in binary (in bits, with added spaces for easier reading):</p>
<pre><code>01000001 01000001 01000001 01000010 01000010 01000011
A        A        A        B        B        C          </code></pre>
<p>But if we replace every occurrence of the most common pattern, &quot;01000001&quot; with just 1, etc, we end up with something that looks like this (still with added spaces):</p>
<pre><code>1 1 1 01 01 001
A A A B  B  C</code></pre>
<p>Since a byte is 8 bits long, and we have 10 bits here, our result would be two bytes:</p>
<pre><code>11101010 01000000
AAAB B C   (Padding)</code></pre>
<p>We have effectively compressed 6 bytes down to 2.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edit, and some possibly interesting points:</strong></p>
<p>It's important to remember that to be able to unzip a file, you must keep track of which replacements you've made. Somehow, you have to remember that 1 corresponds to 01000001. In this particular algorithm, you can declare a dictionary by first listing how many items are in the list, then all the items in the list itself, and finally the zipped string.</p>
<p>In the case above, this would result in the following:</p>
<pre><code>Length   A        B        C        AAAB B C   Padding        
00000011 01000001 01000010 01000011 11101010 01000000
(The length being 3.)</code></pre>
<p>This means that out of our original string, which was 6 bytes long, we've now zipped it down to 2 bytes, but we also added 4 bytes of data to know what the zipped portion means.. :)</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that it's not always useful to zip data. Very small amounts of data, or data that is very diverse, could end up being no smaller, or sometimes even bigger than the unzipped version.</p>
<p>The algorithm still works, though. We could pack a few more A's into this, and still keep the size at 6 bytes, for example.</p>
<pre><code>AAAAAABBC</code></pre>
<p>would turn into</p>
<pre><code>Length   A        B        C        AAAAAAB  B C  Padding        
00000011 01000001 01000010 01000011 11111101 01001000</code></pre>
<p>which is still only 6 bytes, but we've packed 9 bytes into it. We could add another 3 A's, and it would still be only 6 bytes:</p>
<pre><code>AAAAAABBCAAA</code></pre>
<p>would turn into</p>
<pre><code>Length   A        B        C        AAAAAAB  B C  AAA
00000011 01000001 01000010 01000011 11111101 01001111</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>Another quick edit:</strong></p>
<p>I should mention here that this algorithm is a slight variation of something called Huffman's algorithm. Huffman is used in combiantion with LZ77 in zip files.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the data computers regularly deal with is not random, but has various more or less obvious patterns in it. If you know what patterns to expect (say, by already seeing some of the data, or by knowing what sort of data it is), then you can use that knowledge to convert large patterns into smaller symbols and then add a decoding instruction to the file to convert the smaller symbols back into the larger patterns, and if the patterns occur frequently enough, the space you save by converting them into smaller symbols outweighs the size of the decoding instruction.</p>
<p>Here's an example: Imagine that you took a TXT file of one of Shakespeare's plays, analyzed it, and found that the letter 'z' appears 2000 times and the two-letter sequence 'th' appears 5000 times. In that case, you could switch all the original 'z' for 'th', and all the original 'th' for 'z', and put a note at the beginning of the file saying 'before reading this, replace all the 'z' with 'th' and vice versa'. By replacing the occurrences of 'z' with 'th' you increase the size by 2000 letters, but by replacing the occurrences of 'th' with 'z' you <em>decrease</em> the size by 5000 letters, and because the note is only 65 letters long (counting spaces and punctuation), you end up with a TXT file that is smaller than the original by 2935 letters but can still be precisely reconstructed into the original by following the instructions in the note. You've taken advantage of the fact that 'th' occurs especially frequently (and 'z' especially <em>in</em>frequently by comparison) to produce a file that ultimately says the same thing (assuming the note is followed correctly by whoever reads it) but has fewer letters in it.</p>
<p>The actual techniques used by modern data compression software are more advanced than this, but the basic idea, that of finding patterns and encoding them using smaller amounts of information, is the same.</p>
<p>Note that <em>not all</em> types of data have patterns that you can take advantage of in this way. In particular, data that has <em>already</em> been compressed using a technique like this tends to have fewer patterns in it than the original version.</p>
<p>(This is a copy+paste of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3ymt63/eli5_how_can_the_3gb_zip_i_download_turn_into_7gb/cyess3t/" target="_blank">previous post</a> I wrote on the subject, so I apologize if it doesn't seem written precisely to address your question. If you have further questions about these techniques or their mathematical limitations, or any clarification of the above, ask away.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to reply because the top explanations are very different from ZIP and do not capture what makes ZIP special. One top explanation is RLE (run length encoding) and teaches how to replace strings like &quot;RRRRRGGGBB&quot; with &quot;5R3G2B&quot; (5 Rs, 3 Gs, and 2Bs). RLE is simple, but is not ZIP, and unlike ZIP, cannot effectively compress strings like RGBRGBRGBRGB... Another top explanation is dictionary-based compression, where long bit patterns are replaced with much smaller offsets into a dictionary. Then the dictionary and the smaller offsets are stored together, ready to be decompressed by looking up each offset in the dictionary they were stored with. This is also not ZIP and I think does not explain what makes ZIP really magical and elegant. ZIP is special because like dictionary compression it performs an effective substitution-based compression, and so is more effective than RLE, but unlike dictionary compression, it does not have to store the dictionary alongside the compressed output, making it much more efficient than dictionary compression in the end (the dictionary is quite large).</p>
<p>ZIP uses a sliding window. It scans over the uncompressed data from start to finish with a fixed-sized window and prints out the compressed data to a separate output file. So it might make more sense to say ZIP encodes rather than compresses the original input file, as the input file is left untouched while ZIP is running, and instead a new encoded (compressed) output file is constructed alongside the original uncompressed file. What ZIP will do is try to replace each string in the uncompressed input file by printing a much smaller offset to the compressed output file. Each time ZIP does this we say it is &quot;replacing&quot; the string from the input file. The key idea in ZIP is to replace the string just beyond the sliding window with a pointer to a matching string found within the sliding window, and then move the sliding window forward to encompass the string we just replaced, and kick out a string from the sliding window to keep the window a fixed size:</p>
<pre><code>uncompressed input, with window ending at '|', valid strings to point at are 0, 1, 2, and 3:
|(3)RBGR(2)RRR(1)R(0)BBB|RBGRBBBRRRGBG...

compressed output, with window ending at '|', strings replaced with pointers into window:
|RBGRRRRRBBB|302GBG...

move window in input forward now...
RBGRRRRRBB|(3)B(2)RBGR(1)BBB(0)RRR|GBG...

move window in compressed output forward now...
RBGRRRRRBBB|302|GBG...</code></pre>
<p>If a string cannot be matched up with a string within the window, that string is not replaced, but instead becomes a valid string to point at within the sliding window, hopefully helping to compress later strings. This also means that when starting compression, the window is empty, and it cannot replace strings with smaller pointers as there are no valid strings to point at yet. ZIP has to &quot;get started&quot;. Once it encodes some data however, it has built up enough contents for its sliding window of valid pointers and is able to achieve good compression from then on.</p>
<p>The most elegant thing about ZIP is during decompression, the contents of the sliding window where the values of the valid pointers are stored is always decompressed first, so subsequent pointers can always be decompressed. This is very roughly like surfing, where the decompression of data is like the wave, and the end of the sliding window, where we are replacing compressed pointers with their original pointer values is like the surf board. We complete decompression when the surf board reaches the shore. Since the 'dictionary' (the wave front) is built dynamically during decompression, there is no need to store it with the compressed output.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an example of an exception to the already provided answers - in Poland an abandoned bunker has provided a situation where wood ants are regularly separated from their colony by falling down a vertical pipe under the main colony.   Because it is so common, a semi-functional secondary colony operates underground without much food or light.  The ants dig, clean away dead ant bodies to the large &quot;graveyard&quot; surrounding the colony, and mostly act as they would above ground, but eventually starve.  The colony only keeps going by the regular rain of new workers from above.   The scientists studying them aren't sure if they eat anything, like bat guano or mites living on the dead ants, but as of yet haven't identified a food source.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It stops eating and wastes away and dies.  It will try hard to get back for as long as it can first.  The bee needs the hive.  The hive needs the bee.  Social insects aren't following orders from anyone, they are acting on instincts written at the level of DNA.  The queen (and king, if termites) are just as bound to the system as the workers.  Many ants even have multiple queens per colony for redundancy.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to assume social insects can't think for themselves because of the colony.  In the lab they will learn to solve a problem and then teach the solution to others.  They are just intimately a part of the group.  Don't think of a fascist slave state.  Think of an army unit: when one is smart everyone gets smarter; when one is strong, everyone becomes strong.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a large misunderstanding here in that the insect is &quot;following orders&quot;.  It's not.  It's following programming.  Big difference here.  </p>
<p>I know for bees (so I assume for most hive insects) they function on very specific &quot;rules&quot;.  So for example, a &quot;scout&quot; bee will fill up with honey (fuel) and fly out (up to 4 miles away) to find a source of nectar and pollen.  Once it's found, it'll bring a small amount back, and then do a little dance to tell the other bees where to find it.  The bees will taste the samples, and if everything meets the criteria, they'll suck up JUST ENOUGH honey for the trip, and head out.  If they get blown off course, or otherwise delayed enough that they run out of &quot;fuel&quot; before getting back, they die.  Sure, it's not good for them, but for the hive as a whole (which is the more important organism) it's better that a few bees die this way while conserving &quot;fuel&quot; than to waste excess fuel by having bees overeat before each trip.  </p>
<p>No commands were given, and the queen had no part in the process.  </p>
<p>If the queen dies, her lemon-grass smelling pheromone starts to wear off, and the bees will go to work creating some new queen cells from the most recently laid eggs.  Other than that, the existence of a queen has little to do with a bee's day-to-day programming.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;why&quot;.  The mainstream big-picture answer is that animals die by old age at around the point that they'd probably end up dying anyway.  </p>
<p>Small animals that are heavily predated on (say, mice) have really short lifespans, because if they spent energy on hardening their systems so they could live longer it would be wasted; there is no point in a mouse that could live 20 years, because it would be eaten in a year or so anyway.  </p>
<p>Birds tend to live longer than mammals, because it's harder to prey on birds.  Large seabirds, that live solitary lives away from dangerous things, live for a long time.  Bats are as small as mice, but they can fly; they live much longer than mice do.  </p>
<p>There are other argument out there, but that's the general consensus.  Again, this is the evolutionary-theory &quot;why&quot;, not the mechanistic &quot;why&quot;; the concept is that it takes more energy to live longer, but it doesn't say where that energy goes, specifically.</p>
<p>A starting point for further reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The classical evolutionary theory of ageing, first proposed by the famous evolutionary biologist George C. Williams over 50 years ago, gives an answer. The theory predicts that high mortality rates in adult animals due to predation, exposure to parasites and other randomly occurring events will be associated with shorter maximum life-spans. This is because under high external mortality most individuals will already be dead (eaten or succumbed to disease) before natural selection can act on rare mutations that cause healthier ageing. The theory has since been further developed and tested in a number of experimental and comparative studies.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The classical evolutionary theory of ageing (ETA) predicts that exposure of adult individuals to high rates of mortality due to predation, parasites or other stochastic events will hinder the evolution of increased lifespans, because most individuals will already have died from these extrinsic causes before natural selection can act on reducing intrinsic causes of mortality that lead to longer lifespans (e.g. favoring mutations that lead to healthier ageing) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember studying something like this a while ago. If you look up some terms such as &quot;life history trade-off&quot; &quot;iteroparous&quot;, &quot;semelparous&quot; and &quot;K-strategist&quot; and &quot;r-strategist&quot;, you'll get a feel for the answer you're looking for.</p>
<p>Basically, different organisms have evolved different strategies based on what worked best for their ancestors in their environments. Allocating resources to one factor of life such as reproduction comes at a cost to other aspects such as survival and longevity. Semelparous organisms, at one end of the spectrum, will reproduce only once in their lifetime and so there is no evolutionary benefit to them having long lifespans. Iteroparous organisms will reproduce several times throughout their lifetime and so can live longer lives. There is a balance to the amount of resources devoted to somatic effort and the amount devoted to reproductive effort. If I recall correctly, a &quot;K-strategist&quot; has a life history adapted to maximising its competitiveness and adult survival, and are usually found in environments which suit this life style. &quot;r-strategists&quot;, on the other hand, are adapted to maximising their reproductive rate and usually are found in unstable environments where rapid development and early reproduction, and therefore shorter lifespans, are favoured by natural selection.</p>
<p>So the differing lifespans of the different animals you mentioned will be due to the optimal life history strategy in the evolution of their respective phylogenetic lineages.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reproductive fitness.</p>
<p>If an animal living longer increases its reproductive fitness, then it's lifespan will likely increase. If, however, living longer does nothing to increase its reproductive fitness, it won't be selected for - and if longevity decreases reproductive fitness, it will actually be selected <em>against</em>.</p>
<p>Longevity can increase reproductive fitness in two major ways - it can either allow for a longer reproductive lifespan, so that the creature can live longer and reproduce for longer, or it can make it so that the creature's longer survival contributes to higher survival rates for its offspring or its offspring's offspring.</p>
<p>For instance, if you think about humans, an old human, past prime reproductive age, can still take care of their grandchildren, or even children they had later on in their lifespan.</p>
<p>However, some things which might increase your longevity might decrease your reproductive fitness - say, having smaller litters of offspring might make it likely you'll live longer, but it also decreases your reproductive output.</p>
<p>As such, longevity is not necessarily all upside from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>There are some other factors as well - creatures which take longer to reach maturity tend to live longer. This also leads to a tendency for larger creatures to live longer because it takes longer to achieve a greater size, though this is not a hard and fast rule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found this question so interesting, and the answers so inadequate (Come on guys! Explaining the neurobiology is like saying men get erections because their penis fills with blood. True: but not illuminating) that I did a little digging myself. After finding nothing very helpful in my old neuro books, I found <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-are-cold-chills" target="_blank">this</a> answer on Quora, which was written so well I'll just quote </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thrill-induced chills are a physiological response to a number of seemingly unrelated types of emotional stimuli. The exact mechanism is still the subject of scientific investigation.</p>
<p>Thrill-induced &quot;chills&quot; are a physiological response that is called &quot;frisson&quot; by researchers. The main effect is &quot;goose bumps&quot; or &quot;hair standing up&quot; (piloerecetion), which is caused by contraction of tiny muscles around the hair folicles. There is also the full-body shudder, which is related to shivering and is caused by rhythmic oscillating contractions of the major skeletal muscle groups, most likely controlled at the level of the brain stem and spinal cord. Shivers are normally intended to generate warmth through physical exertion of the muscles.</p>
<p>The interesting questions are: 1) why is the sensation pleasurable? and 2) why can this response be induced by stimuli unrelated to cold (music, aesthetic awe, primal scream, threat of loss, certain physical and tactile sensations)?</p>
<p>On the first question, a PET scan study at McGill university looked at the effect of frisson in response to peak experience while listening to music (&quot;musical frisson&quot;). (<a href="http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/media/n" target="_blank">http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/media/n</a>...). They found that dopamine was released during this peak experience. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with &quot;reward&quot; which are positive experiences that the brain attempts to repeat in the future. [1]</p>
<p>On the evolutionary origin or purpose of chills, David Huron argues that they come from our instinctual reaction to human screams, which is an alert and orienting reaction. Human screams are audible at a longer distance than any other sound, and are critical for avoiding danger (warnings) and protecting infants (distress calls). So a scream is an important sound that completely consumes attention.</p>
<p>Huron argues that in music, certain sound elements may trigger the alert reaction (causing the chills effect), but then are realized to be harmless, inducing the pleasurable response. The musical features invoking the sensation often involve a sudden increase in loudness which might normally be a signal of surprise and danger. (<a href="http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/20" target="_blank">http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/20</a>...)</p>
<p>Grewe et al (2010) argue that chills have many unrelated causes including &quot;fight and flight reactions, aesthetic awe or social loss&quot; and so may not have a single explanation or evolutionary origin. [2]</p>
<p>Overall, chills may be an ancient physiological response that has been (accidentally?) co-opted by evolution for new purposes, such as social danger alert. Art forms such as music and painting have found clever ways of activating this response.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, the current tuning system we use in the Western World (and basically anywhere else outside of tribal, colloquial, folkway or other regional music) is the tonal system. This system was set up to give notes (or pitches, actually) the same equidistant relationships between each other within a tuning system known as equal temperament. That is to say, within any octave of an instrument or an instrument tuned to another instrument, there will always be 12 equally separated pitches, what we musicians know as half-steps or semitones, these pitches are always 100 cents (just a division of frequencies) apart from one another. If a pitch is played or sung that is even a few cents off from the tuning pitch as written or perceived, our ears perceive the sound as being dissonant or &quot;off-key.&quot; </p>
<p>To answer your second question, because of equal temperament's hold on music today, the human ear has become used to its clarity within music. If a note is sounded that doesn't fit into the system, our ears know what's up. </p>
<p>TL;DR - Because of a system called equal temperament which standardizes which pitches sound &quot;correct&quot; to the human ear.</p>

Deeper in this is what our ear is accustomed to with Western music. When a note doesn't fit or go the right way, we can pick up on it. The concept of what is right is based off what we are used to hearing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to contribute by saying that you probably mean western music, where 12 separated pitches are used. This is to say that there are different systems in the world where many more pitches are used. A song doesn't nessecarily have to sound off-pitch, if the listener comes from a culture where many more pitches are used in their music. </p>
<p>It isn't the pitch itself, but rather the interval between them that makes them sound &quot;off&quot;. We clearly pick up on a perfect fifth, because of it's properties of sounding very clean, compared to a major third, which sounds more muddled and it colours the music very well. </p>
<p>The western pitch system as explained very well by @nathan594 is rationally divided, which makes the frequencies to be more in line with eachother. </p>
<p>Now that you have some meat on your bones, the answer to your question is basically that notes that sound &quot;off&quot; are dependent on what we are used to hearing. Someone who listens mainly to pop music, might not expect a minor second interval between instruments as much as a musical conductor might, because of the majorly different styles. So, even in our own culture we have major differences when it comes to what's determined &quot;off-pitch&quot; by our ears!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a science behind it that explains harmonics.  Most sounds are comprised of a combination of 'notes' at different frequencies, which define their sound. For instance, bass is typically somewhere in the 20-200hz range (hertz=cycles per second)</p>
<p>So at 1hz, you hear on tone per second.
If you couple this with another tone, the must align to be in 'key'.
The human voice projects different notes simultaneously.<br />
So lets say a person sings a note, it will have a bass property and an alto property.<br />
The bass is at 60hz, so the alto needs to be at a multiple of this harmonic range, let's call it 60Mhz.    </p>
<p>If the bass note was at 60Hz, and there was another bass notes at 100hz, they would not be aligned and would be noticeably crappy.<br />
The second bass note would need to be at 120hz, or 180hz, etc. </p>
<p>TL;DR
tones together need to be mathematically compliant<br />
look up harmonics</p>
<p>edit: harmonics has nothing to due with a 'system' ... it's math</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>cnn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's going on? A range of experts made clear to me that there isn't any one factor to explain the increase, but a number of issues, including obesity-related complications such as hypertension and diabetes, the dramatic increase in the number of cesarean section births, a lack of access to affordable, quality health care and more women giving birth at older ages. </p>
<p>Record-keeping changes might also explain some of the upward trend, experts say.
...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CNN article completely avoids mentioning what's going on in Texas, whereas,</p>
<p>time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Access is inconsistent: Between 2000 to 2015, Texas saw a spike in maternal mortality while the state also underwent changes to reproductive health services, including the closure of several clinics offering abortions and other services. In 2011, the state’s family planning budget was cut by two-thirds. Experts say the lack of access is probably not solely responsible for the state’s dramatic spike in deaths, but as The Texas Tribune reports, it may have exacerbated the issue. “I’ve done my best to try to investigate this as a data error and I can’t find any changes to account for it,” says MacDorman. “It’s very concerning what’s happening in Texas.”</p>

<p>Eclampsia is the onset of seizures (convulsions) in a woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction. Onset may be before, during, or after delivery. Most often it is during the second half of pregnancy. The seizures are of the tonic–clonic type and typically last about a minute. Following the seizure there is typically either a period of confusion or coma. Complications include aspiration pneumonia, cerebral hemorrhage, kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are part of a larger group of conditions known as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</p>

<p><a href="http://eol.org/pages/2924326/details" target="_blank">Japanese Spider crab <em>Macrocheira kaempferi</em></a>: 18-feet across.</p>
<p><a href="http://squid.tepapa.govt.nz/anatomy/article/the-body-of-the-colossal-squid" target="_blank">Colossal Squid</a> up to 43 feet long.</p>

<p>It is very likely that new animals will be found in the under-explored deep sea.

<p>As an example we know that there is a beaked whale, the spade toothed whale, that does definitely exist. Until 2013 it was only known from certain partial skeletons found around the Pacific. In 2013 a mother and calf were washed up dead in New Zealand. They were at first misidentified and buried.  They  have since been dug up for examination. They are the only full specimens in the world of a species noone has ever seen alive. </p>
<p>If we can know nothing about a large animal (the mother was like 6.5m) like this that surfaces at least every hour then it is more than feasible to assume there are large animals we dont even have hints about yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Most deep sea animals have to be very careful about handling energy resources because of this.</p>
