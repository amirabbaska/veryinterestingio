		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While /u/TheGamingWyvern has given you the usual explanation, it doesn't even hint at the whole story.</p>
<p>The passage in Isaiah 14:12 is a type of poetry called a &quot;taunt song&quot;  a sort of Old Testament celebrity roast. Isaiah is actually sarcastically referring to the King of Babylon: one of his titles was &quot;The Shining One&quot;, which was also what they called Venus, the Morning Star; another of his titles was &quot;Son of the Dawn&quot;. And that's how Isaiah addresses him: &quot;O Shining One, Son of the Dawn...&quot; It's just that the King James Bible decided to use the Latin word &quot;Lucifer&quot; at this point.</p>
<p>This Lucifer actually has nothing to do with Satan. In verse 4, God tells Isaiah that he is to give the following prophecy to the King, and then the taunt starts. Verse 12 basically means: &quot;Hah! You call yourself the Morning Star? Well look at you now, fallen out of the sky!&quot;</p>
<p>In the New Testament -- Luke 10:18 -- Jesus is quoted as saying, &quot;I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.&quot; Actually, a more accurate translation of the original Greek would be &quot;I was watching Satan falling...&quot;, and he was reacting to his disciples' report that they had been successfully driving out demons. Nobody really knows whether Luke was deliberately referencing Isaiah 14, but in the popular imagination the connection took hold and people equated Lucifer with Satan.</p>
<p>The idea of Satan as a fallen angel is a much more modern idea.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Satan in Hebrew is just &quot;adversary&quot; or &quot;accuser.&quot; There is no one Satan in the Old Testament, it's just a title; the New Testament is where the singular Satan/Devil is developed as a figure. That's important to bear in mind because there are so many misconceptions about Satan.
Lucifer is attached to Satan because of a prophecy in Isaiah 14 regarding the king of Babylon at the time who is sarcastically referred to as the &quot;Shining Morning Star&quot; in translation. For some ignorant reason, despite the text quite literally prefacing the statement by saying it's about the king of Babylon, people have relentlessly attached it to Satan because of speculation about his origin. Tradition is a powerful thing and it's not helped by the influence of various religious groups, especially Gnostics, on contemporary understanding of pseudo-religious myth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I did my degree (theology) but I focussed heavily on the Satan myth in my dissertation and if I had pursued academia further word have been the basis of any doctoral work. If memory serves the simple explanation is the character is actually a mix of translational issues, biblical references, pagan artifacts and several apocryphal stories that have all been amalgamated into one overarching narrative.  </p>
<p>Satan in either Hebrew/Greek/Aramaic (can't remember the language for the source text) is actually a title, the correct term being something like 'Hasatan' or 'Hashaitan' (it was 10 years ago I did the research, bare with me). This title was actually a political stab at some infamous despot or another at the time. I think the literal translation is 'the adversary'. This was interpreted by early scholars as a proper name and was characterised into this malevolent persona. Over time it got swept together with things like the serpent myth in Genesis, Origins poems, the signs of the first rapture in Daniel and the second in Revelations, Hades from Greek myth, Zaroastrian Angra, Chernobog, Djinn Legends from Persia, Enoch's story of the Fall and a thousand other cultural influences into this broad overarching narrative. Satan itself just represents 'that which we are opposed to', whereas the Lucifer tale of the fallen angel comes from Enoch, Dante, Blake and Milton.  </p>
<p>It's important to remember that there is no one 'Bible' there are thousands of texts, written across hundreds of years by thousands of authors in dozens of different languages (most of which we can only guess at reading). What you commonly think of as the Bible is just what a few old dudes decided they wanted to cram together into one book at Nicea, or under King James or in some church or university somewhere. What one you refer to just depends on your chosen breed of insanity/sun worship. There isn't really one Satan story because the story is actually a cultural phenomenon. It's a persona we invented as a society over two thousand years of culture.  </p>
<p>I'm sorry if that's a bit of a tangled mess to follow, but I'm skimming over a lot of detail from my memories of research I did a decade ago.  </p>
<p>Fun fact: Of all the characters associated with Satan in the NRSV edition of the Bible, not one of them ever tells a lie. The devil always tells the truth (which probably had a significant impact in tying him to the Lucifer story from Enoch).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In biblical lore, before Satan was cast from heaven, he was the leader of the angels and the most favoured angel in heaven.  But a rift between God and Satan resulted in Satan being cast down to earth.</p>
<p>In history, the Babylonian king referred to himself as the first star. Kings always think very highly of themselves, and the first star of the morning is impressive.  But this title of first star of the morning comes from an scene that occurs on many clear  mornings. This scene is the shining of a star as the sun rises.  That is, it is the last star visible before the sky is flooded blue. The light bringer refers to this star, also known as the first star of the morning, or the morning star. </p>
<p>Lucifer is a Roman translation that means morning star. This was apt for early Christians because they considered Satan to be the first among the angels, or the leader of the angels.</p>
<p>However, the morning star to which they are referring Venus. Venus appears as the brightest star on the morning depending on the time of year.  This is because it is relatively close to earth and reflects the light of the sun easily. It's usually the last star to disappear form the morning sky as the sun rises.</p>
<p>So when Isiah was referring to Lucifer, he was in fact referring to Venus.  The later Roman translation creates Lucifer, which became the name of Satan, as a means to identify a fallen star, or the great first star among the angels, or the angel that was cast from heaven.  The translation was wrong, and Lucifer as Satan was born.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a positive feedback loop, and is the same reason that laughter is often thought of as contagious. Laughter releases endorphins, those brain chemicals that make you feel good. Hearing friendly laughter releases some, laughing yourself releases more. (this is why there are laugh tracks on tv; if we hear laughter, we are more likely to laugh as well.) Normally, the endorphins are released, do their business, and then go away. However, sometimes there is reason for them to hang around a bit longer. Sustained periods of laughter can release the endorphins a little faster than they can go away, and so they start to pile up as the brain tries to restore equilibrium. The better we feel, the more apt we are to laugh, making us feel even better. Or, we are tired, and the brain was already starting to shut down for the night and so isn't ready to help clear out the flood of endorphins that have suddenly showed up. Eventually, the brain kicks itself into overdrive to clear out all the backlogged endorphins, and the giggle fit ends. This often leaves us feeling quite worn out afterwards, but still kinda good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit 4: All the way at the top so you can read it first.
Disclaimer: I am not a <del>doctor nor chiropractor</del> medical professional. While I do have some medical experience, I am in no way qualified to provide medical advice. I am simply sharing what training I've received and my personal experiences either with customers or what I've felt myself. I am doing this of my own free will at the low low price of... wait for it.. free. Yes that was a salesman joke. Now all comments I've expressed are opinionated. Please research this topic yourself before purchasing a mattress. Trust but verify. </p>
<p>I currently work at a Colorado based Mattress Store. While you don't need a mattress or a pillow, it does wonders for hip, neck, back, and shoulder pains. </p>
<p>A properly fitted mattress provides about 2/3rds of your support. The mattress in conjunction with the pillow provides the remaining 1/3rd. I feel that this support is necessary IF you want the best nights rest possible. You can still sleep without it but not optimally. The way it was explained in my training is as follows. </p>
<p>A mattress that is actually fitted to your sleeping habits and body, reduces how much your muscles have to work throughout the night to maintain the natural S curve of your spine. If your muscles work hard throughout the night maintaining this position you tend to wake up with a tense back and/or back pain. The part the pillow plays is also quite important. An improperly fitted pillow typically causes neck pain due to similar reasons. The neck muscles work and are stretched throughout the night from the lack of support. </p>
<p>Please note that this a very general statement and that every person is different as well as the mattress they sleep on. Many people will say that they sleep absolutely amazing on their current mattress that is 40 years old (no exaggeration, true story). However, I used to think that Motorola Razr was the best phone ever. Then I tried something new, the Samsung Note. To be clear, my point is that just because you feel something is the best you've ever experienced doesn't mean you can't experience something better. </p>
<p>Bonus (A few general mattress rules) :</p>
<p>If you are a side sleeper try to avoid firm mattresses. They place a lot of pressure on your shoulders and hips with very little give. This leads to more tossing and turning throughout the night (even if you aren't completely awake/aware). </p>
<p>Adjustable bases, sometimes called hospital beds, are used in hospitals for a reason. They reduce pressure on your body by forming a S curve to help match your spine's curve. Also, they raise your feet above your heart causing increased blood flow to facilitate healing. Why do you think doctors tell you to keep certain injuries elevated? </p>
<p>In regards to pillows, most stomach sleepers need a thin pillow. Side sleepers often need the thickest. The reason for that relates to your shoulders. The pillow needs to be about as thick as the distance from your neck to the edge of your shoulder so that the neck is in line with spine. Back sleepers are often  needing something in the middle. Although almost every customer claims to need the fluffiest fluffernugget of a pillow we have. Very few of them will listen otherwise. So we sell it to them. The customer is always right. No matter how ridiculously wrong they are. </p>
<p>Edit 1: A lot of people have asked about the best pillow for someone who switches between their stomach and side throughout the night. There isn't a specific pillow or really even a best one. What works for me may not work for you. However this is what I personally do:</p>
<p>What worked for me, and <strong>might</strong> work for you is this. I purchased a thin pillow that I was comfortable with on my stomach. Now, most side sleepers end up having an arm underneath the pillow essentially &quot;increasing&quot; the thickness of the pillow to match a so called side sleeper pillow. This worked for me. My arm made up for the missing padding. Again, this is what is good for me. </p>
<p>Edit 2: There has been a fair amount of skepticism regarding the increased blood flow portion of this comment. The medical field is slightly outside my area of knowledge. However, while I am not currently retracting this statement, I am going to research a little more in depth. Hopefully I come back with a more satisfactory explanation. </p>
<p>Edit 3: Wow. Um. Gold. Huh. I really appreciate that! Truly! </p>
<p><em>obligatory first gold comment followed by lame pun</em></p>
<p>Edit 5: There's been a lot more interest on this subject than I expected. I've answered most of the questions at least once, some more. If I haven't addressed yours, the answer may be in another comment. Tonight however, I'm turning in. I may be able to answer some tomorrow morning. Past that, I feel like the subject was been pretty well exhausted. I do wish I every a excellent night's rest! Good night! </p>
<p>Edit 6: Editing the edit. I get it, a lot of people don't like chiropractors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a physical therapist in a spinal cord injury unit.  Pillows have the same purpose as pressure relief with our spinal cord injury patients.  In the back of the head, there is a boney prominence called the occiput.  If you lay on something hard, the blood in the skin between the occiput and the hard ground surface occludes  and the skin in that area slowly dies if you lay there for long periods without allowing blood flow to be restored.  The entire weight of the head is concentrated on that one small area and so it needs to be supported to prevent occluding blood.  This same event occurs with the hip bones in spinal cord patients as they cannot move their legs to relieve the pressure (thus they use their wheel chairs to recline and adjust gravity pressures through their legs or they lift themselves off the chair to restore blood flow - every 15 minutes).   You will get pressure sores which are the skin between the bone and the surface necrosing.
Basically pillows serve to support the head to allow blood flow to that skin throughout the night and also support the neck musculature while we sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is mentioning uniforms, but that's incorrect. Having any form of uniform wasn't very common for a lot of histoey. Standing armies night have a mandated uniform and armor, and later on livery became common (even then, not everyone had one), but for most of history you bought your own armor and wore your own clothes. There was no uniform. Of course by medival times, on which game of thrones is based, livery was common. And it does show up in game of thrones with, for example, the very distinctive Lannister army gear. However, the fact that armies have only had uniforms or livery for a relatively short time but managed not to kill their own men even before that suggests that isn't the explanation. </p>
<p>Instead, the problem is that game of thrones is really bad at depicting battles. Very little warfare in history involved skirmishes where everyone got into a giant mess and people paired off and fought their duels, with everyone else fighting around them. It looks awesome on tv, but it almost never happened. For starters, most warfare was seiges and maneuvers. You sit outside a town or castle until the people inside starve, or you lead a giant army and yell &quot;you better watch out or we're gonna attack&quot; and breathe a sigh of relief when the other guys slink away. </p>
<p>When a battle did happen, it looked very different from battles on GoT. You didn't pair up and fight other people. Instead, your army forms a few lines, their army forms a few lines, and the two groups stand across from other and try to kill the other side while doing their best to not die. Some units might move around, cavalry might charge, arrows would be shot, but it almost never happened that the formation broke up and the battle broke down into a bunch of duels (if the formation did break, it's because someone was running <em>away</em> from the fighting). You fought the entire battle surrounded by your own men, which made it really easy to know who to kill. You kill the guys opposite you - the ones poking a spear in your face - and you don't kill the guy behind you. </p>
<p>Now, skirmishes did happen of course. A unit might get isolated from their army, a small part of the formation might break down, a travelling group might get ambushed, a ship might be boarded, etc. But they were between small groups, not entire armies. You would know everyone on your side because you've been travelling and fighting with them.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is actually how the German flag got its colors. Some time in the past they had a war coming but couldn't afford to get everyone a proper uniform so they ordered them to dye their clothes black (which is a very easy color do dye) and handed out red pockets and some (goldish coloured) buttons. They were then easy to identify and the modern flag got it's colors from it. I am sure other countries/tribes etc found similar ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In GoT, we see Bran learning sigils of Houses and Tyrion testing Pod on the Dornish banners. It is very important important knowledge for commanders.</p>
<p>Also, battles were rarely as chaotic as the Battle of the Bastards. Most battles were in formation and relatively orderly. You normally knew the people left and right of you because those were the guys with whom you marched and sat around the fire. And when you know the people to the left, to the right, and behind you, and somebody runs to you from the front screaming and raising a sword, it's easy to find out who is friend or foe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of different types of headaches, and like almost every trait, both genetic background and environment play in role. It's also a hard question, because some of the most common types of headache, including migraines, are not perfectly understood yet.</p>
<p>For example, there is a heritable component to frequent migraines: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253157/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253157/</a> but there usually isn't a single gene difference that predisposes people to them. Some of the identified genes that may contribute involve chemical signaling systems in the brain, which fits with one theory of migraines that says they are caused in part by overactivity of certain areas of the brain. Women are more likely to get them than men, in part because of cycling changes in hormone levels that influence neurochemical signaling as well. I haven't read up on this much for other types of headaches.</p>
<p>Among environmental factors, things like poor posture that leads to compressed nerves, consistent sleep deprivation or stress, certain dietary triggers, sinus infections, etc. could all lead to more frequent headaches, and each individual will differ not only in how much they experience these things (based on lifestyle) but also on how sensitive they are to them (which may be partly genetic or epigenetic in itself.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A few moments (compared to a stellar lifetime) after a star begins to fuse iron it will supernova (any star large enough to fuse beyond carbon, nitrogen and oxygen is large enough to super nova). During the sudden collapse of the stars outer shells there is a rapid increase in pressure triggering supernova synthesis; the fusion the products of which yields every heavy element in the periodic table. The outer shells of the star impact an almost incompressible core, creating a shockwave that bounces off into space, seeding the rest of the galaxy with heavy elements. It's nice to think that, if you're wearing a wedding ring, then that gold/platinum/palladium you are wearing was created in the tiny instant during a supernova.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One physicist would measure, say, position x=1.230012312390000m, and the other physicist would measure, say, velocity v=1570.0002340103490923409134013490 km/s.</p>
<p>However, the key point in quantum mechanics is that if the two physicists were to <em>repeat</em> the experiment on an <em>identically prepared</em> electron, they would get <em>different</em> results! Quantum mechanics allows for measurement outcomes with different probabilities. Sometimes, one physicist gets this value, and sometimes another that value, even though the electron was prepared identically. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the <em>spreads</em> (uncertainties) of the measurements of position and momentum are connected by an inequality, which says that they cannot be arbitrarily small simultaneously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The uncertainty principle prevents something different. If you measure the position and momentum of a million particles as precisely as you would like, and let them go, and then some time later measure their position and momentum again, then the statistics of the second measurement will be such that the product of the standard deviation of the position and momentum is not less than hbar/2. That is, knowing everything about a particle now does not allow you to perfectly describe the position and momentum of the particle in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of answers here are touching on the observer effect, but the uncertainty principle doesn't need require the observer effect to hold. An electron is a wave packet, and part of being a wave demands that certainty in position undermines certainty in momentum and vice-versa. This is just the way an electron is. If the wave packet is scrunched up, its position is more certain, and if it's spread out, its momentum is more certain. If someone creates an experiment that measures position very precisely, the experiment must force that wave to be scrunched up, which causes momentum uncertainty. You simply can't force the wave to be spread out and scrunched up at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>a car is NOT a Faraday cage, especially given the newer construction methods being used on modern automobiles.</p>
<p>The large openings for the windows are the primary difference between the chassis of a car and a real Faraday cage. In order for a signal to be blocked, the size of the opening has to be on the order of 1% of the wavelength of the signal to be blocked. for broadcast  FM radio in the US ,88-108 Mhz, the wavelength is between 3.4 meters and 2.7 meters respectively, leaving a maximum opening size of approximately 2.5 cm. higher frequency signals having shorter wavelengths, the maximum opening size decreases as frequency increases.</p>
<p>Because a car doesn't have a homogeneous surface, either interior or exterior, it will is some cases act as an attenuator, and it other cases as a concentrator for both internally and externally generated signals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was actually just reading a book on this yesterday!</p>
<p>There's so much stuff going on around you that if you were to actually consciously receive all of the data your brain takes in from all five senses it would overload and you'd have a killer headache. In order to mitigate this the brain has something called the human attentional system which makes sure that you pay attention to all the stuff you need to know without looking at every single thing.</p>
<p>The attentional system has four parts: You've got your two modes of consciousness, which are mind-wandering mode and central executive mode, you've got your attentional filter, which is responsible for deciding what you get to passively pay attention to and what you get to ignore, and you've got your attentional switch, which is what changes your brain in between the two modes of consciousness.</p>
<p>Your mind-wandering mode is your brain's default mode, and it's where you are when you're reading a book without getting anything from it. It's a stream-of-consciousness type deal, where neural networks and the thoughts they create connect with each other almost randomly, linked by small similarities that bridge thoughts together. Daydreaming and REM sleep are examples where your brain is almost completely in mind-wandering mode. This is your default mode because when you don't need to be paying attention to anything your brain tries to conserve its energy; <em>just like other parts of your body your brain runs on glucose, and when it runs low it gets tired, and you feel it.</em> That's why it's physically exhausting to take a four-hour exam; focusing takes effort and energy.</p>
<p>You central executive mode is what is popularly considered to be your consciousness: it's the part of your essence that pays direct attention to no more than four or five things at a time and in much more detail than any of the thoughts your mind-wandering mode spawns and connects. When you focus on something you bring it to the forefront of your central executive mind. This can be both voluntary and involuntary. An example of an involuntary focusing is when you hear a really loud noise that <em>your attentional filter has not come to expect as part of your natural environment</em>. It's impossible for you to not think about the sound and/or it's source. That's just the way we were built so we'd run away from scary animal sounds. Voluntary focus is literally when you try to focus on something: reading that book, trying to flip a water bottle perfectly, or reading an unnecessarily long Reddit post.</p>
<p>Your brain tries to conserve energy by staying in its mind-wandering mode whenever its central executive mode is not needed.
It manages this by</p>
<p>A) using its attentional filter, which decides what activates the attentional switch and what doesn't (i.e. what grabs your attention). </p>
<p>B) Delegating tasks to your mind-wandering mode, so that if something is familiar enough <em>you will do it in your sleep!</em> Well not really, but both sleep and these delegated tasks are managed by the same mode.</p>
<p>Your attentional filter works by detecting change. The longer a stimulus is active or the more familiar you are with it in general the less likely it is to grab your attention. If you're in a building right now think about the sound of the air conditioning unit, or the location of your tongue, or what your left middle finger is touching right now, or the fact that your brain will always delegate breathing and blinking to your mind-wandering mode unless you specifically think about it! These are all stimuli or processes that are either very familiar to you or have been present in your current environment for a long time. If it hasn't killed you in the past half hour it's probably not going to kill you now, so why bother giving it attention? Your attentional filter lets through alien or unexpected stimuli so you can decide whether those things will kill you or not.</p>
<p>Now to actually answer your question!</p>
<p>The longer you read a book the longer it remains a part of your environment. Therefore as time goes on your attentional filter will passively block out the book, which means your focus will need to be kept entirely by the central executive mind. This takes effort. Your brain wants to minimize effort, so it looks for ways to make this easier. You are probably a reader extraordinaire, so your brain decides to delegate the reading to your mind-wandering mode. That way you can read with minimal effort and think about something else at the same time. Unfortunately your mind-wandering mode is not very good at processing non-random information, so you just end up reading the words while not actually interpreting them while thinking about something else. So yes, it is due to a lack of focus.</p>
<p>If you have any more questions please ask me! I really like this topic and have the book right on my desk, so I can probably help you out. </p>
<p>Speaking of books, if you want a non-butchered explanation of this I recommend you read <em>An Organized Mind</em> by Daniel J. Levitin, specifically chapter two. But read the whole thing too because it's really cool.</p>
<p>tl;dr: you lose focus</p>
<p>Edit: yes, that's the book I was reading</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're talking about the &quot;keep reading but your mind wanders off&quot; effect. </p>
<p>1) When you're reading something, your brain is connecting content of your memory in a new or less frequently used way (there is also neurological basis for this, called Hebb's Rule: Neurons that are activated as a set are more likely to fire again if another neuron of that set is active). </p>
<p>2) For this to happen you need to be focused on the topic you're trying to read: You should think about the content you're reading, and &quot;do something with it&quot; in your mind (e.g., picture a scene, or try to summarize it internally). These are processes associated (among others) with working memory, and help the connection forming in 1). </p>
<p>3) Now imagine if instead of thinking about the content, your working memory is occupied with other thoughts, daydreams etc.: There are no connections being made in your knowledge base, because you're thinking about other stuff. You may read a page, but its content are never processed in a meaningful way. </p>

Neuroscience is a smushed together version of psychology, biochemistry , and physiology so I think this actually might address everything you're looking for. </p>
<p>There are a few concepts to help out here.
1) <em>Cognitive load</em> - We all have a set amount of cognitive power before we have to recharge and go to sleep or take a break. That's important because it underlies the need for our brain to take shortcuts in order to preserve cognitive capacity. The human brain has actually evolved to be really good at taking shortcuts (and some of them can lead us to bad conclusions -- heuristics are an example. An example of a heuristic is the availability heuristic. If you see violence on the TV all the time, you might come to the conclusion that that violent crime is on the rise in the US. This is not supported by facts though; it's just a result of your exposure to the violence on TV which is not representative of the true state of affairs). </p>
<p>Interestingly, due to the expensive learning principle, the more effort it takes to learn something the more likely you are to remember it. But I guess you've got to put that effort in first.

<p>Attitude toward a subject can influence how much effort how approachable something is for you too in addition to how much you retain.

<p>2) <em>Broadbent's Model of Selective Attention and Triesman's Attenuation Model</em> - It was postulated by Broadbent that in an early stage of processing stimuli we have a filter put in to evaluate the importance of stimuli of all sorts. This filter is there to help us reduce cognitive load. Triesman didn't think that that filter happened early on in processing, but he did want to acknowledge he ability to block out other stimuli to focus on one that's important to us. He was inspired to explain the Cocktail Effect which is where you can be talking to someone else at a party, hear your name and turn toward whoever is saying your name. There are also visual correlates to this phenomenon.

<p>3) <em>Interest and Retention of Information</em> - interestingly it has been found that attention isn't affected by interest or interesting things. But retention is. A positive correlation between interest and retention was observed. Humans are built to focus on the novel or interesting. It's a way for ancient humans to have not felt like they had to stay in one place forever despite dwindling resources -- we have the propensity to explore and expand. That makes us adaptable in many environments. We can also remember freaky new stuff in our new environments so we can keep surviving (maybe a new animal in a new environment is deadly to us -- uh-oh! Way better to have remembered that easily).

<p>As far as people drinking and not paying as much attention as another poster mentioned...this is because frontal lobe (executive functioning) activity is lowered with the release of GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) as a result of alcohol use (alcohol is a drug remember). Stimuli hit your optic tract and thalamus first and then go to your frontal lobe. Alcohol mucks up your balance/motor skills and probably vision a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised if because you're not processing physical input as well due to the GABA inhibitory effects that the signals that hit your parietal lobe (responsible for attention and focus+processing of visual stimuli) aren't so great and the signals from the frontal lobe don't do as well when they're communicated to the hippocampus which helps in learning and memory. I also wouldn't be surprised if you got people to take benzodiazepines or another depressant and saw similar effects.  </p>
<p>Fatigue can lower the control that the frontal lobe exhibits too. Ever been slap happy from lack of sleep? Well, there you go. </p>
<p>&quot;There are at least 5 metabolic causes of fatigue, a decrease in the phosphocreatine level in muscle, proton accumulation in muscle, depletion of the glycogen store in muscle, hypoglycaemia and an increase in the plasma concentration ratio of free tryptophan/branched-chain amino acids.&quot;
Source: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-abstract/48/3/477/297753" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-abstract/48/3/477/297753</a></p>
<p>I know that phosphocreatine is necessary in muscle to help phosphorylate  the kinases that eventually tack on an ATP on myosin heads. Those myosin heads, along with troponin, respond to an influx of Ca2+ into the muscle and that's how you move those muscles. In the process ATP is hydrolysis to ADP and energy is harvested from this conversion. The phosphocreatine shuttle is in the mitochondria even though phosphocreatine comes from the liver and arrives via blood to muscle cells. Phosphocreatine -- important stuff. </p>
<p>I bet that tryptophan and branched chain amino acids are important for some reasons I'll list. Tryptophan is useful for various enzyme pocket stabilizations due to its polar nature and hydrogen bonding capabilities (Nitrogens). If there's an amino acid you'd like to have for some good reactions it's tryptophan. Tryptophan also is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan which is then directly converted to seratonin. Gut serotonin has been shown to help regulate metabolism Source: <a href="https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gastrojournal.org%2Farticle%2FS0016-5085%2815%2900714-3%2Ffulltext&rc=0&code=ygast-site" target="_blank">https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gastrojournal.org%2Farticle%2FS0016-5085%2815%2900714-3%2Ffulltext&rc=0&code=ygast-site</a> </p>
<p>Tryptophan also has some hydrophobic parts which are nice for passing cell membranes (cell membranes have a phosphate head attached to squiggly tails made of triglycerides which are hydrophobic and &quot;like dissolves like&quot;) It's been used to help deliver drugs to rats with Alzheimer's so it can actually weasel its way across the blood brain barrier with some efficacy Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3389492/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3389492/</a> The BBB is a tough hack (a good thing because your brain is kiiiinda important! Additionally, antibodies are too big to pass through the blood brain barrier. All your brain can do is produce an inflammatory response and swell up which is sort of bad if you've got limited elbow room (read: your skull). It can swell so much that it bruises itself! That's why an infection in the brain is extra no bueno. </p>
<p>Branched chain amino acids participate as intermediates in certain metabolic processes; they're also used to stabilize proteins involved in metabolic regulation Source:<a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/1/207S.full.pdf" target="_blank">http://jn.nutrition.org/content/136/1/207S.full.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is speculative but I think I might be onto something here. I would have to look more into the mechanism of action to confirm which I'd love to do if anybody requests it!!</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia is low blood sugar which translates to lower glucose in the blood and glucose is everybody's favorite way to get energy by generating ATP through glycolysis, the Citric acid cycle which is then finally followed by electron chain transport. </p>

<p>Every 2-5 pages, close the book and attempt to &quot;recall&quot; the general concept of what you've read, from memory.
This is often referred to as <strong>generation</strong> by some psychologists, it <strong>forces your brain to stay focused</strong> as it's <strong>chemically/physically working</strong> to recall the information you've just read.</p>
<p>You'll find that it'll take you longer to read a book, but after 1 read through (cover to cover) you'll be able to recall upto 50% more of what you've read than someone who hasn't deployed this technique.</p>
<p>My reason for sharing this &quot;hidden secret&quot; of studying is I wish I knew about it when I was younger (sitting my A-Levels) as opposed to discovering it mid-way through my Degree. I could've saved myself so many hours, and attained such higher grades.</p>
