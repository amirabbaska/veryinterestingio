If you wanted to ensure your own great-grandchildren would know your medical history, how do you ensure its survivability and retrievability? Literacy needs to be combined with resilient materials. Tombstones last longer than wooden crosses, but even stone erodes to illegibility. And how to convey the location of the stone to a mobile population (now globally)? Songs tend to last, but even they get fuzzy and changed. Carl Sagan sent out the planet's info on a disk made of gold because it doesn't corrode. But first someone's gotta find it, and then they have to understand the writing &amp; meaning. My favorite thought exercise is the real problem of warning people for the next 10,000 years not to dig up buried radioactive waste. How can you ever ensure the info will survive that long?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The entire point of burying the tomb somewhere in the desert was to prevent thieves from raiding it.  They were deliberately concealed to make it harder to tomb looters to find.  This is part of the reason King Tut's tomb was so valuable - it was literally the only tomb that hadn't already been robbed.</p>
<p>Also, something to keep in mind is that the Egyptian civilization lasted around 3100 years (if you measure it from Narmer to Cleopatra VII).  That is a <em>long damn time</em> and the average person of that period was not exactly renowned for their skills in literacy.</p>
<p>A few more points:</p>
<p>(1) Tut reigned around 1300 BC.  That makes him older than the Trojan War, and people are still arguing over whether <em>that</em> was even a real thing.</p>
<p>(2) Tut was not &quot;the most important thing to any Egyptian.&quot;  The only reason we remember him today was because his tomb was recovered intact.  Tut was not an important King.  Compared to other pharaohs, he was practically a footnote.  The average Egyptian peasant probably didn't know, or even <em>care</em>, who he was or where he was buried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>War.</p>
<p>Empires transitioning/collapsing/being sacked/etc. was kind of a huge problem back before the printing press was invented. Books (the #1 method of remembering shit until fairly recently) were painstaking, expensive, and extremely time-consuming to make. And even then, with so many scribes that could be working, you have to consider how a massive majority of the industry revolved around printing one thing and really one thing only: religious texts. So, a lot of things that they needed more copies of may have been put on the wayside while they met demand for churches and other important organizations. The fact that the church had a huge control over literature for a long period didn't help with maintaining consistency either.</p>
<p>So 'alchemy' and chemistry formulas, like the true composition of &quot;Greek Fire&quot;, blueprints and building secrets, medical procedures, agricultural works, etc. etc. that were handmade, hand-copied, hand-bound, and kept mostly all in one place (large scholarly libraries, which were not very common...) would get lost by fire, theft, smashed into the rubble, or deliberately destroyed in order to keep the information out of the belligerents' hands (which is sort of okay if the guy who wrote or provided for it was still alive, which may not always be true). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I was wondering about the failure mechanism of most of the drops. It seems like the drop weathered the bullet strike, but the force that it absorbed resulted in the tip of it breaking off somehow. Was this due to the transfer of force along the drop, or was it from it being suspended by the tip on the line and the bullet jostled it enough to cause it to break?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Weight, on the other hand, is usually just a way to represent the mass of the object in terms easier for people to understand.  After all, these bodies are all in free fall, so their mass is the relevant metric.  This can be estimated by applying our general knowledge of the composition of celestial bodies, but it's also extremely common to measure the gravitational interactions between bodies to estimate their size - gravity is, after all, a product of mass.  When we describe a celestial body as &quot;weighing&quot; a certain amount, it's usually just what it would weigh in standard Earth gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given how far it is and how big it is in the sky we can find the volume of a star easily. It's just the volume of the sphere.</p>
<pre><code>
The mass of the star is a bit harder to find. Fortunately, stars lie in a (somewhat) narrow mass range depending on what type of star it is and what color it is (this is due to 5 very messy nested differential equations). If you are not familiar with the H-R graph, it plots the luminosity of a bunch of stars against its color. 

The actual calculation of the mass has a lot of assumptions and computational methods involved. Basically a main sequence star has three significant regions: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. The central density and temperature of the core is assumed to be at a density and temperature range where Hydrogen (or helium) fusion is allowed (which is surprisingly narrow). The radiative zone and the convective zones both have a cut-off point. Using surface temperature, luminosity and a bunch of complicated math, we can figure out the change in density in radius, which we can then find the mass because we know the volume.

Again, most people just use a simplication because it turns out for at least for stars *in the main sequence*, the mass of the stars pretty much determines "what color/size/brightness" they are. This means we can guess how massive the star is just by its color. It makes sense since the way stars form are pretty standardized, and most of the variables regarding their creation are pretty unchanged except for mass. Think of starmaking as a stellar "machine" with one adjustable "knob".

Unfortunately, a lot of the variables themselves within the equations are assumed, like the central density of the star and the cutoff points of the zones. That's why we have such a high uncertainty for stellar masses.
</code></pre>
<p>It gets much easier if we have a star orbiting a &quot;standardized&quot; stellar object like a white dwarf, a neutron star or other &quot;stellar candles&quot;. This is because all we need to know about the system is the mass of the stellar object and its orbital mechanics. White dwarves and neutron stars are by &quot;design&quot; in a VERY narrow mass range. Their mass is also pretty easy to calculate, since they are usually elemental. We then use those stars to set &quot;standards&quot; for what each star of that specific color should be in the range of.</p>

<p>What you've missed is the fact that when you receive blood from a donor it's &quot;only&quot; the erytrocytes that you receive, the erytrocytes have been separated from the plasma and thus separated from antibodies.
This also means that AB is the universal plasma donor!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And the pain is not just from surgically repaired areas. Even the &quot;ole football&quot; type injures become sore as well. </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no full agreement among scientists that weather causes pain, or if a specific mechanism is at fault, Jamison says. But there are plausible theories.</p>
<p>One leading theory points to changes in air pressure. Although many people say that their pain worsens with damp, rainy weather, research has shown that it's not the cold, wind, rain, or snow, Borenstein says. &quot;The thing that affects people most is barometric pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Barometric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere that surrounds us.</p>
<p>If you imagine the tissues surrounding the joints to be like a balloon, high barometric pressure that pushes against the body from the outside will keep tissues from expanding.</p>
<p>But barometric pressure often drops before bad weather sets in. This lower air pressure pushes less against the body, allowing tissues to expand -- and those expanded tissues can put pressure on the joint. &quot;It's very microscopic and we can hardly notice, except that we have these sensations,&quot; Jamison says.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok I did some actual literature searching.</p>
<p>Most published studies seem to read more or less the same conclusion as this one : <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20570193/?i=5&from=/15229951/related" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20570193/?i=5&from=/15229951/related</a></p>
<p>&quot;CONCLUSION: The studies to date do not show any consistent group effect of weather conditions on pain in people with RA. There is, however, evidence suggesting that pain in some individuals is more affected by the weather than in others, and that patients react in different ways to the weather. Thus, the hypothesis that weather changes might significantly influence pain reporting in clinical care and research in some patients with RA cannot be rejected.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm an air traffic controller and a big part of my job is controlling medevac helicopters transitioning through the airspace. We aren't supposed to give the aircraft altitude adjustments because if someone is bleeding in the aircraft, changing the aircraft's altitude a few hundred feet can mean the difference of a person remaining stable and a person bleeding out.  </p>
<p>This is sad when you think about helpless pilots in Afghanistan when they fly out of steep terrain. Those pilots know what's going on behind them and know that clearing the ridge by climbing 1,000 ft is going to kill his passengers.  </p>
<p>At my last base, we were one of the busiest airports for VFR traffic in the country, working 12-14 aircraft in a pattern was almost a daily occurrence(for tower, that's pretty damn busy).  I've had situations where we have been busy as shit and a medevac helo called needing to cut straight through my airspace with a critical casualty. I've made blanket broadcasts telling all the aircraft at once to change their altitude and 'race track' just so medavac can get through without any issues; it's that important that they don't climb.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barometric pressure.  Injuries never heal perfectly (yet).  When the barometric pressure changes, you are getting stretched or compressed.  The scar tissue does the same, but at a different rate than surrounding non-damaged areas.  That makes it hurt.  The greater the change, the more pain.  Once the barometric pressure stabilizes, the stretching and compressing stops and everything goes back to &quot;normal&quot;.  That's why it hurts before the storm, but not necessarily during or after...at least for me.</p>
<p>Arthritis works under a similar method.  Any currently inflamed tissue will ache because some level of damage is occurring - sort of like tugging at a big cut on your arm.  Leave it be and the pain will stop.  Keeping tugging and it will keep hurting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No matter how perfectly you play, some games will force you to occasionally have to make a guess, as is the case in the image that I linked too.</p>
<p>If we can assume that we have a perfect player, who always makes the most highest probability selections (in other words, if there is a 100% &quot;safe&quot; square, it will always pick that before attempting to guess on a 50/50 safe square, and if there is a square that has a 2/3 chance of being safe, it will pick that before picking a square that has a 50/50 chance of being safe, then what would percentage of wins would the &quot;perfect player&quot; most likely approach?</p>
<p>Other assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first click will never result in a mine exploding --&gt; the game is generated AFTER you click your first square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mine placement is completely random, except for the first clicked square.</p>
</li>
<li>The Mines can not change position after the board has been determined on the first click.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you describe this perfect play? In game theory, a solution to a game is optimal if it perfectly maximizes your chances of winning. But even coming up with a candidate solution for a game like Minesweeper is difficult. </p>
<p>Say your first click reveals a lone 1. What's the best way to proceed? Should you hunt down the 1? Should you click somewhere else randomly? Should it be a combination of the two? Can you generalize this into any scenario that requires guessing (e.g. a good strategy might have you only guess based on estimated probabilities of hitting a mine at a given spot, given known information about adjacent markers and the number of mines remaining in the game). How do you account for every kind of advanced technique, like looking at many adjacent markers to figure out which spots can or cannot have mines? You might not realize it, but there's a ton of complexity to this game, and even coming up with a good general strategy for playing Minesweeper would be difficult. Trying to prove your strategy was the solution would be even harder. Then and only then could you understand how often &quot;perfect play&quot; will succeed at the game. </p>
<p>For reference, in total there are (480 choose 99) or about 5.6x10^104 possible game boards. That's a lot of possibilities to account for - far too many to have a computer actually check them all. </p>
<p>EDIT: My scenarios clearly were too simplified (yes, you go for a spot adjacent to the 1), so try this one on for size. You've reached a scenario where you have to guess because there are no spots that can be determined as either 0% or 100% chance of a mine. Almost everyone so far has been fixating on probabilities, assuming that the optimal strategy will be to always guess at the least likely spot, because it has the least chance of blowing up and immediately ending the game. However, I suggest that sometimes, it will be better to guess at a higher-probability spot. What if one of those spots has a small chance of containing a mine, but clicking on it wouldn't reveal enough information to allow you to continue, so you'd then have to make another guess. Meanwhile, you could have originally chosen a more illuminating but higher probability spot. </p>
<p>In the first strategy, although you are always guessing &quot;optimally&quot;, you might be exposing yourself to unnecessary risk. The combination of multiple guesses might make you more likely to explode than taking the second strategy and making only a single, more effective, yet higher probability guess. </p>
<p>As a more concrete example, revisit the lone 1 scenario. Is it truly better to click on one of the adjacent tiles? Or is it better to click on a tile a short distance away in order to gain a better understanding of the game board? What nearby tile do you choose? Can you mathematically prove one or the other gives you better chances of success on average? </p>
<p>This is just one such complication. Yes, you could use a Monte Carlo approach to approximate the win percentage of a player who always chose the probability-optimal tile. But this won't necessarily constitute a solution to the game, as there are many other strategies which may beat this immediate optimum over the long run. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

People who play for speed always guess when it's faster - even if you could uncover tiles later that make the solution apparent. (source: my best time is 70)</p>
<p>Needless to say, the new version with a pop-up after every game is unplayable.</p>
<p>In order to have the best chance of winning, though, you couldn't simply rely on which square had the best odds.  Often times, if you say have a small square revealed or a wall going from one side of the board to another, the best 'odds' may be any square in the great grey sea.  But some of these squares will synergize better with the squares you've already revealed.</p>
<p>Also, it might be a technical note but in at least one version of the game, the board is generated before the click and is then possibly modified by the location of the first click.  A cheat that changes the upper-left pixel of the monitor demonstrates this.  I'm not sure how the new mine is chosen - randomly or the first available space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Two main reasons; weight and their skin. Sea mammals that don't normally venture on to land, like dolphins and whales, aren't built to carry their body weight and would get crushed under their own girth. For the ones small enough to survive their own weight for a bit, they still need to be kept wet and somewhat shaded as they can suffer burns or dehydrate quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really anything else that proposes a ToE. String Theory isn't some crazy invention. If you start with the Standard Model and try to expand it to start including gravity or to unify the Strong interaction with the Electroweak interaction, you inevitably come across failed theory after failed theory after failed theory. String Theory is the simplest approach that unifies gravity and the gauge theories (Strong and Electroweak) without failing other requirements.</p>
<p>There are a handful of theories that attempt to quantize gravity and connect it to the standard model, but those aren't ToEs. They are just quantum gravity theories.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown.</p>
<p>The simplest extension of the SM is supersymmetry. It is a system that identifies bosonic particles to fermionic particles and identifies them as two different aspects of one object. This is a very natural and theoretically satisfying theory that many think will be the next experimentally verified piece of fundamental physics (although many don't.) </p>
<p>Susy has nothing to do with a ToE, however. It simply proposes some new particles (i.e. one that can be identified as a fantastic candidate for dark matter) and can simplify a few mathematical oddities in the standard model.</p>
<p>We also have a topic called grand unification. We have a history of finding ways to merge different branches of physics. Starting with electricity and magnetism merging to become electromagnetism, space and time merging to become spacetime under the influence of the equations of electromagnetism, QM and relativity to become quantum field theory. The same principle that defines electromagnetism mathematically also perfectly defines the weak theory and the strong theory. The weak and electromagnetic interactions merge to form the electroweak theory. Grand unification proposes that somehow the Strong and Electroweak theories merge to form a merged one unified interaction that splits into the rest.</p>
<p>However, GUTs (grand unified theory) just don't work. I haven't really studied GUTs in any detail, but the most popular version is pretty much excluded because it predicts that Protons decay into other particles. In the history of physics, there has been a grand total of 0 measurements of decaying Protons. This pretty much rules out a simple GUT.</p>
<p>Another approach is called supergravity. Supergravity takes supersymmetry and applies a subtle mathematical principle that occurs elsewhere in physics and just so happens to spit out the equations for gravity on top of supersymmetry. However, it requires that the number of dimensions is expanded to 11 and (much worse) it fails completely because the theory is &quot;non-renormalizable.&quot; That means that when you try to do calculations with supergravity you find spurious infinities popping up all over the place which, obviously, ruins your ability to calculate anything. IE when trying to make a prediction for the experiments at CERN you find the probabilities are nonsensically infinity.</p>
<p>So, no luck yet. We have a maybe result saying that Susy could possibly exist but it hasn't been found and has some other unsatisfying predictions. We have to find a new approach.</p>
<p>So we get creative. So we turn to String Theory. Our normal standard model is based off quantum field theory. </p>
<p>Quantum field theory studies the interactions of quantized 1,2 or 4 dimensional fields that are functions of 4 variables on a 4 dimensional spacetime. A natural thing to attempt is to vary some of the these numerical values. </p>
<p>Varying the first values (1,2,4) gives us different particles. The 1 value is, for example, a particle like the Higgs boson. The 2 value could be a neutrino or electron. The 4 value could give us a photon. We've exhaustively studied this variation.</p>
<p>Next, we try to vary the next numerical value: the &quot;4 variables.&quot; When that value says 1, we are looking at a simple particle theory. This doesn't do anything useful and can be made to be just a more cumbersome version of quantum field theory. Changing that value to 2 gives us strings. When we analyze the theory with the value 2, we miraculously find that it accidentally spits out gravity. With some messaging and adding supersymmetry we find it also spits out the all of our fermions and all of our bosons. However, we find that this theory also fails. That is unless we vary the &quot;4 dimensional spacetime&quot; to be 11 dimensional. Now it still provides gravity and all our particles, but it also includes some incredible mathematical niceties that are absent from the standard model which are more complicated to explain.</p>
<p>String theory has TONS of problems, but it really is our only approach that unifies everything. Nothing has invalidated String theory while all these other theories have been invalidated. So it's our simplest approach at a unifying theory. I'd say there's still a 50% chance that it's entirely wrong, but there isn't a great competing candidate anyways.</p>
<p>I hope this made sense, I probably was just rambling incoherently. But oh well!</p>
<p>Also, on a technical note to any string theorists: I didn't study ST, I studied Loop Quantum Gravity and quit before finishing my PhD. Feel free to make corrections as I only have studied ST/SG in my spare time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example, my bachelor thesis was (in part) about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F(R\)_gravity" target="_blank">f(R) gravity</a>, a theory that generalizes our accepted, experimentally verified theory of gravity. You might have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry" target="_blank">Supersymmetry</a>, a further generalization of our Standard model of particle physics.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: Damn, not sure if I have misinterpeted the question. Neither f(R) gravity nor Supersymmetry are candidates for a theory of everything. I just used them as examples that there is an insane amount of alternate theories you maybe have never heard of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so a lot of these posts don't really answer the question. OP wants to know what other candidates there are for TOEs besides String Theory. A lot of the posts on here don't even come close to being TOEs, they are for the most part either useful tools with applications in theoretical physics (e.g. Hairy Ball Theory and Invariant Set Postulate) or generalizations of existing theories (e.g. F(R) gravity and SUSY) that do expand on the theory but don't actually achieve (or, quite frankly, even <em>try</em> [at least intrinsically]) anything close to a TOE.</p>
<p>As for OP: The reason why you rarely hear of alternatives to String Theory is because there really isn't one. There are alternatives to <em>individual components</em> of ST (e.g. quantum loop gravity is an alternative quantum gravity hypothesis, and is arguably ST's biggest competitor with respect to quantum gravity), but insofar as I am aware, there is no hypothesis or as-of-yet proposed model besides ST that is capable (or really even attempts to) of unifying everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>He spent the rest of his life working on his Theory of Everything. A lot of his predictions are hard to confirm, but many of his predictions for the weights of certain subatomic particles were surprisingly close to what ended up being measured. It has been mostly dismissed for a lot of issues that more mathematically minded people could go into more clearly.</p>
<p>But he developed his own flavor of Calculus differentials for it, and it utilizes 6th dimensional spaces. One of his big motivators was his obsession with wanting to develop a way to travel through space and Heim Theory allows you to (in really simplified terms) to use extremely powerful magnetic forces to make a Star Wars style Hyperdrive. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my mind, there are two categories of unusable characters: reserved characters and the rest of them, which I'll call disallowed characters.</p>
<p>Reserved characters are characters used by the filesystem itself.  For example, most Unix filesystems separate directories/folders by using a slash ('/'), and mark the end of a name using a null character (0x00).  They don't allow you to use these characters because using them would be stepping on the toes of how the filesystem itself stores data about filenames. (In regards to the slash, it really has more to do with how the OS delimits paths rather than the filesystem itself.)</p>
<p>Other characters are arbitrarily disallowed, usually to avoid confusion.  In Windows, those characters include the asterisk('<em>'), question mark('?'), doublequote('&quot;'), less than ('&lt;'), greater than ('&gt;'), and pipe ('|').  While these characters don't mean anything special to the filesystem itself, they mean special things to the command shell.  In order to prevent a user from getting in a confusing situation where a file is named &quot;`</em>.txt<code>" and then running "</code>del *.txt<code>" ends up deleting more files than intended, Windows decided to prevent the user from getting in this situation by preventing the use of those characters in filenames.  (Unix systems do not have this restriction.)  I suspect that Windows also includes ('/') in this category.  It looks like the backslash ('\\') directory delimiter, but it's probably avoided because command options are started with a slash, as in "</code>dir /w`&quot;.</p>
<p>Windows also disallows the colon (':'), which has special meaning to the OS.  It actually indicates that the name that preceded it is a device.  Drive letters are the obvious examples, but there are a number of others, including &quot;CON&quot; (the console), &quot;LPT1&quot; (through at least 3, which are printers), &quot;PRN&quot; (also a printer), and some others that I'm forgetting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some special characters mean something in the code used to make the file system. It would be possible to make the system work around this, but it's easier and safer to just prevent you from using such characters.</p>
<p>For example, a filepath might be C:\Users\MrMeltJr\Photos\pepes\le_rarest_pepe.jpeg</p>
<p>This means that the file le_rarest_pepe.jpeg is in the folder pepes, which is in the folder Photos, which is in MrMeltJr, which is in Users, which is on the C drive. Now, if I named the file le\rarest\pepe.jpeg, the computer would now think it's a file called pepe.jpeg in a folder called rarest, which is in a folder called le, and so on. But none of those folder exist, so it can't find the file. Like I said, it's possible to code things so that it can tell the difference between weird file names and actual filepaths, but it that would make the system slower (since it has to run through those extra checks every time you do pretty much anything with any file) and it's less reliable (since it's just more opportunities for something to go wrong). Safer and easier to just prevent those characters from being used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Operating system uses this characters as templates. For example, for searching files by parts of its name, for redirecting input/output streams, and as path delimiters.</p>
<p>If you want to find some files on your disk but can't remember how used word 'color' or 'colour', you can use this template: &quot;colo?r&quot; (without quotes and with question mark).
Here question mark used as replacement for one symbol (any allowed) or its absence. Results can be: &quot;color&quot;, &quot;colour&quot;, &quot;colo7r&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>Slash/Backslash symbols used on different platforms (windows/Linux/web) as path delimiters.
Windows: &quot;C:\games\game1.exe&quot; - sounds like &quot;go to 'C:' (look at another special symbol) drive then 'games' directory inside and find file named 'game1.exe'&quot; inside this folder.
Linux: &quot;/usr/bin/games/game1.exe&quot; - means the same but Linux isn't using drive letters.
Web: &quot;ftp://pub/docs/doc56.txt&quot; - 'ftp' is a file transfer protocol, 'pub' and 'docs' are folders, 'doc56.txt' is a filename.</p>
<p>Definition of some symbols can be different for different contexts. You can find all of the symbols and its description and use-cases by googling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The crane base has four long flaps (from the four corners of the paper) and one short one (from the center of the square), and those form the head, tail, wings, and back of the traditional crane. A folder who knows this base might decide to use it to make some other kind of bird, or a dragon, fish, etc. Other traditional bases have other numbers and arrangements of flaps that suggest other animals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
