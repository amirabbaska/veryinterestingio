		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there, pharmacist here. The most general way to understand the skin, drug absorption, lotions, and so forth is to think about how oil and water don't (easily) mix. To cross the skin barrier from outside of your skin to the inside, generally any molecule has to cross an outer lipophilic layer (which likes fat), then through a hydrophilic layer (which likes water), and then through an inner lipophilic layer. Some transdermal (across the skin) delivery systems can even increase the permeability of the skin, making it easier for molecules to get across. To address your initial question with creams and lotions, remember oil and water. The goal is to increase hydration or rather, to avoid moisture loss. So lotions on a basic level restore water. And if you put something occlusive (a lipophilic barrier like a layer of Vaseline, creams which have oils and fats in them to do the same, a bandage, etc.), you basically trap water in your skin. This is why lotions and creams work better if you put them on when your skin is still damp from a shower or bath - you trap more moisture. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are 2 kinds of moisturizers. The first is occlusive, which is a physical barrier preventing moisture from escaping. (Petroleum jelly, oils, silicones etc.) The second type is humectant, which draws moisture towards itself. (Glycerin, hyaluronic acid etc.) Most moisturizers in the market are composed of a mixture of occlusive and humectant ingredients so that moisture gets actively attracted to the surface of your skin and gets trapped by the occlusive barrier, unable to escape back out into the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the costs of producing gasoline are separate from the price of crude oil, which is the price you are thinking of.  Crude oil is what comes out of the ground.  To get at it, you have to drill.  Drilling costs money.  That cost doesn't really drop based on the value of the crude oil; it is dependent on the costs of labor, machinery, bits, etc...  Once out of the ground, the crude oil has to be transported to a refinery.  Getting it there costs money, either paying trucks or ships or paying for access to pipelines (usually a combination of the two).  The cost of transportation does depend a little on the price of gas, but also depends on the costs of labor/equipment/pipeline access, etc....  Once the crude oil is at the refinery, it gets refined into the various oil products, including gasoline.  That costs money.  That cost doesn't totally depend on the value of crude oil, but rather on the capacity of refining and the supply of oil.  Once it is refined into gasoline, it need to be transported to various gas stations around the world.  That cost depends a little on the price of gas, but also on the cost of labor/equipment.  Finally, governments tax gas like crazy.  Those taxes don't go down when the price of crude oil goes down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR - Salt doesn't make ice colder.  What you're going for in both cases is a state change - you want liquid water, not solid water (ice) - without having to compromise the temperature.</p>
<p>Unless you have some continuous source of coolant (like my buddies at work that used to make iced cream with Liquid Nitrogen, lol) the ice you have is all the coolant you'll get, so you'll want to freeze the iced cream quickly before the elements warm the coolant (ice/water) beyond usefulness.  </p>
<p>In order to best transfer the heat away from the ingredients into the ice, you want the <em>highest possible surface area</em> of the spinning aluminum container to contact the coolant.  Ice cubes aren't that great, crushed ice or party ice is better (smaller chunks), but ultimately liquid is best.  You could use glycol or something, but the most available and safest liquid is water.  If you want to get water cold enough to freeze the iced cream without freezing into a solid block itself, you have to add salt to lower the freezing point.  Fun fact, ice rinks use a salt water (brine) which run through pipes in the concrete beneath the ice surface in order to maintain the temperature at around 19 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Salt does the same think to ice on sidewalks, except the motivation there is that you just don't want solid water (ice) around.  Liquid water will flow away and reduce the hazard/obstacle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the case of the ice cream maker, there's always at least a thin layer of liquid between the cream container and the solid ice, so colder liquid water means more heat transfers out of the ice cream and into the liquid water (so the ice cream freezes fast enough to freeze the air bubbles into the mix which is why ice cream has such great texture).  </p>
<p>In the case of the sidewalks, colder liquid water means more ice melts and flows off the sidewalk and melting continues at lower temperatures, reducing the slipping hazard.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are both the same reason!  It's a really good question.</p>
<p>Salt makes the freezing point of water lower.  That means when you throw it on ice, it tends to melt the ice.  Even in the Ice Cream machine.  What happens is the solid =&gt; liquid process (melting) requires a small amount of energy (the heat of fusion) even if the temperature stays the same.</p>
<p>In the sidewalk case, the large heat capacity of the sidewalk, driveway, Earth under the ice, ... gives up this heat without changing temperature.</p>
<p>In the Ice Cream machine case, the ice is insulated from a large source of heat (by the ice cream machine's bucket).  This means there is no good source of heat and the heat of fusion much come from the ice and the ice cream inside the can.  The ice melts faster, even though it is driving the temperature down from the melting poinf of plain ice to the melting point of ice in salt water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt lowers the melting point of water.</p>
<p>As a result of this, some of it melts. </p>
<p>Something people don't often consider about the act of melting ice is that it takes energy. To change ice at 0C into water at 0C, you need to add about 333Kj/Kg of water, which is quite a bit. This energy has to come from somewhere, and since everywhere is cold, somewhere has to get colder. </p>
<p>This means both the water that's formed and the remaining ice cool off to make up for the difference in energy, and because converting a kilo of ice to water takes about the same amount of energy as heating that water from 0C to 80C, the temperature drop is quite steep for a given amount of water formed.</p>
<p>This is also why the salted ice cube challenge is stupid. You're pressing ~-20C water up against your skin, frostbite is fast at that temperature with that much thermal conductivity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! Here is as ELI5 as I can make it:</p>
<p>Imagine the spinal cord as a thin wire that branches into smaller wires at body side of things. The tip of each branched portion is responsible for delivering messages corresponding to different kinds of stimuli (touch/pain/temperature etc.). Because the spinal cord is thin (keep in mind this is simplified), different signals compete to travel up the spinal cord and be &quot;felt.&quot;</p>
<p>To address your question directly, muscle soreness is helped by rubbing because rubbing introduces a new kind of stimuli. Before rubbing, dull pain stimulus from your muscle soreness was moving up the spinal cord uncontested. After rubbing, the dull pain is competing with your new touch input. Thus you &quot;drown out&quot; the pain signal with touch signal.</p>
<p>Rubbing a cut doesn't work the same way because your input is activating both the touch and the pain receptors in that area. In such regions, pain receptors are often hyperactive, which causes them to outcompete other input.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>(Some of the more astute neuroscientists will realize that I left out Lateral Inhibition, but I'll let you Google that on your own)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles soreness (often called DOMS) occurs when muscles perform eccentric or lengthening contractions such as in your biceps when you lift weights or in your hamstrings when running. These contractions cause microscopic tears which trigger an immune reaction by the body to try and heal itself. This reaction - inflammation - lowers the pain threshold of the nerves so that they are more sensitive to pain. The reason the body responds this way (aka causes pain) is so that we are aware of the injury and more careful when using it. Essentially, sore muscles are caused by micro tears in a muscle and the body responds with inflammation which leads to pain. </p>
<p>Massaging sore muscles helps to relieve muscle pain for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Massaging helps reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines (proteins that cause inflammation).</li>
<li>Massaging has been shown to increase the production of mitochondria in a cell, which aid in tissue recovery. </li>
<li>Massaging sore muscles also provides some of the same benefits as stretching: namely increasing flexibility and relaxing the contracted muscle. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you have an acute injury such as a cut or burn, your nerves react in a similar way as they do in sore muscles, by becoming inflamed and more sensitive to pain. However, touching an acute injury can be incredibly painful compared to the pain of massaging a sore muscle. The reason for this is twofold. First and most importantly, the nerves in a cut or burn are exposed to the elements. When you touch a cut or burn you are directly touching these nerves, whereas when you massage a sore muscle the nerves are far beneath the surface of your skin. Secondly, there are generally more pain receptor nerve ending on the surface of your skin because that is where the body interacts with the environment. This is especially true for areas like your fingertips or face. </p>
<p>TLDR: Massaging sore muscles helps to reduce inflammation and therefore reduce pain and increases the production of microconidia which aid in tissue recovery. When you touch an open wound you are <em>directly</em> touching nerves that are already inflamed and overly sensitive due to injury. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are sick you get increased mucus production. The mucus covers the surfaces inside your throat and is usually not an issue. However if you have too much it can start to flow and clump up. When you cough you push these clumps up the throat and it mixes with the rest of the mucus. This is why there might not come anything out. Making sure to clean out as much mucus as you can will help your breathing and reduce the coughing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of points in addition to those mentioned. There is continuous production of mucus in the lungs. There is a  ciliary (little hairs on cells) action that moves this up into the throat to be swallowed or expelled. Then there is mucus production in the nose that can drip posteriorly.
In addition to mucus, however, remember that when you have a cold or the flu there is usually viral infection and inflammation. This inflammation, the body's response to infection (and other insults), directly irritates the tissues and causes coughing presumably to accelerate expulsion of the insulting agent and mucus. This irritation can persist beyond the initial insult.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Breathing in is an active movement caused by your diaphragm flattening and your rib muscles lifting, breathing out is a passive movement, the relaxing following breathing in. So if your airways are inflamed and swollen when you have asthma or a chest infection the air that you have inhaled cannot leave as easily as it went into your lungs. So you cough to force the air out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From <em>Leviathan</em> by Thomas Hobbes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The imaginations of them that sleep are those we call ‘dreams.’ And these also, as also all other imaginations, have been before, either totally or by parcels, in the sense. And, because in sense, the brain and nerves, which are the necessary organs of sense, are so benumbed in sleep as not easily to be moved by the action of external objects, there can happen in sleep no imagination, and therefore no dream, but what proceeds from the agitation of the inward parts of man’s body; which inward parts, for the connection they have with the brain and other organs, when they be distempered, do keep the same in motion; whereby the imaginations there formerly made, appear as if a man were waking; <strong>saving that the organs of sense being now benumbed, so as there is no new object which can master and obscure them with a more vigorous impression, a dream must needs be more clear in this silence of sense than our waking thoughts.</strong> And hence it cometh to pass that it is a hard matter, and by many thought impossible, to distinguish exactly between sense and dreaming. For my part, when I consider that in dreams I do not often nor constantly think of the same persons, places, objects, and actions, that I do waking, nor remember so long a train of coherent thoughts, dreaming, as at other times, and because waking I often observe the absurdity of dreams, but never dream of the absurdities of my waking thoughts, I am well satisfied, that, &gt;being awake, I know I dream not, though when I dream I think myself awake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Real Eli-5</strong>: When there is an overwhelmingly bright light in your field of vision, this makes other lights appear dimmer. E.g. the sun preventing vision of the stars. Likewise, during the day, your sense impressions of the world (vision, hearing, touch etc.) are quite vigorous and incredibly constant, &quot;dimming&quot; the vividness of thought. At night, when the more bodily senses are sleeping, and the only thing you are doing is dreaming, your dreams appear much more vivid, just as the stars appear much brighter.</p>
<p>Another way of pointing this out is that there is an inverse relationship between the vividness of a &quot;day-dream&quot; and how much attention you're currently investing in the environment around you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The reality is that we simply don't know enough about dreams. Why do they exist? What function do they actually serve? What are we remembering when we wake up? What does a dream actually look like? None of this has been scientifically verified because you can't read someone's dreams, and the technology and neuroscience to study this just isn't there yet.

<p>Your consciousness while dreaming is very different than when you are awake. In dreams, you lose any distinction between yourself and your surroundings, whereas when awake, you seperate yourself from the world and act according to how you could be perceived by others. Dreams don't have that limitation and allow you to simply be (as part of and within the world). In dreams, your mind has no veto power over your body (no ego) and your instincts are the only form of free will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As in. If I dream I'm climbing a mountain I never reach the top. If I dream of exploring, I get lost. If I'm close to getting a girl or anything else desirable I never succeed. All my life I've had very vivid dreams and a few occurences of lucid dreaming. I dream a lot and tend to remember many of them.

As the nebula collapses under its own gravity, any tiny initial rotation in the cloud is amplified as it shrinks in size, just like a figure skater pulling in their arms to increase their rate of spin (conservation of angular momentum).  The nebula forms a disk as it collapses, because of the combination of gravity and centrifugal force: gravity points <em>towards</em> the <strong>center</strong> of the cloud, and centrifugal force points <em>away</em> from the <strong>axis of rotation</strong> of the cloud.  This means that on the &quot;equator&quot; of the cloud, these two forces point in opposite directions and partially cancel each other, but on the &quot;poles&quot; of the cloud, they are at right angles to each other, and there's nothing stopping gravity from flattening the cloud into a disk.  The sun forms in the middle of this disk, and the planets form around it, in the rotating disk, and so they all end up going in the same direction and in (nearly) the same plane. </p>

Hitting each other tends to average out the orbital plane of the remaining debris.  When you look at &quot;Planets&quot;, you are seeing the congealed clusters of debris from many, many collisions, averaged out until their remaining orbital elements are very, very similar.</p>
<p>The plane we ended up with by simple chance is the prevailing rotational element about the center of mass that was present in the previous ball of swirling gas that came before Sol.  If that gas was arranged slightly differently, we'd have a different orbital plane.</p>
<p>The reason we have &quot;planets&quot; instead of &quot;Rings&quot; (other than the asteroid belt) is that the Solar Wind blew away much of the extra gas, and anything that's not arranged in a plane with some spacing between circular orbits, has occasional gravitational interactions that cause their orbit to be unstable and collide with something eventually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In music production lingo, what you're looking for would be called a dynamic range compressor. They're used a lot with popular music to make it sound brighter, crisper, and louder, as well as to make it easier to hear over the din of an automobile or a bar. Dynamic range compression is an unpopular technique with audiophiles since its overuse can take away from the impact and fidelity of a piece of music, and even cause unwanted distortion in extreme cases.</p>
<p>I've often wondered why consumer audio systems don't just come with compressors built in, so the users can dial in the amount of compression they want. Personally, I'd end up using it a lot  more for movies and television than for music. It is a feature some audio systems have, but my best guess as to why they aren't standard is due to cost reasons, and because the general public doesn't know what it is. Another theory is that the music industry doesn't want people owning their own compressors, so that they can continue waging the loudness war and finding new ways to make their music stand out on the radio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this morning as I was the first to walk back into my freezing office after the holiday, I was reminded of an argument I used to have with my roommate when I lived in a drafty old house in upstate New York.  We would both leave the house for one to two weeks every Christmas, turning the thermostat down to something like 5C while we were away, and when we returned we would have to run the furnace full blast for about three days to get the house up to 22C again.  I would always suggest that it would be better leave the thermostat on something in the middle while were gone, like 15C, but he thought it was a waste of energy.  I argued that it took just as much energy to run the furnace continually for those three days when we returned than it did to maintain a modest temperature while we were away.  In reality, I have no idea, but I just hated those three days of feeling cold.</p>
<p>Obviously, this depends on lots of factors, like how cold it is outside and how long we are gone.  But in general, ignoring issues like pipes freezing, does it use more energy to maintain a moderate temperature for a long time and then heat it up for a short time, or to let something cool way down and then heat it up all the way?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of heat lost by an object to the environment is proportional to the temperature difference between the environment and the object.</p>
<p>So if the object is at 20C, while the environment is at freezing (0C), then the rate of heat loss will be twice as high than if the object was at 10C.</p>
<p>If you keep heating the house while you're away, you keep the temperature higher and the total heat loss during your away time will be higher. Whereas if you turn the thermostat down very low, the rate of heat loss will gradually slow down as the house becomes colder and colder.</p>
<p>The total amount of energy you consume during this absence and the reheating that follows will be equal to the amount lost. In the case where you keep heating your house, this energy loss will be higher than in the case where you don't heat your house at every point in time (except for the initial period where the temperature drops from the starting point to your &quot;something in the middle&quot; value, in which case the energy loss is equal in both cases).</p>
<p>So from basic physics, it will be more efficient to turn the heater down as much as possible (without risk of freezing pipes) and heat it back up upon return. To overcome the discomfort of returning to a cold home, consider a smart thermostat that can be programmed to reach the desired temperature when you return (and will start to heat before you get back). Some can even &quot;learn&quot; how long it takes to heat up your house specifically with repeated use, so that they start at the exact right time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the furnace off, in a climate where the temperature is below that of the building, heat will be lost to the environment. This loss of heat stops when both temperatures are equal. When heat is turned back on, the only heat that will be needed is equal to the heat originally stored by the structure. The heat loss would be greater if the building were warmer, so no, turn off furnace to stop fuel consumption is the more efficient strategy. Of course, it will take a long time to reheat and so you will feel colder than normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer depends on how long you are gone, how well insulated your house is, and what type of heating system you have.</p>
<p>For your specific case, with being in a drafty old house and gone for two weeks and with a large basement heater, it is almost certainly better to lower the thermostat while gone.</p>
<p>The house is going to constantly leak heat that the heater needs to pump back in. The rate of leaking will be determined by how well insulated your house is (not well in your case), and the temperature difference between your house and the outside air. The more leaking there is, the less you want to waste energy heating up your house. The longer you are gone, the more important this leak rate becomes.</p>
<p>Next up is how efficiently you can heat up to replace the leaking. To heat a house is more than just heating the air. The floors and walls and furniture also need to be heated up if you let the house cool down over a long period of time. If you have a very efficient heater, it is probably best to keep all those solid things at a reasonable temperature when gone for a day or two. If you have a very inefficient heater, then you will be burning energy just to keep something warm that doesn't need to be warm.</p>
<p>Basically, think about how often your heater is running on a normal basis then compare that to how long it takes to heat back up after being off for awhile. A heater in very cold places like NY might run for 15 minutes then turn off for 30 minutes. That becomes 32 cycles per day. If you are gone for 7 days, you have saved 224 cycles (56 hours of &quot;on&quot; time). Now, when you come back it takes 3 days at 100% &quot;on&quot; time, which is 72 hours. Maybe that isn't the most efficient way. But for 2 weeks you are saving 112 hours vs 72.</p>
<p>However, I'm doubting your heater is running 100% &quot;on&quot; for 3 days. That sounds like an exaggeration to make a point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been having a related argument with the operations manager at the non-profit I work with. We have a district heating system with a dual fuel (cordwood and limited electric) boiler. It supplies hot water to 7 houses, delivered through insulated underground pipes.</p>
<p>I argue that the boiler should be kept at least 160F, as that will make the radiators in the houses significantly more efficient. When the houses are satisfied they stop drawing water from the loop, thus making it easier to maintain that temperature. He, on the other hand, is happy to let the temperature drop to sometimes below 100F, which means that all the houses are pretty much continually drawing on the boiler to stay warm.</p>
<p>It's a tough nut to crack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
