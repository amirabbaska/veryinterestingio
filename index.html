<p>As Nick Knight explains for The Independent, your autonomic nervous system - the overarching system that controls other nervous systems like the sympathetic nervous system - kicks into gear, and causes a bunch of different reactions inside your body depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>This is the same system that controls your 'fight or flight' response along with other unconscious body functions like digestion. When this system switches to hyper mode, it first sends out oxygen all over your body to make it easier for you to punch something in the face, or run away in the opposite direction to safety.</p>
<p>To spread oxygen to all of your muscles, your body must first breathe it in. In an effort to take in more air, the nervous system tells the glottis - the opening in your throat that ushers air into lungs without taking food with it - to stay open for as long as possible. In other words, your throat opens wider than normal because a bigger opening means more air.</p>
<p>You don’t actually feel your glottis opening wide. If you did, everyday life would feel awfully strange. What you do feel, though, is muscle tension caused by your body trying to keep your glottis open even when you swallow.</p>
<p>Normally, when you aren’t crying, your glottis opens and closes when you swallow all day long. This ensures that food and spit go one way and air goes the other, with no mix-ups in between.</p>
<p>But, when you cry or are on the verge of crying, your glottis is trying to stay open, but gets forced close every time you swallow. This tension messes with the muscles in your throat, giving the sensation of a lump.</p>
<p>The lump feeling is actually referred to as globus sensation, and it happens to everyone in these stressful situations. Normally, this feeling dissipates quickly once you calm down and your glottis goes back to functioning like it used to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called a &quot;globus sensation&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact cause of globus sensation is uncertain. Some specialists believe that it is due to a problem with the co-ordination of the muscles involved in swallowing. Many muscles are involved in swallowing and they need to tense and relax in the correct sequence for swallowing to occur normally. In someone with globus sensation, when they try to swallow saliva, some of the swallowing muscles may not relax fully and so the sensation of a lump in the throat occurs. However, when food is swallowed, the food stimulates the muscles in a different way and normal muscle relaxation occurs.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two areas of thought that apply.  The first is for the enlisted and the second is for officers.</p>
<p>While there is a common duty to disobey orders that are &quot;illegal, immoral, or unethical&quot;, a further duty to steward and lead dissent is implied in the officer's oath versus the enlisted oath.</p>
<p>The enlisted oath expressly states that the enlisted will &quot;follow the orders of the President of the United States and the officers appointed over me&quot;.  The officer oath has no such passage.  Instead, officers are charged to &quot;protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic&quot;.  The latter oath is more akin to that taken by a federal office holder (cabinet member, Congressman, President, etc.).  This is further compounded by the fact that the officer oath contains the phrase, &quot;of the office about which I am about to enter&quot;.</p>
<p>That is, officers should hold Constitutional values above all else in their duties.  While enlisted should do the same, the big picture may not always be evident to them.  They are not charged to think second and third order effects of being told to, for example, mow the grass.  If that act itself is legal, moral, and ethical, they must comply.  Officers, by a reasonable measure, may decline to do so and decline for members under their command to do so if it can be reasonably defended that the act or operation as a whole is somehow of detriment to the Constitution.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: The President is just another dude who is responsible for defending the Constitution and serving the nation.  An important guy, but just a guy.  He is fallible and susceptible to the flaws of man.  Therefore, everyone swears fealty not to a man, but to the Constitution, the base document of our nation and ideals.  That way you would not break an oath if the President went crazy.  But you better be damn sure he went crazy before you disobeyed.  </p>
<p>Source: was a military officer and studied Constitutional law.</p>
<p>EDIT: It's been a while since I reenlisted a service member but I should have remembered that there is a part about supporting and defending the Constitution in the enlisted oath.  Rather the part about obeying orders is OMITTED from the officer's oath.  Obviously everyone should support and defend the Constitution.  The basic premise above, however, is the same.  The omission defaults an officer's charge to think critically about the larger picture.  Thanks to those in the comments that reminded me.</p>
<p>EDIT the second: In my opinion, no, there is no provision to overthrow the government or President based on an order that may be unlawful, unethical, or immoral.  You would be committing treason at that point.  There is a proper way to dissent -- through inaction if it doesn't pass the legal, ethical, and moral test.</p>
<p>EDIT the third: Thanks for the gold!</p>
<p>EDIT the fourth: KesselZero's comment below is a more succinct answer to the actual question at hand.  Basically, our Constitutional system of government has several redundant mechanisms to prevent a rouge (rogue) President.  </p>
<p>EDIT the fifth: I'm keeping my typo, dammit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, military commanders are supposed to disobey an order that is unconstitutional: no need for a coup.</p>
<p>In theory. Of course, if said commanders back the President anyway, that won't make any difference -- and it's not as if there's anyone else in a position to stop the military. This is the problem with a standing army, one which the US, in its early history, actively tried to avoid (hence the Second Amendment, which speaks of the need for a &quot;well-regulated militia&quot;). You should probably cross your fingers and hope we never have to find out.</p>
<p>Suppose the President suddenly announces that all presidential elections are cancelled, and that he is President for life. A blatantly illegal and unconstitutional act. What could happen?</p>
<p>Well, if things work correctly, either Congress or the Supreme Court, or both, will put a stop to that. For example, Congress could impeach the President -- effectively putting him on trial, and if found guilty, removing him from office. But what if things go really, horribly wrong. Perhaps Congress refuses to impeach. Maybe the President and those around him have been using personal and direct threats against Congressmen and their families (Hitler did something similar to ensure his rise to the top). For whatever reason, that mechanism has broken down, and those few brave souls who dare speak out are silenced, perhaps arrested or simply dismissed. Can the military stage a coup?</p>
<p>To be honest, if things have got to that stage, then the rule of law has irretrievably broken down anyhow: doing nothing at all would simply allow the totalitarian dictatorship to establish itself. And I would imagine an awful lot of civil unrest, as civilians opposed to the President protest and are met with those sympathetic to him, and that might be serious enough for the military to impose martial law, simply to restore some kind of order.</p>
<p>But here we're talking about a military coup, and military coups are not often good news. If you're lucky, a military coup might succeed in removing the dictatorship, and returning the country to civilian rule as quickly and painlessly as possible. If you're unlucky, a military coup simply replaces a civilian dictatorship with a military dictatorship.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the Constitution is set up to protect the peaceful transfer of power. Basically, the only way the government should ever change hands is through different candidates winning elections.</p>
<p>So while the armed forces swear to the Constitution, not the president, the Constitution itself includes a couple of methods (impeachment and the 25th amendment) by which a bad, crazy, sick etc. president can be removed and replaced. Ideally this would remove the need for the army to overthrow the president, because the other parts of our government (legislature and judiciary) could handle it. The problem with the armed forces doing it is that a.) it's not a peaceful transfer of power, and b.) the armed forces are now in charge of the government, which is bad.</p>
<p>Having the military swear to the Constitution also serves another purpose, which is to separate them from the president, even though he's the commander in chief. One important move that Hitler made when he came to power was to have the military stop pledging to serve Germany and start pledging to him personally. His hope was that their loyalty to him would lead them to follow his orders even if they were harmful to the nation or its citizens.</p>
<p>This fear goes back at least as far as ancient Rome, when (for example) Julius Caesar was able to become <del>emperor</del> dictator because he had a large army of soldiers who were loyal to him personally, rather than to the Roman Republic. </p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> Thank you for the gold! And thanks to those who are correcting and refining my history. This was all off the top of my head so there were bound to be mistakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people who have never served in the armed forces (the vast majority of the present population of adult Americans) have no idea how strongly our veterans feel about the oath of enlistment or oath of commission that they took when the joined our armed forces.</p>
<p>I am 66 years old.  When I was a boy, virtually all adult men were veterans of WWII or the Korean War.  Those veterans all shared a common military experience.  They were patriotic, and they expected certain behavior and attitudes out of other adults.  With the upheavals associated with the Vietnam War, and the cessation of the Draft in 1972, this is no longer the case.  Most adults today do not consider our armed forces to be &quot;part and parcel&quot; of the civilian population, and have never served as a soldier.  They do not understand, because they never experienced military boot camp and training, that our servicemen and servicewomen are taught that they are to <em>defend the Constitution.</em>  Most of us cannot imagine a situation where a tyrant might attempt to seize control of the United States.  Conditioned by a recent history of presidents who attempt to do as they please through Executive Orders, many people believe the power of the president is not checked by Congress or the Supreme Court.  This is not the case, and don't think for a second that the men and women of our armed forces are not acutely aware of this fact.  As a young Marine sergeant, I saw teen-aged Marines outraged and offended when they believed General Haig (the Secretary of State at that time) was trying to take control of the government when President Ronald Reagan was shot.  They were shouting, &quot;He's not next in the line of succession!  It's the VICE-PRESIDENT!&quot;  Haig later apologized, but as a general officer and the <em>Secretary of State,</em> for pete's sake, he should have known better.</p>
<p>This little story is <em>exactly</em> why we need to continue to teach Civics and Government in high school.</p>
<p>Americans should trust their armed forces more.  Soldiers are CITIZENS, not robots.  In my opinion, the Republic is in no danger from its armed forces.  (Plus, the civilian population is armed to the teeth with 300 million firearms.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As a former service member with a conscience, I would not follow an order if I thought it would be against my moral compass.

If several people call or write in (again, not a form letter from some organization on your behalf) on the same issue, then it really gets the representative's attention. Also, you would be surprised how easily you can get a meeting with your state representative by just stopping by their office during the session. They are reluctant to turn away a constituent who is registered to vote.</p>

<p>If there was a 'hot' issue then it was tracked closely.  But even random 'one offs' were put into a general category like 'Veterans Affairs', 'Schools', 'Budget' etc. </p>
<p>Now a days its almost all done online by signing up for a petition.  I don't think a call is any more important than signing the petition online... unless you are donor or well known (for courtesy's sake).</p>
<p>Sign up for email notices from your Congressman and sign the online petitions that are in interest to you.  I just did one last week and the results (over 5000 online signatures) were used to sway a decision on closing some state offices.  We wanted them kept open for jobs.  The cities that didn't have as many votes... well, they also don't have this specific office any more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are not a notable person, with money to donate or influence over a bloc of voters, your opinion will essentially just end up on a tally sheet. X calls on one side of a subject, Y calls on the other.</p>
<p>Any reasons you give for your opinion are typically ignored. If you're hoping to sway a representative based on the logic of your argument, you're wasting your time. Your argument will not be conveyed to them. </p>
<p>The tally itself is significant, however. Politicians take the total number of calls on an issue seriously as a barometer of how much their constituents care about an issue. And how many people call from each side is taken seriously as well. The call volume is also low enough (on most issues) that individual calls have some weight. At the Federal level, a few hundred calls on an issue to a congressman is extremely strong feedback. And while being 1 in 300 people might not seem like a lot of sway, that's a lot more influence than a vote holds. On less well publicized issues, as few as a dozen calls all on the same side can sway a representative to vote one way or another.</p>
<p>If you want to know what a call sheet looks like, <a href="http://borgenproject.org/call-congress/" target="_blank">Borgen Project</a> has a page encouraging people to call elected officials which includes examples of call sheets (This isn't necessarily an endorsement of the Borgen Project, I'm just linking to it for examples).</p>
<p>I also saw a post on social media recently by someone named Mark Jahnke offering advice on how to make your calls as effective as possible. He claimed to have worked taking calls in a Senators office. I don't know him and can't independently confirm it, but his advice lines up with what I've found when calling representatives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends! As some of you know, I used to work on Capitol Hill as the person in charge of all the incoming phone calls to my Senator's office. I have some insider tips to make calling your reps easier and quicker.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Give your name, city, and zip code, and say &quot;I don't need a response.&quot; That way, they can quickly confirm you are a constituent, and that they can tally you down without taking the time to input you into a response database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PLEASE ONLY CALL YOUR OWN REPRESENTATIVES! Your tally will not be marked down unless you can rattle off a city and zip from the state, or are calling from an in-state area code. I know you really want to give other reps a piece of your mind, but your call will be ignored unless you can provide a zip from their district. And don't try to make this up; I could often tell who was lying very quickly thanks to the knowledge of the state's geography. Exceptions to this are things like Paul Ryan's ACA poll which are national.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the issue, state your position. &quot;I am opposed to <strong>____</strong>.&quot; &quot;I am in favor of _<strong>__</strong>.&quot; &quot;I am opposed to banning the import of phalanges.&quot; I am in favor of a trade deal to lower the price of juice smoothies.&quot; That's it. That's all we write down so we can get a tally of who is in favor, who is against. It doesn't matter WHY you hold that opinion. The more people calling, the less detail they have time to write down. Help them out by being simple and direct. This keeps calls shorter, allowing more callers through.</p>
</li>
<li>Please be nice! The people answering the phones on Capitol Hill already had the hardest job in DC and some of the lowest pay as well, and for a month now their jobs have become absolute murder, with nonstop calls for 9 hours every day. Thank them for their hard work answering the phones, because without them our Senators could not represent us!</li>
</ol>
<p>What does this sound like?</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, my name is Mark, I'm a constituent from Seattle, zip code 98***, I don't need a response. I am opposed to banning the sale of blueberries and I encourage the Senator to please oppose implementation of any such ban. Thanks for your hard work answering the phones!&quot;</p>
<p>This is how I wish every caller had phrased their message. It makes it easier for the people answering the phones and takes less time and emotion than a long script. I know that you want to say why, but keeping it short and sweet helps the office answer more calls per hour, meaning more people get heard. The bigger the tally, the more powerful your voice.</p>
<p>Also, when you're reading off the same script as 100 other callers that day... well...they know what you're about to say, so you don't need to use the whole script for your opinion to be heard!</p>
<p>Pick one issue each day, use this format (I am in favor of _<strong><strong> or I oppose __</strong></strong>), and call your 2 Senators and 1 Representative on their DC and State Office lines, and you'll be on your way to being heard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope this is useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The position in the ear is useful, too, as it is further and on opposite sides from the center of the head and therefore experience more movement and in opposite directions when you turn your head which improves signal strength. If it were near you nose it would be more or less just measuring in one spot while the ears are far apart so you have two points for measuring.</p>
<p>It also needs to be close to the eyes as it causes/controls eye movement to compensate head movement so that the image you see is stabilized. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to a lot of answers about why the head in general, the ears make the most natural location when you think about evolution.  Almost all animals have an extremely acute sense of hearing.  Even humans can use the millisecond discrepancy between ears for locating the source of a noise.  Because ears are used for a sort of echolocation (not the way bats do), they are a good organ to have the parts for balance.  Hearing uses an extremely delicate form of sensory perception, unlike sight or smell which is fairly basic or analog if you understand them.  Detecting subtle changes in pitch, frequency, and amplitude require high precision, and so does balance.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that we are bilateral organisms is important.  Having two senses of balance as far away from each other as possible improves balance and ensures that there isn't a local problem interfering.  If the balancing mechanics were in the eyes, for example, each would be very susceptible to anything affecting the other since the two sides are so close.</p>
<p>Edit: It seems that balance developed before hearing so my first paragraph would be the reverse, though I'm going to leave the paragraph there because it does show a nice correlation between hearing and balance.  The second part of my answer seems to be a better one, since the ear evolved from the lateral-line on fish that detected pressure changes in water.  They had one on both sides to increase stability.  Since fish are horizontally directed they required it along their whole body, where as we only need it in the control center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers explain why the ears are a good location for it.</p>
<p>But its very wrong to think of evolution as perfect. Its wrong to think every thing is in the right place and theres a reason &quot;why&quot;.</p>
<p>Evolution is iterative and not designed or engineered. The fact the balance organ is in our ear is at least largely due to pure chance. The organisms that developed a sense of balance happened to develop it in a certain place and as that species evolved that structure is where our ears are now, possibly because thats evolutionarily advantageous, possibly just cause shit happens, possibly a bit of both.</p>
<p>Not everything in your body can be explained as &quot;well thats like that and located there because it gave a greater chance of survival or because it made us better&quot;. Thats not how evolution works. Natural selection drives evolution in a certain way, but it cannot plan ahead, so when the sense of balance developed no creature sat and thought &quot;right well where should i put this, thats a good spot&quot; it developed wherever it mutated and possibly moved over many generations due to natural selection. </p>
<p>Maybe its not &quot;finished&quot; either. Evolution is iterative. Humans and other animals are quite easily made dizzy and put off balance, ear infections are suscetible to affecting our sense of balance. We're actually kinda shit. Who says our sense of balance is perfected. Its obviously not.</p>
<p>A god example of evolution that has led to a stupid part of our body is our laryngeal nerve. The nerve that connects our brain to our larynx (voice box) goes down into our chest, loops around a major artery then back up to our throat. It takes a stupid fucking detour and thats cause shit was iterated from an earlier being, it had not plan or design that could point out it makes no sense.</p>
<p>The laryngeal nerve still loops around the heart in giraffes. Even with the length of their neck, evolution couldnt just redesign the nerve structure for convenience or good design, the nerve goes all the way down that neck and all the way back up</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because hearing and equilibrium are fundamentally the same sort of sense in vertebrates. Both are senses that detect acceleration. In fact, it might be better to say that our ears are located in our equilibrium organs, since there's a decent chance the  equilibrium organs came first.  The thing to realize is that equilibrium organs in the &quot;ear&quot; region go waaay back.  The very first vertebrates had them.  In primitive fish hearing and orientation are accomplished in the same way.  You've got a small &quot;bone&quot; (an otolith) located in a sac lined with cilia. There's also a tube or two lined with cilia.  As the fish moves, the heavy otolith falls to a different side of the sac, always resting on the lowest side.  The cilia &quot;feel&quot; where it is.  This lets the fish know which way is down.  A sudden twist of the head generates a current in the canal (try holding a glass of water and twisting it, and note how the water stays still as the glass moves past, now imagine tiny hairs on the inside of the glass detecting this relative motion). Likewise, hearing occurs when sound waves travel through the fish, accelerating the ear back and forth and causing the otolith to bounce around inside the sac.  That's detected as sound.  </p>
<p>Now, both hearing and orientation have gone on to become more complicated in humans.  But they are both basically refinements of the same system and so they remain in the same place.</p>
<p>As for why both systems are in the head, there's a tendency called &quot;cephalization&quot; which is apparent in many animals and certainly in early vertebrates.  It makes sense to cram the sense organs near the brain, because this lets them send signals to the brain more rapidly.  When a fraction of a second makes a difference in, eg, being eaten, you want to minimize ping time.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Did you ever notice, that, if you tilt your head the image you see is still somewhat leveled? Thats because your equilibrium aligne with your eyes. If they where in your feet, your brain wouldn't know if your head is tilted and could not correct the image in your head. </p>
<p>Also it balances you as your head is the highest point of your body, think of it as a water level on your head to keep you from falling to one side or the other. It also works like the water level.</p>

Unfortunately the tissue it uses to fill in this deficit is fibrous and not very attractive. The larger the deficit, the more likely it will be to scar visibly. A scar IS a wound which has healed &quot;correctly&quot; and &quot;properly&quot;.</p>
<p>If you mean to ask why we can't allow scars to heal more attractively, the answer is...we can. It is absolutely possible to surgically remove scar tissue from smaller wounds and align the now perfectly incised cuts up to allow them to heal with less of a visible scar. </p>
<p>If it's a larger scar, this isn't possible because human skin is held to muscle by connective tissue, so it only has so much immediate give in it and larger wounds would not be able to be fully closed, leaving a deficit and leading to scarring again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From memory, scar tissue isnt made up of, like, skin cells. It's actually made up of collagen fibers.</p>
<p>When you give yourself a small, shallow cut, the surrounding tissue can regenerate quickly enough that no collagen gets deposited at the site of the cut, but if the cut is deep enough and requires a bit more time to fix, collagen fibers get deposited to sort of stitch it together a bit faster. </p>
<p>The scab doesn't really have much to do with it - it's just a plug that your blood forms to cover up the site until either the skin regenerates or scar tissue is formed. If you pick it off early, it reopens the wound and forces the healing process to start all over again. The longer this healing process takes, the more collagen is deposited; and the more collagen, the more likely it'll scar.</p>
<p>That's my understanding of it anyway - hope it helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Scar tissue forms when there is a loss of tissue, or the tissue is simply to damaged. Even in a perfect situation  there's always some damage so you're always going to have some scaring to an extent however the better and faster the wound is closed the less that will be.Which means after a wound has healed and scared, you can surgically remove the scar tissue and stitch the wound, and end up with far less visible scar tissue.</p>
<p>Doesn't happen as part of routine treatment because it's painful, carries a risk of infection and involves surgery, but you can do it. You'd need to seek out a surgeon who does cosmetic stuff basically. </p>
<p>There are a few other surgical techniques as well. Subcision is often used to lessen the appearance of acne scars for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did my PhD in the neurodevelopment of sexual orientation. </p>
<p>I think there have been a lot of answers here that do a good job explaining it.  Here's my attempt at an ELI5:</p>
<p>As has been mentioned, genetics does seem to play a large role in sexual orientation, but it isn't a complete explanation. When one twin is gay, there is less than a 50% chance of the other one also being gay. Studies investigating &quot;gay genes&quot; have been inconsistent in their findings, so while there have been studies suggesting certain genes may be involved, next time a study is done, they don't find those genes to play any role. A particular region in the X-chromosome does seem promising though.</p>
<p>So, if genes don't tell the whole story, what else is there? Well, in my own research, I tested the role of the environment in the womb. We found some effects that may point to factors such as immune system of the mother or exposure to hormones influencing sexual orientation.</p>
<p>But if there is ANY role in genetics, why wouldn't it be selected out? Many people have mentioned the gay uncle hypothesis. This theory was popular for a while but has since fallen out favour since research has shown that gay men are no more involved as uncles as straight men. The other hypothesis is that the genes for male homosexuality is a gene for attraction to men, designed to get women to have more babies.  There is evidence that female relatives of gay men tend to have more babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's not something that you inherit. Straight people can have gay kids. Gay people (at least those who do have kids), can have straight children. </p>
<p>Human genetics are FAR more complicated than most people think, and being gay seems to involve more than just genetics. The fact that identical twins, who have the same genetics, can have different sexualities seems to prove that. There's some evidence that while some people may be genetically more disposed towards homosexual or bisexual activity, some of that may also be determined through epigenetics, from conditions during development as a fetus that affect brain growth. (Basically, imagine that quirks and oddities while a fetus could impact the brain in a way that makes someone gay.)</p>
<p>There continues to be a lot of investigation into this, but it's also worth noting that exclusive homosexual behavior is relatively rare in the animal kingdom. Plenty of animals are gay, and some animals have homosexual behavior being more common than heterosexual, but as long as some animals procreate, the species is able to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gay uncle theory says that homosexual men could have increased the reproductive fitness of their close family members by contributing manpower and resources to raising children. You share an average of 25% of your genes with your gay uncle. It's the same principle as many theories of familial altruism whereby helping individuals that share some of your genes might help those genes get passed along.</p>
<p>EDIT: Studies on modern gay uncles do not show that they are better uncles than straight men. This says very little about the role of gay men in prehistoric, tribal societies and how they may have contributed to the survival and reproduction of their kin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the five-year-old that asked, the men in the family are not working at being daddies, but it's ok since the women can work harder at being mommies to make up for it and the men can help them take care of their kids by doing things like sending them to school or making dinner. That's enough weird questions for today, go to bed.</p>
<p>Now that the kids are all gone to bed, we can have the non-ELI5 answer to this non-ELI5 question. </p>
<p>First, we need to understand that the contemporary understanding of evolution has moved from the survival of the species to the survival of the gene. Everything living thing on this good Earth is a mere vehicle for their genes and these genes are constantly fighting to propagate themselves at the expense of other genes. When you have children you and your partner's genes have succeeded in propagating themselves at the expense of other genes in the gene pool. What does this have to do with homosexuality? Hamer et al (1993) and Hamer and Copeland (1995) analysed the families of homosexuals and found that homosexuality seems to be more common along the maternal line allowing them to conclude that homosexuality is passed down via the X chromosome. This suggests that there is a genetic component to homosexuality, but it is not the complete picture. As other redditors have pointed out there are other factors involved too and homosexuality is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Now comes the important part - the Darwinian paradox of it. One theory called Kin Selection tries to explain it by saying that the homosexual males have more time and resources to take care of their cousins, who also carry their genes. This theory, however, has very little empirical support.</p>
<p>The theory that has the most empirical support is known as Sexually Antagonistic Selection. This theory says that the same genes that make the males homosexual are also the same genes that make females more fertile (or fecund, if you like the technical term). Camperio-Ciani et al (2004) compared the families of both heterosexual males and homosexual males and found that while the fecundity of both males and females were roughly the same in families of heterosexual males, the females in families of homosexuals were significantly more fecund than their counterparts in families of heterosexual males. This lends support to the Sexually Antagonistic Selection theory and postulates a possible resolution to this Darwinian paradox</p>
<p>However, this is still not the whole picture. Camperio-Ciani et al (2004) acknowledges that 79% of the variation in their results cannot be explained, meaning that there is still much that we don't know about human sexual orientation. Also, a lot of research has been done on male homosexuality but very little on female homosexuality. This is particularly important because female and male sexuality is very different from each other with female sexuality being more fluid than male sexuality through the life course (Mustanski, Chivers, &amp; Bailey, 2002). In fact, in Mangaia society (Mangaia is an island in the South Pacific Ocean) a female homosexual relationship is used as a form of sex education with an older female teaching a younger female about sex through a homosexual relationship before she has a heterosexual relationship (Marshall, 1971). </p>
<p>Tl;dr, there is much we do not know, and far more that we do not know that we do not know about human sexuality</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many reasons.</p>
<p>Natural selection is when animals with traits that make it harder to survive (slower, weaker, bad at hunting etc) don't survive long enough to reproduce and pass on their poor genes. But: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Being homosexual does not make it harder to survive (in most countries, anyway) and does not stop you from reproducing. Even in animals those who display mostly homosexual behaviour often still reproduce, since most animals mate only for this purpose and not for pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homosexuality is not simply a gene that it passed on. I don't pretend to understand exactly how and why some people are gay, but it is obviously not simply inherited from your parents since most gay people have heterosexual parents and will have heterosexual children.</p>
</li>
<li>Natural selection largely doesn't even apply to humans anymore. You can be born with any number of unfortunate medical conditions or disabilities and thanks to modern medicine, still both survive and reproduce. You can even reproduce if you are naturally infertile, which is probably why levels of infertility have actually been increasing in recent decades (I think).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if we had a separate privatized road network where you need to pay to drive on it (sort of like a tollway but more of a global subscription).</p>
<p>You might think it's suspicious when I suggest it now, but let's say it passes popular opinion because it's <em>newly built</em> road that otherwise wouldn't have been built (therefore not affecting the &quot;normal&quot; road network.</p>
<p>You might think this is a good plan. It can help ease the congestion of the normal roads since there are now alternatives available for those who can afford it.</p>
<p>But in time, you start noticing things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed limits are being lowered on normal roads much more excessively than on paid roads. This could be done to urge/pester people into paying for the subscription.</li>
<li>Newly invented safety measures are implemented on the paid road system first, and will not be fully implemented (if at all) on the normal road network because the budget doesn't allow for it.</li>
<li>Car manufacturers start improving their cars in ways that adhere to paid road standards and become less applicable on the normal road. E.g. would you pay more for a car which has bluetooth connectivity to switch road lights on (paid roads feature) if you do not have a road subscription and there is no bluetooth system on norma roads? No? So that means that a notable subset of new cars that are released are irrelevant for you (or at least unjustifiably expensive). Unless you buy a subscription...</li>
<li>The company you want to find a job at needs someone who starts early, and quickly loses interest in those who do not have the paid road subscription. It's never said explicitly, but it's painfully obvious in the interviewer's posture and interest in the interview.</li>
<li>There is a new company that builds a road that is much safer to drive at high speeds and cheaper to build. However, because this new company is not yet a big player, they might never get picked up because the old road company only just reaches the government's minimum standards for road safety (but, by definition, just over the minimum quality is allowed)</li>
<li>The police is seemingly more helpful to catch reckless drivers on the paid roads. Speed camera's, however, are vastly more frequent on the unpaid roads. Again, this is never explicitly stated as a rule, but rather implied through the results of police actions.</li>
<li>During a particularly brutal election year, the current Rep/Dem government adjust the roads. Lanes are closed, speed limits are lowered, and it will take you hours to get to your destination. &quot;Coincidentally&quot;, the roads that are affected are the roads that lead towards the Dem/Rep conventions (the opposite party).</li>
<li>(edit: added by /u/FrogLeatherShoes, elaborated by me) Car manufacturers have to pay licensing fees to the road people to make the car compliant, preventing any new car manufacturers from entering the market. BMW can pay the $10,000 licensing fee per car easily. But a new startup will not be able to, because they can't run their business when everything they sell will have to be $10,000 more expensive to cover the licensing cost <em>that nets their own company not a single benefit</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways in which this system can be manipulated into urging people to pay for the subscription. Doesn't matter whether it's through making the unsubscribed version more shit (or improving it less than the paid version), preventing previously unknown companies from making the next breakthrough, or causing a divide between the subscribed and unsubscribed people (economically, employment, ...).</p>
<p>And once we get to a point where practically everyone has the road subscription, then <em>no one</em> gets the benefit from having a subscription anymore (since the paid roads are just as congested because everyone can drive anywhere again) <strong>but we are all still paying for the subscription nonetheless</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>This problem, and many like it, can be summed up like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We make a separate option that's better, but more expensive. The main argument for having it is exclusivity (e.g. uncongested roads) which makes things nicer for those who can afford it.</li>
<li>Big business, however, is in it for the money. They are constantly trying to get more people to partake in the system, because more customers means more money.</li>
<li>As the percentage of people paying the extra increases, the company's profits increase. However, the original benefit (exclusivity and separation) moves out of sight because the majority of people are now all exclusive.</li>
<li>Once big business has completed its goal and convinced everyone to pay the extra, the exclusivity is completely gone. People have paid for years for something that has slowly slipped from them, and they didn't even realize it. Worse still, they can't even opt out of paying extra now, because everyone is doing it and it is now expected of you. Not paying the extra makes you the poor outcast.</li>
<li>Suddenly, everyone is locked in a system where they are all paying more, no one is getting any benefit from it anymore, but no one wants to leave out of fear for being ostracized or simply getting the short end of the stick at a point where they need it most.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all big corporations that sell internet connectivity also sell cable tv. They also have their own streaming services that are not as good as netflix, primevideo or hbo. And by law these corporations must treat all traffic equally. In contrast cable tv is a huge dated mess with total lack of innovation and rising costs and amount of commercials. These big players want you to use cable. They want you to think cable is what you want. By adding bandwidth caps and making online video services worse they artificially make cable look better.</p>
<p>The thing is that when the equal traffic limitation is changed it allows the big corporations to fully control the internet as a market. They can choose who gets in and who gets out. And I'm not talking about people who use the internet. I'm talking about big and small businesses that use internet.</p>
<p>This means the internet  selling corporations can double dip. Or actually tripple dip. They can ask &quot;connection money&quot; from other businesses who use the internet. Amazon, google, hbo, netflix, reddit, foxnews, nascar... If you have a website you need to pay for it to be available to people. Then they can ask you to pay twice. First for your internet connection and then to get access to some other sites.</p>
<p>You may be thinking this sounds right? Surely they should not be forced to offer that service for the other corporations for free, right? The thing is it is not free. YOU pay for it. You pay for your access to google, netflix or whatever when you pay for your monthly fees. You pay it through the taxes because these companies have been given billions of money to build and update the infrastructure. Which they have not done. But they want more.</p>
<p>So those other businesses? Google and netflix buy their own server hardware so they can be connected by people like us who buy internet connections from the big internet providers like comcast, att, timewarner, verizon and such. It is not that netflix or such are being unreasonable by just trying to force comcast to play along. Netflix have even offered to pay and install their servers in comcast's server locations but comcast will not allow it. They want netflix to give them money while accepting worse terms.</p>
<p>So what happens is that tripple dipping I mentioned earlier. What it does it stagnates the market. Because the only way to compete is to own the network and essentially own the customers. Being a newcomer like netflix is literally impossible. Not only do you need to take a gigantic financial risk to pay for the connection fees, server hardware and content creation costs but you need to compete with one hand tied behind your back. Your customers get slower speeds, worse connectivity and have to worry about datacaps. All the while the comcast's own service can utilize the full bandwitdth and users don't need to worry about datacaps. At least in the beginning. It is impossible to compete against that. </p>
<p>And it is a huge untapped goldpot for the comcasts. How much can you ask from google, microsoft, sony, facebook etc for them to be accessible through internet? They can not afford to not pay! The profits are rediculous. All the same time you as a customer can be asked to pay more.</p>
<p>And it doesn't even end there. These comcasts want to be the big players. They don't like facebook and google selling ads. They want to track you and be the ad server facebook and google can only dream of being. You can try to avoid services like google and facebook if you don't like being tracked. But when it is your internet connection that is tracking you then the only way to opt out is to not use internet at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In short, net neutrality <del>combats</del>  protects &quot;free trade&quot; of an open internet. We choose the service we like / are better, not the one with enough money to ensure they're fastest.</p>
<p>Imgur is en vogue, Photobucket is not. Gmail is, AOL is not. Google is, askJeeves is not. Reddit is, SomethingAwful is not. You get the idea. We evolve.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the many implications is the possible appearance of so called 'fast lanes'. Without net neutrality, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) could start prioritizing traffic however they desire.</p>
<p>They could slow down traffic to website they do not like while providing fast traffic to their 'partners'. This would like lead to deals where website providers would have to pay the ISPs for them to provide fast access to the site. While this would not be much of an issue for large companies like Google or Facebook, it would essentially shut out new competition as they might not be able to afford what is essentially extortion money.</p>
<p>And you as a consumer would only get fast access to websites that your ISP want you to go to, essentially leading into corporate censorship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In this case it's just a matter of old saxon roots of those names and the &quot;cester&quot; being pronounced as &quot;ster&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't necessarily true... permanent disease and the notion of &quot;dry drunks&quot; is more of an AA philosophy, although I absolutely believe the more strongly addicted people will have permanent problems and might not be able to drink at all.  This is true of almost any addiction like gambling and sex addiction too (CP perhaps being a prominent example).  I can vouch for four people in my family who drank heavily 10-20 years ago and got help a long time ago, and avoid alcohol now but can still drink several beers socially with no problem.</p>
<p>AA is not the only answer, unfortunately this is exclusively what is embraced by the US legal and psychiatric system. There are alternative recovery programs for alcohol.  Moderation is a possibility, though the tragic story of Audrey Kishline needs to be read as a cautionary tale.  I personally don't think it's possible to go from alcohol abuse to moderation without a long period of sobriety, and even then it's risky. </p>
<p>Alcohol is extremely addictive and it does bring the danger of a permanent ruinous relationship, but for those who haven't been burned too bad by the addiction I am 100% sure it is possible to regain a normal relationship with it, but only after a couple of years of sobriety and after a lot of your Maslows Pyramid stuff is fixed.  You simply can't go back into social drinking when you've got relationship problems, no job, and without interests that fulfill you.</p>
<p>I'm not advising anyone to start drinking, but if all that stuff is addressed then your life is in a very secure place and alcohol is not that much of a risk. But if you had previously been drinking for 10 years and had failed marriages, DUIs, and rehab as a result of drinking, then you're a lot further along on the addiction spectrum and it's probably better to stay away regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recovered sex addict here. Just wanted to add that while it is true that sex addicts learn to a way to have sex, then it's much more complicated than that. There are in many cases things that we stay away from forever just like alcohol. What these things are differ from person to person but the main idea is that some things will for a fact get a sex addict back into an addictive pattern while healthy and natural sex won't. Also it's not just something that comes easy so it requires continuing work to stay on the right path. Sex addicts have to rediscover a way to have healthy sex.
Since alcohol is not similarly complex then it's hard to say that some parts are healthy and some are not.
Completely removing yourself from anything sexual is not healthy. Just like food addicts can't just quit food but needs to figure out what works and what triggers binging. Alcohol is not a necessity and therefor it's easier to just cut it out. I do however believe that it is possible but since it's not easy then people just tend to not take the risk. Cause even recovered sex addicts have relapses and it's just easier to avoid relapses with alcohol by staying away completely. There is not really a good reason to drink so they don't. Long story short - it can be done if you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certified addiction treatment counselor here. Alcohol and other drugs are chemical addictions. Acts like sex, gambling, stealing are called process addictions. Chemical addictions and process addictions both change the way your brain is wired in similar ways and both cause your brain to release various chemical messengers that makes you feel good. However, chemical addictions have a far more severe and widespread effect on how your brain functions and cause much much higher levels of these chemical messengers than process addictions do.  The less severe impact process addictions have on the brain allows someone to continue doing something they were addicted to without it getting back to the place where it was so out of control or causing severe problems. With chemical addictions, the severity of the effects on the brain makes casual drug use almost not possible, which is why statistically speaking, abstinence based programs are the most effective in treating addiction/alcoholism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Alcoholics Anonymous is very popular but it is not necessarily the only way to recover. I know more than one alcoholic who recovered via abstinence and at a later stage in life took up alcohol in moderation (&lt;5 drinks per week) happily and can now socially drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will start by saying that I am an alcoholic and not a sex addict. I am 2 years sober after many years of struggling and desperation. I got sober and stay sober through AA. For me, that is the only way, but I know it's not for everyone, and that's fine. I am also a part of Toronto AA which is predominantly atheists and agnostics. I went to AA to get sober and I stay b/c it makes my life better. As an alcoholic I am allergic to alcohol, in that the physical alcohol in the body sets off an obsession for wanting more. While most people can stop after a few, me being an alcoholic, will always want to continue drinking. I tried for many years to learn to drink in moderation, but even when I didn't drink until I blacked out, I was always obsessing about wanting more. I can only share my story here about why I can't moderate as it's not my place to discuss other alcoholics or sex addicts and their stories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
