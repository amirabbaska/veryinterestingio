<p>And the pain is not just from surgically repaired areas. Even the &quot;ole football&quot; type injures become sore as well. </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no full agreement among scientists that weather causes pain, or if a specific mechanism is at fault, Jamison says. But there are plausible theories.</p>
<p>One leading theory points to changes in air pressure. Although many people say that their pain worsens with damp, rainy weather, research has shown that it's not the cold, wind, rain, or snow, Borenstein says. &quot;The thing that affects people most is barometric pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Barometric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere that surrounds us.</p>
<p>If you imagine the tissues surrounding the joints to be like a balloon, high barometric pressure that pushes against the body from the outside will keep tissues from expanding.</p>
<p>But barometric pressure often drops before bad weather sets in. This lower air pressure pushes less against the body, allowing tissues to expand -- and those expanded tissues can put pressure on the joint. &quot;It's very microscopic and we can hardly notice, except that we have these sensations,&quot; Jamison says.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok I did some actual literature searching.</p>
<p>Most published studies seem to read more or less the same conclusion as this one : <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20570193/?i=5&from=/15229951/related" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20570193/?i=5&from=/15229951/related</a></p>
<p>&quot;CONCLUSION: The studies to date do not show any consistent group effect of weather conditions on pain in people with RA. There is, however, evidence suggesting that pain in some individuals is more affected by the weather than in others, and that patients react in different ways to the weather. Thus, the hypothesis that weather changes might significantly influence pain reporting in clinical care and research in some patients with RA cannot be rejected.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm an air traffic controller and a big part of my job is controlling medevac helicopters transitioning through the airspace. We aren't supposed to give the aircraft altitude adjustments because if someone is bleeding in the aircraft, changing the aircraft's altitude a few hundred feet can mean the difference of a person remaining stable and a person bleeding out.  </p>
<p>This is sad when you think about helpless pilots in Afghanistan when they fly out of steep terrain. Those pilots know what's going on behind them and know that clearing the ridge by climbing 1,000 ft is going to kill his passengers.  </p>
<p>At my last base, we were one of the busiest airports for VFR traffic in the country, working 12-14 aircraft in a pattern was almost a daily occurrence(for tower, that's pretty damn busy).  I've had situations where we have been busy as shit and a medevac helo called needing to cut straight through my airspace with a critical casualty. I've made blanket broadcasts telling all the aircraft at once to change their altitude and 'race track' just so medavac can get through without any issues; it's that important that they don't climb.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barometric pressure.  Injuries never heal perfectly (yet).  When the barometric pressure changes, you are getting stretched or compressed.  The scar tissue does the same, but at a different rate than surrounding non-damaged areas.  That makes it hurt.  The greater the change, the more pain.  Once the barometric pressure stabilizes, the stretching and compressing stops and everything goes back to &quot;normal&quot;.  That's why it hurts before the storm, but not necessarily during or after...at least for me.</p>
<p>Arthritis works under a similar method.  Any currently inflamed tissue will ache because some level of damage is occurring - sort of like tugging at a big cut on your arm.  Leave it be and the pain will stop.  Keeping tugging and it will keep hurting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No matter how perfectly you play, some games will force you to occasionally have to make a guess, as is the case in the image that I linked too.</p>
<p>If we can assume that we have a perfect player, who always makes the most highest probability selections (in other words, if there is a 100% &quot;safe&quot; square, it will always pick that before attempting to guess on a 50/50 safe square, and if there is a square that has a 2/3 chance of being safe, it will pick that before picking a square that has a 50/50 chance of being safe, then what would percentage of wins would the &quot;perfect player&quot; most likely approach?</p>
<p>Other assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first click will never result in a mine exploding --&gt; the game is generated AFTER you click your first square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mine placement is completely random, except for the first clicked square.</p>
</li>
<li>The Mines can not change position after the board has been determined on the first click.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you describe this perfect play? In game theory, a solution to a game is optimal if it perfectly maximizes your chances of winning. But even coming up with a candidate solution for a game like Minesweeper is difficult. </p>
<p>Say your first click reveals a lone 1. What's the best way to proceed? Should you hunt down the 1? Should you click somewhere else randomly? Should it be a combination of the two? Can you generalize this into any scenario that requires guessing (e.g. a good strategy might have you only guess based on estimated probabilities of hitting a mine at a given spot, given known information about adjacent markers and the number of mines remaining in the game). How do you account for every kind of advanced technique, like looking at many adjacent markers to figure out which spots can or cannot have mines? You might not realize it, but there's a ton of complexity to this game, and even coming up with a good general strategy for playing Minesweeper would be difficult. Trying to prove your strategy was the solution would be even harder. Then and only then could you understand how often &quot;perfect play&quot; will succeed at the game. </p>
<p>For reference, in total there are (480 choose 99) or about 5.6x10^104 possible game boards. That's a lot of possibilities to account for - far too many to have a computer actually check them all. </p>
<p>EDIT: My scenarios clearly were too simplified (yes, you go for a spot adjacent to the 1), so try this one on for size. You've reached a scenario where you have to guess because there are no spots that can be determined as either 0% or 100% chance of a mine. Almost everyone so far has been fixating on probabilities, assuming that the optimal strategy will be to always guess at the least likely spot, because it has the least chance of blowing up and immediately ending the game. However, I suggest that sometimes, it will be better to guess at a higher-probability spot. What if one of those spots has a small chance of containing a mine, but clicking on it wouldn't reveal enough information to allow you to continue, so you'd then have to make another guess. Meanwhile, you could have originally chosen a more illuminating but higher probability spot. </p>
<p>In the first strategy, although you are always guessing &quot;optimally&quot;, you might be exposing yourself to unnecessary risk. The combination of multiple guesses might make you more likely to explode than taking the second strategy and making only a single, more effective, yet higher probability guess. </p>
<p>As a more concrete example, revisit the lone 1 scenario. Is it truly better to click on one of the adjacent tiles? Or is it better to click on a tile a short distance away in order to gain a better understanding of the game board? What nearby tile do you choose? Can you mathematically prove one or the other gives you better chances of success on average? </p>
<p>This is just one such complication. Yes, you could use a Monte Carlo approach to approximate the win percentage of a player who always chose the probability-optimal tile. But this won't necessarily constitute a solution to the game, as there are many other strategies which may beat this immediate optimum over the long run. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

People who play for speed always guess when it's faster - even if you could uncover tiles later that make the solution apparent. (source: my best time is 70)</p>
<p>Needless to say, the new version with a pop-up after every game is unplayable.</p>
<p>In order to have the best chance of winning, though, you couldn't simply rely on which square had the best odds.  Often times, if you say have a small square revealed or a wall going from one side of the board to another, the best 'odds' may be any square in the great grey sea.  But some of these squares will synergize better with the squares you've already revealed.</p>
<p>Also, it might be a technical note but in at least one version of the game, the board is generated before the click and is then possibly modified by the location of the first click.  A cheat that changes the upper-left pixel of the monitor demonstrates this.  I'm not sure how the new mine is chosen - randomly or the first available space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Two main reasons; weight and their skin. Sea mammals that don't normally venture on to land, like dolphins and whales, aren't built to carry their body weight and would get crushed under their own girth. For the ones small enough to survive their own weight for a bit, they still need to be kept wet and somewhat shaded as they can suffer burns or dehydrate quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really anything else that proposes a ToE. String Theory isn't some crazy invention. If you start with the Standard Model and try to expand it to start including gravity or to unify the Strong interaction with the Electroweak interaction, you inevitably come across failed theory after failed theory after failed theory. String Theory is the simplest approach that unifies gravity and the gauge theories (Strong and Electroweak) without failing other requirements.</p>
<p>There are a handful of theories that attempt to quantize gravity and connect it to the standard model, but those aren't ToEs. They are just quantum gravity theories.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown.</p>
<p>The simplest extension of the SM is supersymmetry. It is a system that identifies bosonic particles to fermionic particles and identifies them as two different aspects of one object. This is a very natural and theoretically satisfying theory that many think will be the next experimentally verified piece of fundamental physics (although many don't.) </p>
<p>Susy has nothing to do with a ToE, however. It simply proposes some new particles (i.e. one that can be identified as a fantastic candidate for dark matter) and can simplify a few mathematical oddities in the standard model.</p>
<p>We also have a topic called grand unification. We have a history of finding ways to merge different branches of physics. Starting with electricity and magnetism merging to become electromagnetism, space and time merging to become spacetime under the influence of the equations of electromagnetism, QM and relativity to become quantum field theory. The same principle that defines electromagnetism mathematically also perfectly defines the weak theory and the strong theory. The weak and electromagnetic interactions merge to form the electroweak theory. Grand unification proposes that somehow the Strong and Electroweak theories merge to form a merged one unified interaction that splits into the rest.</p>
<p>However, GUTs (grand unified theory) just don't work. I haven't really studied GUTs in any detail, but the most popular version is pretty much excluded because it predicts that Protons decay into other particles. In the history of physics, there has been a grand total of 0 measurements of decaying Protons. This pretty much rules out a simple GUT.</p>
<p>Another approach is called supergravity. Supergravity takes supersymmetry and applies a subtle mathematical principle that occurs elsewhere in physics and just so happens to spit out the equations for gravity on top of supersymmetry. However, it requires that the number of dimensions is expanded to 11 and (much worse) it fails completely because the theory is &quot;non-renormalizable.&quot; That means that when you try to do calculations with supergravity you find spurious infinities popping up all over the place which, obviously, ruins your ability to calculate anything. IE when trying to make a prediction for the experiments at CERN you find the probabilities are nonsensically infinity.</p>
<p>So, no luck yet. We have a maybe result saying that Susy could possibly exist but it hasn't been found and has some other unsatisfying predictions. We have to find a new approach.</p>
<p>So we get creative. So we turn to String Theory. Our normal standard model is based off quantum field theory. </p>
<p>Quantum field theory studies the interactions of quantized 1,2 or 4 dimensional fields that are functions of 4 variables on a 4 dimensional spacetime. A natural thing to attempt is to vary some of the these numerical values. </p>
<p>Varying the first values (1,2,4) gives us different particles. The 1 value is, for example, a particle like the Higgs boson. The 2 value could be a neutrino or electron. The 4 value could give us a photon. We've exhaustively studied this variation.</p>
<p>Next, we try to vary the next numerical value: the &quot;4 variables.&quot; When that value says 1, we are looking at a simple particle theory. This doesn't do anything useful and can be made to be just a more cumbersome version of quantum field theory. Changing that value to 2 gives us strings. When we analyze the theory with the value 2, we miraculously find that it accidentally spits out gravity. With some messaging and adding supersymmetry we find it also spits out the all of our fermions and all of our bosons. However, we find that this theory also fails. That is unless we vary the &quot;4 dimensional spacetime&quot; to be 11 dimensional. Now it still provides gravity and all our particles, but it also includes some incredible mathematical niceties that are absent from the standard model which are more complicated to explain.</p>
<p>String theory has TONS of problems, but it really is our only approach that unifies everything. Nothing has invalidated String theory while all these other theories have been invalidated. So it's our simplest approach at a unifying theory. I'd say there's still a 50% chance that it's entirely wrong, but there isn't a great competing candidate anyways.</p>
<p>I hope this made sense, I probably was just rambling incoherently. But oh well!</p>
<p>Also, on a technical note to any string theorists: I didn't study ST, I studied Loop Quantum Gravity and quit before finishing my PhD. Feel free to make corrections as I only have studied ST/SG in my spare time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><em>Edit</em>: Damn, not sure if I have misinterpeted the question. Neither f(R) gravity nor Supersymmetry are candidates for a theory of everything.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so a lot of these posts don't really answer the question. OP wants to know what other candidates there are for TOEs besides String Theory. A lot of the posts on here don't even come close to being TOEs, they are for the most part either useful tools with applications in theoretical physics (e.g. Hairy Ball Theory and Invariant Set Postulate) or generalizations of existing theories (e.g. F(R) gravity and SUSY) that do expand on the theory but don't actually achieve (or, quite frankly, even <em>try</em> [at least intrinsically]) anything close to a TOE.</p>
<p>As for OP: The reason why you rarely hear of alternatives to String Theory is because there really isn't one. There are alternatives to <em>individual components</em> of ST (e.g. quantum loop gravity is an alternative quantum gravity hypothesis, and is arguably ST's biggest competitor with respect to quantum gravity), but insofar as I am aware, there is no hypothesis or as-of-yet proposed model besides ST that is capable (or really even attempts to) of unifying everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>He spent the rest of his life working on his Theory of Everything. A lot of his predictions are hard to confirm, but many of his predictions for the weights of certain subatomic particles were surprisingly close to what ended up being measured. It has been mostly dismissed for a lot of issues that more mathematically minded people could go into more clearly.</p>
<p>But he developed his own flavor of Calculus differentials for it, and it utilizes 6th dimensional spaces. One of his big motivators was his obsession with wanting to develop a way to travel through space and Heim Theory allows you to (in really simplified terms) to use extremely powerful magnetic forces to make a Star Wars style Hyperdrive. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my mind, there are two categories of unusable characters: reserved characters and the rest of them, which I'll call disallowed characters.</p>
<p>Reserved characters are characters used by the filesystem itself.  For example, most Unix filesystems separate directories/folders by using a slash ('/'), and mark the end of a name using a null character (0x00).  They don't allow you to use these characters because using them would be stepping on the toes of how the filesystem itself stores data about filenames. (In regards to the slash, it really has more to do with how the OS delimits paths rather than the filesystem itself.)</p>
<p>Other characters are arbitrarily disallowed, usually to avoid confusion.  In Windows, those characters include the asterisk('<em>'), question mark('?'), doublequote('&quot;'), less than ('&lt;'), greater than ('&gt;'), and pipe ('|').  While these characters don't mean anything special to the filesystem itself, they mean special things to the command shell.  In order to prevent a user from getting in a confusing situation where a file is named &quot;`</em>.txt<code>" and then running "</code>del *.txt<code>" ends up deleting more files than intended, Windows decided to prevent the user from getting in this situation by preventing the use of those characters in filenames.  (Unix systems do not have this restriction.)  I suspect that Windows also includes ('/') in this category.  It looks like the backslash ('\\') directory delimiter, but it's probably avoided because command options are started with a slash, as in "</code>dir /w`&quot;.</p>
<p>Windows also disallows the colon (':'), which has special meaning to the OS.  It actually indicates that the name that preceded it is a device.  Drive letters are the obvious examples, but there are a number of others, including &quot;CON&quot; (the console), &quot;LPT1&quot; (through at least 3, which are printers), &quot;PRN&quot; (also a printer), and some others that I'm forgetting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some special characters mean something in the code used to make the file system. It would be possible to make the system work around this, but it's easier and safer to just prevent you from using such characters.</p>
<p>For example, a filepath might be C:\Users\MrMeltJr\Photos\pepes\le_rarest_pepe.jpeg</p>
<p>This means that the file le_rarest_pepe.jpeg is in the folder pepes, which is in the folder Photos, which is in MrMeltJr, which is in Users, which is on the C drive. Now, if I named the file le\rarest\pepe.jpeg, the computer would now think it's a file called pepe.jpeg in a folder called rarest, which is in a folder called le, and so on. But none of those folder exist, so it can't find the file. Like I said, it's possible to code things so that it can tell the difference between weird file names and actual filepaths, but it that would make the system slower (since it has to run through those extra checks every time you do pretty much anything with any file) and it's less reliable (since it's just more opportunities for something to go wrong). Safer and easier to just prevent those characters from being used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Operating system uses this characters as templates. For example, for searching files by parts of its name, for redirecting input/output streams, and as path delimiters.</p>
<p>If you want to find some files on your disk but can't remember how used word 'color' or 'colour', you can use this template: &quot;colo?r&quot; (without quotes and with question mark).
Here question mark used as replacement for one symbol (any allowed) or its absence. Results can be: &quot;color&quot;, &quot;colour&quot;, &quot;colo7r&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>Slash/Backslash symbols used on different platforms (windows/Linux/web) as path delimiters.
Windows: &quot;C:\games\game1.exe&quot; - sounds like &quot;go to 'C:' (look at another special symbol) drive then 'games' directory inside and find file named 'game1.exe'&quot; inside this folder.
Linux: &quot;/usr/bin/games/game1.exe&quot; - means the same but Linux isn't using drive letters.
Web: &quot;ftp://pub/docs/doc56.txt&quot; - 'ftp' is a file transfer protocol, 'pub' and 'docs' are folders, 'doc56.txt' is a filename.</p>
<p>Definition of some symbols can be different for different contexts. You can find all of the symbols and its description and use-cases by googling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you have a completely closed and isolated system, you have a microcanonical ensemble. The equilibrium distribution for the microcanoncial ensemble is not the Boltzmann distribution, but rather a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>So all the particles in the gas will not have the same energy nor speed. But they'll obey a probability distribution which assigns the same probability to every accessible state.</p>
<p>If your system is closed but not isolated, and held at thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T, then you've got a canonical ensemble. In that case, the probability of each particle being in a state with energy E<em><em>i</em></em> is not uniform, but rather proportional to exp[-E<em><em>i</em></em>/kT], where k is Boltzmann's constant.</p>
<p>If you write this in terms of velocities (assuming a nonrelativistic gas), it becomes exp[-m<em><em>i</em></em>v<em><em>i</em></em>^(2)/2kT]. I've written the mass as m<em><em>i</em></em> to account for the different species in your second situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No the velocity of particles will assume some distribution. Gasses in a closed system will reach thermodynamic equilibrium. Most gases can be approximately fairly well as an ideal gas. The velocity distribution for ideal gases in thermodynamic equilibrium is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">Maxwell-Boltzman Distribution</a>. It's mean value defines the kinetic temperature and the distribution is slightly positively skewed.<br />
In real life gases won't behave exactly like ideal gases, so there might be some differences to this <em>model</em> but the main idea is still the same: The particles won't all have the same velocity but rather some distribution of velocities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would be more specific in the title, but it would be too incomprehensible and cut-short probably. It will take some explanation before I get to my question again but it's there:</p>
<p>I was working on a math puzzle a while back where I had to guess the next number in a series. The given series was &quot;1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, __&quot; and I had to guess the last number. I guessed correctly, but instead of intuitively realizing that the pattern was &quot; x^2 &quot;, I found the answer via another method.</p>
<p>I found the differences between the adjacent numbers in the series, i.e. 4 - 1 = 3, 9 - 4 = 5, so on, and used those to create a new series: &quot;3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13&quot;. I then performed the same operation on that line, finding the differences between adjacent numbers and then using those to create a new line: &quot;2, 2, 2, 2, 2&quot;.</p>
<p>I thought this was interesting, because by performing this differences method twice on my given series, I was able to bottom-out/hit a ceiling at the number 2*. The number 2 was useful, because I could then work my way back down/up (depends on how you write it down, I guess) to find the next number in the series: 64.</p>
<p>I decided to try this again on a new, related series. I made the series &quot;1, 8, 27, 64, 125&quot; ( x^3 ) and resolved to use the same differences method on this line. The first time yields: 7, 19, 37, 61&quot;; the second time yields: &quot;12, 18, 24&quot;; the third time bottoms out at: &quot;6, 6&quot;.</p>
<p>So ( x^2 ) bottoms out at 2<em>, and ( x^3 ) bottoms out at 6</em>.</p>
<p>I continued this with ( x^4 ): &quot;1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401&quot;. The differences method yields: &quot;15, 65, 175, 369, 671, 1105&quot;; again, and it yields: &quot;50, 110, 194, 302, 434&quot;; again, and it yields: &quot;60, 84, 108, 132&quot;; again, and it yields: &quot;24, 24, 24&quot;.</p>
<p>So ( x^4 ) bottoms out at 24*.</p>
<p>Finally, my question: Is there a name for these bedrock numbers that I've marked with the asterisks? </p>
<p>Additionally, I would like to know: is there reading material on the matter? Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?</p>
<p>tl;dr:</p>
<p>2 underlies ( x^2 ),
6 underlies ( x^3 ),
24 underlies ( x^4 ),
and so on, for reasons explained above.
Why?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, for x^n the number you're looking for will be n!, which is shorthand for n * (n-1) * (n-2) *....*3*2*1.</p>
<p>For example, x^7 would end up with the number 7! = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040</p>
<h2>To see why:</h2>
<p>Focus on x^2 to start. </p>
<p>To generalize the difference between consecutive items in the sequence, we have:</p>
<p>(x+1)^2 - x^2</p>
<p>Do some algebra and get:<br />
<strong>2</strong>x^<strong>1</strong> + 1</p>
<p>Repeat the process:</p>
<p>[2(x+1) + 1] - [2x+1]<br />
= 2</p>
<p>So there's your 2.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now we do this with x^3:</p>
<p>(x+1)^3 - x^3<br />
= <strong>3</strong>x^<strong>2</strong> + 3x + 1</p>
<p>Repeat the process:<br />
[3(x+1)^2 +3(x+1) + 1] - [3x^2 + 3x + 1]<br />
= <strong>6</strong>x^<strong>1</strong> + 6 </p>
<p>Repeat the process:<br />
6(x+1) + 6 - [6x+6]<br />
= 6 [aka <strong>6</strong>x^<strong>0</strong>]</p>
<h2>Making sense of it:</h2>
<p>Notice that I've bolded a few coefficients and exponents in the above section. As you go through the repetitive process, you see that your highest power term always gets canceled out in the algebra. In the x^3 example, you start with 1x^3 being your highest power term. Then you do the difference process and you end up with 3x^2 being your highest power. Then you do the difference process again and you end up with 6x^1 being your highest power. Then you do it once more and 6x^0 is your highest power. </p>
<p><strong>In the x^3 example, do you see how the highest power term goes like this as we go through all the steps:</strong></p>
<p>x^3<br />
3x^2<br />
6x^1<br />
6x^0</p>
<p><strong>So the general pattern is:</strong><br />
x^n<br />
nx^(n-1)<br />
n(n-1)x^(n-2)<br />
n(n-1)(n-2)x^(n-3)<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
n(n-1)(n-2)...3*2*1</p>
<p>which is the formula we talked about up top.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Taking the derivative of a polynomial reduces the exponents by one, then multiplies the terms by the original exponent. </p>
<p>If f(x) = x^2<br />
f'(x) = 2 * x<br />
f''(x) = 2</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something vaguely related to this phenomenon, but sadly I have no source (hopefully someone can back me up with real sources).<br />
If I remember correctly, <strong>a part</strong> of enjoying music is being able to relate to the music, being able to predict what comes next. That is why music that is &quot;in tune&quot; will sound more pleasant than music out of tune, because we don't listen to much music out of tune and therefore are not accustomed to it. Music that we do not like is generally music we cannot predict well and that doesn't stimulate us. By listening to music that we do not enjoy, we are forcing our brains to work hard at trying to guess what comes next but because it's no good at it, it needs to start from scratch again.</p>
<p>A useful analogy is that of how a (computer) processor predicts what it needs to do:<br />
First it will pick which branch (of multiple possible choices) of execution to expect.<br />
Then, possibly before it even knows which branch it will <em>really</em> take, it will load some relevant information into memory.<br />
When the CPU realizes that it is following another path, it has done a lot of work for nothing and discards the information and starts over from the beginning of the mispredicted branch.</p>
<p>It's possible that our brains evolved this &quot;feature&quot; to reward intelligence (or rather, being good at predicting outcomes), but since I am a software engineer and not a biologist or geneticist, I really wouldn't know.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> (disclaimer) to clear up some confusion:<br />
I never stated that our brains <em>prefer</em> predictability over spontaneity, just that predictability <em>plays a part</em> in it. Indeed many of us seek out unpredictability in music, there is a balance to be had. Likewise, once we can perfectly predict the music we can get bored of it, causing an inverse effect. There are a lot of good points made in the thread of this comment which either further elaborate or provide alternate points of views, all of which may or may not be valid. </p>
<p>I personally think that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr8758/" target="_blank">this reply provides a good alternate point of view</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr7he1/" target="_blank">this partly addresses loudness (which I did not touch on)</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kt10d/eli5_why_is_it_that_loud_music_we_enjoy_doesnt/dbr5iw7/" target="_blank">this drives another alternate point of view, touching on the notion of music appreciation as learned behavior</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loudness may not be the culprit. Have you ever heard a brand new song, and despite it being by one of your favorite artists, you don't really enjoy it that much the first few times you hear it? Its your favorite artist though, so you'll listen to it a few more times and maybe hear it on the radio a time or two. Then one day you realize you actually like the song very much. <em>Seems weird, right?</em></p>
<p>I'll diverge a second. As humans, we generally stick to habits, and any deviation from our typical habits feels unusual and different. It takes a couple (sometimes a lot more) attempts at a new routine to turn it into a habit, and our bodies might respond during that transition period by aches and pains. Telling you, hey this is different, I don't like different. Music works on us the same way, because listening to music is a habit. You hear music you don't like and your brain finds a way to balance it out, or force you to stop it, which is where a headache can occur.</p>
<p>It turns out that the radio industry has had to create techniques of gradually adjusting listeners to new songs, even if radio executives already know the song is going to be a hit. The challenge is to prevent you from changing the radio channel (or turning it off) when you hear a new song that you don't quite like right away. One way to do this is by sticking the new song in between two already popular and well liked ones. You don't immediately notice that this unfamiliar new song is playing because you just heard one you really like. What happens by the time you notice the new song playing? It ends and another popular song comes back on. After hearing the new song a few times, even if you weren't all that focused on it, your brain is more familiar with it. Have this happen a few more times and you might soon find that you really like the song because your brain got </p>
<p>I first read about this in a book called &quot;The Power of Habit&quot; by Charles Duhigg, which explores our habits in general, including how they can be developed or changed, and uses music as an example at times. One example in the book is &quot;Hey Ya&quot; by Outkast. It became an incredibly popular song, but at first radio listeners literally hated it. To make people like it, the song was first squeezed between two already popular ones and eventually it reached the top spot on Billboard for 8 weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordbasket.blogspot.com/2014/12/who-killed-good-music.html" target="_blank">Another article that discusses the Hey Ya situation and references The Power of Habit</a></p>
<p>Edit: I want to summarize 2 other situations that have been asked in comments.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Why do I dislike music I've listened to constantly, such as at work? My brain knows what to expect right?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose you like country music and hate heavy metal, but your jerk of a coworker always plays his metal too loud. You could hear his music over and over again but odds are that you won't like it ever. Simply put: you don't like metal, you like country. You respond positively to country and metal is nothing like it, so your brain forms no connections between the two.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What about a brand new song that I instantly fell in love with? Even if the artist is someone I've never heard of?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>It's probably pretty similar to something else you've heard before, musically speaking. The song's beat, the artists' voices, the rhythm, etc. something about the music itself was noticed by the brain and connected to other songs you like. What's the thing about Nickelback songs? They all sound pretty similar, and most people that like one of their songs (crazy, I know) tend to like most of their music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your question is very specific to right after the winter solstice, because the Sun actually rises and sets between days at varying rates, as <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/new-york" target="_blank">shown here</a>. The Sun traces out a sinusoidal pattern in the sky over the course of a year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-exposure_photography#Solargraphy" target="_blank">shown here</a>. In a similar vein, the sunrise and sunset is a sinusoidal pattern, where the greatest rate of change occurs at the equinoxes, so you can expect up to 3 minutes of change per day near the equinoxes at mid-latitudes. Meanwhile, at the equator, there is very little change, and in the arctic circle, sunrise and sunset can change as much as half an hour per day up to having only one day with a sunset at the North Pole.</p>
<p>To answer your actual question about the difference of sunrise and sunset gaining time though, it actually has to do with solar noon, or culmination. The time at which the Sun gets to the highest point in the sky gets later and later in winter because the Earth's orbit is an ellipse and is going faster since it is nearest to the Sun in winter. This can be read about more <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-dont-sunrise-and-sunset-times-change-symmetrically.426655/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/38270/why-is-the-solar-noon-time-different-every-day" target="_blank">here</a>. Basically, the difference between sunrise to solar noon and solar noon to sunset is roughly the same, but solar noon itself changes. Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a cool effect due to the fact the Earth is not on a circular orbit. Instead, it is elliptical, which means it travels faster around perihelion (January) and slower around aphelion (July).</p>
<p>We must also consider the fact that, with respect to background stars, the Earth spins on its orbit 366.25 times per year, with the trip around the sun effectively subtracting one day and giving the usual 365.25. That means that a day with respect to fixed stars (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time" target="_blank">sidereal day</a> ) is slightly shorter than an apparent day at 23 hours, 56 minutes. </p>
<p>So, if the Earth wasn't moving on its orbit, 23h56m after you saw the Sun in one location, it would be seen in the same location. The reason it shifts is because the Earth has moved ~1 degree (well, 366.5/360 degrees, or 4 minutes) <em>around</em> the Sun. So the Earth has to turn just that bit more for the Sun to reach the same point it was yesterday.</p>
<p>Now, if the Earth was on a circular orbit, all would be fine, and every 24 hours the Sun would return to the same location in the sky (negating seasons). BUT, it has an elliptical orbit. This means the speed around the Sun varies over the year, so as you get towards perihelion, the Sun actually appears to move slightly faster around the earth. But we set a day from the <em>average</em> spin of the Earth.</p>
<p>Hence near perihelion the Earth is moving faster, and after 23h56m+4mins, the Earth hasn't quite spun enough to make up for it's speed on its orbit. The effect of this is that the apparent position of the Sun compared to the average position seems to move forwards. As sunset and sunrise are roughly equidistant from when the sun is highest, sunrise seems to stay still while sunset races away.</p>
<p>At aphelion the opposite happens and after 23h56m+4mins the Earth, which is travelling more slowly than usual, slightly over-rotates with respect to the Sun. Hence the position of the Sun appears to be moving backwards during the (Northern) summer months.</p>
<p>I hope that makes some sense. The entire effect is quite confusing, but it's why we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma" target="_blank">Analemma</a>'s, and it's why the sunrise and sunset seem to move around, especially around perihelion, when Earth moves fastest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think Analemma is the best explanation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma</a>). </p>
<p>Here is a good picture of it: <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101231.html" target="_blank">https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101231.html</a></p>
<p>Close to the solstices the sun is at the top (summer) and bottom (winter) of the figure 8 pattern. As the sun &quot;turns the corner&quot; from our perspective it is moving more laterally than up and down for several days. During that time the sunrise/sunset times don't deviate too much. Look at your chart right around Jan 8, you will see the sunrise/sunset times start to make bigger changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am assuming that you meant &quot;Spring Equinox&quot;. The closest approach of the earth to sun happens in Northern Winter, Jan. 4; Because the Sun is at the nearest focus on the orbit but the earth's rotation is petty constant, the observed solar transit is sped up before the winter solstice and retarded with respect to a clock after. This effect is greatest from fall until spring.</p>
<p>This is also why the switch from daylight to standard time is not symmetric to length of daylight. The equation of Time, and that figure eight on some globes tells us that we can extend daylight savings lime in the fall and retard it in the spring because the sunset is as much as 20 minutes late in the fall and we can wait until early March to begin daylight savings time because the sun is slow by that amount even though the length of day is more in March than it is in November.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
