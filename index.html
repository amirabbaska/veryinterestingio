		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. You wouldn't be saved from eating immediately before. Your body needs to metabolize the food into your blood which isn't instant. Not only that, if you're on the brink of starvation, then your digestive system wouldn't be functioning ideally; after all, starving to death takes typically over a month (assuming you're hydrated) and in the last week or so your organs would be damaged and shutting down, plus you're barely producing stomach acid to digest anyway.</p>
<p>To add even more on top of that, there's refeeding syndrome which involves a number of pretty shitty disorders. Essentially though, from my understanding, during starvation, your body uses up it's resources and switches to consuming your fatty acids to conserve red blood cells. When refeeding occurs, the body tries to pump out more red blood cells, but the resources used to make those normally are used up, so some compound builds in the liver and skeleton which uses up ATP in red blood cells causing the red blood cells to not work properly and they don't deliver enough oxygen around your body. There are also other things that happen, but I'm not sure about them.</p>
<p>Often times, when faced with emancipated, emaciated WW2 captives, allied soldiers were told not to give any food to the emaciated captives and to keep them away from finding food as it could literally kill them because of refeeding syndrome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Standard practice when rescuing starving people is to give small amounts of food in order to prevent refeeding syndrome. It depends on your condition and the type and amount of food you have.</p>
<p>Long answer: With adequate food, the body primarily uses glucose for energy, but the body can't store as much glucose as it can protein and fat. Trouble is, the brain can't use fatty acids for energy, so the body produces ketone bodies to help replace the glucose you aren't eating. This process, called ketosis, releases acid into the body. If you undergo ketosis for long enough to starve, then ketoacidosis, a deadly acidification of the the blood, may occur. If you can't get treated for severe acidification, then it doesn't matter what you eat. You'll die (interestingly, this is why untreated Type I diabetes is also extremely dangerous).</p>
<p>But let's say your blood hasn't turned to acid before your rescue. Ketosis changes the metabolic environment of the body in other ways, but the body would prefer to metabolize food normally. If you eat a load of food, then the body will immediately shift to the normal mode of metabolism, and that shift is what causes refeeding syndrome. Several days of limited intake helps &quot;prime&quot; the body for regular metabolism and slows down the shift from ketosis to normal metabolism. If your &quot;last moment&quot; means that you have no more stored calories, then the shift from no food to enough food for you to live would probably kill you. If your &quot;last moment&quot; means that you have just enough stored calories to maintain your life until you can finish the metabolic shift, then it might save you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another issue I haven't seen mentioned on here yet is something called &quot;refeeding syndrome.&quot; It's something that happens when you haven't eaten for weeks. The influx of glucose and other nutrients into your system cranks up hormones that had been essentially shut down, especially insulin. The sudden change causes a massive shift and depletion of electrolytes like phosphorous and magnesium among others. It's so bad it can send you into heart failure. That's why if you're admitted to the hospital due to starvation, they reintroduce food very slowly with a close eye on your electrolytes. </p>
<p>tl;dr Refeeding syndrome is more likely to kill you after reintroducing food than anything else </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dug up some old lecture notes about this. If there's any factual errors, please tell me.</p>
<p>Aight, so, in the context of the human body necrosis is the word for uncontrolled cell death (things leak out of the cell, causes inflammation), while apoptosis is the word for controlled cell death (everything packed up in neat vesicles for further breakdown). Severe hypoxia will lead to necrosis eventually.</p>
<p>Essentially, what happens when a cell is exposed to hypoxia is that it starts switches over to anaerobic metabolism. This, however, produces way less ATP (energy) than aerobic metabolism, and also produces lactate as a byproduct. Insufficient ATP leads to the ion-pumps on the surface of the cell not functioning, and thus an electrolyte imbalance (as the cell normally needs to spend energy to maintain the differing concentrations intra-/extracellularly). The electrolyte imbalance results in net flow of fluid into the cell, and thus cell swelling, due to osmotic effects.</p>
<p>Electrolyte imbalance and lactate accumulation leads to a decreased pH, which in turn leads to wrongly folded proteins (protein folding is a very important and intricate process to ensure functional proteins). Crucially, these misfolded proteins along with the ATP-deficiency means the cell fails to maintain an low intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions. Ca2+ is important in many of the signaling systems of the human body, and can activate many different enzymes (for instance, phospolipases which break down the cell membrane). High Ca2+ leads to uncontrolled activation of various enzymes, which begin to break down various structures of the cell (this is semi-functional; moderate Ca2+ induces apoptosis while a high conc. induces necrosis). It also disrupts mitochondrial functioning by opening pores in their membrane.</p>
<p>The phospolipases mentioned above also break the membranes around lysosomes, which are intracellular packets containing a lot of catalytic enzymes (as a safeguard, these are supposed to only be active in the presence of the low pH present in lysosomes, but hypoxia leads to acidity as mentioned before) that the cells use to degrade various organic matter.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: cell fails to maintain electrolyte and pH balance, high Ca2+ concentration activates a ton of enzymes haphazardly that begin to break down the cell (among them, lysosome membranes -&gt; leakage of catalytic enzymes into the cytosol), improper electrolyte balance causes cell swelling, mitochondria cease to function -&gt; &quot;point of no return&quot; as ATP cannot be generated even in the presence of oxygen</p>
<p>Edit: updated some things after reading a book. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The stray's particles collide with the odorous particles and coagulate, forming slightly larger particles.  In effect, this removes a odorous particle from the air, but a particle that can collide with other odorous particles remains in the system.  As these particles become more massive, local air currents are not providing enough force to counteract gravity and they fall to the ground, leaving a film on your floor.  Clean your bathroom.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern chemistry has shown us that certain chemical agents, when atomized and inhaled, are capable of blocking our smell receptors, thus blunting our ability to detect odor. Other air fresheners coat our nasal passages with an oily film, and many still just cover up the original odor with better-smelling scents. A minority of air fresheners actually break down the offensive odor, and even those ones generally contain a heavy dose of chemicals.</p>
<p>What’s Wrong with Conventional Air Fresheners?
A regular run-of-the-mill air freshener will probably contain at least one of the following scary chemicals:</p>
<p>Phthalates. Synthetic fragrances usually contain phthalates, and most of us know that these are bad—linked with early puberty, autism, obesity, and birth defects. You won’t see “phthalate” on a label; it’ll just say “fragrance” or perhaps “parfum.”
PEG-40. The Environmental Working Group considers this polymer to be moderately hazardous to human health.
1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB).1,4-DCB is reasonably anticipated to a human carcinogen, and has been shown to cause kidney and testicular cancer in rats. It also has been shown to cause reduced lung function and increased asthma rates in humans.
Air fresheners may also contain some really gross chemicals that won’t show up on the label. A 2007 study tested 74 air freshening products and measured the concentration of VOCs in the air after use. They reported that a total of more than 350 different chemicals and allergens were detected, including (but not limited to!) benzene, formaldehyde, styrene, and phthalates.</p>
<p>Spray bottles (aerosol) cause additional health risks due to ingredients used as propellants, such as butane and propane.</p>

<p>tl;dr is GPUs are great if your problem is &quot;I want to do the exact same thing to an entire dataset&quot;, not so much if it's &quot;I want to run this set of instructions exactly once&quot;.  There's nothing stopping you from running arbitrary code on a GPU but performance will tank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The smart guys can handle most problems thrown at them quickly. Simple tasks are easy to them, has are tough intense tasks, but there's only 4 of them. They can't do something that requires a lot of busy work efficiently.</p>
<p>The 100 dumb guys, meanwhile, can't do really complex tasks that easily. However, when it comes to busy work, they just have a lot more man power. So if they have to do something like draw the same picture 100 times, it takes them a lot less time than the smart guys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GPUs are faster for 2 reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they are much simpler cores (missing features see below) and thus smaller and more can fit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GPUs do not try to maximize IPC (instructions per clock); in other words they suck at single thread sequential execution of instructions, only problems that can be efficiently multithreaded are suitable for GPUs</p>
</li>
<li>they are SIMD machines. When you compare a proper AVX CPU implementation of an algorithm with a GPU implementation, the performance difference of GPUs already is more reasonable. When compared to a simple CPU implementation that does not take advantage of 256bit wide data words with AVX, the performance difference to GPUs appears much larger, because SIMD is really a requirement for proper GPU algorithms while it is not the most commonplace approach taken with CPU code - comparisons are usually between unoptimized CPU code and optimized GPU code and the performance difference is thus exaggerated.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a large set of features that is geared towards single thread IPC throughput in CPUs (the reason for that is that most programs are single threaded):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>out of order execution (including register renaming, data dependency conflict detection, ...)</p>
</li>
<li>branch prediction</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are a boatload of features in CPUs that make them suitable to run a modern operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>interrupts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiple privilege levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sophisticated virtual memory management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connectivity to a more complex set of support chips on the mainboard</p>
</li>
<li>virtualization</li>
</ul>
<p>Each core on a GPU is in essence a very simple SIMD CPU core. Because they lack sophisticated management functions they could not execute a modern operating system. Because programs for GPUs are harder to write they are not used for everything. Because most code executed on a CPU is hardly performance critical GPUs are not used for everything.</p>
<p>When we are talking about straightforward parallel code that is performance critical to the application then GPUs are used for almost everything; if the programmer takes the little extra time to do it right. They are for example used for everything graphics related. They are used for almost everything in the high performance computing community.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of code that a computer executes that is not really performance critical is way larger than the really critical parts, so when you want comfort and do not care about speed then a CPU is just much quicker to program.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Not everyone experiences this condition, and many times the muscles just go back to normal.  Your ligaments and joints get loose as well, all caused by certain pregnancy hormones that enable a women's hips to shift during birth.  All of this usually goes back to normal in the months after birth.  Binding your belly after birth can help your muscles come back together as well, at least anecdotally.  Your skin will almost always stay a little looser than before.  </p>
<p>FYI, there are many exercises you can do to strengthen your ab muscles after birth (wait a couple months minimum though, to heal) and these are usually not your typical &quot;ab strengthening&quot; exercises/movements.  Crunches will not help, and can often make diastasis recti worse.  A quick google search will help you find something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Now see them, slowly over months, be pushed further apart. They stretch, flatten and separate, allowing your belly to grow forward. Pregnancy hormones allow a woman's muscles to soften and relax more; which is why you can do some serious damage lifting heavy things or playing sports (both things I did during my pregs). I had big babies so ended up post-preg with 6 inches of separation and had to do physio immediately after birth, while everything was still soft. Perfectly fine now, everything has snapped back into place, but I have a friend who did not do the physio who now has a permanent pot belly due to her abs being out of place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The ones who maintain core fitness throughout pregnancy often keep their 'six packs' up to the birth. Diastasis (separation or laxity of the rectus abdominal muscles) is not inevitable. For those mamas who have cesareans, some surgeons suture the muscle layer back together and others don't, it's a personal preference. </p>
<p>Wrapping the abdomen postpartum is a very old indigenous tradition that serves the purpose of encouraging muscle healing and preventing diastasis too. </p>

<p>When somebody says 'abdominal muscles' they are mostly referring to rectus abdominus which is the 'six pack' muscle. This muscle helps you to do sit-ups and that is all (and I guess it looks good if toned). But the real important abdominal muscles are underneath the rectus abdominus. One of the primary muscles involved in keeping your abdomen together and supporting your lower back in a muscle called transverse abdominus. This muscle together with a couple of others including the diaphragm, makes up the 'core' muscles. Transverse abdominus acts as a corset around your body so, when working optimally, it can prevent any splitting of rectus abdominus during pregnancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with most of the &quot;open-mind&quot; and &quot;putting yourself in other shoes&quot; comments but I'd like to focus on a different aspect.   </p>
<p>It's about thinking about something without accepting it as true. What do I mean thinking about it?   </p>
<p>Well, let's suppose tigers are blue. Then what? Well, they wouldn't be very well camouflaged. They would probably have to radically change the way they get food or otherwise go extinct. Also, why would they be blue? Maybe a different environment could cause that, which would make the previous consideration irrelevant.   </p>
<p>What if God doesn't exist? Well, then God couldn't be the basis of morality. Is there any basis of morality at all? Would it be objective, something out in the world, or maybe the basis would have to be us as a society deciding what is right or wrong, or maybe it would have to be based on personal growth for each individual, or something else entirely.   </p>
<p>I know Tigers aren't blue, but I can still think about related issues. I, personally, don't care whether God exists or not, but there are implications and questions if God does exist, and different implications and questions if God doesn't. There is no such thing as an isolated &quot;fact;&quot; every fact is connected to many others. To be able to think about something is, in part, to be able to consider those connections. Whether you believe in God or not - heck, even if everyone in the world believed in God (and, thus, there are no actual shoes of the other to put yourself in) - you should still be able to consider what it would <em>mean</em> if God didn't exist.   </p>
<p>So, I think the quote is partly about the relationships between propositions, rather than fixating on the truth value of those propositions. After all, Aristotle is the father of category logic, which is all about those propositions and not, primarily, their truth. For instance:<br />
All X are Y<br />
Some X are Z<br />
Therefore Some Z are Y<br />
This is a valid argument - if the premises are true, the conclusion MUST be true, but we have no idea if the premises are true because it's just formal. If we fill it in:<br />
All dogs are rocket ships<br />
Some dogs are bars of soap<br />
Therefore, some bars of soap are rocket ships<br />
If the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true: If it were the case that, in actuality, all dogs were rocket ships, and it really was the case that some dogs were bars of soap, then some bars of soap would HAVE TO BE rocket ships, namely, the bars of soaps that were also dogs (because all dogs are rocket ships). So, we looked at the implications of some claims, even though the claims are obviously false and absurd. Better yet, some claims are not obviously true or obviously false, but figuring out their implications can help us to solve the question of truth, and also to figure out all sorts of other things, too.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think the argument is that a wise person should be able to understand why someone else might adopt a belief or idea that they personally disagree with. Just take any controversial belief you may hold and compare yourself to others who would oppose that belief. If you're pro-LGBTQ, try to understand why someone might be anti-LGBTQ. If you're pro-choice, try to understand why someone might be pro-life. If you're pro-gun-control, try to understand why someone might be anti-gun-control. If you support prohibition of drugs, try to understand why someone might support legalization of drugs. </p>
<p>A huge amount of people take sides on any given issue and are either unable or unwilling to consider the perspective of people who oppose them- dismissing opposing arguments as senseless, stupid, pointless, misguided, etc... I think that Aristotle is saying, a wise person is able to take a side while actually understanding why the opposing side believes what they do and respecting them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

For example, if you returned to that hotel room you'd probably easily recall the exact spot you put your contacts before, because that memory was stored in association with your memory of that location. As far as repetitive things like showers, it's easy to forget if you took one today because you have e a ton of competing/overlapping memories of the same thing, and your brain has to search thru them for the most relevant incidence. Not sure if that fully answers the question but there ya go. Out of date psych degree here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you've got two different things here: repeated acts, and one-time acts that have low salience. You take a shower every day, so &quot;how to wash self&quot; gets treated as a learned skill/task and is not impacted by other memories created that day. If you do the same routine for long enough your brain starts to treat each of the separate actions involved like components of a single task. The parts of it are not recalled separately, either when you're doing them or when you want to remember them later. That's why when you get interrupted in the middle of it, it's hard to remember what part you were at. </p>
<p>Remembering where you put your contacts in a hotel room (and appearance of the room itself) is a one-time event with low saliency. When it was occurring you did not attach importance to the actions involved by involving otherwise-unrelated parts of your mind, like executive decision making, emotions, other memories, etc. This memory is not connected to anything else and you don't spend time afterward activating it by thinking about it, so it's a good target for overwriting later when you need to remember something else for an hour or two. This is why mnemonics tricks often involve telling yourself a little story about the thing you want to remember: this attaches the thing to a bunch of other things such as visual images or jokes or music, and this causes your brain to treat it as less of a target for pruning. After rehearsing the story a little bit, the memory stabilizes, becoming long-lasting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Edit: I meant acceleration of charge, not mass, thanks for pointig this out.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, and one of the questions that led us away from the classical model of the atom and towards the quantum model. You are correct that the classical way we think of an atom (positively charged nucleus, negative particle in a circular orbit around it) would emit radiation, causing the electron to decay into the nucleus. The fact that this doesn't happen means this must not be the correct model.</p>
<p>We now know that the electron is not a point mass orbiting the nucleus at all, but a &quot;density cloud&quot; which constantly surrounds it. You've likely heard of the &quot;wave particle duality&quot; of light- well it's not just light which has this duality, all particles do (it's just most pronounced with light, since the less mass a particle has the more &quot;wave like&quot; it acts). So, the electron is in a wave around the nucleus (and actually, when it is in its ground state it is in a standing wave) so it doesn't radiate (in fact, when it is in an excited state it is no longer a standing wave, which is why it does radiate and then fall down to the ground state). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Accelerating a mass doesn't necessarily cause its kinetic energy to change so long as the magnitude of its velocity is constant.</p>
<p>The previous answer explains a more complicated issue in that accelerating a charged particle does cause it to lose energy, and how the absence of this effect with electron orbits helped us understand that the typical chemistry book model of an atom is inaccurate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two answers here really:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you are correct that acceleration <em>can</em> cause a change in kinetic energy. However, there is a special kind of motion called <em>circular motion</em>, such as the approximate orbits of planets, where the acceleration is roughly perpendicular to the direction of motion at any given time, so the kinetic energy is unchanged. So the electrons, orbiting in circular motion around the nucleus, should not lose energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>However: Electrons have a charge. Highschool-level physics should tell you that accelerating a charged particle causes radiation to be emitted, and that this radiation carries away with it some of the energy of the particle. Accelerating the electrons in a circle, therefore, should cause them to lose energy. The solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wave-particle duality. Everything is both a particle and a wave. When electrons orbit the nucleus, the orbitals behave as waves, and the electron does not truly accelerate, but simply exists in all possible places around the nucleus, with varying frequencies (we're pushing the limits of my physics knowledge here). Thus, no radiation is emitted, and no energy lost. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: A letter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dont think of an electron as orbiting around an atom but being &quot;stuck&quot; in an orbital. An orbital is an area in or around an atom that due to the collection of forces around it, the electron will &quot;stay&quot; in this area unless given enough energy to get out of this area, ie. it gets hit by a photon, or another electron flys by.</p>
<p>In the simplest atom, hydrogen, the first orbital is called S1 and is an area around the proton where the electron is &quot;trapped&quot;. If you have more then one electron, they will become trapped in other orbitals with names like S2, P2, ... Search &quot;atomic orbitals&quot; and you will get some pretty neat pictures of where the electrons end up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right, but atoms don't work like that. If they did they would be unstable because the electrons would be radiating energy. That's the main reason why Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom is wrong and this led to the development of quantum mechanics, where thinks work very differently (the question has no basis there as you can't say the electron is travelling and under acceleration).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the brain is like an echo chamber that can be filled with silent sounds. It is not electrically/mechanically perfect, and so there are little inklings of sound even when none really exists. And then you have the individual perceiving it all, shifting minute amounts of attention to this or that within the inklings... If you're familiar with a song that's even remotely similar to how the inklings fit into your perception, it can bubble all the way up into that song's chorus or bridge.</p>
<p>TLDR: you listen to so much pop music that even silence reminds you of songs you know</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most answers you get are probably from people who think you talk about ear worms, I had that problem at least when I tried to explain it in real life.</p>
<p>I've since been to a few neurologists, and they are all very interested as hearing music in your head truly 100% of the time seems to be very rare. I was offered to participate in some studies, but they all take at least 10 days an I can't really be bothered to disappear from life for over a week for basically nothing, as I was assured the condition is not dangerous (no tumour or anything). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
