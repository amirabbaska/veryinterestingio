Ever notice how people turn down the volume of music in their car when they're driving to a new area or looking for a location? I've read that this can be described as an intentional reduction of stimulus used in order to improve focus. In fact, I turned down my music half way through writing that sentence. Perhaps in the same way when you're trying to think of something, you look off to the side to try and ignore whatever is in your visual field while you focus on searching for that info within your brain!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do this to reduce stimulus so we can focus better. When your eyes look left or right you are making your field of view smaller thus reducing the amount of stimulus you receive from your visual field. This allows for more processing power to be used in whatever mental task you're attempting like remembering something or calculating a math problem. We will also look in different directions depending on the type of mental task because many mental tasks majorly occupy either the right or left half of our brain and our visual fields are mostly split in the same way. </p>
<p>Example: for most people language is majorly located on the left half of your brain. If you're struggling to remember a word you might look to your left. This decreases the amount of light that can enter your right visual field. Everything in your right visual field is usually sent to your left brain (confusing I know) so by reducing the amount of stimulus received in the right visual field you send less signals to the left brain allowing for more processing power and better focus on remembering the word. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your graphics card is a famed renaissance painter named Giancarlo Pasquali Uberti sitting in a room. In this room is a canvas, paint, and a pneumatic messaging tube like they have at bank drive-thrus. Giancarlo also has a brother named Cirino Pasquali Uberti that he works with. Cirino can't paint, but he's great with customers and runs their shop. Cirino's job is to take orders for paintings, then send messages to Giancarlo that tell him what to paint. He can't fit big messages in the tube, though, it's real small, so each message tells Giancarlo how to paint a single object. A message might be like &quot;Paint an apple 50cm from the left edge of the canvas, 20cm from the top&quot;. Giancarlo is very fast, but it takes him longer to finish a painting if he has to paint lots of individual things (it wastes time writing a message, sending the message through the tube, opening it up, reading it), or if he has to paint a really big canvas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, Cirino and Giancarlo are pretty smart, and they've figured out some tricks to make paintings go faster. Cirino takes great notes while talking to customers, and knows how far away each object in the painting is supposed to be. This is known as its depth. While Cirino isn't a good painter, he's very organized, so he sorts the messages by depth, closest object to furthest, and throws away any objects that are hidden behind something else. The only messages he sends to Giancarlo are just those objects that will be seen in the painting. This is way faster! Giancaralo knows that it's in order, so he doesn't have to waste time painting things that overlap. Since it takes time to paint an area of the canvas (the bigger the area, the more time), this is very efficient. Giancarlo doesn't have to paint over the same spots on the canvas at all, he just paints every spot once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then comes a job to paint a still life with a frosted glass vase in it. Cirino sorts everything, and realizes there's a problem. The glass vase is translucent, you can see through it, so it changes how stuff behind it looks since it isn't totally clear. No amount of sorting can fix this, and he eventually realizes that Giancarlo is going to have to paint over the same spot twice to get the right look (remember, he can only tell Giancarlo to paint one object at a time in his messages). The clever brothers think about this for a while, and come up with an idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their new plan is to work on the same painting twice. First, they do what they usually do, sort all the solid objects front-to-back, and only paint the ones that can be seen. Second, they sort all the see-through objects back-to-front and Giancarlo paints each one in order, still careful not to paint any that would be hidden behind a solid object. Sorting the see-through objects back-to-front makes sure they look right if two see-through objects overlap, like if you're looking at that frosted vase through a stained glass window. It wouldn't look right if they painted the vase in front of the window! The results look great, but it's a lot more work than just painting solid objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, for just a single vase it's not so bad, but once you have a scene with lots of smoke, fog, shadows, etc, Giancarlo spends a lot of time going over and over and over spots he's already painted to build up these translucent layers. This slows things down, and it's a big reason why your GPU struggles with these sorts of effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really hard to ELI5 graphics algorithms, but I'll do my best to keep it simple.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> All those effects make the GPU do a bunch of work twice (or more) instead of once.</p>
<p>Of the three special effects you list (fire, fog, and shadows), two of them are actually the same thing as far as a GPU is concerned: fire and fog are both examples of partially transparent objects, so I will group them together.</p>
<p>The work a graphics card has to do to draw a scene can be broken roughly into two parts. The first part is the work it has to do for each 3D polygon (triangle) in the scene to determine which pixels that triangle covers. The second part is the work it has to do for each pixel to calculate the color and brightness of that pixel.</p>
<p><strong>Transparent objects are demanding because they make the GPU process each pixel multiple times, multiplying the amount of work done in the per-pixel phase of rendering.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shadows are demanding because they make the GPU process each triangle multiple times, multiplying the amount of work done in the per-triangle phase of rendering.</strong></p>
<p>Without transparent objects, there is exactly one surface visible at each point on the screen (disregarding anti-aliasing). Therefore the GPU only has to calculate light and color for each pixel once. With transparent objects like fire and fog you can see multiple layers at each point on the screen, so the GPU has to calculate light and color for each layer at each pixel, then blend them together.</p>
<p>To draw shadows, the GPU has to draw the scene from the perspective of each light that casts shadows, just as if that light were actually another camera. It usually doesn't have to calculate any color from the light's perspective, but it still has to go through the process of drawing each triangle in the scene for every light.</p>
<p>It turns out that many &quot;demanding&quot; effects in video games are slow because they multiply some part of the work of drawing a scene:</p>
<p>Transparency: Multiplies per-pixel work in the areas covered by transparent things.</p>
<p>Shadow Mapping: Multiplies per-triangle work (plus some extra work at each pixel).</p>
<p>Anti-Aliasing: Multiplies per-pixel work at the edges of each triangle on screen.</p>
<p>Global Illumination: Multiplies everything by everything else until your GPU catches on fire...</p>
<p>If that all sounds confusing, that's because it is. I can try to clarify if anything about my wall of text is particularly unclear.</p>
<p>Edit: I should mention that the problem of drawing pixels multiple times is called &quot;overdraw.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit2: I should also mention that &quot;duplicate&quot; work was probably a poor choice of words. It's not redundant, it just has to process the same point multiple times instead of just once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Accurately simulating any 3D scene is impossible in a computer game. About 10^19 photons hit every square metre of earth during a single 1/60th of a second frame, so obviously simulating even a tiny fraction of the photons in a normal video game scene is just intractable. But a lot of simple stuff can be simulated in a way that looks good enough without doing it accurately. Fire, fog, shadows, refractive glass, mirrors and all kinds of other effects are stuff that <em>don't</em> work in this simple way of rendering things, so require a more complicated simulation to make them look any good. More complicated means more work for your graphics card. So the question might rather be: <em>why are things like rendering a chair in a room with two small lamps and no windows easy for graphics cards?</em> Below I will try to answer both questions.</p>
<p><strong>More info:</strong> Traditional 3D rendering works backwards: you start at the virtual camera and, for each pixel you want to render, trace out a line until you hit an object - each line goes out at a slightly different angle for each pixel. You then look at the angle and distance from that object to every single light source in your scene and calculate how much light the object is receiving. Then, examine the material the artist gave that object and see how it reacts to light to determine what colour it is at that spot. You then draw that pixel that colour. (This is backwards because in reality, obviously, light travels <em>into</em> the camera, not out of it.)</p>
<p>This requires you to trace lines to see what they hit exactly the same number of times as there are pixels in your image. For each pixel you also have to calculate distances and angles to exactly the number of lights in your scene, though games tend to use tricks to reduce this number (by making lights outside a certain distance not count, or by pre-calculating a lot of this information so some more can be skipped.) This is all quite doable and is represented in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Ray_trace_diagram.svg" target="_blank">this diagram</a>.</p>
<p>Now none of this allows you to render shadows: suppose you're calculating a certain pixel and calculating the distance and angle from the object in front of that pixel to the single light illuminating the scene. At no point do you check whether there's anything in the way which would prevent light from getting to that point. To do that you'd have to not just calculate the distance and angle, but trace another line to every light (the shadow ray in the diagram above) - that takes more calculations and makes it slower. Again there are tricks: you could say that only stationary objects and light sources can cast shadows, pre-calculate all that information and then you don't need to do it every frame in the game. But this of course doesn't look as good.</p>
<p>Basically for the other things the answer comes down to the same thing: forcing the engine to trace more lines. Sometimes you're forced to trace lines from the light sources instead of from the camera - this is very wasteful as you have no idea which will end up hitting the camera (perhaps after bouncing off some objects); any that don't have no effect on the scene at all. You're forced to trace far too few to actually look good and hope you can smooth out the resulting mess to look decent. Other times, like with reflective surfaces, you have to trace the bounces off the objects. If you have two mirrors facing each other, you have to cut off the trace at some point, which will prevent the render taking an infinite length of time but result in a black spot in the mirror.</p>
<p>How about fog? Basic fog is actually easy and used to be a way to make games run <em>faster</em> - when you worked out what colour a pixel should be by tracing out a line to the object in front of it, you'd also mix that colour with the fog colour according to how far the object is away from the viewer. Then at some far-away distance, all objects would be exactly the same colour, and you wouldn't have to do any further calculations. It could sometimes produce <a href="http://treditor.hu/7/gmac/nglemanual/weather09.jpg" target="_blank">weird effects</a> if the fog doesn't match up with the rest of the background. But real fog isn't like this - as light passes through it, it scatters, making things in fog look blurry. It's partially transparent, meaning you can see things on the other side, but also the fog at the same time. So suppose you run the above algorithm for fog: you trace out a line for a single pixel and discover the first thing it hits is a region of fog. You can't just colour that pixel according to the properties of fog, because then the fog would be opaque, so you have to first do the calculations for what is illuminating that little area of fog, and then continue calculating. A naïve approach would be to continue the line through the fog until it hits an opaque object, and mix the colour of the opaque object with the colour of the fog according to the distance of the line segment that passed through the fog, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20011003/boyd_01.gif" target="_blank">like this</a>. Already this is more complicated, but this is not a perfect simulation. As I said, fog scatters light: each photon that passes through can be randomly disturbed so that it goes off at another angle. Also, the single line you trace through the fog might pass through a region which is shadowed - <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Fog_shadow_of_a_tree-crepuscular_rays.JPG" target="_blank">like in this photograph</a> and those patches should be darker than if you just treated every path through the fog of the same length the same. So what you really need to do is calculate the illumination at every single point through the fog, randomly make the line you're tracing bounce off somewhere else. Except you can't do it randomly because then each frame, and for each adjacent pixel, the angle would be different - you'd get a flickering mess of noise. Instead you want to simulate the fact that each pixel is the aggregate of billions of rays of light, and simulate that they're all bouncing at once! Of course, it's not possible to trace billions of lines for each pixel that hits fog, nor to calculate illumination at every point within it, so games use tricks, but to get the look correct, you still need to do a lot of extra calculation.</p>
<p>If I may digress a little, the problem is that you can't treat things like fog as being <em>homogeneous.</em> For 3D that means you can't treat light going through it as having only two interactions: one at the beginning and one at the end. (In fact it would be better to just have one interaction!) The traditional approach to cheaply modelling transparent objects is to pretend that a ray of light passes into, say, a glass paperweight, changes angle once due to refraction, passes through the paperweight being continuously attenuated as it does so, exits out the other side and is refracted again. The ray of light does not change path inside the glass, it never encounters a bubble, trapped piece of dust or anything else. If you want to simulate this things that occur in a <em>heterogenous</em> transparent object, where interesting things may happen inside, you have to chop the object up into thousands of pieces small enough that you can't see them, and perform complex calculations as your ray of light passes through each tiny volume. This is a general problem in simulation: whenever you can't deal with something as being defined by a simple process inside it, a start and an end, things get hard.</p>
<p><strong>Digression over:</strong></p>
<p>Fire is like glowing fog, so it has a lot of the same problems, but it also represents something very hard: a light source with size. When you calculate the illumination of an object, it's much easier if you can pretend all the light from each source is coming from a single infinitely small point, rather than being spread over, say, the element of a lightbulb, or a fluorescent tube, or a whole fire. This is because to accurately simulate the illumination you'd need to act as if there were millions of tiny lights all over the surface of the object, and calculate how far and at what angle they were to the thing being lit up. Millions of lights means millions of calculations - which again is not possible, and again the tricks that can be used to fake it are still computationally expensive. But also if you want to simulate the way fire moves rather than just recording a video of it, that is a very difficult process. Again you are reduced to trying to simulate the fire as lots of tiny particles - but nowhere near as many particles as makes up a real fire. So you try to apply physical laws to the particles but they can't actually behave physically because they're too big or because information like the air currents in the environment is lacking. Usually people just use a recording with some tricks to make it look less like a recording.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot depends on how all these elements are handled in a game.
Best case scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fire is a simple object, animated in a 3d program and let loose in the game. The animation loops and it's quite noticable but you can get away with it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The fog is just things in the distance getting blurrier. Looks quite bad but it's cheap.</p>
</li>
<li>Only static (non-moving) objects cast shadows, no dynamic lights.</li>
</ul>
<p>This might sound like a lot of assumptions but it's not entirely unrealistic and there certainly are games which can use this simple model. It's very, very cheap.</p>
<p>Worst case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fire is made using multiple particle systems including multiple types of flame, randomized smoke, lights, dust and small elements flying around wildly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fog is also a large particle system with added blur effects</p>
</li>
<li>Multiple lights with multiple dynamic objects casting dynamic shadows</li>
</ul>
<p>This model is used in games with better graphics and there are multiple performance concerns. I won't go into the details but the main issue is that many of the effects require multiple passes which basically means the image you finally get on the screen needs to be drawn multiple times by the GPU. First object geometry, then lighting, then shadows, then particles, then special effects like antialiasing, bloom, ambient occlusion etc. and if you have a lot of those they can easily become a GPU bottleneck.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shortest and simplest ELI5 I think is that, as in real life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire generates light.</li>
<li>Fog blocks and alters light.</li>
<li>Shadows are cast by light from different sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these things either generate or alter light and dynamic light calculations are complex and grow exponentially with the amount of light sources and alteration sources present.</p>
<p>the addition of 1 light source does not just add one light source or one more shadow to a scene, an additional light source interacts with the other light sources and every new light source or alteration in the available light alters the effects of every other light source or alteration in the available light.</p>
<p>A really simplistic analogy on the scope of adding just one light source or alteration to light is this:</p>
<p>Imagine counting to 9.</p>
<p>You can do that in 9 counts and it'll take you under 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Now add 1 more digit.</p>
<p>Now you have to count to 99, which takes a lot longer, around 1 and a half minute.</p>
<p>Now add another digit.</p>
<p>Now you have to count to 999, which will take you around 17 minutes.</p>
<p>Now another one.</p>
<p>Now you have to count to 9999, which will take you over 2 and a half hours.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Similar complexity exists in calculating the effects of light sources in 3D.</p>
<p>In 3D Processing there are a ton of shortcuts and tricks to limit how large an impact a single light source has, but the effect will still be great with every one you add.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was reading about the case of Billy Milligan, who had Dissociative Identity Disorder and had 24 documented personalities: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Milligan#Personalities" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Milligan#Personalities</a></p>
<p>One of these personalities could write and speak in Serbian and was extraordinarily strong. The page doesn't say that Billy, in his normal persona, could speak in Serbian. How is this possible? And how could one of his personas be far stronger than another?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for how, the general consensus is that he learned at least some of the language somewhere, and that it took off from there. There are multiple cases dealing with brain injuries that deal with complete changes in personality and sometimes complete changes in language, so an alter ( alternative personality) knowing a different language isn't completely impossible. How Regan knew Serbian while Billy didn't? It's the same as why you might know English better than someone else. Regan is technically a completely different person. So he may think and speak in Serbian as his first language and English had secondary. You have to understand that the question isn't really why Billy can speak Serbian, it's where did Regan learn Serbian from. It wouldn't have to be a lot, just enough for Billy's brain to learn more. </p>
<p>Example: You know the French word for dog and door. You see a dog walk through a doorway. Someone says in French &quot;the dog walked through the door&quot;, you can figure out which word means &quot;walked&quot;. Now you know the French word for &quot;walked&quot;. </p>
<p>The brain is capable of amazing things. Absorbing a language isn't that hard for a brain wired to do so. That's why there are some people who can learn and speak in multiple languages easily, while someone else under the same circumstances, with the same opportunities, may not be able to learn a second language to save their life. Once the Regan personality fully developed he probably just went and interacted with Serbian people and media, which expanded his vocabulary.</p>
<p>As to how he can be stronger while still only possessing the qualities of Billy's body, that deals with Regan's mindset. </p>
<p>Have you ever seen people psych themselves up before lifting a heavy weight? Or someone else is yelling at them to &quot;get mad at it&quot;? People tend to exert more force when they're angry, even if you discount adrenaline as a factor. People tend to be stronger than they know, but without proper motivation or the proper mind set, they don't exert their full capability. </p>
<p>With Regan being the angriest personality (he was referred to as the &quot;keeper of hate&quot;) he would be more likely to put more effort behind something than Billy would. Therefore he'd be utilizing more of their body's capability (basically putting more &quot;umph&quot; into it) than Billy would.</p>
<p>In other cases, it comes down to the simple fact that the brain is the epicenter of DPD, and the brain tells everything else what to do. It could simply be that Billy's brain is convincing his personality that he's weak. He goes to pick up something, and he can't because his brain tells his muscles that they can't handle the weight, while it tells Regan's personality that they can. </p>
<p>When dealing with the traits of different personalities, outside of obvious answers, you start getting into unsolved neuroscience. Unlocking the brains full potential. If someone could figure out and reproduce how Regan learned Serbian without Billy really trying, they could make a whole lot of money selling that ability to people. There are cases of a personality having a disease that the others didn't. Why? Because no matter what condition your liver/kidneys/lungs/whatever are in, if your brain convinces them that they're not working, then they'll stop working. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you talk about DID, it's important to remember that <strong>there is no objective, empirical way to measure or evaluate claims of DID</strong>. In fact, there isn't even a universally accepted definition of the disorder. There is no measurable biological information that one would expect to observe with imaging like fMRI. It's just...what someone says is happening to them.</p>
<p>The leading theory is that trauma or stress causes dissociation and you &quot;forget&quot; about connections, which allows you to create separate identities. Say you have three groups of traits. Normally, you see yourself as the whole of the three. It's theorized that some people who dissociate lose whatever ties bind those that group together, leaving three separate groups of traits that appear as three separate identities. But <strong>there is no study that has ever demonstrated this mechanism</strong>.</p>
<p>Another theory is that alter identities are actually hallucinations, and one is experiencing psychosis not DID.</p>
<p>Now, dissociation as derealizing or depersonalization are well-studied reactions to stress, anxiety, trauma, etc. But they don't make people forget who they are.</p>
<p>With the Billy Milligan case specific, not criminally responsible is a <em>legal opinion</em>, not a medical diagnosis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: This is mainly about diarrhea than regular poop.  </p>
<p>&quot;So your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.
When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).
Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.
Let's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.
The Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.
I hope this answers your question.
TL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.

Expansion and irritation of your stomach leads to the activation of your enteric nervous system, which is a network of nerves running all throughout your GI tract. This activation leads to peristalsis and movement of the colon to make space for the new &quot;to be digested&quot; food. It takes hours to make stool from your food, it never runs right through you. Certain irritable foods can make your enteric nervous system get a little testy, so that's why that Indian curry seemed to come straight out.

<p>Edit: In the hopes of sparing my inbox some grief, let me explain. The fact is there are many reasons why eating can trigger defecation and OP's question is non-specific. I still think my answer is the most common reason as OP didn't mention anything about diarrhea or corn or contaminated food. Other mechanisms are also valid and have been well covered in other responses. Also spelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When food exits your stomach to enter the intestines, it's blocked by a valve called the pyloric valve to keep you from overloading your intestines with too much volume. Your body, wanting as much nutrition as possible because it doesn't know you plan on eating again, will hold as much food in your large intestine as possible for as long as possible because the longer it's in there, the more nutrients are absorbed.
So, when you eat and the pyloric valve is opened, that is a signal to your large intestine that &quot;hey! We have food again! Get rid of that old shit (pun intended.)&quot; This caused your colon to contract and poop out what, at this point, may be day or two old poop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>think about it as a canal that splits into two smaller canals of different sizes for a while before joining together at some point downstream. Consider elevation to be like voltage and the volumetric flow of the water to be current. The smaller canal has a bigger resistance to flow and allows less &quot;current.&quot; However, downstream the two canals still meet back together at the same &quot;voltage&quot; elevation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Another important consideration is that if node 1 is the high side of the resistors and node 2 is the low side, voltage can only have one value at node 1. Same for node 2. It's analogous to pressure in a pipe. If there were two plumbing routes from node 1 to node 2, pressure would be a single value at each node. However, flow would be determined by the resistance in each route. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is a combination of what /u/ajent123 and what /u/Mininni have said. </p>
<p>Ultimately it depends on the size of the studio.  A lot of porn studios are extremely legitimate and professional.  In that case, they pull permits for their scenes the same way any film studio would, and have a highly controlled environment, where extras have given consent, camera crews are standing by, as well as a full set of professionals for hair, makeup, etc.   </p>
<p>A smaller studio will most likely <em>not</em> do this, because it is difficult and costly, but also because they have less to lose.  A large studio is a legit operation, with insurance, payroll, probably investors and parent companies.  They need to be &quot;by the book&quot;, but they also have the money and legal teams to figure out the logistics and make sure everything is above board. </p>
<p>A smaller studio or freelance film crew can take the risk, film the scene quickly, and get out before they're caught.  If they are caught, they may face fines, and may either just pay them or get out of dodge, depending on what they get served for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I went to a large public university (UCLA) and one time I saw these two blonds walking around in skimpy clothing (not much skimpier than normal since it was a sunny day in Southern California) but they were particularly standing out.  They were on Bruinwalk which was the main walkway towards and from the dorms.<br />
As I was walking towards them/back to my dorm I recognized one of them.......vaguely....They also had one guy in front of them shooting something on his large camera. No cones set up, no tape, just two girls walking and a guy filming them.   Didn't think much of it since there are lots of famous people that visit the campus so I couldn't pinpoint who it was anyway.     </p>
<p>Fast forward a year or two (can't remember how long) and I was watching this adult video and  whaddaya know, the &quot;setting&quot; was on a university campus and it was the same scene that those two actresses were shooting that day!  I tried to locate myself in the video and I could faintly make out my backpack in the background, it wasn't particularly crowded that time since it was during classtime. This was a large famous studio too, I can't remember the name of the video/studio though but it was easily recognizable, they didn't shoot the actual sex acts in public, it was just used as a setting.  </p>
<p>Also I've walked into many, many, many filming scenes of &quot;Lifetime Channel&quot; movies walking around campus, like literally into the front of the camera while it's rolling cuz they don't rope anything off. They give no fucks at all and it looks like they shoot without a permit or telling the school's administration. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As to how it got there, well, the surface of the Earth is significantly different to how it was 500 million+ years ago. Oil, often referred to as &quot;fossil fuel&quot;, comes from fossilized plant material, animals (like dinosaurs, though little oil would actually be dinosaurs), and microbes in the oceans. While these dead things went further into the crust, the surface of the Earth changed: the climates changed, the tectonic plates moved, etc. So places like Saudi Arabia, the North Sea, Venezuela changed on the surface, but the fossil fuel was still there. </p>
<p>What you're probably confusing is that a lot of the world's oil comes from the Middle East because it is very easy (relatively speaking) to draw it to the surface, but the most of the oil in the Earth isn't <em>in</em> the Middle East.</p>

There are a ton of reasons why laptop/desktops see more viruses than smartphones and consoles.  I would say the top two reasons said by u/Gnomio1 and u/ckindley argue that creaters of malware are going to focus there energy on what gives the greatest return.</p>
<p>On top of that it comes down to the type of data.  PCs (even most enterprise servers/storage) run block or file data.  Mobile devices (excluding consoles here) tend to access data through object storage.  TL;DR basically means PCs are predictable and the ways we access than is well known.  Mobile devices are still new.  It takes someone who keeps up with modern programming languages to attack.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day there are fewer people who know how to attack mobile devices and it's more cost effective to go after PCs.  Combine the two and there's your answer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Think of what you might target as a producer of malware, whether that's ransomware or otherwise. Going after end users is not going to be profitable. End users don't often have the cash to shell out to ransom their files. So malware producers target businesses that can shell out large sums of cash as ransom (either because they have no backups, have bad backups, or it's cheaper to ransom the files and restore than to recover the backups). With certain industries there may be trade secrets to steal and sell, or perhaps a state-sponsored malware attack on the strategic utility or industry.</p>
<p>And what do you know, those bigger players all run Windows. Even if they use Linux servers, workstations are the way to get at the file servers easily and efficiently. And users are still the #1 attack vector.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The issue is that on a PC a user is getting everything from a third party rather then from an &quot;app store&quot; that is managed an authority. This often leads to people downloading malware as Trojans while trying to find a bit of software if they navigate to the wrong URL or find the wrong bit of software to do a job they need.</p>
<p>This is more apparent on mobile when people start downloading apps on Android from sources other then the Play Store this is why by default this is blocked and has to have a setting changed before you can do this. </p>
<p>A major example I can think of is all the malware that came along while people where trying to obtain Pokemon GO from outside of the Play Store while it was only available in limited regions</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
