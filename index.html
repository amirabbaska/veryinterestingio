		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The twists reduce the &quot;magnetic flux&quot; caused by magnetic fields in the environment, reducing interference.</p>
<p>Nearby electrical circuits will cause fluctuating magnetic fields in the region of the cable.  These fields will create an &quot;induced voltage&quot; in the cable circuit: the induced voltage depends on the magnetic flux, which is the number of field lines which poke through the gap between the two strands.  This induced voltage will interfere with the signal.</p>
<p>So clearly you want the two strands close together to minimize the gap, but because of their physical size and insulation, you can only get them so close together.</p>
<p>But if the wires cross over each other, the magnetic field pokes through in one direction for the first half-twist, then pokes through &quot;backwards&quot; for the other half-twist, and so on: each half-twist cancels out the previous one, so the total magnetic flux is much closer to zero.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When an ethernet cable (or any wire) runs next to a run of power cables, the power cables will induce current into the ethernet cable. This is similar to the way that an inductive, or wireless, charger works for your phone.</p>
<p>If your ethernet cable is not twisted, there's going to be one that is closer to the power cable, therefore getting more induced current. If they are twisted, the power cable will induce current more current to one wire, then the other, then back to the first... eventually averaging out so both wires in the twisted pair have the same amount of inducted current.</p>
<p>The signal on the wire is the difference between the voltages on the 2 wires, rather than an absolute voltage. There are good reasons for this, relating to ground state differences, but that's for another time. The important thing is the devices are looking for the difference in voltage between the 2 wires.</p>
<p>All this comes together to mean that the twists cause any added current to be added equally to both sides, thereby not corrupting the signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright so I'm going to make an attempt at an <em>actual</em> ELI5:</p>
<p>Let's say you have two long roads right next to each other (a single pair). And there's no way for cars to go from one side, to the other side. These cars spell a word from front to back, so they need to stay in the order they're in. </p>
<p>It's also crab mating season, so all the little crabs want to come onto land to breed. This means they have to cross the roads (outside interference). </p>
<p>If we keep the roads as is, the crabs will flood the road, and cars will have to stop, they might crash, they might get passed by cars on the other side which will get to the end before them, messing everything up.</p>
<p>BUT, if we add &quot;S&quot; turns into each road for the whole length(the twists in the pair), so they overlap creating many intersections, something cool happens: When crabs flood one side of the road, the cars can just split off to the other side. BUT THEN BOOM, MORE CRABS ON THAT SIDE! But it's cool, there's another intersection and we can just veer back to the other side and go around these crabs too!</p>
<p>We don't want no crabs affecting our perfect line of cars. Twists keep the crabs from affecting what's happening on the roads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>An indigenous group in the social science sense is defined by the UN, as another redditor commented. It refers to people who have undergone a sort of conquering, suffering exploitation at the hands of colonists. Nobody really is the &quot;first&quot; group of people to inhabit a land mass, people migrated a lot, and one area could host many groups over the course of geologic time.

<p>Generally indigenous populations have less technological development and do not fare well against invaders/visitors, due to disease and mal-intent. </p>
<p>Indigenous populations also are usually not aware of travelling to their location except through stories passed down through word of mouth. Papua New Guinea has a museum in Port Moresby showing a recreation of the arrival ships their ancestors used to arrive, as their travel ships are essentially just l very large outrigger canoes. </p>
<p>Kontiki, a movie about testing Polynesian myths of sailing directly from the east, using only historically accurate materials and construction. Thought impossible until accomplished again in our time, proving their word of mouth was true. </p>
<p>An indigenous population predates any other known populations in the location but has also been occupying the land and accumulated local knowledge of plants, herbs, food and water sources that allow them to survive and thrive at much lower technological levels. The isolation also causes distinct (although often very similar) belief systems, laws and stories. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Some aerobic some anaerobic. The difference being some can survive without oxygen (I'm foggy on this part) and the others depend on it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There aren’t really good answers to this question. Therapists have a bunch of different approaches that all would answer the questions in different ways and yet all seem to work just as well. The part of therapy that has been shown to hold a positive correlation with the outcome of therapy is a concept called “therapeutic alliance” which is basically just a metric of the quality of the working relationship between client and counselor. The better their alliance, the better the outcome. This is true regardless of the therapists theoretical orientation which itself has a huge impact on the content of the treatment. Beyond that bit, therapy is consistently shown to be effective, so that’s not in doubt, but it’s hard to show good data about why it works. </p>
<p>From my orientation, I see therapy as effective because it allows people to organize their thoughts and feeling so that they are comprehensible rather than nebulous and scary. But I also work really hard to maintain a good relationship where people feel safe to say whatever they want and feel anything they want. And honestly, I feel like if I can do that then the people will just heal by themselves, just by virtue of having someone they feel safe with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Talking about ones problems can help fix them.  In programming circles this is called rubber duck debugging, where by going over the smaller details of a problem helps one notice details in more depth.</p>
<p>However, this is not what therapy is about.  After all, if talking about your problems was enough, you could just start a journal and write about your problems to yourself, and that would have nearly, if not all, of the benefit of rubber duck debugging.</p>
<p>A lot of therapy comes down to tools, either external or internal.  Externally a therapist might guide a conversation in the right direction to uncover something that would never naturally be noticed, by moving the conversation in a direction that is beneficial.</p>
<p>Internal tools in psychology are somewhat new, and most of the research is shown to be incredibly promising.  The most common of these tools are meditation (which increases awareness of the thing being looked at, just like journaling), a combination of meditation and then journaling right after, and CBT.</p>
<p>CBT takes thoughts about the present and the future that are pessimistic or neutral and then replaces these thoughts with their opposite.  This seems like a sort of 'fake it till you make it' process, but in actuality, most thoughts that seem founded like, &quot;I hate my life.&quot; are not, so thinking, &quot;I like my life.&quot; is a valid replacement and not any less false than its negative counterpart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Its not about replacing bad thoughts with good thoughts (my depression says hi, no it doesn't work). It's the relationship you have with your therapist that's fundamental. I'll expand greatly here. It's necessary to understand how we learn first before we move on to therapy. </p>
<p>Think about how you learnt how to ride your bike, for a moment. No doubt through trial and error, and a little help from a parent or guardian. You repeatedly exposed yourself to being on a bike, learning how to maintain your balance as you went. Your parent coached you through the process. That's basically what therapists do. They coach and help you deal with whatever you're struggling with. They're not advice givers, that's a common misconception. </p>
<p>The brain creates pathways for learning anything through exposure. The more often you repeat something, the deeper that pathway becomes, the better you'll remember. </p>
<p>People are social animals. We are a product of exposure. What we think, and how we feel, today, is largely dependent on whatever it is you were exposed to as a child. That means that if something went awry while growing up because you were exposed to awful parenting, horrible trauma, a combination of both, or whatever else, then you'll grow up maladjusted and possibly with (severe) mental illness. </p>
<p>Relationships are at the core of a person's dysfunction. Either the relationship with the self, others, or both. It's thus the relationship you have with your therapist that's ultimately most transformative. Methodology is of little concern. It's a complicated mess and a difficult process. You can only develop a healthy relationship by talking to that person, hence the necessity for talk therapy. </p>
<p>Exposure to a particular way of thinking and being shapes how you think and feel. That's why every new behavior requires consistent repetition. Talk therapy is one way to help with staying consistent. Your therapist coaches you through the process and helps you when you inevitably get stuck. </p>
<p>You're exposed to a lot of things as a child over which you have no control. The relationship you have with your parents determines much of how you feel about yourself, your place in the world, the quality of your relationships, how well you deal with stress, how safe you feel and basically how you talk to yourself.
If those foundational relationships were lacking in some way as a child, you'll end up maladjusted as an adult and you'd need a replacement to fix those issues. That's what therapists are for. </p>
<p>Who you think you are, what you think, how you think, how you feel, all of that is under your parents' control, well technically anyone you spend considerable time with, until you hit puberty at age 11-13. You're meant to rebel against your parents. You're meant to reject their notion of who you are. You become an individual during the rebellious phase. So if you skipped puberty due to trauma, like I have, because you were forced to grow up fast to survive, you'll have difficulty functioning in every area of your life. You can safely go through puberty in a therapeutic setting. My therapist currently functions as a replacement for the mother I never had. My therapist will never leave me, no matter how awful I think I'm being, as someone with severe abandonment issues, this is a crucial matter. It would be too much for a spouse to handle that kind of pressure. My behavior would just look weird to them. Most would bail. Long-term therapy is a necessity for everyone who struggled with trauma and/or bad parenting.</p>
<p>My number one recommendation to anyone seeking help is that if you don't vibe with your therapist, get another, no matter how difficult. I'm on my fourth and she's a gem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that talking about your problems helps someone fix them-- at least not from a therapy sense (though obviously some people do benefit from &quot;venting&quot; or whatnot, and there are cases where someone refusing to admit a problem can be alleviated by admitting it/talking about it)</p>
<p>but more importantly, therapists help people <em>understand</em> their feelings and give them the tools to cope with them. It's not like a medical doctor where you go in for surgery and they fix you up and you're cured when you go leave. It's more like... a school where you go and the therapist helps you understand why you're feeling what you're feeling and how to handle it, but you still have to <em>use</em> that knowledge to better yourself even when you're not in the therapist's office.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is the &quot;count to ten and take a deep breath&quot; for anger issues or if you have marital problems learning that it's more effective to say &quot;I am feeling ignored by you and that hurts me&quot; rather than saying &quot;IT'S FINE I'M FINE EVERYTHING IS FINE&quot; and then storming off, but those are extremely simplified answers. Therapy may be understanding grief or trauma, and that they shouldn't blame themselves for something, or learning how to handle grief in a healthy way (eg accepting it appropriately rather than ignoring it)</p>
<p>A lot of times people may not even understand <em>why</em> they're feeling the way they're feeling or even what they're feeling. They may just go in to a therapist and say &quot;I had a breakdown at work and I have no idea why.&quot; Then, with the help of the therapist over many sessions, they'll try to learn what's been going on in their life, and potentially root problems and other factors that may have contributed to it (the stereotypical mommy/daddy issues that a patient may have never even realized they had would be one example). <em>Then</em> once they've uncovered why they might be having these feelings they can start learning healthy ways to handle them.</p>
<p>honestly it's all very complicated because there are <em>so</em> many different problems and potential solutions-- there's a reason people have to go to school for a long time to learn about it.</p>
<p>But yeah I guess to sum it up I'd reiterate that it's not that just talking about your problems helps solve them (again, from a therapy standpoint), it's that people need to learn how to identify and handle their emotions and problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to understand is the difference between specular reflection and diffuse reflection.  In perfect specular reflection, all incident light essentially reflects everywhere off the surface such that the angle of reflection is the angle of incidence. Like the left image here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/refln/u13l1d3.gif" target="_blank">http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/refln/u13l1d3.gif</a></p>
<p>This basically means that the surface is &quot;smooth&quot; in terms of reflection.  On the other hand, in diffuse reflection, the surface is rough and thus each incident ray is seeing a slightly different surface and thus reflects off at random angles depending on where it lands on the surface.</p>
<p>Thus, a mirror is an example of mostly specular reflection when illuminated where a white t-shirt is an example of diffuse reflection (due to the cottons strands making for a very uneven surface)</p>
<p>Now, as you've said, an object that is truly black, what is called &quot;a perfect black-body&quot;, should absorb ALL light in the visible spectrum and thus one should receive no light from it and it should have no reflection under illumination.</p>
<p>However, in reality there is no such thing as a perfect black-body and thus all materials will reflect at least SOME light off at least their surface, if not the bulk.   In a similar vein, no material is 100% transparent and it will always reflect and absorb at least some light.</p>
<p>But what is happening with a piano is actually a bit more,  because the look is ENGINEERED by having TWO surfaces,  The first layer is a fairly-but-not-totally transparent top layer that has a flat surface.  That means that most of the light gets through it, but a good chunk doesn't and reflects off the front and because of the smoothness of the surface it reflects specularly.  The light that makes it through the quasi-transparent layer then meets the black paint, and is mostly absorbed (though some reflects here too).  </p>
<p>Thus, in a nutshell (and I'm totally making up these numbers), you've created a case where you start with 100% light, then a top layer reflects 20% of it specularly and transmits 80% and then the black layer underneath eats the 80%.</p>
<p>There's an interesting aside here I'll maybe draw attention to, which is that having multiple layers with different properties is actually the reason for a lot of the &quot;flavour&quot; and variety of sights we see (rather than just having a single layer).  And in general, much of what we see CANNOT be modeled by assigning  reflection/albedo properties to a single layer alone. This compounding effect of multiple layers of different properties actually plays a big role in computer graphics, where it is called &quot;Subsurface scattering&quot;.  I'll drop the wiki to that topic here:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering</a></p>
<p>But it's probably not worth going fully into here, but this is the reason why old CGI moves like Toy Story looked so plasticy (Pixar, of course, brilliantly turned a bug into a feature in that movie).  Because it's not possible to create the kind of visual surfaces we see in real life by treating them as only a single layer with some properties, you have to compound the effect of multiple layers.  </p>
<p>There's a lot of aspects to this in the surface of something like a piano (or marble).  It's a multi-layer effect.  And it's also worth noting that although it's often possible to &quot;cheat&quot; these effects using only one or two layers, this kind of sub-surface complexity can happen within a single material, and it need not be the case that you literally have multiple spatially separated layers, but rather you have reflections from different depths of the surface of just a single material behaving slightly differently.  So even in a single material you may not be able to model its reflection by treating it as a single surface. (the converse is also the case, it may sometimes be possible to take a real life surface appearance that is physically caused by multiple layers and &quot;fake&quot; it with a single layer with specially chosen properties).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When light hits an object, several things may happen.</p>
<p>The light may be absorbed. An object that absorbs all light would be perfectly black.  </p>
<p>The light may be transmitted through the object. An object that transmits all light would be transparent and invisible.</p>
<p>The light may also be reflected. One way of reflection is when the light bounces off the object in the same angle as where it came from. The scientific term for this is specular reflection. An object that reflects all light like this would be a perfect mirror.</p>
<p>Light can also be reflected so that it bounces away in all directions.  The scientific term for this is diffuse reflection. An object that reflects all like this would be perfectly white.</p>
<p>Other effects like refraction can also happen, but these are not relevant to the question.</p>
<p>All objects do a combination of these effects when they are exposed to light. How an object looks like depends on how much it does each.</p>
<p>The wax on top of piano transmits most of the light through, but it also does a notable bit of specular reflection. This means that if there is a bright source of light hitting the piano from the opposite direction, you will see a &quot;mirror image&quot; of that thing on the piano. Lesser sources of light will not be seen, as like said before, most of the light goes transmits through the wax, and hits the actual surface of the piano which is black and absorbs almost all of the light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The coating on the piano has a thin layer on top that is somewhat reflective, mirror-like, but it only reflects back a small fraction, perhaps a few percent points. That is enough to create the illusion of &quot;high reflectivity&quot;. If it were truly highly reflective it would look like the mirror in your bathroom, which reflects over 50% and sometimes significantly more than that.</p>
<p>Below that thin reflective layer there's a deeply absorbing layer of dark pigment which accounts for the black hue. All light that passes through the top layer hits the bottom layer and gets absorbed. That layer perhaps absorbs 90% of incoming light, or close to it. Some of it gets scattered back. But it's not perfect black; if it were, it would look like a hole in space, featureless.</p>
<p>Source: I make telescope mirrors, which are some of the most highly reflective surfaces made by mankind. I am also an amateur woodworker who has spent some time with furniture coating processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just reread my answer and realise that, while it's very long, it is not even scratching the surface of what is a surprisingly difficult question to answer. Congratulations on asking such a good question, and apologies for the oversimplification that is to follow. </p>
<p>There are a few reasons, and the best way to explain it is to see how currency has evolved. </p>
<p>So there are at least 2 theories of how money evolves. The first is that, in any community beyond a certain size, barter becomes inconvenient. For example, maybe I'm an apple farmer and I want some pork. But I can't trade apples for pork because it's the middle of winter and I don't have any fresh apples around. So communities start using some form of currency like gold or beads or silver or whatever as money. Then I can sell my apples in autumn, and spend the money on pork in winter. </p>
<p>The result of that is, if you have 2 communities that evolve more or less independently of each other (like separated by mountains or whatever), you would end up with different currencies. For example, cigarettes used to be a popular currency in USA prisons, but outside prison the currency was US dollars. </p>
<p>The second theory is that, governments are responsible for deciding what currency their country uses. Imagine you're the king of a country called Alpha. You have a problem - you want to raise an army, but the army costs money, and you don't have any money. So what do you do? You can pass a new law. You can say, up till now, you have all been paying your taxes in kind - pig farmers give me pigs, apple farmers give me apples. But from now on, I want you all the pay your taxes in a new currency called Alpha Dollars. I won't accept anything else. </p>
<p>Now your subjects are confused and worried. They have never even seen an Alpha Dollar before. Where would they get them to pay their taxes with? Luckily, you are the king. So you print Alpha Dollars, and you give them to people you employ. For example, you pay your brand new army in Alpha Dollars. Your army is keen to accept the Alpha Dollars because they want to be able to pay their taxes in Alpha Dollars. </p>
<p>Now your soldiers start buying stuff like boots and food and drink and all the things soldiers need. All the shopkeepers want Alpha Dollars too, because they also have to pay their taxes. So Alpha Dollars have become your kingdom's currency. And that's very, very good for you, because whenever you feel like raising a new army, you just print more Alpha Dollars (which will lead to issues of its own, but more on that later). An example of this happening is casinos. Why is all gambling done in chips instead of US Dollars? Simply put, it's because the casino management says, we will only accept chips. So within the casino you can use chips to tip staff, play tables etc. Whenever the casino has a shortage of chips (maybe more people come to play the tables), they can always make more. </p>
<p>Now imagine you're the king of a country called Beta. You also want to raise an army. You don't want to pay them in Alpha Dollars because you don't want to go crawling to the King of Alpha and beg him for Alpha Dollars. So you create your own currency, Beta Dollars. Before long, every king is printing his own currency, using the same trick - declare that they will only accept their own currency in taxes. </p>

When you collapse from heart problems, you tend to have available oxygen still in your lungs, as well as in your blood, so the priority of CPR is to circulate the blood until emergency response gets there. Sometimes pausing and taking a breath burdens the effectiveness of the CPR, but it could be necessary in someone who drowns (or else you're circulating spent blood). So if there is oxygenated blood in the body already then breathing can do more harm by pausing CPR compressions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm a Medic first aid +CPR instructor and the most recent update of our standard (g2015) still recommends the use of rescue breaths for both cases. Compression only CPR is viewed as an alternative to standard CPR when a would be rescuer becomes apprehensive about doing the breaths. This can be especially effective in a witnessed arrest because it's likely the oxygen saturation of the blood is still high enough that circulation alone will benefit the patient for a period of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version: Current American Heart Association CPR teaching is NOT different for pulseless victims of drowning.</p>
<p>People who drown generally aspirate water, and experience respiratory arrest which leads to cardiac arrest (death.) AHA guidelines for an adult with no pulse and &quot;death rattle&quot; (agonal) breathing or no breathing is the same every time - check for pulse and breathing simultaneously for no more than 10 seconds. Delegate someone else to call 911 and get an AED. Start compressions. Perform 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths. Continue until the AED arrives. Turn on the AED. Follow the instructions. Continue CPR. Follow the AED prompts until the patient responds or help arrives. </p>
<p>In drowning, there is an obstruction (inhaled water) that isn't allowing gas to exchange in the lung tissue - this is why it is very important to get advanced life support as soon as possible. These patients need advanced airway management, ACLS (advanced cardiac life support), and to be kept warm. </p>

Putting on a ring you are basically pulling your skin tight against your fingertip and pushing it up over the cleft of the joint.  It can’t go very far so it doesn’t form folds easily. Pulling off a ring your basically pulling on a lot more skin with no hard anchors nearby and it drops off over the cleft of your knuckle so it folds there and jams under the ring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons I know of are; when something is tight to your skin, moisture is more likely to accumulate there. Sweat can make you a bit sticky, so a ring might stick down to the skin more easily. Because sweat is water-based, we will often resort to oil-based products such as grease or butter to loosen it up so the ring may slip off.</p>
<p>The second reason, and more likely to get a ring stuck, is that having the finger even slightly restricted will cause it to swell with blood because the veins are being squished by the ring so the blood has a harder time returning to the heart. The more the finger swells, the more the veins are compressed, and so the more blood gets &quot;stuck&quot; in the finger. This increases the size of the finger so the ring is effectively tighter. Many people will use compression techniques in order to force the blood back out of the finger so that it may shrink down enough for the ring to slip off. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGGwX2lY4rc" target="_blank">Here is an example of such compression.</a></p>
<p>edit: I should mention, the reason blood can be forced into the finger but not forced away from it is because the heart cannot suck blood into itself, it can only push blood out. It relies on the veins and arteries to retain clear passageways to allow the blood pressure to force blood to flow back toward the heart, by pushing the old blood out of the way with the new blood. This blood pressure is lost when the veins are squished by a ring so while the heart can pump blood into the finger by pushing it, it can not bring the blood back out of the finger quite as easily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;safe&quot; is a relative word when you talk about squeezing them.  the big problem with doing it is the pimple is there because that site was teeming with bacteria that got into your system and your immune system is fighting it off.  If you pop it, there's still probably a lot of bacteria around there, so you risk infection (or prolonging the existing problem).  </p>
<p>If you don't mind using a pin or needle (that you've sterilized) and you've washed the area, you can pop them that way with less chances of scarring and greater infection.  Putting something like neosporin on it will help too.</p>
<p>If the choice is between just popping it with your fingers (and no other prep) and letting it go away on its own, you're probably better off letting it go away on its own.  Most of the time, you'll not get an infection or scarring if you pop it, but this is the choice you have to make.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once they get to the &quot;solid goo&quot; phase I've never had any issues with popping them. I've been doing it for over a decade with no infections or scarring. That's not to say it won't happen to you, but there are safer ways of doing it.</p>
<p>Start with a clean, washed face and a clean, washed needle. Gently puncture the pimple. Take two fresh Q-tips and gently squeeze on both sides until the plug pops out. Wipe away the pus/blood with paper towel, swipe with alcohol or wash again with soap, dry again with paper towel then immediately place a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002DMANU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_9ta6zb78C5FM" target="_blank">hydrocolloid bandage</a> over the dry pimple. Leave it overnight, remove in morning. </p>
<p>This results in no scabbing, no scarring, no infections - for me, personally. It heals amazingly fast after the plug is removed and the hydrocolloid is left to do its magic.</p>
<p>If the pimple is sore, swollen, warm or obviously filled with liquid, do not pop it. Wait until it has aged into a hard plug that isn't too tender.         </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Safety of popping, it depends on how. You risk causing a break in the skin that may not coincide with the pore, bleeding, infection, etc.</p>
