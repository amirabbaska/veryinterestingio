		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most popular theory blames the drop in atmospheric pressure that accompanies rain. Think of it like blowing up a balloon. There’s inside air pushing out, and outside air pushing in. Atmospheric pressure is always pushing on our bodies in a similar way. If the pressure outside of the body drops, gasses inside the body can expand, particularly the gasses dissolved in the fluid surrounding your joints and tendons.</p>
<p>Now consider your injury. Think about pain as nerves that have been irritated. Somehow they didn’t heal right, or they might be inflamed. That expansion of fluid around your damaged Achilles might be microscopic, but it can really trigger these nerve endings by putting additional pressure on them, causing pain.</p>
<p>As for the temperature, the theory goes like this: cold may cause muscles to tense up, and that contraction can also aggravate those damaged nerves.</p>
<p>Long story short: A drop in atmospheric pressure may trigger an increase in the pressure of your body’s fluids on damaged nerves, causing pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are theories about atmospheric pressure, etc, however, I believe that the main reason why joints (and injures) hurt more with weather changes is because cold weather makes your muscles tighter, thus adding pressure to the joints. Heat relaxes the muscles (increasing blood flow to the tissues), so the joints move more easily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle contraction occur when electrical impulses trigger the release of chemicals (sodium and calcium, along with some other things) that react with the muscle fibres causing them to contract. The contraction ends when the chemical are cleared away stopping the reaction. A &quot;knot&quot; in a muscle is an area of muscle fibre that has remained contracted while the rest of the muscle has relaxed. By pressing on the knot for an extended period of time (technical term is digital ischemic pressure) the blood in the area is forced away. When you then lift off, fresh blood floods in and this helps to clear away the remaining chemicals that were still bound to the muscle fibres, allowing them to relax.</p>
<p>Edit: Looking through the comments there are 3 main ideas being thrown around, and I had addressed 2 of them in comments so I thought I should put the info here too.</p>
<p>Good news is, all 3 ideas are relevant. I provided the answer above As my primary response as it relates directly to the question of pushing into the muscle, but as a remedial therapist treating soft tissues, a combinations of techniques are needed for effective treatment. </p>
<p>Stimulation of the Golgi tendon organ is one of those treatments and is used mostly on long muscles, like calves and hamstrings, when tension is being felt along the length of the whole muscles as opposed to an isolated area of contraction &quot;knot&quot;. Most effective way of stimulating the Golgi organ is by bowing the tendon as this effectively makes it freak out thinking the tendon is about to snap, telling the muscle it has to relax so this doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Adhesions are another issue where trauma to the muscle fibres over react while healing causing them to become stuck to the fascia  (muscle casing), this results in the muscles not being able to move smoothly and will cause disfunction of movements. This is commonly treated with friction as it helps to tear apart the adhesions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscle fibers run in all different directions in our body and muscles are layered on top of each other from our heads to our toes. This is a good thing and the reason why we can bend, twist, dance, and play sports. Our muscles are meant to be pliable, strong, and challenged. However, when we sit at a computer all day in the same position and if we injure ourselves, or if we are chronically dehydrated, we can lose our mobility and flexibility. The various muscle fibers start to stick to each other and become adhered. This new hard and lumpy feeling is a muscle ‘knot’. Pressing on the knots breaks those bunched up muscle fibers apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We barely understand muscular contraction as it is not observable. Our best guess is still the sliding filament theory.

Of those 5 PT's each one will have a different opinion of what causes knots. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Massage makes muscles relax by tightening them first, strangely enough. Muscles have a finite scale, call it 1-10. 1 is perfectly relaxed and 10 is a cramp. After a long day maybe your neck feels like an 8. When you press on the muscle it's actually a stressor so the muscle tightens further. But if you press long enough it gets to a 10 at the top of its scale and resets back to a 1.
Long term &quot;knots&quot; in your muscles are usually  fascial constrictions and are called adhesions. It's a lot like internal scar tissue. You can lift and twist or grind those clumps of internal scar until they break apart. That allows your muscle to move freely again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><em>It used to be thought ... that the reason skaters can glide gracefully across the ice is because the pressure they exert on the sharp blades creates a thin layer of liquid on top of the ice... More recent research has shown, though, that this property isn't why skaters can slide on the ice... It turns out that at the very surface of the ice, water molecules exist in a state somewhere between a pure liquid and a pure solid. It's not exactly water -- but it's like water. The atoms in this layer are 100,000 times more mobile than the atoms [deeper] in the ice, but they're still 25 times less mobile than atoms in water. So it's like proto-water, and that's what we're really skimming on.</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see much misinformation here.</p>
<p>Many cite regelation as cause for the slippery nature of ice. Regelation is the phenomenon that the melting point of ice rises with pressure. Many people believe this is what melts the water under ice skates or even under a shoe when stepping on ice. Doing the calculations will show that the effect even slim ice skates have on the melting point is negligible.</p>
<p>Ice is slippery due to a layer of liquid water on the surface. This liquid layer may be better described as loosely bound water molecules. In an ice crystal water molecules inhabit fixed spots. They form a structure in which every molecule is surrounded by a number of other molecules. The interaction between the molecules keeps them in place. The molecules that happen to be on the surface however are only surrounded by half as many molecules than the molecules in the bulk. Thus they are just loosely bound to the surface and in a quasi liquid state.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually something we believe to be one of the first ways we and our ancestors hunted game. We have a huge advantage over almost all other animals: Skin surface area. This makes us the most capable of venting our body than literally every other animal. Not only that, but our bipedal locomotion makes us extremely efficient at moving. Compared to a chimpanzee, we use less than 1/3 the calories that the chimp does to move from point A to B, even if they are walking on two feet.
Due to these adaptation, we and our ancestors were able to literally chase a gazelle, antelope, etc for 4, 6, even 8 hours. The animal's only way to effectively cool itself down is by resting in shade. When they try, the hunter scares the animal out. They chase the animal until it literally cannot continue, after which they simply walk up and kill it. This is known as persistence hunting. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting</a>
There are actually even tribes in Africa that still practice this method of hunting today! It's quite interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yeah. Cannabis is like that. (only not really).</p>
<p>Sometimes, people make cannabis with lots of whisky in it so that they can have lots of fun and relax.</p>
<p>Sometimes they'll put lots of coffee (and they'll use lots of shots of espresso instead of one shot and filling the rest up with water). </p>
<p>This means that even though the people that drink the coffee with whisky in it, they get very excited because they had LOTS AND LOTS OF COFFEE AT ONCE! So they get VERY EXCITED! The whisky doesn't calm them down or make them have fun like usual. </p>
<p>ELI15 :</p>
<p>Cannabis has several types of cannabinoids in it. Cannabinoids are special chemicals that do different things. Two main cannabinods are THC and CDB. THC makes you more aware of things, and CBD makes you relax. People can breed Cannabis plants to have a moderate amount of both, lots of both, more THC or more CBD.</p>
<p>If you have a friend who constantly smokes lots of high THC cannabis, they might get more anxious. If you have a friend who smokes cannabis with a regular amount of CBD in it from time to time, they relax and have fun. </p>
<p>As some other users have pointed out, if you're in a bad mind and setting, doing drugs is likely to make this worse. Also, because cannabis is illegal in some places in the world, you can already feel anxious about smells, police etc, if you feel that neighbours or police might see/smell you doing it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'll take maybe two puffs to relax these days but even a whole bowl out of my bong and it can be pretty bad. Needless to say I do not smoke often at all anymore unless I have actual anxiety or nausea. I used to have a really high tolerance but recently I'd say over the last few months it really effects me differently than it used to. Thus why I've been smoking much, much less. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One day it dawned on me; smoke only a very tiny amount. Just enough to feel something without wigging out. Changed my life. Not only can a small bag last for over a year, but I smoke far less frequently and it's no longer a prerequisite for good times.<br />
For me it was all about dosage.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are already pretty good comments and references, but I wanna point out some information that is not always considered.</p>
<p>First, the facts. She was a born in the mid 19^th century, the youngest daughter of a science teacher from a formerly well-off family. She was catholic (despite the rumors that she might have been jewish, a pretty extended idea among the people who hated her). She studied under great, well known scientists at the time (like Lippman, who managed to get the first color photography, and Becquerel, who discovered and studied radioactive decay).</p>
<p>It'd be easy to say that she's famous because she earned two Nobel prices, but there has been a bunch of people who got also two Nobel prices who aren't nearly as renowned as she is. (John Bardeen inveted the transistor and studied a important phenomenon known as superconductivity, and Frederick Sanger worked with DNA and proteins, to name a few). Linus Pauling is probably more famous than those two, but I don't think he's as famous as Ms. Curie. (He got a Nobel prize in Chemistry for his works on the nature of chemical bonds, and he also got a Peace Nobel prize). </p>
<p>The fact is that she is a very well known historic figure because she was a woman. Her life was a lot harder than that of men who could've achieved the same things as her. She managed to discover fundamental physical phenomena as well as two elements, and did so while suffering depression for almost all her life, became mother of two, lost a husband and lived in a turbulent time and place.</p>
<p>As a curiosity: one of her daughters, Irene, won a Nobel prize in physics and died of leukemia before turning 60. Eve, her other daughter, became a writer and lived to be more than 100 years old (she died in  the mid 2000's or so).</p>
<p>So my guess is that she's famous because her life was a constant struggle and even yet she found a way to be a remarkable person who gave her life for science (in more than a sense). </p>
<p>Sorry if my English is a bit off, I'm tired and I'm speaking from memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I filled out a w2, and taxes are taken out of my check every time. I get an income tax check every year like normal.  We have an account with ADP and have to just keep money in our account with them. One time the owner forgot to deposit funds, and ADP was nice enough to pay us anyway. Obviously he made the deposit, but super courteous of them regardless. </p>
<p>Countless times I've had to run to the local grocery store for money orders to pay rent, electricity, ect... since everything is cash based. Our taxes are even paid in cash too. We have had 8 banks close accounts that the owners have opened in their names. Chase was one of them. We had an account with them for years. All of the employees knew us and what we were doing. Then one day out of nowhere they closed our account.  They even marked my boss as using the account in an illegal way, so his personal account with Charles Schwab got closed because they were notified. He had 7 days to find a place for $1.5mil (personal, not dispensary related).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

WHile somewhat specific, they don't get so specific as to what items you sell.  FOr instance Marijuana sales could be retail trade: food and beverage stores  among others.  So as long as your business name on the tax return is not something like &quot;Bob's House of  Weed, Edibles and Illegal Activities&quot; you would be good.  The other way they could know is that banks file reporting of interest income to the IRS.  So if your business bank name is incriminatory that would come up.  FOrtunately, or unfortunately there is not much in the way of banking services for this industry.  </p>

Under the 5th amendment you cannot be compelled to self incriminate but tax code compels you to report income. So if you sell guns illegally, or drugs, you still need to file that as income, possibly just as misc sales but as income. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me just start with stating that the top comment so far about stomach acidity is just blatantly incorrect. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So your body wants to get rid of some acid in order to get your blood acidity back to normal. And where's a great supply of acid? Your stomach, which is filled with hydrochloric acid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your stomach pH and your blood pH are not connected. Taking a Tums doesn't change your blood pH, so throwing up doesn't do anything for your blood acidity. Your body doesn't filter blood acidity by utilizing your stomach. Your stomach is for digestion.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> So why are people nauseous after hard exercise? Basically, it's because your body is drawing blood away from your digestive organs. You're doing intense exercise, why do you need to be digesting dinner? Your body thinks, &quot;Hey, all this running is hard. Why are we carrying a sack of half-digested food? It's slowing us down. Let's get rid of it so we can run better.&quot; </p>
<p>All energy should be sent to helping you run, or push that weight up, etc. If you want to avoid throwing up during exercise, avoid eating a few hours before hand, or keep it light with gatorade/fluids. </p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4027831/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4027831/</a> </p>
<p>Above is a good article about exercise induced vomitting. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> from it: &quot;Nausea and vomiting are relatively frequent GI symptoms in athletes, especially those performing endurance sport disciplines. In the majority of the cases they are particular physiological reactions to strenuous exercise and might be alleviated by proper hydration.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Another good excerpt from it:</strong> &quot;The sole accompanying symptom was nausea a few seconds before the vomiting occurred, without any other announcing signs and no following complaints. The patient reported that he consumed the last meal always at least 2 h prior to the exercise.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It is obviously a multifactorial thing but important aspects that haven't been mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical - running especially can throw the gut around in the abdomen a significant amount. If there is food or liquid in it the 'sloshing' makes this worse. This triggers stretch/mechanoreceptors in the gut wall which connect with the area postrema (vomit centre of the brain) causing nausea.</li>
<li>Sympathetic drive. Significant exercise of any type raises circulating catecholamines (e.g. adrenaline aka epinephrine) which can cause nausea and vomiting through receptors in the same area as described above.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your Nervous system has a branch called the Autonomic Nervous System that controls a bunch of autonomic processes like blood pressure, secretions, etc. The ANS has two branches, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. These are your &quot;fight or flight&quot; and &quot;rest and digest&quot; (respectively) nervous systems. Your body runs as a balance of these two nervous systems and the balance is shifted depending on the scenario (like being chased by a bear)</p>
<p>So normally, your PNS, rest and digest, is in charge, and one of the things it controls is the digestive system. Digesting requires a lot of blood to circulate to the area and requires a lot of energy (ironically). This is something that happes while you &quot;rest and digest.&quot;</p>
<p>When you exercise your body treats it like you're being chased by a tiger, hence activating the Sympathetic nervous system  (SNS). When you're being chased by a tiger, you dont need to be spending energy digesting the burger you just ate but instead pumping those legs and thinking really hard to run away and deal with the situation. So, the SNS will override the PNS and contract certain blood vessels in the gut, stop the movements in the gut to push and churn the food (also called peristalsis), and break down fat, to spend its efforts on running away. However, the controls of the digestive system keep certain parts in their specific spaces (stomach contents in the stomach, etc). By the SNS overriding the gut control, the stomach cant contain its material. As a result, you end up letting it all out and barf. Its also why some people shit their pants. Some dont have this happen to them because the signals arent as strong in the gut, they can hold it down willingly, etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there's the correspondence principle which basically says that if you scale the physics to &quot;everyday life&quot; measures you should get Newtonian Physics back. However that's not a strict mathematical derivation of the fact, that's common sense (and woe is he who trusts it). The proof is in the form of a statistical (thermodynamical) analysis which shows that for large objects quantum mechanics tends towards classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Having that said, the fact that there is sound for example (or perhaps better: quantized electrical conductivity) shows that quantum effects can still be seen at these scales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The behaviour of some systems is chaotic, which means that even very small changes to the starting conditions may lead to big differences in outcome. </p>
<p>Unfortunately Heisenberg's uncertainty principle means that we can't measure all the parameters we'd need accurately. This means that, even with infinitely fast, infinitely accurate computers, our predictions could still be wrong, because we lack the required input data (and fundamentally cannot acquire it). </p>
<p>The best we could do in principle would be to Monte-Carlo simulate a lot of start cases that are within the measurement error and look at the range of possible outcomes. </p>
<p>In practice, we don't have infinitely fast / accurate computers, nor do we have the ability to measure millions of particles to the Heisenberg uncertainty limit, so we are much worse off than that theoretical best case. </p>
<p>Fortunately, many systems are not chaotic, which means that roughly-right inputs give roughly-right outputs. That's why we can predict many physical phenomena (just not all). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's a reasonably well understood thing called quantum decoherence which rather precisely describes how &quot;quantumness&quot; tends to be lost to the environment over time due to inevitable interactions between the system you are interested in and the rest of the universe, particularly the immediate environment. Very small numbers of quantum particles are easier to isolate from their environment whereas larger numbers of particles presumably are more difficult to &quot;contain&quot; thereby losing their coherence i.e their quantumness more readily. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, I'd say that there is a rule, or principle of physics, that the laws of particle physics do scale up to macroscopic systems. That doesn't mean that we are able to compute the behavior of macroscopic systems from the Standard Model, just that if we were able to do so, and it didn't match the actual behavior of those systems, we would assume that there is an error in the Standard Model.</p>
<p>That could be wrong—it wouldn't be the first time that a seemingly sacrosanct principle of physics was overturned—but everyone works under the assumption that it's true as long as there's no evidence that it isn't.</p>
<p>We actually have a fairly good understanding of how macroscopic classical behavior arises from quantum rules. Quantum probability averages out to classical probability in incoherent systems (systems where the phases of the quantum amplitudes are random). The technical reason for this is that if you add two quantum amplitudes, a+b=c, the law of cosines says that |a|² + |b|² + 2|a||b| cos φ = |c|², where φ is the relative phase of a and b. If φ is random, the expected (average) value of cos φ is zero, so you get |a|² + |b|² = |c|² on average, which is the classical rule. Macroscopic systems inevitably become incoherent through interaction with the environment, via blackbody radiation if nothing else. This is why macroscopic quantum phenomena like superfluidity require very cold temperatures—warmer objects emit too much blackbody radiation. High temperature superconductivity is not well understood, but there must be a kind of natural insulation of certain parts of the superconducting medium from others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Yet nitrogen is arguably one of the very most prevalent and important components of nutrition for most organisms on the planet (in my understanding?). </p>
<p>So how do organisms break that triple bond in order to render nitrogen reactive enough to bond with other elements? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that certain soil bacteria break N2 down using an enzyme called nitrogenase.  It catalyzes the reaction:</p>
<p>N2 + 6 e^- + 6 H^+ --&gt; 2 NH3</p>
<p>This is a thermodynamically favorable reaction, but it is very slow due to the strength of the nitrogen triple bond, which has to break on the way to forming ammonia.  The active site of nitrogenase contains a large iron sulfur cluster that serves as a powerful and fast source of electrons to make this reaction happen.  At the same time, to maintain charge balance, amino acids near the N2 binding site quickly deliver the hydrogen ions that name up the rest of the reaction.  Overall, we call reactions like these proton coupled electron transfer, or PCET.</p>
<p>The trick in this reaction is that every time you give an electron to N2, its bond gets weaker.  This is due to the increasing population of electrons in what are called antibonding orbitals.  Consequently, if you add 6 electrons to N2, the bond gets completely negated.  Maintaining charge balance through proton delivery makes the injection of additional electrons much easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It needs to be in a bioavailable form such as NH3, which as already mentioned, can be created by some bacteria. The other way is through lightning but it's not nearly enough to support the amount of people and food we grow now. The Haber-Bosch process converts atmospheric N2 with hydrogen to generate ammonia for large-scale fertilizer production. This allowed us to dramatically increase the productivity of land to grow more food and populations. Now some 80% of nitrogen in the human body originated from this process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Nitrogen is one the most abundant molecules in the atmosphere and necessary for plant metabolism, yet most plants are incapable of obtaining usable nitrogen due to its diatomic state. In a given environment, you'll more often than not find a fungi/plant mutualistic relationship where the fungi (most often rhizobium) will be living at the roots of a plant. The fungi will break down the nitrogen and exchange it with the plants' roots for sugar!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to everything else already mentioned, dictators keep themselves in power by spending enormous resources on propaganda (and censorship) to keep individuals who hate the government from realizing they're not alone.</p>
<p>If you hate the government enough to want to act, but fear that you are alone and therefore essentially powerless, you're probably going to keep your head down and grudgingly obey. If you realize that <em>everyone</em> feels that way, well, if <em>everyone</em> revolts, the dictator is in deep trouble. Therefore, it is in his interests to fill the media with lies 24/7 about how great he his, how popular he is, how good everyone under his rule has it, and so forth. It doesn't even matter if the lies are transparently false--as long as you can't be sure the population as a whole shares your hatred for the regime, the risks of revolting are huge.</p>
<p>But when it becomes evident that hatred and unrest are widespread, you can see a dictatorship fall seemingly overnight. Suddenly everyone realizes the regime is a house of cards and reacts accordingly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Governors and Rulers are kept in power by their key supporters, not necessarily by the populace which they rule. Many countries in which the citizens suffer and the elites flourish are actually quite stable, when compared to democratic societies. </p>
<p>For example, in Saudi Arabia, only the royal family can vote in the next king and the king only really has to maintain the support of his family members (albeit larger than your typical family). The saudi citizens has no real say in who rules next.</p>
<p>Whereas in the U.S., the president requires key support from major political figures, who are they themselves supported by their constituents and contributors, who are also themselves supported by local level constituency / stockholders etc.</p>
<p>TLDR: Dictators tend to need to keep less people happy than elected leaders.</p>
<p>You mentioned the role of the military, which behaves similarly to any political pyramid. At the top you have the generalissimo, who is presumably a key supporter of the dictator, and is being kept happy by the dictator. </p>
<p>He is then appointing and keeping happy the top officers he needs to keep the army under control (typically with help from the regime's coffers). These top officers will dispense and acquire whatever influence they need to keep their subordinates under control, and so on.</p>
<p>The army, with the general in the lead, is not likely to abandon the current regime unless a new regime is likely to improve their welfare. At which point they might throw their weight behind a revolution. Its important to note that populist uprisings are typically seen as the people rising up against the establishment, this is a fallacy. What actually happens in a populist uprising is a new regime moving to push the old regime out, probably having swayed some key supporters their way. It's just a better public image to let the people (aka angry mob) do the work for you. </p>
<p>This is why so many new governments born of populist uprisings ends up being just as bad or if not worse than the previous government. When a new ruler comes in power, new key supporters are installed, much of the old support base is purged, and the day to day lives of the people tends to stay the same. Since the money used to maintain the previous government's support base is now being spent to keep the current government's support base happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
