<p>Endorphins and other brain goos in the brain are discharged more effectively if you eat spicy food more often.  </p>
<p>If you have problems with spicy foods start off with small changes.  Overtime you'll find it much easier to kick up the spicy.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As an Indian I always had yogurt on the side and this would not only cool the palette but also the stomach. Over time the spice amount in the food increased (as I got older) and was able to tolerate it more and more, such that going to a restaurant with friends who never had eaten spicy food before were surprised at the tolerance level. </p>
<p>Doing this would certainly help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who feared spicy food and hot sauce until about 15 years ago, one thing I realized later in life was that spice causes pain but does not cause damage.  All that is happening is that these foods contain chemicals that bond with heat receptors in the body.  People who claim injury are mistaken.  The injury comes from stomach acid and from wiping the ass too much.</p>
<p>I enjoy spice a lot now.  I'm not sure I feel an endorphin rush but I do sweat a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I tried to build up my tolerance with Thai food first and it seemed like it was more of a fresh heat but with Indian it was more dull ( don't know if I'm explaining it well). </p>
<p>I've built up being able to enjoy the hottest item on my local Thai menu and even ask for extra chillies. But with Indian I'm up to Madrass level. I went all out for Vindaloo last time and it was just too much pain. Like how can anyone even enjoy that level of heat. I'm sure real lovers of heat consider vindaloo tame. </p>
<p>I've just spoken to my local restaurants and told them I'd like to build up my tolerance and they've all been great at recommending what to try next. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those people that partake in the super spicy. Part of it is genetic. Some people simply have less of a response trigger to capsaicin than others. The other part is something you can get used to with practice (to a point). If you have a want for handling spicy, eat a bit of hot as you can stand stuff every day. You become accustomed to it, and may learn to really enjoy it, but like a muscle, if you stop training it, you will start to lose it. Going a week without eating anything really spicy will leave you unable to handle super spicy food again. </p>
<p>Also, as an added note: when you try one of those record breaking hot peppers, like the 1.4 million shu ghost peppers, you aren't eating a pepper with 1.4 million shu's.  Record breaking peppers are grown in very special conditions and selectively bred to get that hot. Your ghost pepper you got a hold of is likely closer to just 600k shu.  Jalapenos can range anywhere from 6k to 300k shu's. </p>
<p>A good sauce to start with is Da Bomb: Ground Zero. 321,000 shu's .</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>&quot;Quoting Ed Landa: &quot;zinc sulfide was mixed with a radium salt to yield products containing about 25 to 300 ug [one ug is essentially the same as one uCi] of radium element per gram. The more concentrated preparations (generally containing 215 ug of radium per gram to meet British Admiralty standards) were used on aircraft and ship instrument dials, while lower-grade materials containing about 50 to 100 ug of radium per gram of mixture were used on watches, switch markings, and other devices requiring less critical reading.&quot;  According to a Department of Commerce Information Circular from 1930, the paint might contain &quot;from 0.7 to 3 and even 4 milligrams of radium element to 100 grams of zinc sulfide. Impurities may be added to the zinc sulfide as follows: Cadmium, 0.05 per cent; copper, 0.001 per cent; manganese, 0.0002 per cent.&quot; </p>
<p>As from the cited text, making radium paint required only micrograms to milligrams of elemental radium. So you could paint thousands to millions of dials and watches with just a gram of radium. The glow is actually caused by the zinc sulfide fluorescing in response to the radioactivity of the radium salt additive, which is so radioactive it can provide sufficient amount for radioluminescence at such low concentrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have an undergrad degree in social work and purposefully worked in an area that served poorer communities for 8 of those years where I made less than $25k per year plus a small parsonage. The vast majority of people who work as ministers don't make much money at all and many denominations require a graduate degree. Now days I serve a church in a much wealthier area and make a middle class wage but our church still spends about 25% of our gross income on helping the poor and homeless. Most pastors work 60+ hours a week and don't make much money. This is pretty typical in my experience for most ministers and churches. Just like teachers or social workers we don't go into this work for money. I've do it because we love it. </p>
<p>Those ministers who you see on tv who have jets and make millions of dollars are probably less than 1%. I think they're scoundrels who manipulate people with fear and promises of future wealth if they just give in faith. They use all kinds of schemes - selling &quot;blessed&quot; handkerchiefs, tickets to healing rallies etc. It's a bunch of nonsense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>With that being said we go to a large church with great programs and facilities. They have a full staff and band and put on a really good service every weekend.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body goes through sleep cycles that last average around 90 minutes each. More or less depending on how long you've been asleep. I started setting my alarm to wake me up at exactly the end of a cycle and you'd be surprised to see hoe much easier it is to get up. Besides lack of sleep, most people feel froggy in the morning because they wake up in the middle of a cycle. </p>
<p>So for example if you go to bed at 10 (if you are a person tbat normally falls asleep within a few minutes) you would have to get up at either 5:30, 7 or 8:30. Waking up at 6 would interrupt a cycle and disrupt your morning.</p>
<p>I use a sleep app that tells me when is the best time to wake up based on what time Im going to bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soaking a wound in salt water can kill bacteria because it essentially draws the water out of the bacterial cells. However it's important to note that for wound care soaking in salt water is generally not recommended. This is because while salt kills bacteria it also kills healthy cells that are necessary for wound healing.  </p>
<p>When you get a cut the best thing to do is irrigate it with normal saline (which can be bought at any drug store) or regular tap water. This is just to get whatever immediate dead skin, dirt, bacteria are there out. The next step is to cover the wound. </p>
<p>Another false remedy is hydrogen peroxide. Although it kills bacteria through a different mechanism then salt it is not recommended for wound care because it can prolong wound healing. Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria but also kills good skin cells </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of diffusion If you have a permeable barrier (ie your mouth skin), salt/water/the like can pass through it, going from the side with more stuff in less space to the side with less stuff in more space.</p>
<p>Now, let's say the inside of your mouth skin has an infection. There's a lot of water there now. If you swish salt water, as per the exaplanation above, there's more salt (stuff) in less space (water) in your salt water conpared to the infection stuff. Therefore, the water from inside your infection bubble goes into the salt water (since this way there's an equal amount of salt per water inside and outside your mouth skin, and salt can't really go through your mouth skin). Now your infection doesn't have enough water to survive and it dies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a process called osmosis. Osmosis keeps a balance of concentrations both inside and outside of bacteria. So if you put salt water on a wound, the concentration of salt in the salt water is very high, however, it is very low inside of the bacteria. Due to osmosis, the salt will enter through the cell membrane of the bacteria and go inside of it. The bacteria will eventually be holding too much salt water and it will break open the cell membrame which eventually kills it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most modern liquid &quot;soaps&quot; are not technically soaps at all, which is to say they're not produced from mixing vegetable or animal fats with a strongly alkaline solution such as lye or potash.  Instead they're a blend of (usually) petroleum-derived surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate with other chemicals to produce a detergent that matches the desired use.  </p>
<p>Shampoo is designed to be gentle on the keratin which forms hair, have strong foaming properties to be more easily worked through the fine strands, remove common hairstyling products, and - especially for those of us with more than a couple inches of hair - have specific effects on the texture of the hair.  It has a fairly low concentration of surfactants so that it rinses out quickly and you're not in the shower forever trying to get it all out of your hair.</p>
<p>Hand and body wash is usually formulated with a mild surfactant to avoid skin irritation, plus various ingredients that can moisturize the skin, add scent, improve lather, etc.  Lathering agents are generally surfactants as well, so there's a careful balance here between getting a nice lather and not drying out skin.  Hand washes are usually less foamy since they don't need to cover much surface area and are used frequently throughout the day, while body washes tend towards more foam since they need to cover a lot more surface area and are used less frequently.  They're both a bit more concentrated than shampoo, since it's easier to rinse soap off of skin than hair, and in the case of body wash, most consumers pour it onto a sponge/pouf/washcloth/etc. before applying it to the skin, which spreads it out thinner than applying it directly. Face washes are their own magical category and can include all sorts of fun chemistry like ceramides and multivesicular emulsions, alpha hydroxy acids, benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, etc. - and as an acne sufferer, it <em>definitely</em> makes a difference.  </p>
<p>Bar soaps are one area where true soaps are still relatively common.  Moisturizing ingredients can also be added, and the naturally occurring glycerine is also somewhat moisturizing.  However, traditional soaps also have a lot of limitations.  They have a fairly narrow range of environments in which they're effective, needing hot water with a low mineral content to function, and must be rinsed a second time with clean water to avoid deposits.  </p>
<p>Laundry detergents are commonly formulated these days with specific surfactants designed to work well with cold and hard water, both of which decrease the effectiveness of traditional soaps.  They're also highly concentrated, since they're going to be diluted by the large volume of wash-water, which is why just a few drops of liquid detergent on your hands will take much longer to rinse off than an equal amount of hand soap.  This is also why ideally you should fill the washer with soap and water so they can mix, then add the clothes.</p>
<p>Dishwasher detergents aren't worried about gentleness, since they don't come in contact with skin or organic fibers, so they can use harsher detergents and often include abrasives, but do rely on hot water to be effective.  For similar reasons to laundry detergents, they're highly concentrated, but they use surfactants that are more effective on metal and ceramic.  </p>
<p>Dish detergents meant for hand-washing dishes have to balance removing grease, starches, sugars, etc. from food with not completely stripping the natural oils from skin, which is a bit tricky - the oils that keep your skin nice and pliable aren't any different from the oils of any other animal, chemically speaking.  They're also pretty highly concentrated for that &quot;grease-fighting&quot; effect, and so that your washcloth/sponge/etc. doesn't need more soap on it after every dish you wash.</p>
<p>Edit:  Added some information on surfactant concentration that I forgot to include when I typed this up last night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, soap isn't soap.  Kinda.</p>
<p>Depending on what sort of saponificator you use, you get two very different types of soap.  Lye will produce a hard soap, like what you get in bars.  Potash produces a liquid soap.</p>
<p>The type of fat you use also matters.  Lard make a very, very hard and dry bar of soap, while olive oil makes a very soft soap.  Other fats have all sorts of other things that can be added.  Then, you add different scents and colors and stuff.</p>
<p>So, soap for your hands will be made with lye and will generally be less &quot;harsh&quot; than powdered laundry soap, which doesn't have to worry about potentially drying your skin out.  Shampoo is potash soap with lots of water and fragrances and magical chemicals that companies say repair damage.  Liquid detergent is a potash soap that's designed to be &quot;tougher&quot; on grease.</p>
<p>Soap for the body tends to have more fat in it compared to soap for other things.  This is why &quot;dish hands&quot; used to be a thing.  A high-quality body soap will leave fat on your skin, which is why it feels soft and smooth afterwards.  Yes, that's either plant or animal fat that's covering your skin.  Enjoy!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we are talking about traditional soap, than the differance between a hard bar of soap and liquid soap would simply be the type of oils/fats used and the type of lye used. Sodium Hydroxide or Potassium Hydroxide for example.</p>
<p>The differance between liquid soap and foam soap depends on the dispensing device itself and how watered down the liquid is.</p>
<p>Brands like Zest, Dove, Lever 2000, etc, aren't actually soap. They are a detergent bar. </p>
<p>Shampoo is just a liquid soap with a lye discount and differant oils used to protect and nourish your hair and scalp. Like tea tree oil and argan oil.</p>
<p>Dish soap is just liquid soap with added chemicals to help further degrease the food grime.</p>
<p>Edit: I don't think a great many people realise this industry is heavily regulated, atleast in Canada. Everything from the ingrediants used to the size and font used on the packaging. In order for a product to be considered soap, fairtrade, vegen, etc, it has to meet the criteria. Anything else could land the Soaper into a lot of trouble. </p>
<p>Another thing most people don't understand is that these products fall under the Weights and Measures Act of Canada and these products have to be sold by weight in order to be considered legal. A lot of Soapers selling their products at fixed values at craft shows are breaking federal laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what &quot;everything else&quot; you're thinking of here, if &quot;we understand their effect on matter&quot; is something you take as given.</p>
<p>We have observed stars orbiting seemingly empty space as if there were a massive object there, and we don't have candidates for dark objects of the necessary mass apart from black holes. We have observed systems where gas is heated to extreme temperatures as it spirals into an otherwise invisible massive object, which again we have not been able to explain except as a black hole accretion disk. We have direct observations of stellar orbits around our galaxy's central mass, consistent with a supermassive black hole and pretty much nothing else (given the necessary density of the central object for the closest stellar orbits to avoid hitting it).</p>
<p>We have gravitational wave observations from LIGO that quite precisely match theoretical and computational models of black holes spinning together to merge into a single larger (rotating) black hole; the fact that those observations are such a close match to the theory and its consequences is strong evidence that the details of our theories are quite accurate.</p>
<p>So while I'd love to be able to take a spaceship out to a black hole and perform experiments right there in person, I feel like our understanding of black holes at this point has (very) roughly the same level of experimental evidence that our understanding of, say, neutron stars or red supergiant stars has. What else do you want to know about them that <em>isn't</em> covered by that?</p>
<p>(One immediate possibility: &quot;What happens when you cross the event horizon and head inside?&quot; But I might claim that in that case, we don't &quot;know&quot; the answer theoretically/hypothetically, either. There's a guess, based on the equivalence principle, that for a big enough black hole you wouldn't even notice that you'd crossed that line, at least not until you discovered that you could no longer escape the central singularity. But 1) it's well-established theoretically that you wouldn't be able to report back on your experience anyway, so this is essentially impossible to check as far as we know, and 2) as far as I know, there's still active debate among quantum gravity/string theory researchers about whether there's some sort of &quot;firewall&quot; that would inevitably annihilate you the moment you reached the event horizon, due to quantum requirements that kinda seem to contradict the equivalence principle in this situation. So I don't think this question really fits what you're asking about, either.)</p>
<p>Edit: A couple of people have pointed out that Hawking radiation counts quite nicely as something hypothetical/purely theoretical that we haven't been able to measure yet. That's a great point!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your phrasing is still incorrect. Scientists will say that black holes exist because there is no better explanation for observations. &quot;Everything else&quot; we know about black holes is also determined in the same way. There aren't two categories of knowledge on black holes. It is a sliding scale of uncertainty.</p>

<p>Edit: The scientific community does not enjoy the use of the word theory. I can't change the title but it should say hypothetical rather than theoretical </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, theoretical is a better term than hypothetical, scientifically, for this. The reason is that there is theory to explain things about a black hole other than that it exists. The problem is that your question implies that theory is the same as guessing. If you want to irritate a scientist, tell him that scientific theory is &quot;just a theory&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between direct and indirect evidence. In science, the former is valued more than the latter.</p>
<p>This is why the Higgs boson announcement in 2012 was received so well (and also why Messieurs Higgs and Englert got the Nobel Prize for it only after this confirmation), even though we were relatively confident, on theoretical grounds, in the existence of the bosons.</p>
<p>We don't &quot;know&quot; that black holes exist. This is not a claim I have ever heard anyone in the science community make.</p>
<p>What we do know is the following: general relativity is remarkable well-tested (and has that quality of mathematical elegance and &quot;beauty&quot; that has been correlated with truth in the history of science) and admits as one possible solution to its equations remarkably simple objects (&quot;simple&quot; in the sense that they can be described with remarkably few parameters -- for a Schwarzchild black hole, in fact, only one number, the mass). The prediction of the theory is that such objects must be extremely massive to remain stable, and have a strong enough gravitational pull that light cannot escape from them. However, just because these mathematical solutions are compatible with general relativity does not mean that they are realized in nature. With that said, we are fairly confident that there are conditions created during the natural evolution of the universe for which no known force is able to stop objects in those conditions from collapsing in on themselves. Two well-known examples are very heavy neutron stars (for which we can calculate a semi-precise number for &quot;how heavy&quot;) and the centers of large galaxies such as our own. In such conditions, one solution we know compatible with general relativity is a black hole. There are also other solutions compatible with general relativity -- quark stars being an example. But we don't have well-established theories for such objects, and in any case even quark stars will eventually form a black hole at large enough mass.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a continuum in the &quot;directness&quot; of measurements. The better grip we have on the observations, the more fundamental they are, the more the sources of background are understood -- the more we can be confident in ruling out causes other than black holes for those observations.</p>
<p>Direct observations of black holes (i.e. pointing a telescope at them and looking for a gap in the sky) are quite challenging, but are being attempted at this moment. I believe there is a telescope pointed at the center of our galaxy where we do expect a black hole to be present, looking for obstructions in front of background stars. I don't know how likely it is that they will find anything.</p>
<p>But indirect observations, such as the recent LIGO discovery of a gravitational wave pattern that fits quite well the expected profile from the merger of two black holes, and the speeds of stars orbiting the putative black hole at the center of our galaxy, point to it being very likely that black holes exist.</p>
<p>Whether or not these indirect observations warrant a rethinking of the label &quot;theoretical&quot; as applied to the current state of our knowledge, is a question best left to lexicographers and not to physicists. Certainly I find such discussions about labels a complete waste of time. No physicist stays up at night worrying about whether some other person calls their knowledge &quot;theoretical&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't <em>know</em> they exist and we understand even less about what happens to matter inside a black hole.</p>
<p>Black holes are <em>not</em> guaranteed to exist.  I would say healthy skepticism about them is good.</p>
<p>We think that they may exist, and our current understanding of physics says they should exist.  There is also some circumstantial evidence supporting their existence (inferred from observations).  </p>
<p>But I cannot stress this enough: We don't really know.  Lots of astronomers and cosmologists are on the black hole bandwagon but the fact of the matter is that the physics describing them ends up producing lots of divide by 0 errors and infinities, which is at least a tad uncomfortable (usually it's a sign your theories are incomplete).  Then there is that whole debacle about information being destroyed that plagued theoreticians for decades until they did lots of mental gymnastics to work around the problem.  But singularities themselves are bizarre and our understanding of physics breaks down.  What happens to matter inside a black hole?  We have no way of knowing.  And we may never be able to know.  To me explanations that are untestable are more like religion than actual physics. Basically, it sounds a lot like we don't know what we are talking about, when you look at black holes very closely.</p>
<p>They are attractive though -- they are the natural conclusion if you take our understanding of gravity to the extreme.</p>
<p>However, until there is direct observational and/or experimental evidence confirming their existence, it's entirely possible they <em>don't</em> really exist except as solutions to our equations that as it turns out don't describe reality accurately.</p>
<p>There are objects we have observed that look like black holes (in that they are very massive and emit almost no light).  One such object is Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.  We have observed stars orbiting it at relativistic speeds.  It must be ginormous -- on the order of millions of suns.  And yet it gives off no radiation.  We think that's a black hole.</p>
<p>It could very well be that it's something else entirely.  Some exotic matter we are unaware of that has physics we don't know about.</p>
<p>Or it could be a black hole.</p>
<p>But the existence of black holes is by no means 100% a certainty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have lots of evidence due to the motion of the stars very close to them. (Source: I work on exactly that) And a combination of how much mass in a small space is required for the stars to move that fast, do not leave any other possibility than a black hole. Have a look at this video for example. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gggKHvfGw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gggKHvfGw</a></p>
<p>We measure the tracks of each star very accurately. Basically you see a sudden acceleration of the stars when they get close to a certain spot. One can use basic dynamics to figure out how much mass is necessary in order for stars to move this fast. These are not crazy claculations, its basically the same thing used for when predicting how the earth moves around the sun. And then you cannot see a star or any light from that spot where the stars all circle around. So the only explanation for having so much mass in such a tiny space is a black-hole.</p>
<p>In addition to stellar dynamics going around a BH we also observe its X-ray signature. Because contrary to what it sounds like a black hole is often not dark but quite active due to accreting surrounding gas. We call them AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei). And signatures from such accretion evens are regularly observed in the X-rays.</p>
<p>There is also an extremely exciting campaign going on with GRAVITY an instrument that can resolve extremely small spatial scales (<a href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de/372679/Science" target="_blank">http://www.mpe.mpg.de/372679/Science</a>) to look  as close as we can get towards the event horizon of a black hole. </p>
<p>So no, black holes are not just &quot;theoretical&quot;. They are a astrophysical necessity and their properties like their mass, and accretion are quite well studied. However, obviously due to their &quot;dark&quot; nature if they are not accreting of course one cannot just take a picture of them as of normal stars and galaxies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a considerable amount of compelling evidence, which happens to be intimately bound to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics#Development_of_the_theory" target="_blank">development of the notion of continental drift and then of plate tectonics back</a> in Wegener's days, so let's start there.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=xogEaAfvsnsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=wegener+continent&amp;ots=i5snRzmv8h&amp;sig=O1l4HwS214ZrW50tWUxRxwqqw8I#v=onepage&amp;q=wegener%20continent&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Wegener suggested that continents had drifted over time</a>. He had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift#Evidence_of_continental_drift" target="_blank">evidence to support this</a>, but no mechanism to explain it, this came about 50 years later (we'll get back to that). What Wegener noted was that the coastlines on either side of the Atlantic fit a lot better than any random process could account for, pretty much like jigsaw pieces. He also noted that if one brought back N &amp; S America against western Europe and Africa, several geological units would be in continuity one with the other and that this also extended to the distribution of the fossil fauna and flora. This made for a pretty compelling case that those 4 major continents once were united as one, but at that time nobody knew how this could have come about with a mechanism which could account for this motion.</p>
<p>Exploration of the ocean in the 50's and 60's brought forth some new and unsuspected data which allowed to flesh out a mechanism which might account for the movement of continents (see: <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZlQABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Hsü, K. J. (2014). Challenger at sea: a ship that revolutionized earth science. Princeton University Press.</a>). It was noted that the middle of the Atlantic was the site of a massive chain of volcanos and of seismic activity which followed the jigsaw outline of the coasts on either side, and that rocks on both sides of this volcanic ridge showed a symmetrical pattern of progressively increasing ages and magnetic polarity patterns as one moved from the ridge to the coasts. It was also noted that continental margins bordered by mountain chains were often the location of exceptionally deep trenches (e.g. the Marianas), volcanism (ring of fire) and seismicity. What was puzzled out was that new material was constantly being injected between the separating continents from the volcanic ridge (divergent margins), moving them progressively apart over time. And that at the same time, older material was being reintroduced into the mantle to melt and be recycled along convergent margins. This was revolutionary, and completely transformed our understanding of geology. </p>
<p>Since then, a lot of effort has been expended in generating <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/ess403/ESS_403/Lectures_files/ThirdWeekLectures.pdf" target="_blank">paleomagnetic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronology" target="_blank">geochronologic</a> data to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_polar_wander" target="_blank">pole wandering path</a> trajectories for each given site and backtrack from the current position to the original one for any give time. On the basis of the pole wander paths, we can produce <a href="http://www.scotese.com/" target="_blank">paleogeographic maps</a> which show the position of given continental blocks for a given time. It is in a large part of the basis of these maps and the underlying data that our understanding of Pangaea is built. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is definetely <em>not</em> better to entirely relax on impact. This is a myth and I have no idea where it actually comes from.</p>
<p>For example in a car crash where you drive straight into something (the most common one), if you relax entirely your head will be whipping forward and back again really fast like a whiplash (you can probably guess where this is going...) and this may cause severe whiplash damage <em>to your spine</em> in the neck. This may cause all kinds of aches (if you are lucky) or partial paralysis if you are less lucky. By tensing you neck really hard (best thing to do is to push it back against the head rest or whatever it is, I think) in order to counteract the whipping motion of your head. Sure, you may sprain your muscles and what not, but that is <em>always</em> preferable to spine damage and will probably automatically get well after some time.</p>
<p>I am definitely no expert in the area and I hope that someone who is comes here and gives a better answer, but I do know that you should definitely not relax on impact.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is so much bad speculation in this thread. I'm going to answer the question from my area of expertise, which is impact biomechanics, most specifically with respect to car crashes.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to remember is that in all reality, you wont be able to brace. A slow car crash of 35mph (~56 KPH) is over in roughly 150ms, which is faster than an average humans reaction time. Bracing only rarely can come into play like if you were run off the road or something and were going to crash into a tree.</p>
<p>The next most important thing is that biomechanics like me use 3 main things to design the safety systems (seat belts, air bags, etc) of cars: dummies, cadavers, and finite element models. None of these things have working muscles. The seat belt pretensioners and airbags are carefully timed to fire at the right time to cushion the crash of these effectively complicated ragdolls. There is a possibility that if we knew how bracing effected the impact, we could design cars to accommodate that, but we cant test volunteers at levels that would be useful.</p>
<p>Final point. Lets say you brace. That low impact of 35mph could easily have your body accelerating relative to the car by 30 g's. For reference, a g is the strength of the gravity on earth. The sun has gravity of 28 g's, so unless you are strong enough to do a pushup on the sun, your arms could still snap like spaghetti if you are braced with your arms locked. If you dont have your arms locked (but are still using them to brace), you just delay your body moving, and you can actually increase the accelerations your brain (and the rest of your body) is exposed to. This is supported by research showing that with volunteer impacts, some of the accelerations/forces are increased when the volunteers are given a countdown prior to the impact so they can brace.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your statement about being relaxed in impact is way too general. Like in many things in life it depends on the situation. </p>
<p>But before going into it, the first thing to note is one of Newton's laws, from which the equation F = ma comes from. It means force = mass * acceleration. </p>
<p>So in the case of falls which you specified in one of your comments, if you were to remain rigid - locking your knees for example - when you hit the ground you would almost instantly decelerate to a stop. This would mean the force acting on you would be immense, which would cause injury. </p>
<p>Rather than staying relaxed, it would be more accurate to say that prolonging the time in which you decelerate would lessen injury. Just like how people who do free running roll after a big jump. </p>
<p>As an example, let's say you take 0.1s to completely decelerate to a stop when rigid and 0.4s to stop if you roll. You would reduce the amount of force acting on you to a quarter of its original value. Of course this is a very simplified version but this is more or less the point. </p>
<p>In the case of things like punches and such, it is better to tense up like other redditors have mentioned. This is because even if you reduced the force by relaxing and allowing the punch to create an impact over a larger time, the force would be distributed over your internal organs which would cause injury. </p>
<p>By tensing up your muscles, even though the force is much higher it is almost fully absorbed by your muscles as they now act as a hardened barrier - akin to armor - protecting your more squishy parts. And muscles can take a lot more than punishment your squishy parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The reason, as a matter of speculation, is that alcohol blunts the body's injury response, which is actually what kills people who have suffered trauma.

In a whiplash incident we have your head going forward then aggressively back again. The problem is your brain is still going with the momentum cause what is called a cou / contra-cou injury. Your brain smashes against the front of your skull then the back of your skull. If you were to tense up in say a forward collision putting your weight into the seat.
