		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing to understand here is that fusion is not on/off effect. Its probabilistic effect. And it depends on temperature/density. So the more dense the gas, the more probable it is for it's atoms to fuse and more energy is produced.</p>
<p>This means, that as the proto-star grows more dense, the rate of fusion increases and so does amount of energy produced. Then at one point, the star reaches equilibrium between energy pushing out and gravity pulling in. Also, this equilibrium changes over time, as composition of the star changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars begin hot and bright because they contain a ton of energy from gravitational collapse, with surface temperatures up to around 3000-4000 Kelvin and core temperatures above a million Kelvin. Young proto-stars are actually much more volatile than regular stars because the primary mechanism for heat transfer internally is convection, which leads to lots of irregularities. So much so that such stars undergo regular eruptions (enormous solar flares) as bubbles of heat boil up to the surface. As the star continues collapsing it gets denser and hotter, eventually reaching a state where fusion reactions start generating a significant amount of heat internally. This results in a sufficiently hot interior that the primary mode of heat transport changes from convection to radiation, which causes the heat profile of the star to settle down into a much more orderly gradient ranging from the core to the surface, reducing the frequency and intensity of stellar eruptions. When fusion begins the star as a whole gets hotter, including the surface, but the surface only increases in temperature by a comparatively small amount (10% or so, initially). Stars also get dimmer as they &quot;turn on&quot; because even though they are a little hotter they are <em>much</em> smaller after they've fully collapsed into a star, so their overall luminosity is much less (by orders of magnitude).</p>
<p>In short: stars shine even before they begin fusing due to the energy of gravitational contraction; pre-fusion stars are very bright (because of their large size) and unruly (because convection isn't great for heat transport); as they begin fusion they actually settle down, growing smaller, dimmer, and more well-behaved while only a little bit hotter on the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand this, you have to understand how star formation works. In space there are mind bogglingly large clouds of various gasses out there. Because gas stop has mass, it is attracted to itself. Over time this &quot;ball&quot; of gas gets larger and larger.</p>
<p>We know that if you add pressure you something, it gets hotter. At first the amount of pressure expressed on this gas is very small. But as it grows in size, so does the pressure. Eventually, you will reach a mass where the pressure at the center is so great it starts a cascading fusion reaction. A hydrogen star fuses its gas into helium. Follow the elements up the periodic table and that is what it begins fusing next.  Until you reach nickle that is. Nickle is the first element that consumes energy to produce, rather than producing it.  This consequently is one of the causes of a star going supernova.</p>
<p>Once this fusion reaction starts, it takes over pretty quickly, exact times are hard to pin down. But I would expect something along the lines of seconds to minutes. So now you have gravity pulling in on the mass, but a fusion reaction pushing out. At first the size of the star is very variable. But over time, these forces balance out.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is: more or less. It's not exactly the same, since time passes by for objects moving at different velocities and in different gravitational potentials, and the Universe isn't entirely uniform. Some regions are a little denser than average, and some are less dense. This is a pretty tiny effect, however: the differences in density from one region of the Universe to another are about one part in ten thousand, i.e., 10^(-5), and the age measured in these regions varies by a similarly tiny amount. Indeed, our best measurements of the age of the Universe have percent-level error, so that regional variation is still about a thousand times smaller than the <em>error</em> in our estimates of the Universe's age.</p>
<p>To put some numbers on all this, the age of the Universe is about 13.8 billion years, the error is in the ballpark of 100 million years, and the 10^(-5) variation between dense and underdense environments is in the realm of 100 thousand years. There are other reasons the age changes from place to place, such as other commenters have listed, but they generally lead to discrepancies far below even those relatively small numbers. One notable exception is near a black hole, where time slows down nearly to a halt as seen from outside, and time comes to an end entirely as seen from an object falling in when it hits the singularity. This is because black holes have extremely strong gravitational fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical current through a wire creates a magnetic field directed in a circular motion around the circumference of the wire.  So, when you coil the wire into a circle, this creates a magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the circular cross-section of this coil (think of a donut of wire sitting on a table, the magnetic field would be directed upward or downward through the hole of the donut).</p>
<p>Now, if you take a second coil of wire and place it on top of the first coil, the magnetic field from the first coil will cause a flow of current in the second coil.  This is due to the reverse of how you generated the magnetic field.</p>
<p>The &quot;first coil&quot; is your wireless charger, and the &quot;second coil&quot; is inside your phone, connected to the battery.  The current generated in the second coil charges your phone's battery.</p>
<p>Edit: It should be noted that this was an extremely simplified explanation. An important aspect that I left off was that it is the <em>change</em> in magnetic field, called magnetic flux, through the second coil that induces a current.  This means the coils must use alternating current (the type of power coming out of your wall socket), then the second coil's AC current must be converted to DC current (type of current a battery produces/charges on) in order to charge the battery.</p>

<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Wireless_power_system_-_inductive_coupling_de.svg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Wireless_power_system_-_inductive_coupling_de.svg</a></p>
<p>This picture here illustrates well what is happening. The left side is your wireless charging pad, the right side is your phone.</p>
<p>First, we need two coils, then we need alternating current and that's pretty much it. The purpose of the coils is to intensify and guide the magnetic field so we have lower power losses.</p>
<p>In the picture above, &quot;B&quot; is the magnetic field created by the left coil. A magnetic field is created when you send AC through a coil.
As you can see, a lot of the magnetic field is &quot;lost&quot; on the left side of the transmitter coil, that's why magnetic charging is so inefficient and it takes a long time to charge the phone!</p>
<p>On the right side, we have the receiver coil. A &quot;changing&quot; magnetic field induces a Voltage and thus a current flow in the coil, which can then be rectified to charge your battery (since the battery is often charged with 4.2V DC)</p>
<p>And now the even cooler part: Wireless charging isn't scratching the surface of what kind of power we can deliver that way!
If you step up the power a litte bit, you can melt metal with a coil.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By an extremely simple concept, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Faraday's Law of Induction</a>, which states that:</p>
<p><em>'The induced electromotive force in any closed circuit is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.'</em></p>
<p>Put simply, your wireless charger has a wire coil inside it. An alternating current runs through the coil. This generates a magnetic field with <em>changing strength</em>—this is a key point.</p>
<p>There's <em>another</em> wire coil inside your phone. As the changing magnetic field passes through this coil, an electromotive force, or a voltage, is generated. Since this coil is connected to a closed circuit, we have another AC current in the wire coil in your phone. </p>
<p>This AC current is then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wik
i/Rectifier?wprov=sfla1">fully rectified</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier#Rectifier_output_smoothing" target="_blank">smoothened</a> to a comparatively flat DC current, which charges your battery. </p>
<p><strong><em>This will not work if the magnetic field does not change in strength</em></strong>. So the first coil <em>must</em> either carry an AC current, or a non-uniform DC current, i.e. a rectified AC, pulsed DC, square, or sawtooth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: the equations explaining the whole idea of electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction may be complex, but the physical idea is simple.</p>
<p>Take a large metallic solenoid—it can be <em>any</em> metal, so long as it <em>is</em> metal. Connect the two ends of the spring to an ammeter or galvanometer. Drop a strong magnet through the solenoid, and see the needle on the galvanometer flick away from the centre line. </p>
<p>The kinetic energy of the falling magnet has been <em>indirectly</em> converted to electrical energy in the circuit. Why? The solenoid experiences a <em>changing</em> magnetic field of sorts. As the magnet enters the coil, the latter experiences an 'increasingly stronger' magnetic field as the magnet gets nearer. Likewise, as the magnet drops out of the other end, the magnetic field becomes increasingly weaker. As the magnet enters, it is repelled by the electric current in the coil, which generates its <em>own</em> magnetic field. Vice versa as the magnet leaves the coil, except that it is now attracted. </p>
<p>The entire concept of electricity and magnetism can be summed up in equations relating force in newtons, electric current in amperes, and magnetic field strength in teslas. It is an interplay of these three quantities that give rise to these phenomena. Actually explaining them on a deeper level requires a strong grasp of quantum mechanics and relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are basically a transformer. What is a transformer exactly? It is two wire coil (electromagnet) sharing a common core, which carry the magnetic field.</p>
<p>A classic transformer use a metal core, which help for the efficiency and to make it smaller, but it do not have to be metal, it can, in fact, be air.</p>
<p>The base have the primary winding, that's it, the one with power. The phone also have a winding, which would be called (drum roll) secondary winding. The electricity from the primary winding induce a magnetic field around it, which the secondary catch and convert that magnetic field into electricity. For this to happend it need to vary all the time, hence why they call it &quot;AC&quot;, or alternating current. In the case of those, the frequency, so the number of cycle per second, is relativelly high, but the frequency is not really important, it basically just change the size of the coil and the amount of power that can be transfered, the theory is still the same</p>
<p>So, in the base, you have a circuit that convert the direct current (DC) into AC, this is done by simply having a few transistors (think of switch) that turn on and off in a sequence. Basically you connect the 'left' wire to positive and 'right' to negative    and the current flow in one direction.  Then you reverse the wires, and the current flow in reverse. Think of a water hose and a pump. Connect one end to the in and the other to the out, then reverse, you will cause the water to move one way then the other. Congratulation, you made AC !</p>
<p>The way they do that is with what is called an H bridge, which is basically 4 transistors. By turning two (one per side) you can control which direction the electricity flow...</p>
<p>Once out of the secondary winding (the phone), you now have a small issue: you have AC, you want DC. This is easilly fixed by a diode (actually, most likelly 4, look up diode bridge, the advantage is that it use both the positive and negative portion by inverting the negative portion... look up how the bridge work), then follow that by a capacitor. The output of the diode(s) is pulsed, that pulse get absorbed by the capacitor, which basically act like a battery of low capacity, but can be charged millions of time.</p>
<p>Then you just need a charge controller to charge the battery.</p>
<p>The charge controller will ensure that the current do not excede the limit of the battery, else fire can happend. Also, it control the voltage, because to much voltage and the battery won't be happy (read: can catch fire). It will also stop charging when the battery is full, is too cold or too hot, and also under some other conditions. All of this to ensure a proper charge and to make the battery happy (read: don't catch fire).</p>
<p>tl;dr: the base and the phone both have a wire coil, which make an air core transformer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people say that the universe is expanding in all directions, they don't merely mean <em>at its edges</em>. The universe is expanding everywhere all at once. Galaxies aren't really moving apart from one another, the space between them is expanding. If we removed that expansion from their velocities they would be practically standing still.</p>
<p>All of the images that you see of the Big Bang show a spherical explosion, but that's greatly simplified for the masses. Remember that what is inside that &quot;sphere&quot; is <em>everything</em>. It's the whole universe. It's impossible to look at it from the outside because there is no concept of &quot;outside the universe&quot;. The idea of what it looks like from the outside is meaningless.</p>
<p>Why do all those animations show a sphere then? Well, in part because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">Cosmological Principle</a>, which says
that the universe looks the same no matter the direction we look, and the natural way to depict that is with a sphere (and because <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/112805/why-is-everything-spherical/" target="_blank">sphere shapes are very common in space</a>), but that's not the way that real explosions work. Even the most perfectly packed explosions don't generate perfectly spherical shockwaves.</p>
<p>Importantly, there would be no way for us to tell if the universe is shaped like, say, a giant chicken, because spacetime has no edges. We could be hip deep in chicken guts, but if we never see any feathers, we'd assume it's guts all the way down.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The universe isn't expanding at its edges because it has no edges, and the concept of what it looks like is meaningless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We tend to think in spheres when it comes to the universe because when it comes to space exploration, Earth has always been the starting point, or rather our solar system, we can only explore what is going on up to a certain distance in any direction from a 360 degree starting point, this is why the famous image of ''the visible universe'' is actually in shape of a circle. </p>
<p>There is another theory going on, in which the universe is shaped like a doughnut, instead, the cross section is still circular, but if you keep going and going and going, you will eventually end up in the place you started. Problem with that theory is... what IS in the middle of the doughnut? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Played at the same speed, the difference is in the accent — that is, where you put more emphasis.</p>
<p>Listen to Sousa's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr0ZI3j-fT8" target="_blank">Fairest of the Fair</a>. As soon as the drums kick in, you should be able to get a really strong &quot;one, two. one, two.&quot; sort of feel. That's what 2/2 or 2/4 sounds like.</p>
<p>Now pay attention to the bass line for Queen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO6D_BAuYCI" target="_blank">Crazy Little Thing Called Love</a>. That's a &quot;one two three four&quot; feel. That's your 4/4.</p>
<p>Let's try the ones that are multiples of three now. 3/4 vs 6/8 is the difference between &quot;One and Two and Three and One and Two and Three and (...)&quot; for 3/4, and &quot;One and a Two and a One and a Two and a (...)&quot; for 6/8: one has three beats that divide into two halves, the other has two beats that divide into thirds. You can hear this difference in Bernstein's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy6wo2wpT2k" target="_blank">America</a> from West Side Story: The bit that goes &quot;<em>I</em> like to <em>live</em> in A-<em>me</em>-<em>ri</em>-<em>ca</em>&quot;. Note how The first half has two accents (&quot;I&quot; and &quot;live&quot;) and is in 6/8, and the second half is 3/4 with emphasis on &quot;me&quot;, &quot;ri&quot;, &quot;ca&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not always about the ratio, its mostly about where you want the emphasis to be and how fast that beat goes.  Also keep in mind that in many 20th century arrangements composers will stick in measures with different time signatures to produce a certain effect, and those measures don't always behave the same as if an entire piece were written in that meter.  </p>
<p>Some time signatures are close to interchangeable.  2/4 is often really similar to 2/2 or &quot;cut&quot; time even though those aren't the same ratio as 2/4.  Having the beats on quarter notes is a little easier to read for some musicians that haven't played a lot of the old marches written in cut time. </p>
<p>Others are not.  3/4 is 3 beats per measure, each beat being subdivided into 2, while 6/8 is 2 beats subdivided into 3.</p>
<p>6/4 can mean a few things.  If an entire piece is written in 6/4, it probably is in a slow 3.  But if a random measure is in a piece, it may just represent a 4/4 + a 2/4 measure to extend a phrase by a couple of beats.</p>
<p>In addition to 2 vs 3 feel, the composer arranger will take other things into account, like how much work would the conductor be doing, and how much effort is to write everything out.  Going back to 2/4 vs cut time, the advantage of 2/2 is that really fast notes can be written as 16th notes instead of 32nd notes.  That makes it easier to read and easier to write.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference is a combination of which notes get emphasized, how the notes are distributed in the measure, and what kind of music is traditionally played in that time signature.</p>
<p>2/2 with emphasizing every other beat, divide each measure into two parts, and have a march-like quality.  4/4 emphasized every fourth beat, and you might see a quarter note-half note-quarter note order you would be unlikely to see in 2/2.</p>
<p>Similarly, 3/4 is usually a waltz 1-2-3, a measure's rhythm would rarely be divided between two dotted quarter notes.  In 6/8, when it is divided, it is almost always going to be divided into two parts between the third and fourth beats.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally an ELI5 I can answer.</p>
<p>One of the important things in music when composing is how the accents are placed. This is basically just musical emphasis. It can either be marked directly, where a little symbol is placed underneath the note, or indirectly, where a time signature is used.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/Nz0b4STz1lo?t=1m35s" target="_blank">this section</a> from Gustav Holst's <em>Jupiter</em>.</p>
<p>As you can hear, the emphasis is a &quot;<strong>dun</strong> dun dun <strong>dun</strong> dun dun&quot; where each of the emphasis (I'm unimaginative) is on the third beat. If you try and imagine the emphasis on each other beat in a &quot;<strong>dun</strong> dun <strong>dun</strong> dun <strong>dun</strong> dun&quot;, it would sound much different (if we stripped the piece of the chords and had just the horns playing at that point).</p>
<p>Now, here's the kicker: <strong>This should explain it.</strong> Now, of course, you might not understand it, so here goes:</p>
<p>The piece is currently in the time of 6/8. This is a series known as <strong>compound time</strong>. This is basically where you get groupings of 3 in one beat.</p>
<p>The visualisation where the duns would be on the other beat is what's known as <strong>simple time.</strong> This is basically where you get groupings of 2 in one beat. (it would be in 3/4 btw)</p>
<p>Next, to answer your question, listen to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dPn9M7TLlI" target="_blank">Colonel Bogey March.</a> You can feel a 2 feel - 1,2,1,2 -  this is due to the accents, which are naturally placed. Listen to the bassline in particular - you can hear a repeating pattern in groups of 2s.</p>
<p>Now listen to Queen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ" target="_blank">Break Free.</a> Hopefully you can feel the 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4. You'll notice a lot of pop songs are written this way.</p>
<p>Both of those pieces can have a 4/4 time signature or a 2/2 - but it doesn't work for either.</p>
<p>As for why composers just use 2/4 instead of 2/2 - the way music is written, it's a lot harder to read if the music is fast.</p>
<p>I hope I explained myself well, this being the first ELI5 I've written.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is in the grouping of beats which translates into a different feel when used correctly.</p>
<p>For example, 3/4 and 6/8. 3/4 is one meter divided into three beats, while 6/8 can be two groups of three beats or three groups of two beats. To simplify, think of 6/8 as two sets of triplets and you'll maybe be able to feel the difference. </p>
<p>Now, technically, if you wrote a piece in 3/4 but made your primary beat division the eighth note, then yes, you're basically playing 6/8 while being numbered 3/4. Nothing technically wrong with doing that. But even then, seeing 3/4 at the front should make the musician play differently than he would in 6/8, just because they create different mindsets even if they're technically the same thing. Different beat groupings translates into different accented notes, which can totally change the feel of an instrument line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two cases a reactor or core designer has to deal with, steady state operation and transient operation. </p>
<p>In general, poisoning is dealt with by having a large amount of hot excess reactivity so that you have xenon overrode capability. This means having sufficient hot excess reactivity to overcome any poisoning effects. Large light water power reactors are designed to run for up to 2 years continuously so they are loaded with a large amount of excess fuel to support that. </p>
<p>In steady state, the whole poison process balances out with excess reactivity and isn’t an issue. For transient conditions, like sudden drops in power or a scram, unit’s have xenon override capability based on their design. </p>
<p>For bwr plants, at full power you have a large amount of voids in the core producing negative reactivity. After a scram these steam voids collapse as the reactor shuts down, returning that reactivity and making it available for restart. Xenon may complicate ramping the unit back to 100% after the restart due to thermal limits, however bwrs always have xenon override capability and can start up in peak xenon at virtually any point in the cycle. </p>
<p>PWRs have xenon override until they are in the end of their cycle in coastdown with most of all of their boron diluted. For a pwr, you reclaim a small amount of reactivity as the reactor cools down to hot standby after a trip, but you rely on the hot excess reactivity to overcome peak xenon. </p>
<p>For CANDU plants, these units have very little hot excess reactivity, and can easily be poisoned out. The plant is designed to only do a full reactor trip when absolutely necessary, and in other cases runback to 60% or 2% based on he situation. At 60%, you have enough neutron production to prevent poisoning from shutting the core down. At 2% you have a time window where if the problem condition clears you can ramp back up to 60% before xenon catches up to prevent a xenon peak from poisoning the core out. </p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what CaptainCalandria said:</p>
<p>Reactor Physics keeps a very detailed model of the current and projected reactivity. Refueling is planned so it will both keep enough reserve for transients/power operations, and keep the flux uniform in core.</p>
<p>Sometimes after a planned outage they have to refuel channels that were inspected. If the fuel in them was close to depletion, and they defueled a lot of channels they put in fuel with less uranium so the spike in reactivity won't be that high.</p>
<p>CANDU also keeps a &quot;reserve&quot; in the form of adjuster bars (which usually stay inserted). That's what allows that 30 minute window. If they couldn't take them out (and reduce the number of neutrons they absorb), they would only have a few minutes to restart.
As is, most of the time after a stepback or reactor trip, they won't restart immediately even when they believe they know what happened. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food spoilage is mostly caused by bacteria and fungi in the environment. </p>
<p>There are a lot of them naturally present, and generally don't harm the plant or animal that they're living on. But when that organism dies, it literally becomes the Hunger Games. </p>
<p>The microbes start ripping apart the nutrients present in the dead organism, and creating environments that kill as many of their competitors as possible. </p>
<p>Some of that competition is good for humans: pickles, vinegar, cheese, bread, and plenty of other foods are basically just us picking the winner in those Hunger Games. We give the microbes we like (L. Plantarum, etc) a nudge that helps them kill their competitors that we don't like (C. Botulinum, etc). </p>
<p>But, what does that have to do with canning? </p>
<p>Canning is the &quot;kill everything&quot; strategy. The food is completely sterilized and all microbes are killed. Good guys, bad guys, it doesn't matter. Kill everything with fire (literally with fire, if you're using gas heat). With everything dead, there's no Hunger Games, and the food doesn't get digested by them -- it stays fresh forever. </p>
<p>... if it's sterile. </p>
<p>If the strategy is to kill everything, you have to make sure that not one single microbe survives. That's hard to do. C. Botulinum in particular is a tough little bastard, can kill you, and you've killed all the L. Mesenteroides and other &quot;good guys&quot; who might have fought against it. For that reason most commercial canned foods include some additional preservatives -- the &quot;chemicals&quot; -- that people complain about. </p>
<p>But those chemicals are important for the reasons I described. Canning tries to kill every last living thing in the food product, and if there's a single survivor you'll die eating it -- a little chemical help makes sure that there are no survivors. </p>
<p>(Edit: Corrected some typos that people have pointed out. Thanks for all the positive comments! And, I'll stand by my use of &quot;literally&quot; here, so don't bother complaining more about it.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Once you put food in a can and create a hermetic seal (fancy term for saying nothing gets in or out, not even air), you have to cook the can. It is cooked in a giant pressure cooker with steam until all of the dangerous bacteria is killed off. The food will last as long as the seal. For a canned good, the seam is made of 5 layers of metal. When stored at room temperature, if the coating on the can is good, canned goods should last indefinitely, however there will be a small drop in quality after 2 to 3 years. Highly acidic products can eat through the can coating after a while, and have shorter shelf life as a result. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's 3 main ways of preserving food, all of which can be very effective. </p>
<p>The first, canning, focuses on killing all the bacteria in a product, then sealing it so no new bacteria can get in. Irradiation is another form of the same concept. </p>
<p>The second is altering the environment such that the bacteria there can't grow. That can be by removing water, adding sugar or salt in large amounts, or otherwise making it inhospitable. </p>
<p>The final way is fermentation. The goal here is to stack the deck such that desirable organisms can outcompete the bad guys and prevent them from taking hold. Also, things like lactic acid (pickles) and alcohol (beer and wine) can help create an environment where other stuff can't grow. </p>
<p>The very best ways of preserving things would likely be a combination of all three. For example, beer is boiled (type 1) with hops, which has some antimicrobial properties (type 2) fermented (type 3) then carefully sealed (type 1). A beer recovered from a shipwreck proved drinkable after 200 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As an aside, &quot;best by&quot; and &quot;use by&quot; dates often have nothing to do with how quickly the food will go bad.  Instead, they're often defined by how long the <em>packaging</em> can be expected to remain intact.  This is why bottled water has an expiration date, for example, and why you can eat long-expired food so long as the packaging is still sealed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most lip balms (Chapstick is actually a specific brand name) have two or three functions.</p>
<p>The first and main function is to create  a hydrophobic (waterproof) barrier on your lips to prevent evaporative loss of water from the exposed cells. Usually petrolatum or beeswax is used. That water loss kills cells while changing their shape and size which creates the hardening, cracking, bleeding, and pain of chapped lips.</p>
<p>All lip balms will provide some UV light protection and many modern brands can provide very significant protection (SPF 50+). This simply helps keep those exposed cells healthy and stops what could be a secondary danger to those cells.</p>
<p>Some lip balms which are usually labeled as &quot;medicated&quot; contain mild analgesics. These can be effective in reducing the pain of chapped lips but some physicians and researchers are concerned that preventing the pain may cause people to not notice when damage is increasing. Also, the analgesic effect will run out well before your lips heal leading to a simple &quot;dependence&quot; on constant reapplication to avoid pain. It may be wise to avoid these balms unless your chapped lips have reached the point where pain is affecting your life.</p>
<p>Bonus trivia: lip balms are not compatible with latex condoms. Take care when the two may come in contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this would call on Computer Scientists and Network engineers, with domain knowledge in cell tower installation/setup.</p>
<p>I want to know what ATT or Verizon's average cost is assuming data transfer is over a cell tower in the lower 48 US. I'm not interested in capital investment numbers because these eventually are fully subsidized through pricing I would think is obvious. I'm just interested in the number it costs to transmit the data over all the network hardware to my phone. </p>
<p>Also I'm mostly talking about the last mile or endpoint node to my phone. I realize depending on where the data is originating the costs can vary, at least it would be nice to have some explanation of how numbers add up in the ISP world. So we can be more educated consumers. </p>
<p>EDIT: Many have brought attention to operating/maintenance/employee costs. While these costs are substantial, they are relatively fixed or stepped and heavily subsidized. I want to know a big telcom's average variable costs on delivering data from point A to B, if both A and B are in the US and B is an endpoint like my cell phone. </p>
<p>EDIT2: After reading through all these comments, maybe the better question would've been: On average, how much would every customer of ATT have to pay per month to support all of ATT's network and operational costs.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical engineer who has done a decent amount of work for Verizon and At&amp;t. The two main operating costs for carriers is renting tower space and electricity. Most cell phone towers are owned by tower companies like American Towers or Crown Castle. Carriers will rent a 10' section of the tower and roughly 200-400 sq ft of space on the ground to store equipment. Cost of rent will vary based on location but it is typically around 2,000$ a month. Electricity costs will vary based on the location of the cell site. Basically, the more people using the equipment, the more power the equipment will draw. For Verizon, in a decently populated area, they will peak around 10kVa or roughly 40 Amps at 240V. Verizon has a few different types of sites as far as equipment goes. Some sites will be smaller scale sites that will not handle as much data while others are central hubs that will draw alot more. For electric bills that I have seen in populated areas you are looking at ~250 a month. The number of cell sites that are needed will depend on the tower heights and how much interference is in the way from site to site. Basically, you need more cell sites in the city or in the woods then you would in the desert.    </p>
<p>Assuming you are only downloading from one cell site, the cost to run that cell site for ~5 minutes will be about 25 cents. Have to figure that you will not be the only person ever using the tower though.</p>
<p>2000rent plus 250 electric yield 2250. 2250÷30days÷24hours÷60 minutes gives cost per minute of .05 dollars, or 25 cents for 5 minutes. (thanks to arglebargleglopglif)</p>
<p>Edited for horrible math.... working to much + alcohol does not equal good math for some reason...
Few extra notes...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes, this cost does not include a lot of the costs associated with running a company, upgrades maintenance and so on. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The life of cell towers does not really matter a lot as the provider is typically not the owner of the tower. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LTE means long term employment to people in the industry. Cell sites get upgraded all the time to have more capacity, more efficient equipment and so on. </p>
</li>
<li>The download speed depends on the internet in the area. If the cell tower is in a town that has old internet than the tower will be limited. Also worth noting that all providers on the tower are connected to the same internet connection which means that all providers will have the same speed. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Telecom in general, both wireless as well as broadband data, are an interesting study in economics. It takes well over $100million to run a fiber optic cable with 24 strands between New York and LA. Paying for right of way, fiber, bulldozers, repeaters. And more for techs to repair it when inevitably someone cuts it during construction.</p>
<p>Once that’s built, the variable cost of sending data, or putting another user on is almost zero. The biggest fixed cost is the stamp on the monthly bill. The 24 strand fiber would carry terabits - thousands of gigabits with the proper termination optical equipment.</p>
<p>But if you are that company, you have to recoup the $100 million plus the techs cost.</p>
<p>You could price 1 Gigabit/sec at $1 million/month and maybe 10 companies could afford it. That’s where we were in 1970when bandwidth was very expensive and the phone company was a regulated monopoly.</p>
<p>Or you could price it at $1/month and hoper there were 10 million customers in NYC and LA that want to send 1 kilobit/sec.</p>
<p>Or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Then you have to lay lines to everyone’s home. Some downtown in high density areas are cheap to cover. In the rural areas or suburbs, it may cost over $1000 per house to wire. So, how to you get that back?</p>
<p>While everyone thinks cellular and broadband rates are highway robbery, it’s pretty close to cost. There are profits. For companies with a large number of customers, large profits. Those who don’t attract a large number of customers go out of business because they can’t pay for the large fixed cost.</p>
<p>While there’s no marginal cost of ‘one more customer’, someone has to pay for the fixed cost or the company dies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers in here are way off the mark, and are only looking at one minute facet of a much larger infrastructure.<br />
I cannot give you exact figures, but providing 1gb of data to a mobile customer certain costs more than 0.01c in the vast scheme of things outside of just electricity.</p>
<p>Most modern LTE towers are run via fiber or microwave transmission.  As an example of putting LTE service in a rural area; Running those lines alone requires:
-municipal planning,
-paying for contractors,
-surveyors,
-people to map out coverage maps and overlaps.<br />
-People to be hired to negotiate with local officials in order to get a deal or financial support for the infrastructure.    Usually this comes with other arrangements (wait until water lines are put in, cover a portion of the ground crew, pay to upgrade a school, etc).  Yes, I know many carriers don't follow through on these obligations, but it is more complex than people think.</p>
<p>So now we have approval to build a tower, now we go and find land you either have to buy from a local government (who will certainly upcharge 10x what it is really worth), or convince a local farmer or building owner to let you build on their land, and pay a monthly fee.
Now you call a town meeting, and need to appease people, this isn't free and staff need to be paid etc.</p>
<p>Great, you have a tower site, you paid possibly tens of thousands to contractors to run lines to your rural tower via fiber along roads etc.</p>
<p>Now the tower itself costs a bunch of money, as do the transceivers of which there could be dozens on each tower.  Costs a little to wire it into the grid and add back up power.</p>
<p>Now you pay a crew to wire it up, and spend 2-3 months of testing, while you wait for approval of activation.  Sometimes this is dependant on getting approval from a local government as well as from the engineering team.</p>
<p>So now the tower is up.  In each region will be a team of engineers who maintain and test the tower ongoing.  They also have an emergency team they keep on call for various regions.  All need to be paid.</p>
<p>Then you have a fleet of vehicles that need to be paid for, maintained, and stocked with equipment, including back up equipment for towers.</p>
<p>You need to also pay for a central building to house those vehicles locally in various regions, pay for all the costs that come with running a facility.</p>
<p>That is just the local side of things...</p>
<p>You also need programmers to make control software, and pay for monitoring software, and also have people integrate those things into your existing software infrastructure.  You also need a team that constantly work on updating or keeping things up to date.
Then there is a team that monitors status of the service/towers.</p>
<p>You also need trainers to train, and software needs to be made to also train.</p>
<p>You need to also pay for 1000s of customer service reps, foreign and domestic, their managers, training, software, support staff, a building and facility.</p>
<p>Theres the cost of the actual frequencies, most countries auction them off and that costs money.</p>
<p>Research and Development too, paying for various contracts with ZTE/or one of the other manufacturers of tower equipment.</p>
<p>Then you have buyers and dealers who work with companies like apple, Samsung etc to make deals and get devices on the network.</p>
<p>Software developers who make/test software releases on devices for the network.</p>
<p>Teams of marketing people who work in advertising, making deals with various manfactueres, working with advertising agencies to create content for tv and other various media.</p>
<p>Then we have retail locations.  You have thousands of staff in various positions.  Training for them, POS systems and software, payment systems, merchandising that is updated weekly.  Support teams for them too.  Train regional managers as well.  Incentives programs and various other systems to be put in place.</p>
<p>There are maybe 100 other systems I am missing out on that a carrier has as &quot;costs&quot; in the transmission of a signal.</p>
<p>So those people who are using purely electricity to calculate the cost of the transmission are only using a tiny part of a much larger system of costs and profits.  Sure with all the monthly fees and income more than cover the costs, and I'm not saying that 0.01cents is way off, because it might not be in the long terms, but people need to realize it isn't so simple to calculate.</p>
<p>TL:DR While 0.01cents may not be far off, it isn't a simple calculation of electricity costs to figure out the cost of 1gb of data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer, as any accountant knows, is what does Verizon want it to be?</p>
<p>There are a ton of costs setting up a cell network that don't include the cell towers. You have to have the switching equipment, internet interfaces, backhaul lines, emergency power, and so on, and that's just equipment. You need customer service, repair techs, and a trouble ticket system. You need a billing system, software and hardware, and people to run it. There's more, but you get the idea. And the costs of ALL of those things have to be reflected in the final price. </p>
<p>I don't even think Verizon could answer the question because, quite honestly, they don't give a f. I worked at a cellular provider in Canada when it was in its infant stages, and I lived through all the issues with trying to build out a network. No one would have ever asked this question, because there's no point in answering it. We don't price based on marginal cost (which, as others have pointed out, is extremely low); we priced on expected revenue vs expected costs to get a target profit margin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your question the way it's proposed, but I'll say this. The cost to the company is maintaining a network that can handle a certain number of people on demand in any given area. It's more about the available bandwidth than the amount of data used. </p>
<p>If everyone used their data without any fear of usage cost, it would be easy for the network to be overwhelmed by the users.</p>
<p>I agree that the cost vs the amount of data given is crazy. </p>
<p>However, thanks to competition even the big carriers offer reasonable unlimited plans now. ATT doesn't even consider throttling your data until you hit 22 GB (for unlimited users) of usage on your line. Even then, you only experience throttling when the network is congested. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
