Now whether they have the power to do anything about it, and whether doing so would be considered a hostile act or a defensive act is debatable. </p>
<p>That being said though, it's not possible to put a satellite in permanent position over most countries because of the Earths spin. We would call such an orbit geostationary meaning from the ground the satellite doesn't appear to move, because it's orbiting the Earth at the same rate the Earth is spinning. The only stable orbit in that setup is around the Earths equator in a narrow range of latitude. </p>
<p>Spy satellites tend to orbit at an incline to the equator which allows an orbit that progresses over time, like using a pen to progressively paint a white ping pong ball black tracing one line next to another line over and over. By having several satellites in overlapping orbits it is possible to keep continuous view of a country though as one satellite moves too far away, another is coming into range. </p>
<p>It would be possible to move a satellite above any country and hold it there, but it would expend fuel doing so and could not do it indefinitely. Equatorial geostationary orbits though are stable without fuel (other than minor corrections) and the use of those geostationary spots (there is limited space up there in that narrow band) is governed by international treaty and businesses that hold licenses for those spots. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What can be put into space and what activities can be conducted there is regulated by international treaties at least partially through the <a href="http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/index.html" target="_blank">United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs</a>. Among the agreements contained in those treaties is the agreement that: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>outer space and celestial bodies (e.g. the Moon or any of the planets) cannot be claimed as the territory of any nation, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that every nation has the right to the peaceful use and exploration of space, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that no nation can place weapons of mass destruction into space nor build military bases in space or on any celestial bodies, and </p>
</li>
<li>that nations that launch objects into space must register them (generally describing their purpose and intended orbit) with the Secretary General who publishes a registry of the objects and who owns them.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in short, any nation can place non-weaponized objects in space as long as they tell the Secretary General of the United Nations about it. </p>
<p>The treaties also cover private actors like SpaceX or Blue Origin and there are national laws and bodies that govern the extraterrestrial activities of domestic private entities (e.g. FAA regulates launches in the United States under the Commercial Space Launch Act).</p>
<p>This area of law called (unsurprisingly) Space Law, and is an actively practiced specialization for at least a few lawyers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sattelites in space move in really strange ways from our perspective on the ground. Because of this, the idea of something in space staying direclty &quot;over&quot; a country is almost impossible unless the country is really near the equator. The reality is that satellites fly over many, many countries depending on their orbit (e.g. the international space station flies over almost every single country every day or two).</p>
<p>Any sovereign nation can place a satellite in space that flies over another. This is part of the reason why the Cold War did not escalate further, the Russians could see what Americans were doing and the Americans could see what Russians were doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You can easily see that in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NZjWfWT.jpg" target="_blank">this series of images</a> taken in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) parts of the spectrum. As you can see there is a UV band below the violet edge and an IR band above the red edge, which you obviously can't see with the naked eye.</p>
<p>This result is exactly what we would expect. The way rainbows work is that when sunlight strikes water droplets suspended in the air, part of the light is reflected at the air/water interface at the back of each droplet, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tcLYm5o.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. Since water is dispersive (meaning that the rerfractive index varies by wavelength), each droplet effectively acts as a small prism spreading the white light into its spectral components. Now our eyes our only sensitive to the visible (by definition), which is why a rainbow looks like a colorful transition from violet to red. However, sunlight also contains <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KbIrTzA.png" target="_blank">IR and UV components in addition to visible light</a>. While the water droplets absorb some of this light, much of it ends up reflected, as part of this extended rainbow that you can see from the IR and UV images posted above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it's generally said that the genes for blue eyes are recessive as opposed to other eye colors such as brown/green/hazel. However it's believed that blue eyes all originate from a single person thousands of years ago. This person had a genetic mutation that gave them blue eyes and then the gene spread over the millennia. But if blue eyes are recessive then surely nobody would have blue eyes today? So is it really a case that blue eyes are recessive in the short term and then they begin to appear spontaneously amongst people who have the blue eye gene regardless of their eye color? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue eyes are what are called Autosomal recessive (this isn't necessarily 100% true, but it is good enough we can work with it).</p>
<p>Autosomal recessive means that both alleles (meaning genes that you get from your parents) need to be recessive in order to be expressed in the offspring. </p>
<p>Now lets say that this blue eyed person's alleles are represented by  'rr'. A person needs two little 'r's, one from the father and one from the mother, to have blue eyes. Here's where it gets interesting. Father and Mother do not need to have blue eyes to necessarily have a blue eyed kid. If Mom has a Brown eyed allele and blue eyed allele, she will have brown eyes, but still carry a blue eyed gene, or what we would write as 'Rr'. If the father has the same 'Rr' pattern, then there is 1/4 chance of one of their kids getting 'rr' and having blue eyes. Also, they will have a 1/2 chance of getting a kid with 'Rr', meaning the gene is still present, even if it isn't being expressed. </p>
<p>A one more point before I wrap up with an answer. Since blue eyes do not necessarily put a person at risk of early death in the wild, they are not selected against in population. The lack of disadvantage means that the likelihood of someone with blue eyes living as long as someone with brown eyes is pretty good, and increases the chances of a blue eyed person mating with another blue eyed person, or a brown eyed person with an 'r' allele. You could even argue that blue eyes are selected for in modern populations, as some consider those with blue eyes more attractive and therefore increase that person's chances of mating (although the applicability of that could definitely be questioned).</p>
<p>In short</p>
<p>Because a gene can be carried without being expressed in a person, it can survive a surprising amount of time without ever showing up as a blue eyed person. All it takes to express that gene is one other person with that recessive allele to mate with them, and a blue eyed person can be born. And because blue eyes are not usually selected against in nature, when someone does appear with blue eyes they are just as likely to mate as any other member of the population, increasing the chances of persistence in population.</p>
<p>Edit: I should have probably made this a bit more clear, eye color is not 100% controlled by one gene, it is controlled by quite a few genes that give each eye a unique hue and pattern. Eye color as whole however does work pretty well in models for autosomal traits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, eye color is a complex trait resulting from the interaction of MANY genes, not just one gene as previously thought. It's not as simple as just being &quot;recessive&quot;. </p>
<p>As someone else posted, recessive genes are only expressed if a person has two copies of them, one from each parent. They are not &quot;weaker&quot; than dominant genes.  Often what makes a gene recessive is that the protein it codes for doesn't work or it has a different function than the dominant protein. In the case of eye color, blue eyed people don't make as much melanin, which is a brown-colored pigment (protein) that also makes your skin tan and fruit turn brown when exposed to air. </p>
<p>That being said, recessive traits in general can be very common in a population if they are associated with a reproductive advantage. For example, dwarfism is actually a dominant trait, but it's not very common because having two copies of the dwarfism gene causes a baby to be stillborn or die shortly after birth. So people with dwarfism typically have one dominant allele for dwarfism and one recessive allele for normal height. But the recessive gene for normal height is far more common in the population because babies with two recessive copies reproduce more frequently, thus passing on that gene more often. </p>

Note that there are a lot of other genes that go into eye colour, so in reality it's much more complicated than what I'll try to explain here. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if blue eyes are recessive then surely nobody would have blue eyes today?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do you think this? The children of that original blue eyed person wouldn't have had blue eyes, but they were carrying the blue eye gene that didn't get expresed. Over the thousands of years, they have some kids, those kids have more kids, and eventually some of these distantly related cousins get together. The ones who each carry a blue eye gene have a chance of having blue eyed kids. You get half your genes from each parent, and if both parents have one blue eye gene and one brown eye gene (meaning they have brown eyes) you will have blue eyes if the halves you get each contain the blue eye gene. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recessive genes are no less likely to be inherited than any other.
This means they get passed down to about 1/2 of a carrier's progeny.  Recessive means they are only expressed when someone has a copy form both parents.   Odds are every carrier who reproduces is going to have at least one carrier descendant.  Nothing ever weeds the carriers out of the genome, and it takes genetic testing (or having a blue eyed kid) to even tell the gene is there.  Nothing ever selectively culls them out.  </p>
<p>It is likely the blue eyes mutation has occurred more than once.  If it did, science might be unable to tell the difference unless the populations were widely separated to prevent their descendants form interbreeding.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instincts, or fixed actions, are part of your genome and moderated by the complexity of the brain.</p>
<p>Sharks have very a primitive brain. If you compared their brain to a human brain, it would look a lot like a fetus' brain well before birth. There is no complex cerebral cortex helping them learn complicated tasks or deviate very far from what is already imprinted (instinct). They feel hungry, they look for food. They sense blood, they think meal. A shark would never say fish are friends because a shark only knows that fish are food. It simply can't learn that fish are friends.</p>
<p>On the other hand, humans have a <em>massive</em> cerebral cortex that gives us a very high degree of &quot;behavioural flexibility.&quot; The more we learn and adapt, the less we rely on more reflexive instincts. We feel hungry and want food, but we look to things like learned information, learned behaviours, and social needs when we decide what we want to eat, where we want to eat, etc. We can look at both side of the fish-are-friends vs fish-are-food debate choose to eat or not eat fish.</p>
<p>I don't really know how arachnids compare to animals. Spiders do have rather complicated brains for such little dudes. [Up to 80% of small spiders is their brain!] (<a href="https://braindecoder.com/post/spider-brain-great-mystery-in-a-tiny-head-1094514994" target="_blank">https://braindecoder.com/post/spider-brain-great-mystery-in-a-tiny-head-1094514994</a>) I suspect it is probably something imprinted, too. Looking back over hundreds and hundreds of generations, spiders imprinted with the &quot;genetic memory&quot; to build successful webs may have been more likely to survive and continue to pass those traits on to their offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's samples per second aka the sampling rate of an audio signal. When you convert analog sound to a digital format it is done by sampling the analog wave thousands of times a second to convert it into a number like a voltage. The higher the sampling rate, the greater the frequency in hz that can be represented. It ends up needing about twice the sampling rate, to correctly sample a specific frequency of sound. </p>
<p>For instance if you need to record a 20,000hz analog soundwave, you need to sample it at 40,000 times a second or 44.1khz which is what music on a CD is sampled at. </p>
<p>The other factor is the size of each sample which effects how many levels of sound it can encode for each sample. This is analogous to how many colors an image has. An 8 bit sample allows for 0-255 levels of sound, or 256 colors if it were photographic data. Where as a 16 bit sample allows for 0-65,355 levels or voltages, or 65,356 colors if it were an image. </p>
<p>So a 16 bit 44.1khz wave file encodes 65,356 discrete &quot;loudness&quot; or voltages in each sample and it samples (or does it) 44,100 times a second. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people have mentioned that the sampling rate of a digital audio signal needs to be at least twice the highest frequency you want to accurately capture. This is called the Nyquist limit, and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/PcWxd" target="_blank">I whipped up a quick graphic to explain why here.</a></p>
<p>The gist is that to produce a faithful representation of a continuous periodic function using finitely many data points, you need to have at least two points present in every period, or you won't have enough information to recreate the original signal. </p>
<p>Real audio signals have many component frequencies, not just one like the pure tone in those images, so you need to decide what the maximum frequency you want to capture is, and then sample at least twice that often. For most people, human hearing really drops off past 20-25 kHz, so sampling at 40-50 kHz will sound good, hence the CD audio standard of 44.1 kHz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes - samples per second (s/s). &quot;CD Quality&quot; was set at 44,100 s/s. The reason for this that you need at least twice as many s/s as the highest frequency you want to capture, which for humans is about 20,000 Hz. These days a pro studio records at 96,000 s/s (96k).</p>
<p>The other major digital audio parameter is bit depth, which is a measure of the potential quality of each sample - like the film or frame size (35mm, 70mm, 1080p, 4K) determines the quality of film or video. &quot;CD Quality&quot; is 16 bit depth, now 24 bit depth is typical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original inspiration for holography is black hole thermodynamics. Black hole entropy (which you can obtain from Hawking's expression for the temperature) is area-intensive, and has thus holographic character. In general, <em>any</em> gravitational theory (in which it is possible to create black holes) will display an area-intensive maximum entropy (see Bekenstein bound). This does not directly imply holography, but it's very hard to fit in any other framework.</p>
<p>Holography however starts really coming together only when you find explicit examples of holographic dualities, which started popping up in string theory (AdS/CFT and co.). Not only have we come to understand that string theory implies holography, but also that holography is necessarily stringy. Nowadays, we think of holography as providing the microscopic <em>definition</em> of a string theory!</p>
<p>So I would argue the role of your &quot;logical leap&quot; is definitely to be embodied by string theory. It's not a small jump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This topic is not my specialty, but I can relay some things I've learned in various lectures. Holography seems to come in when you try to combine gravity and quantum mechanics, even from very general considerations.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, the notion of probability is inherently associated with various notions of infinity. In quantum-sensitive experiments, we tend to think of the system we're examining as &quot;quantum&quot;, whereas our instruments, measuring devices, laboratories, even our brains, are &quot;classical&quot;. This is wrong, everything is quantum. However the reason it's OK to practically think in this fashion is that our laboratories etc are macroscopic (composed of many degrees of freedom). Any probability of some weird quantum shit happening is exponentially suppressed, and thus practically negligible, but still technically there. If you want a truly &quot;classical&quot; object, it needs to have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Thus well-defined quantum probabilities require infinitely large laboratories (conceptually speaking).</p>
<p>When you add gravity, things get weird. We know that if you put enough mass into a space, eventually it will create a black hole. Thus if we want to build an infinitely large laboratory (again, conceptually speaking), we must continually enlarge the volume it encompasses. Since we are taking the infinite limit, this pushes the laboratory to the boundaries of the space you're in, possibly to infinity. Thus we say that in quantum gravity there are no &quot;local&quot; variables; all of the things that conceptually make sense, <em>from the get go</em>, are variables that exist at the boundary of your space. This implies holography, because it implies the theory must be formulated in terms of boundary variables.</p>
<p>If you now consider that the universe is expanding, and that the expansion is accelerating, we lose even those boundary variables. In that case we're totally lost; what is the theory even <em>about</em> any more? However this point I don't totally understand. Keep in mind my comment is a hand waving relay of (frankly) a hand waving (but still very good) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87lz3U4CkPU" target="_blank">technical lecture</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Afaik, the argumentation kind of goes like</p>
<p>What we know about the thermodynamics of black holes implies that the maximum entropy of a region in spacetime doesn't scale with its volume but its surface. Now because entropy is equivalent to content of information, it is principally possible that a theory describing physics in a space is equivalent to a theory on that space's surface (as the surface could in principle contain all information the space inside does due to the surface proportional maximum entropy scaling). Now because theories of quantum gravity can describe black holes, they might also tell us more about the holographic principle. </p>
<p>That's at least what I understand of it, but my knowledge on the topic is very superficial. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The holographic principle comes more naturally from information theory, which, just like other math, is playing a larger part in theoretical physics.</p>
<p>The speed of light is also called the speed of causality, and &quot;causality&quot; ties deeply into information theory.  A blackhole has gravity so intense that even light cannot escape its schwarzschild radius.  That also meant that information cannot escape, or so people thought.  Once Hawking radiation was theorized as a way for a blackhole to dissipate, a new problem was posed: can we destroy information by throwing it into a blackhole and letting it dissipate?</p>
<p>The resolution to preserve information was to let Hawking radiation carry the information from inside the black hole as it dissipates away.  For this to happen, the information of the volumetric space (spherical blackhole) had to be equal to the information of the surface area (Hawking radiation).  In fact, you can draw a sphere around the entire observable universe and imagine it collapses into a blackhole and therefore all volumetric information has to be equal to the surface information.  This is the holographic principle.</p>
<p>This has an interesting ramification due to the Planck length and Heisenberg uncertainty.   The information of the surface is at a coarse resolution (Plank squared) while the information of the volume is a higher resolution (Planck cubed).  This means the allowable information in a volumetric space is vastly less than implied by volumetric Planck scale, since it had to be equal to the surface resolution.  We don't know how the information is encoded in Hawking radiation, but we have encoded 3D wavefront information onto 2D paper called holograms and borrowed that name as an analogy when referring to dissipating blackholes and radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glottal blocking so that nose breathing is easier. If your tongue rested without touching the roof of your mouth it would not seal your mouth and it could allow air to be pulled in between your lips, or saliva to be inhaled. </p>
<p>Try this little experiment. Open your mouth and don't allow your tongue to touch the roof of your mouth or close your throat. What I mean is with our mouth open if we make a &quot;guh&quot; shape with our tongue like saying the letter G (which seals our glotis) most people (some say they can. Who am I to argue lol) will be unable to breath in through their nose at all. This is because there is less resistance inhaling through the mouth. If you start closing your mouth or allow your lips to come together a little to create more restriction, then it will start to come in through the nose more. But wide open mouth and wide open tongue/throat you cannot breath in through your nose. </p>
<p>The usual resting position of the tongue is low in the back and curving slightly at the tip lightly touching the back of the hard palate in the roof of your mouth just behind the front teeth (usually not touching the front teeth at all) Although people of different native languages sometimes have slightly different resting positions for the tongue depending on the sounds they use with the tongue more forward or more back in the mouth. This may affect a comfortable resting position that is not always the same in different people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Seriously tho, my tongue rests on the bottom of my mouth as well. I do have sinus issues, and so I've breathed primarily through my mouth for most of my life, so that might play a part, but I know plenty of people who rest their tongues at the bottom.</p>
<p>Case in point: there are certain qi gong and yoga practices that require the practitioner to place their tongue on the roof of their mouth, and it's not just taken for granted, it's really emphasized that people need to put their tongues there. If most people already had their tongues there, it wouldn't really need to be mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is supposed to apply to social media and ordinary citizens as well, although I doubt that a member of the public tweeting about Le Pen would get into trouble. The authorities will be more worried about the very powerful mass media.</p>
<p>The idea is that voters should have time to think about who they're going to vote for without the distractions of political campaigning. They've heard all the arguments and speeches, and now they need time to digest all that and come to a rational decision, rather than be swayed by whatever headline they glanced at on the way to the polling booth.</p>
<p>It also means that one candidate can't undermine the other by releasing some scandalous revelation on the day of the election, or even the day before.</p>
<p>Other countries have similar measures to ensure a fair election. In the UK, for example, media outlets can't broadcast anything on the day of the election that might favour any particular party; also, from the moment Parliament is dissolved, the government enters into a state of &quot;purdah&quot; (a Persian word meaning &quot;curtain&quot;) and is banned from announcing contentious or controversial legislation. For example, a government that thinks it might lose the election can't introduce a bill for some popular measure that the next government will have to scrap as unworkable, in order to discredit the next government -- that kind of thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It really gives people time to critically think about last minute promises or capitalizing on a tragedy. </p>
<p>In the US, Bloomberg's mayoral inauguration was delayed due to 9/11. That really helped Giuliani gain a lot of ground on his post-mayoral career. Of course, the city of New York had bigger things on its mind than who the mayor was but Le Pen and Macron could do tacky things if something happened. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The press have criticized this a lot, however after following the US elections I find that somewhat healthy. Polls have a lot of &quot;cooking&quot; and they can affect the result of the election. The US campaign was 50% scandals, 45% horse race and 5% policy.</p>
<p>The day off before election helps to &quot;clean&quot; a little bit about scandals (however, everyone have decided their vote by then) and the polls shutdown also cleans the news about the state of the race. </p>
