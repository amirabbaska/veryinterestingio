The short term memories are formed in the hippocampus which is very robust starting early age but the frontal cortex (also called as the neocortex where most of the long term memories are thought to be stored) develops even until the mid-20s in humans. From this perspective, infants may not consciously remember anything as the short term memories cannot easily get translated to the long term memories and get stored in the brain (we don’t truly know the chemical/physical nature of memory yet).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond the biochemical aspects, <em>what</em> exactly would you remember?  When you think about a memory, you mostly just describe it in terms of other, firmer concepts.  Car, ground, tree, red, friend, cold, etc.  A picture's comprised of a thousand words.  But as a baby, you don't have any of that.  The world is an incoherent jumble of sensation that takes <em>years</em> to learn to make any sense of.  Consider blind people who gain sight for the first time as adults; they have the damnedest time learning to comprehend what they are looking at.  To turn the photons hitting their retinas into &quot;Oh, that's my friend Bob, about 15 feet away, looking directly at me, wearing a white shirt and jeans&quot;.</p>
<p>To remember your infancy would be like trying to remember a conversation other people are having in a language that is totally alien to anything you know.  It's just a string of random noises to you, a solid wall of incomprehensibility with no chinks there for your mind to get a firm grip on.  It's not until you can map sounds to concepts you already know that you start to actually remember them in earnest.</p>
<p>Honestly, I've always been <em>amazed</em> at just how much infants have to learn, and how quickly they do it.  Not just learning a language or two from scratch and the aforementioned sensory processing, but also motor control, distinguishing between living and nonliving things (&quot;the quick and the dead&quot;), socialization, you name it.  That's an <em>awful</em> lot to have to pick up, and they get a huge chunk of it by age 3 or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like the proximate explanation given by /u/vingeran.</p>
<p>I'm also fond of ultimate explanations so I offer: the infant brain is terrible at making sense of its inputs because all of it is a confusing, uncorrelated mess. They are learning how to interpret the grand sensorium provided to them. Every input is novel and bears little relation to others.</p>
<p>Remembering a sensorial, interpretive mess provides no utility. A melange of un-compartmentalized sense inputs will do you no good in the future, so there is no mechanism to remember them by.</p>
<p>This is not to say that infants don't lay down diffuse, affective memories (this is good, this hurt) because I think they do, but they appear to be light on specifics because they have a hard time distinguishing specifics so early.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the most intuitive explanation for infantile amnesia is that memories are physically stored in neurons and synapses, and those structures change during postnatal development. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons) in the hippocampus causes cells to reorganize and thus break and replace synapses (the connections between neurons). (<a href="http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/19/9/423.short" target="_blank">http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/19/9/423.short</a>)</p>
<p>This hypothesis explains why infantile amnesia seems to happen in animals and why young children appear to form long-term memories, even though they can't recall them later. (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096585710235" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096585710235</a>) However, it does not explain how we can be influenced by events that take place during the time of infantile amnesia. For example, we begin learning to walk and talk during this time and we don't lose these abilities at the same time that we forget episodic memories. </p>
<p>Another hypothesis, supported by data from cognitive and neurological studies, proposes that the memories usually remain in storage in the brain, but cannot be accessed in the same way as later memories. (<a href="http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/21/3/135.short" target="_blank">http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/21/3/135.short</a>) The common analogy for this is that children first store memories on VHS, but then switch to DVD around 3 years. The VHS's are still there, but they no longer have the VCR to play them. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that still doesn't really explain why this happens. The truth is that we still have more questions than answers when it comes to memory, and infantile amnesia remains an area of active research. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Beyond the clickbait, there's your needle in the haystack.  The Earth's rotation has been declining progressively since its formation due to the persistent influence of the tides, the wind, and the Moon.  That is a glacially slow process involving more than 4 billion years.  That is the scale of geological time involved.  According to the scant details in the article, the research only looks at seismic events since 1900.  That is less than the blink of an eye in the proper context.  Paint me skeptical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth doesn't rotate at constant speed. Each day has a different duration depending on multiple factors. Here's the official site, and a table of average lenght of day (LOD) per year, since 1623. Before 1955 those figures were estimates; since 1955 the data come from atomic clocks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Science/EarthRotation/LODsince1623.html?nn=12932" target="_blank">https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Science/EarthRotation/LODsince1623.html?nn=12932</a></p>
<p>The US Geological Survey has a complete database of earthquakes. It's possible to build and download customized tables of earthquakes according to magnitude, location, and date:</p>
<p><a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/" target="_blank">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/</a></p>
<p>Bilham and Bendick authored a paper: &quot;Do weak global stresses synchronize earthquakes?&quot; which was published by the Geophysical Research Letters, August 2017:</p>
<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL074934/abstract" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL074934/abstract</a></p>
<p>Here's the abstract of Bilham's presentation at the GSA Annual meeting, October 2017:</p>
<p><a href="https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/webprogram/Paper300667.html" target="_blank">https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/webprogram/Paper300667.html</a></p>
<p>At the GSA presentation, as well as in several interviews with the meedia, Bilham claims:
1) Increases in the annual number of strong earthquakes (maginute 7 or more) coincide with a slowing down in the rotation velocity of the Earth;
2) Periods of high seismicity are preceded by deceleration episodes by 5-6 years.
3) In periods of high seismicity, there are between 25 to 30 intense earthquakes a year; the rest of the time the average figure is around 15.
4) The Earth is currently in a deceleration episode that began in 2011; therefore a period of high global seismicity of at least five years is expected.</p>
<p>By plotting the data obtained from IERS and USGS, we can test his assertions. What do we get?
1) Nothing. No correlation at all.
2) Nothing. No such thing.
3) From 1900 to 2016, the average number of major earthquakes in a year was 11.4, and the maximum was 24.
4) There was no deceleration episode that began in 2011.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>In their original paper, Bilham and Bendick were very cautious about their methods and findings. They even presented it as a question: &quot;Do weak global stresses synchronize earthquakes?&quot;. In her webpage, Prof. Bendick acknowledges: &quot;I am working on temporal patterns in the global earthquake catalog, especially ones suggestive of earthquake cycle synchronization and entrainment. This is brand-new work, and we have lots to do on it!&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="http://hs.umt.edu/geosciences/faculty/bendick/research/subduction.php" target="_blank">http://hs.umt.edu/geosciences/faculty/bendick/research/subduction.php</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Prof. Bilham has completely distorted the original paper's methods and findings, makes countless mistakes, and speaks in terms of absolute certainty. His assertions don't pass a basic test of scientific rigor. And his tone confims what his colleagues in India said of him: &quot;He's kind of a scaremonger&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a terrible disservice to science and society.</p>

<p>Why does it seem like junk science? They literally explain their theory in abstract.</p>
<p>Roger Bilham apparently has an insane amount of citations to his name (top25 in seismology in the world) so it seems he might be of the credible kind.</p>

<p>So yes, I would say it's NOT junk science. Now is the theory valid or close to what really happens? We'll have to wait for some papers to be published that address that question. Anyway it made a prediction, which can be verified in the next few years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are so many labs working on gene therapy delivery. You just can't deliver DNA to all the cells in your body by injecting DNA into your blood.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: yes, sort of. But forget about the rubber sheet analogy.</p>
<p>The notion of the volume of a black hole is quite tricky. To talk about volume you need to talk about a portion of space at a fixed time, and &quot;at a fixed time&quot; is not straightforward when relativity comes into play, because it depends on who exactly is measuring time.</p>
<p>The problem is essentially that the interior of a black hole is a piece of spacetime; you cannot just take the &quot;time&quot; out of it. Now, normally this isn't a problem. A ball which is just sitting there also occupies a region of spacetime, because time always moves forward. But no matter what the ball is doing it is always possible to move in such a way that the ball is at rest with respect to you: even if the ball is being affected by all sorts of crazy gravitational or electromagnetic fields and moving all over the place, you simply hold on tight to the ball, ignore all the havoc around you, and measure its volume. In more sophisticated terms, there is always a (hypothetical) observer for whom nothing changes with time, at least as far as the ball is concerned.</p>
<p>Inside a black hole, it is not possible to do this. Everyone and everything must fall towards the singularity, so it is not possible for someone to just stand still with respect to the black hole and measure its volume like it is with the ball. So one possible answer is that there is no unique well defined notion of the volume of a black hole.</p>
<p>However, there is kind of one way to define what it means to take the interior of the black hole at a fixed time. Mathematically, the problem described above can be expressed as saying that inside the event horizon there is no timelike Killing vector to form spacelike hypersurfaces. However, there are spacelike Killing vectors closed under Lie brackets, which means that they are integrable, so in a sense the inside of the black hole can be covered with spatial sections which are the closest we're gonna get to taking the black hole &quot;at a fixed time&quot;. And, for the punchline, each of these hypersurfaces has infinite volume.</p>
<p>Conclusion: whether or not the volume is infinite or whether it is actually well defined is really a matter of definition. I believe that if you must assign the word &quot;volume&quot; to <em>something</em>, then yes, it is infinite. But the situation is much more subtle than the rubber sheet would have you believe, as is always the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The ambient air going into your engine only has so much oxygen. If you provide too much fuel without increasing the oxygen level, you end up with incomplete combustion and less power is produced. This is called a rich mixture.</p>
<p>To make more power, nitrous oxide is added to increase the amount of oxygen beyond what the ambient air contains. With all of this extra oxygen, you are able to add and combust more fuel per cycle. When more fuel is combusted completely, you make more power.</p>

<p>A gasoline engine generates rotational energy through controlled combustion of air and fuel. If you <em>also</em> channel some compressed Nitrous Oxide into the air/fuel mixture, you can add more fuel and then make more power.</p>
<p>Nitrous Oxide supplies more oxygen and cools the intake charge. We don't use pure oxygen because it would literally be too explosive. Nitrous Oxide is composed of one molecule oxygen and two molecules of nitrogen. The nitrogen helps to control the burn, so it happens during ignition rather than before.</p>
<p>But this is a rather limited resource, so it's better suited to a drag strip than to a race track.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like everyone said.  Oxygen.  You need it to burn something.  IIRC a perfect mix of pump gas in your engine needs to be almost 15 parts air to 1 part fuel for a &quot;stoichiometric ratio.&quot; Or the perfect amount to burn everything out of the combustion chamber.  This burns really hot so it's better acrually to run a little rich so un burnt fuel is pushed out cooling the motor and exhaust on its way.<br />
Wanting to get more power, you need more air. So forced induction would do this.  And then you can add more fuel to make more power. But then as your pressure increases, regular pump fuel can't handle the compression without detonation before the spark plug fires.
Another way to add more power then is changing the fuel.  Oxygenated racing fuels and alcohol can lower the stoichiometric ratio to only 6:1. But Nitrous... having 2 oxygen molecules in it.  It's as low as 4:1. If I could have that ratio of waffles to syrup right now... that's a lot of syrup.  Or 3 - 4 times the fuel burning in your combustion chamber.  It'll probably separate a head from the block. But it's fun right up to that point.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>An engine can only take so much air into a cylinder which limits the amount of oxygen available for burning fuel. The oxygen part of NO enriches the air and allows more fuel to be burned in the same volume of a cylinder.</p>
<p>Additionally, the single Nitrogen atoms combine into double-atom Nitrogen molecules. This binding reaction is very strongly exothermic - all that energy is released as heat. This acts as an additional source of energy and doesn't even require any oxygen. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insulins fucked it up.</p>
<p>Your body needs glucose for energy. Everything you eat is broken down into glucose.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Foods like &quot;sugary&quot; foods, starch or very simple carbohydrates like rice, bread, pasta, etc, are digested very fast and thus, broken down and turned into glucose very fast.</p>
</li>
<li>Now, when you eat lots of those foods, lots of glucose goes into your blood very fast.</li>
</ol>
<p>And your pancrea produce little guys (hormones) called insulins who push that glucose into your cells.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When lots of glucose goes into your blood very fast, your organ pancrea freaks out and is like &quot;OMFG! Too much glucose in the blood. Too much glucose wandering around in the blood = poison!! Guys!!, Insulins!!, go go go!!! Go push them into the muscle cells and fat cells to properly store them.&quot; and then Pancrea produce lots of fucking insulins. May be even too much insulins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those lots of little fuckers called insulines push all the glucose from your blood into the cells.</p>
</li>
<li>Then, very low level of glucose in your blood. So, your body thinks &quot;Hey, my blood needs glucose. I need sugar(glucose). Feed me.&quot;</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably too late to the answer party. But you're probably not actually hungry. The insulin answers are sort of right, but your body is very, very good at controlling glucose levels unless you're diabetic. It will have some fairly large swings after binge eating but by morning it should be mostly stabilized and your body has stored a lot of the calories (and used some of them). You're probably dehydrated. A lot of people can't differentiate properly between feelings of hunger and feelings of thirst (a lot of the time anyway). Combine not drinking for however many hours you were asleep, digestion itself requires energy and water. On top of that, glucose being forced into cells pulls water with them because now there's more stuff inside the cells and they want to keep the concentration of that stuff about the same as before. So try having a glass of water in the morning after binge eating, give it 30 minutes and you should feel mostly better.</p>
<p>Edit: binge eating, not binge drinking. Though both apply sort of</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We tend to think of hunger as an indicator that our stomach is empty but this is not how hunger works. Hunger is controlled by hormones and there is a psychological component. Whether you eat a lot or a little before bed, your body will have digested it all within 8 hours.  </p>
<p>The first hunger hormone is ghrelin which comes in waves. If you eat 3 meals a day every day, you will get 3 waves of ghrelin around those meal times. If you skip a meal you do not continue to get hungrier, but the hunger will go away (even though your stomach is still empty). If you fast for a few days, hunger can go away altogether. </p>
<p>In your scenario, I think it is more about triggering a larger surge in ghrelin than it has to do with insulin. </p>
<p>The body is good at regulating blood sugar and crashes are not as common as people make them out to be (this is a serious medical condition). Plus if you ate lots of carbs that means your glycogen stores are full and instead of blood sugar going low the body would just tap into these stores.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you've eaten.</p>
<p>When you eat a meal at bedtime, particularly one rich in sugars and other simple carbohydrates, you generate an insulin surge from your pancreas. Upon retiring, this insulin begins pushing glucose into your cells, a process that continues as you sleep. During the night, a continual drop in your blood glucose stimulates the release of counter-regulatory hormones, leading to stimulation of your appetite centers. Unless you get up in the middle of the night to satisfy your appetite, you will be hungry upon arising in the morning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is called <a href="http://www.diabetes.co.uk/reactive-hypoglycemia.html" target="_blank">reactive hypoglycemia</a>. Basically you are throwing your body's hormones way out of line.

The volume of air displaced by a large subwoofer is large, but it is many feet / several hundreds of feet away from your ear. If you are too close to something of this size, you will be doing damage to your ears because the volume of sound waves hitting your eardrum is too large.  </p>
<p>Similarly, small earbuds produce a bass sound with a very tiny volume, but that earbud is mere millimeters away from your eardrum. Change that even to a few centimeters and the bass sound waves diffuse too quickly for them to affect your eardrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually easier for an earphone to produce bass than for a loudspeaker to. The reason is that the volume of a speaker drops off by the square of it's distance. In short, this means moving twice as far, results in 1/4 of the sound reaching you. While bass frequencies travel farther through the air than treble does, it requires much more power to produce them due to the physical excursion required from a driver. </p>
<p>The only way to produce powerful bass in a loud speaker is by moving air. This could be a very large speaker that moves just a little bit, or a smaller speaker that moves in and out very far. Either way it takes a LOT of power to do this and in order for the user to hear it, the speakers enclosure, and placement in the room is critical. </p>
<p>However on a headphone, the speaker is very close to the ear, sometimes even inside of the ear canal. And since it is possible to form a sealed enclosure with the speaker on one end, and the ear drum on the other, powerful bass can be produced with very little excursion (very little air needing to move) and with very low power requirements. </p>
<p>Larger, over the ear, headphones often have driver sizes of 50mm or more, which is a lot of surface area moving very close to the ear canal, and powerful bass can be produced. </p>
<p>The other thing to consider is the tonal balance of the headphone speaker between bass and treble. If you had a perfectly balanced frequency response, and changed the speakers enclosure slightly to reduce the level of treble frequencies, the perception of the user is that the bass frequencies were made louder. They would simply increase the volume control to compensate, resulting in louder bass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
