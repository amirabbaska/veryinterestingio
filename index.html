<p>Basically, the first spiders were venomous burrowing critters. They most likely had a mucus like secretion that helped form and hold the walls of their homes.</p>
<p>Over time this mucus ended up helping to incapacitate prey which placed a naturally selective pressure on those that used it offensively in addition to constructively.</p>
<p>Over even MORE time (millions of years, likely) those secretions became more refined and the spiders could use it as a soggy kind of net by dragging it around the top of low grass or plants.</p>
<p>Eventually it moved from there to the refined sticky silk we all know and love today.</p>
<p>Mind you, we don't have a fossil record of any of this, but many smart people have independently told me that this is the most likely evolutionary route taken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flowering plants and pollinating insects, such as bees, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221300256X" target="_blank">co-evolved somewhen between 140-110 million years ago</a>.</p>
<p>There are several different main categories of large plant, gymnosperms and angiosperms.  Gymnosperms came before angiosperms and are &quot;non-flowering&quot;  they include conifers, cycads, and ancient lineages such as ginkos and podocapus.  These plants generally pollinate by wind, dumping immense loads of pollen into the air and letting the wind carry it to the female receptacles on other plants, or self-pollinating in some cases.  Gymnosperms evolved around 320 million years ago, with indications that the lineage was emerging around 380 million years ago.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/808.full?rss=1" target="_blank">there <em>may</em> be evidence of animal pollination already taking place in gymnosperms</a> as early as 320 to 300 million years ago.  One line of evidence for this is pollen grains that appear to be too large to be wind transported.</p>
<p>Angiosperms are the flowering plants and the first true ones evolved around 160 million years ao, but split from gymnosperms long before that, around 245-200 million years go.  Flowering plants didn't become widespread until around 120 million years ago, which is right when we see the evidence of co-evolution in the first research paper linked above.  This suggests that the pairing of insect pollinators with flowering plants was vital to their success in spreading across the planet.</p>
<p>That still leaves a gap of some 40 million years, but there is evidence to suggest that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260766/" target="_blank"><em>Lichnomesopsyche gloriae</em> fly had already adapted to drink nutritious 'ovulate fluids'</a> from gymnosperm reproductive organs (can't really call it nectar since they're not technically flowers) and made an easy switch over to angiosperms when they evolved 160 million years ago.  So, from the very beginning it appears that there was a potential insect pollinator waiting in the wings to take advantage of a new niche, possibly many different ones.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that despite insects being the most well known pollinators (not just bees, but flies, mosquitoes, beetles, moths, butterflies, etc, etc) many <em>other</em> animals also pollinate flowers, including birds, bats, monkeys, marsupials, lemurs, bears, rabbits, deer, rodents, and, importantly for this discussion, reptiles.</p>
<p>Lizards, especially <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0028825X.1987.10410078" target="_blank">geckos and skinks can play an important role in pollinating plants</a>.  This is seen in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241579/" target="_blank">various places around the world</a>.  This suggests there were certainly other animal pollination vectors potentially available for early flowering plants, especially if some of these non-arthropod animals were already taking advantage of the nutrients available in gymnosperm reproductive bodies.</p>
<p>And there is, of course, still wind pollination and self pollination, but it seems that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534702025405" target="_blank">wind pollination for flowering plants may have evolved after animal pollination</a>.  Wind pollination requires both wind and a relatively dry climate, part of the reason why it's not seen very often in wet tropical forests.</p>
<p>TL/DR:  there were already species pre-adapted to pollinate flowering plants when they evolved and there was a rapid co-evolution of flowing plants and insect pollinators, as well as potential non-insect pollinators present.</p>
<p>EDIT:  oh, hey, thanks for the Au!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are types of plants that can pollinate themselves or use the wind to carry their pollen to other plants. In the same vein, there  are other insects that can pollinate plants other than bees, but again this depends on the ecosystem. </p>
<p>Honey bees themselves are a little percentage of pollinator insects. As a matter of fact, they are actually an invasive species that intrude on the other pollinators. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Initially most plants either basically copyed itself like grass. or put massive amounts of pollen in the air. But over millennia plants slowly evolved to use animals to help them reproduce, either through hitchhiking (seeds with spikes to stick to fur) or pollination. </p>
<p>Eventually those that cloned themselves lost prevalence as disease is easily transmitted by genetically indistinct plants and often a single infection can wipe out a species. And without rapid entropic transportation they dominate only a single area they are adapted for and exclusively for. </p>
<p>Those that spread pollen on the wind have to use massive amounts of energy to create large amounts of pollen otherwise there is almost no chance of reproduction as wind is chaotic and can sometimes be slow for weeks. And to do this they must go through cycles of storing energy, growing going dormant, spreading pollen
Using remanding energy to grow and regain their leaves. The use of sexual reproduction allows for greater distance traveled and because the plants are farther away they are less related and create greater genetically diverse offspring but require routine weather they have evolved to work with and a sudden change can ruin their lifecycle.</p>
<p>A few spicies of plants had a animal take a liking to them (often for food) but in the process carry the pollen to hopefully another of the plant. These plants slowly evolved to create less pollen and instead put more sugar into their nectar to attack insects as these animals as small enough to notice and access the nectar but fast enough to travel great distances  and because the bugs were small they didn’t kill the plants.</p>
<p>Centuries later Europeans brought bees around the world as they use the nectar to create honey that lasts and is more nutrient dense than raw nectar useful for rearing young that happens to be edible for humans. Eventually we helped bee colonies to grow and overtake the numerous pollenating insects leading to the initial lack of genetic diversity that caused asexual reproducers to lose prevalence!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Many plants also clone themselves and drop &quot;baby&quot; plants beneath them. Sometimes roots and stems can break off and grow new plants. Sometimes they send out vines that take root somewhere else. And as others said, even for flowering plants, anything that contacts both flowers can pollinate it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An excellent question.  Thank you for asking.  Wind pollination, for starters, which is how non-angiosperms (ferns and gymnosperms, ie cycads, pines, cypress trees) tend to be pollinated.  At least among vascular plants.  Many mosses, as I understand it, tend to rely on water droplets to get their spores from one sex to the other.  But a number of plants are self fertile.</p>
<p>It's actually probable that the flowers evolved first.  It's important to note that many don't attract bees at all: one of the the most basal angiosperms, so basal it's neither a monocot or a dicot, Magnolia, attract carrion beetles as pollinators by smelling [to them] like rotting meat, a tactic used by a number of other plant families, too.  However, showier flowers tend to attract a wider diversity of pollinators, like bees, flies, butterflies, moths, or even bats.  Some flowers have developed nectaries to further encourage pollinators to come down.  A little weed that pops up in North America, <em>Linaria canadensis</em>, Canadian Toad Flax, dusts the head of pollinators that land on its petals.  A personal favorite flower, the Bee Orchid is self fertile (and prefers to reproduce that way), but its flowers often attracts male bees in overlapping territories by emitting scents that smell like a female bee's pheromones -- the bee gets tricked with a pseudo-sexual reward, but it's another way of attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Bees, though, seem to have evolved from wasps that got a taste for nectar.  They and other things were already attracted to the flower, but the nectaries drove the evolution of an entire lineage of specialized pollinators.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Alright. Poop talk. Here we go.</p>
<p>Most animals are vegetarian. Lots of fiber. Often their poop forms fecal balls that gently cascade out of the animals anus like some kind of zen pebble garden fountain. Occasionally they get sick, have diarrhea, etc. That stuff stains their fur and irritates their butt. No fun. </p>
<p>Some of us are carnivores. Carnivore poop is many magnitudes grosser than vegetarian poop. That's why you can skitter across a field full of little goat raisinettes with little to no effect, but your cat can clear the room dropping a single turd. Carnivores can make up for some of the lack of roughage by eating the fur and sinew of its prey as well as ingestion of its own fur through grooming. This helps give the poops form as a protein rich diet tends to less like string cheese and more like go-gurt.  </p>
<p>We are omniverous, eating whatever tripe the food lobby puts in front of us. Some of us are better about eating roughage, vegetables, etc than others. But often we eat high protein, high carbohydrate diets which means that a lot of people are experiencing the Jackson Pollock shits.</p>
<p>The last element of the deuce equation is that we're bipedal with well developed gluteal muscles that encroach on the anal playing field. It's like trying to play field hockey in a back alley. You can do it, but you're gonna hit the walls a lot. Quadripeds have a different muscle orientation where their muscle mass is to the side rather than directly behind. We can bypass this anatomic hurdle by doing the deep squat. This brings the gluteals to the lateral and clears the airfield for the bombs to drop. But when you sit on the toilet like a nut on a Hershey bar, looking up cat videos on your phone, your butt cheeks are squeezed together and you can't help but to paint the walls. Furthermore, the commercial block is almost over so you're trying to eject that turd with magnum cannon force all the while reflexively clenching your puckerino, something akin to putting your thumb over the head of the hose and spraying your sister when she's trying to look cool sunbathing with her friends.</p>
<p>So if you're getting a flair in your <del>darier</del> derrière (thank you /u/Lee_Troyer), eat your veggies, cop a proper squat and relax the cracks. It'll save you the trouble of having to give yourself a tongue bath.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow. This got a response for something casually typed out while I was feeding my daughter dairy products. Thank you all for your kind words and for those of you who gelded me, why would you do that? I needed those. But seriously, thank you.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Word to the wise - if you know as much about shit as I do, you're either a proctologist or a veterinarian and I don't do people. So yes, I know the difference between gilding and gelding. Just a little veterinarian humor. Typically my time spent on reddit is making jokes to myself deemed too subtle to be funny (case in point). Guess I get it right every once in a while though.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: For those who are emphatically pointing out, sometimes with troubling enthusiasm, that many mammals prolapse their anus, I will just say that there are few cases where legitimate prolapse is not a disease state. Some critters have an increased laxity in the connective tissue stabilizing their rectums but at most I would say that this allows for protrusion, not true prolapse. If somebody has a source on physiologic prolapse, I'd be more than interested to give it a look. As for us, if you're constipated, eat a poor diet, don't drink enough water AND are in a hurry to get off the throne, then you too can experience the joys of rectal prolapse. But you might also pull an Elvis so I wouldn't recommend it.</p>
<p>As for cows, yes, they have the tendencies to undercook their pies leaving them shloppy half-baked piles. As an aside, baked the rest of the way in the sun, they can act as a worthwhile stand in for a frisbee if you're in a pinch. The upper digestive tract of a cow holds A LOT of water - upwards of 50 gallons or so. The moisture is both a robust ecosystem for the little buggies that break down the fibrous plant material they eat as well as a mechanical means of softening and breaking apart plant material. The result is that while they have other parts of their forestomach that specialize in retaining that water, a lot of it gets mixed with the end product and it keeps their cow bombs on the soft-serve side of the equation. That doesn't even take into account the fact that the housing conditions of cattle are akin to a daycare and that diarrhea from intestinal pathogens is a frequent occurrence. </p>
<p>FINAL EDIT: What started with me feeding my kid before my first cup of coffee is ending with me feeding my kid. I'm signing off for the night, but sincerely thanks to all of you. I've gotten a lot of seemingly heartfelt compliments today, something I can really use right now, and it's been a profound joy knowing that I was able to give the bulk of you a chuckle or 2 while you were finishing up your number 2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are some microorganisms that can still survive a trip to Mars, such as a well-known <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade" target="_blank">Tardigrade (Wiki)</a>. That's the main reason rovers avoid parts of the planet that contain water or ice - they can still carry Earth's life and contaminate it {<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-nasa-s-mars-rovers-are-banned-from-investigating-that-liquid-water" target="_blank">sciencealert.com</a>}.</p>
<p>So far all life-detecting tests done by rovers are interpreted as negative. If we find a sign of life on Mars, we will make sure it's not brought by us from Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Answering a few questions that keep repeating.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why do we refrain from contaminating Mars? Wouldn't that be an interesting experiment?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be, but before we do that, we want to make sure there is no native life on Mars that we might accidentally destroy (as we often do).  If we find micro-organisms there, it would be nice to study them without our own organisms getting in the way wherever we go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wouldn't a manned mission contaminate Mars?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will. Before we can send humans to Mars we will have to modify the rules of the Outer Space Treaty. Hopefully we can find life there before we send humans. If not, hopefully the first humans will find life. If we don't, it's pretty clear there is no life there. But we will not be colonizing and terraforming Mars until this question is answered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Shouldn't we search for life in water-rich zones, instead of the opposite?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, ideally we should, but because our rovers are not 100% clean, letting invasive life forms flourish in Mars's potentially already living waters, before we have a chance to at least send a few of them back to us, is just not worth it. On top of that, we don't need to check water contents to determine if Mars has life - the atmosphere and soil can give us enough clues to answer that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Don't we have the technology to sterilize things to 100%? Or are we that neglectful?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do have the technology, and we can use it with ease. The problem is that if you want to sterilize a circuit board, you end up frying it. One proposed idea is to build a rover on Mars with 3D printers, and sterilize all the necessary materials separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I was studying Antarctic yeast species, which live in cold, dry environments and are exposed to incredible amounts of uv radiation. In other words, very similar conditions to space.  Numerous studies have found that they in fact can survive in space, so it's entirely possible that other microbes could survive the trip to Mars. The yeast I studied ate rocks, do they may even be able to reproduce on Mars as well.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>When the mars rover went to mars were they able to remove all bacteria and small life from it?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, no. It is almost impossible to remove every single cell/spore from rovers.</p>
<p>Rovers are assembled in clean rooms (where the air is filtered), human contact is limited, surfaces are cleaned with alcohol and other harsh chemicals. Heat tolerant parts are heated to 110C (230F) and electronics are sealed. Surfaces are also regularly tested to determine bioburden levels <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/planetaryprotection/" target="_blank">(1)</a><a href="https://www.space.com/6136-mars-mission-contamination-big-concern.html" target="_blank">(2)</a>. Despite all the protocols, clean rooms are filthy (biologically speaking) and contain their own unique microbiological communities<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2007/070903/full/news070903-5.html" target="_blank">(3)</a><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/nasa-clean-room-contaminated-fungus" target="_blank">(4)</a>. </p>
<p>Earth life is pretty tough. Its for this reason that Martian rovers are not allowed to explore certain regions, why Cassini had to plunge into Saturn (To protect Enceladus and Titan), and why Juno has to plunge into Jupiter at the end of its mission (To protect Europa). There is always a risk that contamination may reach these planets</p>
<p>This idea forms the guiding principle of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_protection" target="_blank">Planetary Protection Protocols</a> . This is the idea that any interplanetary missions should do everything possible to prevent contamination. Scientists spend a <strong>long</strong> time calculating risk of contamination into excruciating detail. NASA set a minimum risk of contamination below 0.001&#37; and missions have to plan for 50 years after a mission ends.</p>
<p>The more we learn about microbes the crazier things gets and there is a lot of ongoing research into extremophiles. Microbes are really good at <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultraviolet-light-could-be-what-protects-alien-life-from-earth-bacteria" target="_blank">stowing away</a> on space craft. When microbes are stressed they can produce endospores**,** that allow them to survive the extreme conditions of space (massive temperature fluxes, low pressure, low nutrients, high radiation).  We also know microbes survive on the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/living-bacteria-from-outer-space-found-clinging-to-iss-alien-life" target="_blank">outside</a> of the space station. Also, microbes from Earth have been deliberately left on the outside and have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11039206" target="_blank">survived for up to 553 days !</a>. So space isn't as deadly as we imagine it to be, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_microorganisms_tested_in_outer_space#cite_note-:0-1" target="_blank">at least for microbes.</a></p>
<p>For the most recent Mars arrival, the Mars Trace Gas Orbiter (And Schiaparelli lander), there's a lot of info on how they minimised contamination <a href="http://exploration.esa.int/mars/57581-planetary-protection/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>So yes, it is possible that cells may reach these planets</p>
<p><strong>If not could any of the bacteria be able to live in the harsh conditions of mars?</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Mars_habitability" target="_blank">here</a> for modern Martian habitability. This is one of the fundamental questions of Astrobiological research.</p>
<p>There isn't an obvious answer to this one as there are many factors.</p>
<p>Your question is referring to <strong>Forward Contamination</strong>, meaning the risk of missions taking Earth Microbes to Mars.  Despite the super strict cleaning protocols and rigorous mission design, there is still a risk that a microbe may reach the surface of Mars. However, once its there its problems have only just begun. Conditions on Mars are pretty tough. The main problem for microbes is the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/uv-light-could-easily-kill-microbial-stowaways-mars" target="_blank">UV radiation</a>. Simulation studies have shown that 99.9&#37; of populations would be inactivated within a few seconds on Mars, and that within 1 day surfaces will be completely sterile(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103503002008" target="_blank">6</a>,<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00924210" target="_blank">7</a>).</p>
<p>Having said that, we know microbes are tough and there is always a risk that we don't know enough about the survivability of microbes to be sure we wont contaminate Mars. If microbes were to enter the soil, it is likely that they may be preserved from the sterilising UV radiation, (below the top few mm), and many simulation studies show microbes may survive within the soil  (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063312002334" target="_blank">7</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103563900241" target="_blank">8</a>, <a href="http://aem.asm.org/content/12/3/215.short" target="_blank">9</a>).</p>
<p>Potentially habitable regions of Mars are called <strong>Special regions</strong> and missions are currently prohibited from going near these regions. These regions include environments where liquid water exists and may have existed within the last 500 years <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2016.1472" target="_blank">(10)</a>.</p>
<p>If microbes piggy backed on a rover to Mars, it is likely that the contamination would be localised to the rover and the rover would be sterilised pretty soon after landing.  Sending microbes to Mars, in itself, isn't a bad thing. We just need to be sure they dont make it to the areas we know are habitable.</p>
<p>Some may survive, but to actually be active they require habitable conditions and need to be removed from the harsh radiation environment.</p>
<p><strong>And how do they obtain soil samples looking for bacteria if it could possibly be from the rover itself?</strong></p>
<p>So this is why its vitally important we do not forward contaminate Mars. An important thing to note is the majority of science is aimed at looking at evidence for past life. We know Mars was wet, warmer and had an atmosphere in its past and its much easier to identify biosignatures (whifs of life) than it is to identify something that is living, at least if we are doing it remotely.</p>
<p>The real question (as you have highlighted) would be is it definitely <strong>not</strong> Earth life. This is much harder and requires a rigorous methodology.</p>
<p>One way would be to identify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_signature" target="_blank">isotopic signatures</a> (different 'versions' of the same element) that we find in preserved material or in potentially living materials. For example, say that we have a bunch of cells, we could see what the isotopic signature of the biomass was. This biomass would be built of either Martian elements or Earth elements - which each have different isotopic signatures. However, to be accurate, we would need to analyse it on Earth.</p>
<p>In my mind, the simplest way would be to get genetic info on the microbe. If we managed to get genetic info on the Martian microbe, it would be pretty easy to tell whether it was related to Earth life or not. However there are complications. It is probable that Earth life may be quite similar to Martian life as Earth and Mars have exchanged material over their histories'(<a href="https://www.astrobio.net/mars/earth-and-mars-may-have-shared-seeds-of-life/" target="_blank">11</a>).</p>
<p>Ultimately all the questions you are asking are the questions that hundreds of scientists are asking themselves daily, and ultimately there is more that we <strong>don't know</strong> than we know. So we need to be careful. Answering the most fundamental question of 'are we alone?' requires a rigorous methodology so that we can be sure of the answer and this means preventing any form of contamination.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a word, no.</p>
<p>While certain gods came and went, and some were considered newer even when they were actually quite ancient, for the most part the gods that the Greeks worshiped remained, as far as this question is concerned, the same. Essentially their pantheon was inherited from the proto-indoeuropean roots much like their language. The gods that we are familiar with, Zeus and the like, have their roots in gods which, as far as we can tell, functioned very similarly based on PIE linguistics. Zeus and Jupiter (Roman equivalent) are both etymologically related to a reconstructed deity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyeus" target="_blank">Dyeus Phter</a> which just means &quot;sky daddy&quot;. This makes sense because they are both fatherly figures of the sky.</p>
<p>So where did all the titan stories come from? Well, a few places. For most of human history cultural information was passed down from generation to generation in the form of stories. It helps to have a compelling story to tell and, at times, certain embellishments can be made. Over the course of hundreds of generations and even more embellishments you will eventually wind up with a full fledged mythology. However, that does not mean that all of these stories are embellishments, strictly speaking. One of the interesting facets of Greek ritual observance is their willingness to adopt gods and appropriate their stories and fold them into their own mythologies. This is essentially what is happening at the beginning of Plato's Republic; it opens with a Greek festival to a foreign goddess. Over time, it becomes quite difficult to separate native stories from original stories from adopted ones.</p>
<p>So, were the titans worshiped before the gods? Perhaps, but not by the Greeks. However, it is also important to remember that some of the titans were worshiped with much the same vigor and veneration as the gods, they all had their ritual roles to play in the overarching mythology.</p>
<p>Addendum: It is also worth noting that some mythologies, such as some of the Roman origin stories, have ancient peoples that founders encounter worshiping deities such as Saturn. Instances such as this could really go either way, as a religion that got subsumed or as literary embellishment. However, most material evidence points to the extreme antiquity of much of the core pantheon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on exactly what you mean by the &quot;Greeks&quot;, that word is applied to a number of related civilization that existed in the region over about 3000 years.</p>
<p>The Minoans were the earliest, dating to about 2600 BC.  We don't know much about their gods, partly because their language remains undeciphered.  But it does appear to be centered around a sun goddess figure and bulls, and bears little relation to Classical Greek gods.  Part of their tradition may live on through the legend of King Minos and the Minotaur.</p>
<p>The Mycenaeans came about around a thousand years later, after the Bronze Age collapse.  Their gods are precursors to the well known Greek gods, but with many differences.  Poseidon appeared to be the most central figure and was the god of the depths of the earth, not of the sea.  Zeus existed, but was not the chief god, but merely the god of the sky.  Many gods of the Greek pantheon were missing, and others in the Mycenaean pantheon have no Greek equivalent.</p>
<p>The Archaic Greek period started about 800 BC, with the familiar pantheon.  Some speculate the Titans represent earlier shamanistic religions, in much the same way Easter, Halloween, and Yule are remnants of extinct European pagan religions.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For similar reasons that explain why a pot of water doesn't all turn to steam (well, vapor, then steam) at once. The change is a gradual progression.</p>
<p>So, air holds water. To an extent. Higher pressure air holds more water. Warmer air holds more water. The amount of water in the air is called the absolute humidity, but since different pressures and temperatures of air can hold different amounts of water, we refer to something called the relative humidity. Relative humidity is the amount of water that the air <em>is</em> holding compared to how much the air <em>can</em> hold at that temperature and pressure. This is referred to as a percentage of saturation.</p>
<p>So, let's say you have hot, wet air down by the ground (more pressure), and it's moving up into an area of cold air with less pressure, due both to the rise in elevation and the lower temperature (which decreases pressure). At the beginning, you had a certain amount of water in the air, that was the absolute humidity, but the air was able to hold it. That means that the absolute humidity was at or below 100% of what the air can hold (meaning relative humidity is at or below 100%). As you move the air up to the cold, low-pressure area, the air can hold less and less water. At some point the absolute humidity is going to surpass the air's ability to hold it. At this point water condenses, and drops fall.</p>
<p>Now, as the drops fall, they do gather more water and get bigger, but as they get bigger and faster they start breaking up again. This is why there is a limit to the size of drops that we see.</p>
<p>Now, the main reason that all of the water does not drop at once is because all of that change that I mentioned happens over time, not instantaneously. In order for all of the water to drop at once, you would need to instantly cool or depressurize a local region of atmosphere. Not only that, but all of the water molecules would have to be instantly teleported together into drops, since they were all spread out at first.</p>
<p>I hope that helps. I didn't go back and read what I wrote, so that may be kind of confusing.</p>
<p>Edit: I keep logging on to questions. I'm sorry if I confused you. It was an ELI5, but I had to draw the line and dumb it down somewhere. Some want more explanation, some want less. I tried, that's all I can say. But for those of you that keep telling me that I'm wrong about air pressure, or temperature, and amount of water in the air, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law" target="_blank">The ideal gas law</a>, and if you still disagree, then please go take some meteorology courses that may or may not help you understand the relation between a closed system and multiple open systems.</p>
<p>Edit 2: For all others, if you have a real question that you think I can answer, feel free to PM me. Reddit is a difficult place to explain anything more complicated without writing a book that no one will read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Updrafts cause rain.</p>
<p>Humid air gets raised up and up until it cools off enough to condense. Small rain droplets may not be big enough to overcome the updrafts, so they keep accumulating until they are big enough droplets to fall through the updrafts. The process is gradual so it takes some time to deplete your cloud, and there is never a case of a cloud just dropping all of its water in an instant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure why it doesn't all fall at once, but the reason a storm can continuously drop rain as it rolls across a state is because the inflow of the storm is constantly picking up moist air.</p>
<p>Storms aren't just a cloud of water, they are a complex system of air currents that allows the storm to continually recharge. The storm only dies out when it outpaces this system of air currents (or the air currents dwindle due to day/night cycles).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Sponges don't drop all of their water out at once. Even if you squeeze it very quickly, it still takes a certain amount of time for you to gradually squeeze the sponge. </p>
<p>The atmospheric pressures and temperatures are like a slow-squeezing fist. Fast and heavy storms, when rain falls with heavier drops and seems to be faster, the change in atmospheric conditions happened more quickly, like you squeezing the sponge faster. </p>

<p>past supernovae and kilonovae produced a lot of these elements. Just this past discovery of the colliding neutron stars that got a lot of news for its gravitational wave, it produced  <del>solar</del> many earth masses of gold. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most important thing though is turbulent mixing in the interstellar medium. This process mixes heavy elements in a very short timescale. So effectively there's pretty much of the same relative abundance of the same periodic table elements everywhere. Astronomers routinely just used a term called metallicity Z to describe the content of heavy element relative to the sun. </p>
</li>
<li>However, have we lived in an elliptical galaxy,  or some region of the halo of a galaxy, there are chances that the relative pattern might be different for alpha elements. This is because of the population of stars that could be different. More type I vs type II supernovae could change this. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The miniature effects for the space craft are all very slow, which gives them weight and believability. These effects were ground breaking and it wasn’t until Star Wars 8 years later that broke new ground in the addition of speed and action, that subsequently made visual effects much more accessible. You may like the look and feel of Silent Running (1972) as well, the effects are great for the time.</p>
<p>That said I think it looks like a 60’s movie because of the fashions within from dress to hair. Also a lot of the occupations are stereotypical for the decade. For example the service industry jobs within from waiters to air hosts are all female. All of the executive and scientific roles are male. </p>
<p>That’s not a slight on it all, I love the movie and expect to see cultural trends from the period it was made in.</p>
<p>There is also no electronic/synthesized music, which was very popular for 90’s sci-fi. The orchestral soundtrack for sci-fi is mostly only seen in pre synth times and Star Wars movies as Lucas rightly prefers John Williams’ approach to action.</p>
<p>I could ramble on about this all day, as it’s such a good cinematic experience, but I’ll stop here. Great question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The New Yorker answered almost exactly this question in an article a few weeks ago:</p>
<p>“By rendering a not-too-distant future, Kubrick set himself up for a test: thirty-three years later, his audiences would still be around to grade his predictions. Part of his genius was that he understood how to rig the results. Many elements from his set designs were contributions from major brands—Whirlpool, Macy’s, DuPont, Parker Pens, Nikon—which quickly cashed in on their big-screen exposure. If 2001 the year looked like ‘2001’ the movie, it was partly because the film’s imaginary design trends were made real.”</p>
