		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The placenta is actually only formed by the blastocyst  (very early fetus) so is 100% fetal DNA.</p>
<p>The placenta acts as an exchange for maternal nutrients to the embryo. The blood vessels of the mother bury into the placenta and pass very closely to the fetal blood vessels which allows for the exchange over the vessels. This allows the mother to give all yhe oxygen, nutrients and immunity to the baby while it is in the womb. The mother also has a reduced immune system during pregnancy which prevents most possible immune reactions.</p>
<p>However,  sometimes a mother can be &quot;sensitised&quot; to the fetal blood. This happens when mother who has a specific blood type, called rhesus D negative, comes into contact with blood that is rhesus D positive. The mother's immune system will create antibodies to the D positive blood (because her body has never encountered D positive blood and treats it as an &quot;invader&quot;, like your body would treat a bacteria). The exposure to the Rhesus D positive blood most often happens during a first child birth. If the same mother were to have a second child that was also rhesus D positive, her immune system would recognise the same &quot;invader&quot; as last time and will create antibodies to fight it. These antibodies are small enough to cross over the boundaries between the maternal blood vessels and the fetal blood vessels. Once the antibodies are in the fetal circulation, they attack the fetus' red blood cells which carry the Rhesus D positive marker.</p>
<p>To stop that from happening, a rhesus D negative mother needs an injection after giving birth to stop her body making antibodies against the blood she may have been exposed to in childbirth</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the mother becomes pregnant a protein called glycodelin is released in huge quantity around the growing child. This acts as an immunosuppresent since as you say, half the DNA of the foetus is foreign.  Immunosuppresents function to minimise effects of the immune system by restricting its activity. Glycodelin has been shown to actually induce apoptosis (programmed cell death, basically a 'tidy' way of getting rid of a cell in a managed way) in activated T cells, which are one of the components of the immune system. </p>
<p>There may be other factors at play too, but this is my field and I know this effect to be significant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has actually been a question that has long perplexed medical researchers...and the truth is, it still isn't fully known. But fairly recently (2012) it was discovered that when the embryo implants in the uterus, it sets off a process that ultimately turns off a key pathway required for the immune system to attack foreign bodies. As a result, immune cells are never recruited to the site of implantation, and therefore don't attack and cannot harm the developing fetus. </p>
<p>A central feature of the body's immune system's defense against foreign tissues and pathogens is the production of chemokines as a result of localized inflammatory response. These chemokines recruit various kinds of immune cell, including T cells, which accumulate and attack the 'intruder'. The chemokine-mediated recruitment of activated T cells is an integral part of the immune response. During pregnancy, the foreign antigens of the developing embryo/fetus and the placenta come into direct contact with cells of the mother's immune system, but fail to evoke the typical tissue rejection response (what causes some organ transplants to fail, and the reason for the need for anti-rejection meds). </p>
<p>Professor of Pathology and lead investigator in several studies in this area, Adrian Erlebacher, MD, PhD, along with his research team, found that the T cells, poised to attack the fetus as a foreign body, were unable to perform their intended role. This prompted them to wonder if there were some sort of barrier or obstruction preventing the T cells from reaching the fetus. They turned their studies to the decidua, a specialized structure that encases the fetus and placenta, and there they found the answers. </p>
<p>The onset of pregnancy causes the genes responsible for recruiting T cells and other immune system cells to the sites of inflammation to be turned off in the decidua. As a result, T cells are not able to accumulate inside the decidua, and are therefore unable to attack the placenta and fetus. Implantation of the embryo changed the packaging of certain chemokines in the nuclei of the decidua's stromal cells. The change in the DNA packaging &quot;silences&quot; the chemokine genes, and as a consequence the chemokines are not expressed and the T cells not recruited. </p>
<p>They further posited that inappropriate regulation of this process could cause inflammation and the accumulation of immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface, which could then be the source of complications including preterm labor, spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), preeclampsia, and a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A more aerodynamic shape would help fuel efficiency some, but not that much for two reasons. First, buses don't travel that fast and drag (air resistance in this case) becomes a bigger deal at higher velocity. </p>
<p>Second, there are two different types of drag: drag from pushing air out of the way and drag from air passing over the surface of the vehicle. For a short car, there isn't much surface for air to pass over so pretty much all of the drag comes from pushing air out of the way. That's also the sort of drag an aerodynamic shape helps with. For a long vehicle like a bus, drag from air passing over its surface area is a bigger deal. There's still more overall drag on a bus from having to push air out of the way, but skin drag is a much bigger component than it is for cars. This makes the drag from having to push air out of the way in the front less important for buses.</p>
<p>Those are just reasons why an aerodynamic shape won't help a bus as much, though; they're not reasons to not do it. The reason buses are designed with a flat front is that it maximizes volume and a flat front and window allow the driver to see better, especially when turning. The increased space and visibility are more important than any small increase in efficiency from a more aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>tl;dr - Buses benefit less from aerodynamics because of their long shape and they would be hurt by a more aerodynamic shape because a flat front maximizes space and driver visibility.</p>
<p>Edit: In response to the multiple comments saying that some buses go fast, we know that. But most buses do not and when buses are designed it's usually not clear exactly how they'll be used. And even for the ones that get on the freeway, the flat front is better for volume and for turning once the bus inevitably leaves the freeway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interior space efficiency is more important than exterior aerodynamic profile in busses as they generally travel at low speed. Aerodynamic drag increases as the square of velocity, so at low speeds it is less important. A more aerodynamic nose shape generally requires an overall &quot;pointier&quot; shape, which means you can generally fit less into it inside. This space could be used to fit more seats, so the bus can haul more people in the same foorprint. So at a low speed where aerodynamic drag is almost negligible, interior packaging profile is prioritized. It's also a maintenance issue. Flat parts are also easy and cheap to both make and replace, much more so than contoured aerodynamic shapes. Busses hit things and get hit fairly often, so having cheap exterior panels is a big plus. Long haul and tour busses that travel for extended times at speed make more of an effort at aerodynamics, by adding some rake angle to the forward face and having more contoured panels. But the lower the speed the bus operates at, the higher the priority of packaging and ease of construction/maintenance, hence simple flat faced city busses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If transit buses were built like school buses the nose would swing way into oncoming traffic when making turns. Flat front buses have the front wheels behind the driver and closer to the rear axle so the turning radius is greatly reduced.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All vehicles have a maximum design length, width, and height. </p>
<p>A bus's primary purpose is to transport as many people as possible, fuel efficiency is much further down the list. </p>
<p>Buses are designed to have the largest volume you can drive safely on most roads without special consideration.  That's why they're low-riding boxes on wheels.  </p>
<p>Designers do their best on fuel efficiency through the motor, but aerodynamics at sub-40mph are really negligible anyway.  Carving out triangles to gain aerodynamic efficiency is taking away from storage, seating, or engine space, which is the whole reason your customer bought the bus in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a business standpoint, how exactly does it help your company more than a &quot;no BS&quot; policy would?</p>
<p>A customer is unreasonable and/or abusive, and makes a complaint. Despite evidence of the opposite (including cameras and other employee witnesses), why does HR or management always opt to punish the employee rather than ban the customer? Alternatively, why are abusive, destructive, or otherwise problem-causing customers given free stuff or discounts and invited to return to cause the same problems?</p>
<p>I don't know much about how things work on the HR side, but I feel like it takes more time, energy, and money to hire, train, write tax info for, and fire employees rather than to just ban or refuse to bend over backwards for an unreasonable customer. All you have to say is &quot;no&quot; and lose out on that $1000 or so that customer might bring every year rather than spend twice that much on a high turnover rate.</p>
<p>I know multibillion dollar companies are famous for this in the sense that they don't want to &quot;lose customers&quot;, but there are plenty of mom and pop or independently owned stores that take a &quot;no BS&quot; policy with customers and still stand strong on the business end. </p>
<p>Where did the idea of catering to customers no matter what start, and is there a possibility that it might end?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this question confuses 'The Customer is Always Right' with 'Customer abuse of Employees'.  Those have always been two separate things.  I'm speaking from the experience of working at Customer Service Desks at two different supermarkets:  Whole Foods and Wegmans.</p>
<p>'The Customer is Always Right' is the general approach to a customer complaint or concern.  There are a couple of things going on.  First, if it is a matter of bad product, the cost of the product in question is usually trivial compared to the buying power of any given customer.  So if someone comes in with a dozen eggs and says one is cracked, I would tell them to go get another one and mark it paid.  I don't know if it cracked in their car going home or it was cracked in the store, but it doesn't matter.  I just spent a few dollars to make that customer spend a lot more dollars in the future.  </p>
<p>Could that system be abused?  Yes.  And people do abuse it.  It happened on occasion that someone would buy prepared food and eat it in the store, but return to the customer service desk with half a plate and complain the food was bad.  Of course you know they're angling for a free meal.  But again it is risk/reward.  The cost of appeasing an abuser is usually less than the cost of accidentally rejecting a real complaint.  It also serves to get that customer out of the store as quickly as possible.  If they create a scene, it will make other customers unhappy too.</p>
<p>Another case is an angry customer.  Either they felt like they were treated rudely, or bad product had ruined some plans, or any of a myriad of reasons.  'The Customer is Always Right' in this scenario means deescalation.  You need to resolve the anger first before resolving the issue.  The quickest way to get this done is appeasement and empathy.  Tell them you understand and you apologize and that they're right:  it never should have happened.  You invite a manager into the mix - which also has the benefit of outnumbering them.  People shopping in supermarkets often don't want to be there.  Go in with the assumption that someone is having a bad day and you're usually right.  If you can make them happy and they leave happy, well then you're the one bright spot in the otherwise crappy day.  This brings them back to the store tomorrow.</p>
<p>'Employee Abuse,' however, was NEVER tolerated in any place I worked.  Cursing out an employee, yelling and screaming, inappropriate behavior (I had one guy lie down on the service desk as if to take a nap once), or anything physical would get a customer escorted out of the store.  At Wegmans, that would have involved a cop and Whole Foods had their own security.  Whenever a customer got abusive, the customer was always wrong.  It's a health and safety issue at that point.  And yes, people do get banned for life.  Both stores also have their own 'inventory control' people:  essentially undercover shoppers looking for shoplifters or scammers.  You didn't want to confront shoplifters yourself, but notify a manager who would notify these folks (we rarely if ever knew who they were).  </p>
<p>Why does this work at big retail chains and not Mom and Pop stores?  It's really economy of scale.  Large retail stores are making a lot more money per transaction and doing a whole lot more of them, such that they can absorb the cost of a 'Customer is Always Right' policy.  And in the end, you encourage people to return and spend more money with the policy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some decent posts here but I think one key thing is missing.</p>
<p>As a business owner, you do not control the impact that a dissatisfied customer has on your business when he or she recounts the experience. A customer can be 100% wrong in their interaction with a business. You could ban that customer or simply ask him or her to leave. However, when they go out into the world and recount their experience to their friends and family, those people will only hear the customer's side of the story. You as a business owner don't get a seat at they table to explain what actually happened. This can easily dissuade other people from visiting your business and buying from you. </p>
<p>So it often makes sense to placate a customer who is not &quot;right.&quot; That customer leaves satisfied and may even realize later upon further reflection that he was being a jerk. If he ever recounts his experience to another person, his story is now unequivocally positive. &quot;Man I was super pissed off the other day after a long day at work. Went to Mike's tacos, and I accidentally ordered the wrong thing. When the waitress brought it I was kind of snotty and told her she better fix it. She did it with a smile even though I was being a dick. She went out of her way to try and give me a good experience. Those are good people at Mike's Tacos.&quot;</p>
<p>Word of mouth is extremely important for local businesses and really any place that has direct customer interaction. Since you can't control the customer's message to the outside world, sometimes it is worth taking a small loss of a rude or wrong customer to help your reputation. This doesn't excuse those people for being assholes, but it is the reality of doing retail business. </p>
<p>This doesn't always apply and some customers can really take advantage of satisfaction policies. Repeat bad customs are often banned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So instead please refer to the original answer below as the most USEFUL version of the phrase, rather than the original. </p>
<hr />
<p>The &quot;customer is always right&quot; is an often abused and misunderstood sentiment.</p>
<p>The &quot;customer is always right&quot; originally meant that what the customer wants (and thus buys) is more important than what you think.</p>
<p>For instance, you're a shoe store. You stock green boots, black boots, and pink boots. Green is your favorite color. You always wear green boots.</p>
<p>However, your customers only buy black and pink boots. Those green boots sit dead on your shelf, but you keep stocking them. Even when you could be using that money to stock more black and pink boots.</p>
<p>The customer is always right means it doesn't matter that you like green boots. Buy more black and pink and suck it up.</p>
<p>The saying got twisted through misunderstanding into some kind of customer service truism that it was never intended as.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Not surprisingly, the party mostly responsible for this has been... consumers. We live in an entitled culture. (In the West, anyhow. Sometimes the rest of the world isn't so lucky.)</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century and before, shopping for a lot of items was not a self service affair. You were helped by a salesperson or shopkeeper, who was counted on to be more or less knowledgeable about whatever the product in question may be. Even if that item was mundane (a sack of flour, or a pound of nails) it was probably located behind a counter or in a storeroom or otherwise inaccessible. Naturally the customer would tend to turn to this person for advice, particularly with goods like clothing. &quot;The customer is always right&quot; really means that despite what the salesperson's opinion or prior experience may be, he should ultimately sell the customer what they ask for. Regardless of how silly or unfashionable it may look on them, or if there is a higher quality version or another product that would earn a fatter commission, whatever -- if the customer wants a specific item, that is what you sell them.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the 1960's and 1980's, possibly due to the rise of chain stores, corporate culture, and the possibility for bad word of mouth to spread fast and far via the telephone, TV, nationally syndicated letters to the editor, etc. this got twisted around to the current &quot;bend over backwards and do anything to prevent the customer from complaining&quot; compulsion. That's what everyone thinks it means now, but that's not what it originally meant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shape you recognize as common to all those aircraft is done entirely for stealth. Specifically, radar signature, though many factors come into play.</p>
<p>If you were designing for aerodynamics alone, you wouldn't bury the engines or have anything but a short round inlet in front of them. Engines don't want to be buried or forced to suck through a straw. That's why commercial aircraft, which care about efficiency and performance above all else, look the way they do. </p>
<p>But, since round holes are fantastic radar scattering sources, and so are fan blades...low radar observability is achieved by hiding the engine face(s) and shaping the inlet aperture so that it has particularly-shaped edges. Everything you're seeing about a modern fighter inlet is a way of achieving other objectives while (hopefully) compromising aerodynamic performance as little as possible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a repeat of previous comments, but yeah, the general inlet shape is  to reduce the radar cross section (RCS) of the aircraft (i.e. make it stealthier). As Raymer (Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach, 4th Ed.) explains, &quot;One of the largest contributions to airframe RCS occurs any time a relatively flat surface of the aircraft is perpendicular to the incoming radar beam....Aircraft cavities such as inlet front faces and engine exhausts create a radar return perpendicular to the plane of the opening. All around the opening there will be small perpendicular bounces. When the threat radar is at a direction perpendicular to the opening, those small bounces will be 'in phase' and so will sum to a single large return. This is avoided by sweeping the plane of the opening well away from the expected directions of threat radars, as can be seen on the F-22, B-1B, F/A-18E and other designs. To further reduce this RCS contribution, the inlet lips are often treated with radar absorbers.&quot; </p>
<p>(As a side note, this is why early stealth planes, like the F-117, look so funky and angular. They are designed to avoid faces perpendicular to expected threat radar. As computing power increased in aircraft design, smoother shapes could be made that would achieve the same purpose.)</p>
<p>In another section, Raymer goes on to explain, &quot;Other huge contributors to the RCS for a conventional aircraft are the inlet and exhaust cavities. Radar energy gets into these cavities, bounces off the engine parts, and sprays back out the cavity towards the threat radar. Also, these cavities represent additional surface discontinuities [surface discontinuities are prone to accumulating and discharging radar energy]...More recent stealth designs allow the radar energy into the inlet duct but use [radar absorbing materials] to absorb it as described above [RAMs will absorb some but not all the radar energy so you want to make sure that it will bounce off several RAM-coated surfaces so the signal will be too weak to be picked up.] Also, if the radar energy is allowed inside, some provision must be made for hiding any direct view of the engine front face from the outside. This can be done by extreme snaking of the duct, or by putting curved vanes or an onion-shaped bulb in front of the engine.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The B-2 Spirit is arguably the most stealth aircraft currently flying and has a similar gap under its top air intakes. The B-2 sucks the boundary layer into this gap for two reasons. The boundary layer is over expanded and cold. And sucking it off from the wing improves aerodynamic efficiency by minimizing drag created by this turbulent air. The boundary layer is mixed with the B-2's exhaust before it is expelled, reducing infrared signature. So this gap between intake and fuselage serves, in stealth aircraft, to minimize IR signature, and improve aerodynamic efficiency by pumping the boundary layer off the fuselage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason for the small and wedge looking air intakes on supersonic jets is to induce a series of oblique shock-waves instead of a normal shock-wave. When the air intakes are designed this way it creates a series of oblique shock-waves that slow down the air that enters the turbines and prevents a shock-wave from damaging the turbine. Basically the air needs to be subsonic for the turbine to work and the only way to slow down the air when flying at supersonic speeds is to use shock-waves. Also, the gap in between the fuselage and the intake is to prevent turbulent boundary layer air from entering the intake. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It is about attention and media coverage and creating a groundswell.  You hope by having 100 people show up you get 5000 to write their congressman.

<li>
<p>In most of the case the government, the corporation, the whatever don't give a shit about protest. I've read that there is like 1500 demonstration a year in Paris, obviously most of them are 3 hippies asking for piece and free love or 2 nazi asking to deport the <del>jews</del> muslim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big protests  are a place where some people go for the festive aspect, teenager having an excuse to skip school, student going there to smoke pot and ask for the peace, worker bored of the machine wanting to do something else, and demonstration are full of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6_7Mbp76jU" target="_blank">happy people singing for a better world</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big protest are a place for political activist to do some networking, <em>you are interested in global warming, that's great we're organizing a conference where African peasant will talk about how the climate change affect them</em>  which let political group hiring new members and spreading their ideas (As I became older during demonstrations I don't buy drugs to a weird punk but books from various think-tanks) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a way for parties and union to show their relative strength which is important for the various elections </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are representing 1 000 000 people who accept to leave their home to go protesting on Sunday morning you have a certain credibility to talk in the medias and can at least get appointment with government officials, sometimes it's possible to negotiate something sometimes nothing, As an elected body you have to think about these 1 000 000 voters</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, it really doesn't, and that's rarely talked about. We notice when it does, and notice less when it doesn't (which is more often), which through confirmation bias leads us to (wrongly) believe that it's a lot more effective than it is, and more often.</p>
<p>In reality, protest of any kind needs to be unusually prominent (usually meaning very large scale) or sustained or widespread to get meaningful attention from anyone who's in any position to effect any actual change that it calls for. Most of the time, it's reported on the news but shrugged off by decision-makers as just a bit of whining (which, let's be honest, is often the case), if they even know about it at all (which they often don't).</p>
<p>In terms of energy and time invested to meaningful gain derived, public protest is often the least efficient way possible to get desired results. However, it does have its place, so I'm not knocking it. Just pointing out that as a go-to tactic, it's usually (but not always) misguided.</p>
<p>Decision-makers will commonly tune out small-scale protest as fringe-group whinging. Because, as I said, if often is. To get real results, you need at least the implication of a large-scale movement of some kind -- something sufficient to have real democratic effect. Decision-makers aren't doing this because they're assholes who don't care, but because let's face it, humanity as a whole is kind of childish and reactive, and they're trying to deal with it the way parents do. If you jump every single time the two-year-old screams, you'll never get anything done, and the kid will never figure out how to solve things on their own.</p>
<p>There must be reasonable balance between what's really called for and what's just someone's bored complaining. College kids, especially, are very good for manufacturing drama. (Anyone tempted to downvote me for saying that, spend a few years living in the shadow of any urban college, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.) There's even a very reliable market built around that well-known effect: Glenn Beck didn't schedule and publicise a book event walking distance from Brown because he was unaware that they'd likely protest it. He was counting on that free marketing, and he got it.</p>
<p>None of which is to say that protest is pointless or that decision-makers are all good and decent people. Some protest really does work, and plenty of decision-makers are assholes who need it. But by and large, the majority of protest I've ever seen is cathartic street theatre with little or no productive value, and sometimes the opposite. If the public's not largely already on your side, you can earn a lot of new opposition by blocking roads and irritating people.</p>
<p>Historically, public protest was a show of force, demonstrating that large numbers of citizens were ready to Do Something about something they objected to. Before modern times, that had real and immediate political effect because it was, in essence, a possible rehearsal for civil unrest and violence. For the better part of a couple centuries, though, it's pretty much inconceivable that any mass of people could really threaten 'government' in the way that they used to. What <em>is</em> true in our time, though -- and wasn't in those earlier times -- is that <em>very</em> large-scale protest demonstrates a very real <em>democratic</em> threat, and is therefore taken seriously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>As far as I can tell, people block personally identifiable information from pictures out of respect for people it would help identify. When you post a picture on the Internet you have to assume it will be available for <strong>all to see</strong> for <strong>all eternity</strong> (an oversimplification but you get the point). And although a situation can seem very innocuous, the fact that a given vehicle can be identified as being at a specific location at even an approximate time can have a huge effect on some people's lives.</p>
<p>Governments can use this kind of information to track people. In (civil) court cases this can be used to prove a person's location at a given time - this could be used in divorce cases, for example.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spiders are a diverse order, with close to 50,000 described species in more than 100 families, so there is no answer to this question that will apply to all spiders.  Any particular spider's preferred temperature will depend on a variety of factors, including its habitat (climate, substrates, etc.) and its predatory habits.  Some species prefer warmer temperatures (examples: <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.13156/arac.2007.14.1.45" target="_blank"><em>Pardosa</em> species</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3543678?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Phrurolithus festivus</em>, <em>Euophrys frontalis</em></a>) while others prefer cooler temperatures (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2435.1997.00040.x/full" target="_blank"><em>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</em></a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3543678?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Stemonyphantes lineatus</em></a>, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3543911?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Agelenopsis aperta</em></a>, <a href="http://www3.uah.es/pedrovillar/Docencia/Ecologia%20Grado%20Biologia/Archivos/Articulos%20para%20practicas%20de%20campo/Seleccion%20de%20habitat/Seleccion%20de%20habitat%20por%20arana.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Oecobius navus</em></a>).  It's also worth pointing out that as ectotherms, many spiders adjust their behavior/location to gain heat when they are too cold but will also adjust to lose heat when they are too warm.</p>
<p>If you're wondering whether spiders will instinctively move into the warmth of your house during cold weather, the answer is generally &quot;no.&quot;  Even for species that have a preference for higher temperatures, spiders that live outdoors are generally well-adapted to deal with weather swings, and will endure the cold rather than move into a completely different ecosystem where they are likely to have difficulty finding food and water.  There is little overlap between the lists of species that are commonly found in/around people's homes and those that live outdoors in nearby natural areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be worth pointing out that spiders (like any other animal) have more than one motivation. And heat means more than one thing.</p>
<p>Their prey might prefer heat, which in turn means their preferred hunting / webbing grounds are near heat. It might also simply be the difference between a temperature that keeps their prey active and a temperature that keeps their prey dormant.</p>
<p>Heat can mean the difference between liquid water and frozen water. Even though spiders get most of their moisture from their prey, they can and do drink.</p>
<p>Heat means temperature differential. Temperature differential means air currents. Spiders that build webs in particular like air currents because building their web in a current is like putting a neat in a stream.</p>
<p>Anyway my point is that even if they're attracted to warmer areas, it might not be the heat itself that attracts the spider. Also people don't realize just how many spiders there are around us. Even if just a tiny number wander into homes by accident, it'll make you think spiders are seeking it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you have any examples for this? Most things in the world today require you to put your trust in someone else who is an expert, or require you to become an expert yourself.</p>
<p>Consider the concept of the solar system. I absolutely believe that there are 8 planets (and Pluto), but I have only personally seen four of them. I'm choosing to trust astronomers and scientists and physicists who tell me that there are more, and I have no issue with that trust, but there's always a possibility that they are lying. </p>
<p>Throw in 20 years of action/crime/drama movies where nothing is ever what it seems, and huge organizations all have agendas and manipulating the herd is how people get ahead, and then remove a great education that teaches you to think critically and you can end up with a natural distrust of everyone who isn't exactly like yourself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Opinions seem to be tied very closely to people's identities.  So if you provide people with data that refutes their claims or beliefs, they would have to admit that the premise on which they've based their identity, their purpose, and their goals we're all a sham.  I dont think people consciously have this thought.  I believe it's an automatic psychological defense mechanism. </p>
<p>There is something called the 'Back fire effect.'  Check it out here. <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/" target="_blank">https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/</a></p>
<p>It basically states that when you present proof suggesting a person's opinion to be other than correct, they will grow more convicted in their views.  Basically the opposite of science!</p>
<p>What really boggles my mind is when I see this behavior in college educated people.  Not because I believe non-college educated people are less intelligent.  Far from it actually.  But a college degree, more than anything, should confer upon a person proof to society that they know <em>how</em> to think.  That is to say that I hold them to a higher level of responsibility, that their opinions should be backed by facts, with room to be flexible should new facts be presented to them.  In practice, proof (however it is presented) should affect a person's conclusion.  But unfortunately, that is applies to theory more than reality. </p>
<p>I see this mostly happen mostly with political views.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I had 2 conversations with a 20 year old delivery driver the other day. In the first he was absolutely DUMBFOUNDED that Hawaii was a state and not a continent/country.</p>
<p>In the second I had to explain that germs cause sickness, not cold weather. Cold weather will weaken your immune system to some extent but you need to get germs in your body to get sick. He basically just said he didn't believe me, then when he saw me wearing a light jacket the next time I went out for a cigarette he said &quot;cold huh?&quot; in a very snarky tone.</p>
<p>This is what you get when you combine the NYC public school system, a lack of interest, and an already &quot;not the sharpest razor in the cookie jar&quot; kinda person.</p>
<p>On the plus side, after explaining the germ thing further he did say &quot;learn something new every day!&quot; so I think he knew I wasn't looking down on him. I hope this doesn't come across as hubris or a holier than thou up on a high horse kind of mentality but I feel like it's partially on me to help get him interested in learning these basic sorts of things. It's up to you too, assuming you can do it without being condescending. I can't speak for anyone else but if someone explains something well to me that I previously didn't understand, or gives me evidence that disproves something I already believed, I always appreciate it. I think most people do as long as the other party isn't being a jerk about it.</p>
<p>I guarantee that a large percentage of people who cling to these falsehoods do so because there's an animosity toward people who talk to them like they're stupid for believing it in the first place. I'd wager there's a ton of people reading this who still think urine is sterile. You're not stupid, you just never double checked. That's ok, cuz guess what? You learn something new every day!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The coaxial (cable)/twisted pair (ADSL) leaves your house and goes to a building that's nearby (a mileish) called a Central Office (CO). These cables are buried underground, usually down the street in front of your house or alleyway, or carried on poles if you get your telephone or cable that way.  </p>
<p>In the CO all of the copper lines from all of the houses in the area come together and are plugged into some devices there. The step from the local office to your house is called the &quot;last mile&quot;.</p>
<p>These devices detect amplitude (how big) and/or frequency (how often) changes in the voltage on the line and convert it into digital data (ones and zeros). This process is called demodulation. </p>
<p>From here your data is lumped together with all the other data coming into the CO and sent over a fibre optic line, usually buried under the street or hung on a pole, to a big data center where your ISP's routers are. Fibre optics can go very far, so there are usually only a few of these big data centers in a city. These data centers are physically connected to one another with buried fibre optic cables, and then one or more of the data centers in each city are directly connected to one or more of the data centers in neighbouring cities. So the fibre goes from your neighbourhood CO a mile or so away to a much bigger building somewhere in the city, which then has connections to other data centers in the city and in neighbouring cities.</p>
<p>Electrical signals are converted into light using a transceiver. The light then bounces down the fibre optic line to the transceiver on the other end, where it's turned back into electrical signals.</p>
<p>In the data center your ISP's routers look at the data. Routers are responsible for moving data between different networks. They look at the destination IP address and figure out which IP network the data is destined for. Then they look at these big tables (500,000+ entries) that match each IP network to an ISP based on the ISP's autonomous system number (ASN), which is how the internet sees an ISP. You see &quot;Verizon&quot;, the internet sees ASN 701. Having it's own ASN, and having a copy of the table listing all of the IP network to ASN assignments is basically what makes an ISP an ISP (well, that and connecting to other ISPs). Once the router knows which ASN the data has to go to, it looks for the edge router that is closest to the destination ASN, and then sends the data bouncing through its data centers, city by city, until it gets to that edge router. More about edge routers later.</p>
<p>ISPs connect to one another by burying fibre optic cable from one of their own data centers to an internet exchange (IX), which is a place where a bunch of other ISPs have agreed to drag fibre lines to as well. For obvious reasons, ISPs will also just designate one of their own data centers a Point of Presence (POP) and &quot;allow&quot; other ISPs to bring fibre cables there and rent rack space in the building. </p>
<p>ISPs themselves, or companies that specialize in this, will also sometimes bury cables directly between IXs and POPs that are far apart (e.g. on different continents). These connections can be very, very long and very, very expensive. They will bury it over land or sea, farmland, forest, mountain, coral reef or deep ocean. These lines are usually one big continuous unbroken link, minus a few repeaters/amplifiers/regenerators which keep the signal strength up, and go for thousands of miles. </p>
<p>In an IX or POP, which is basically a warehouse, each ISP is given space on computer racks in the building. So your ISP has brought their fibre optic cable hundreds of miles from their data center to the IX or POP and routed it through the building to their racks. They then place their edge router in the rack and hook up their backhaul fibre cable to it. A physical fibre optic or copper cable is then ran from your own ISPs edge router, through the building, to the other ISPs edge router, which is connected to its own long distance fibre cable back to that ISP's data centers. <del>And that's how babies are made</del></p>
<p>Edge routers tell whatever ISP they are connected to which IP networks your ISP owns, and then, importantly, they also usually say which additional ISPs your ISP is connected to as well.</p>
<p>ISPs will then sign agreements between themselves regarding how much, if anything, they will charge one another for data going between them, and whether or not they are allowed to send data only to that particular ISP, or if they are allowed to also send to ISPs that THAT ISP is connect to as well. This is called peering.</p>
<p>It should go without saying, this is a huge simplification and stereotypification of something that can go a billion different ways.</p>
<p>One usual variation is that there are companies that specialize in burying fibre optic lines between IXs and POPs, so that if ISP A wants to talk directly to ISP B, but is far away from ISP B, they can pay to use part of one of these companies fibre lines to get from an IX where ISP A is to an IX where ISP B is, rather than paying to construct their own long distance cable.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> I realize this is more of a ELI 1st year college student... but there you go...</p>
<p><em>Second Edit</em> Obligatory thank you for the gold, kind stranger. May your internet be forever fast and reliable...</p>
<p><em>Third Edit(s)</em> Good points from some great folks that newer implementations of DSL move the aggregation point (where your DSL line ends and your data is sent onwards over fibre optics) much closer to you and it is likely just a cabinet down the block. This makes things faster for you. Also remembered what a CMTS was, corrected a few typos, and added a few terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is complicated.  There are lots of different things going on at the same time.</p>
<p>The analogy with letters by /u/Atzen doesn't really match how it works, unfortunately.  It's a little more like phone numbers and a phone book.  But I'm going to strip out the analogies.</p>
<p><strong>DNS:</strong>  Let's start with typing in something like <a href="http://www.example.com/cheese.html" target="_blank">http://www.example.com/cheese.html</a> into your browser.  A certain part of that, www.example.com, is the <em>domain name</em> which tells you which computer has what you're looking for.  But the domain name is not enough, it's like knowing a person's name.  What you really want is something like a phone number or address.  The post office doesn't know how to deliver a letter to &quot;Joe&quot; and the phone company doesn't know how to route a call to &quot;Joe&quot; either.  So the first step is to look www.example.com up in a directory and you get an IP address, like 192.168.200.5.  Now you can send packets of data to that address.</p>
<p><strong>Routing:</strong> So your computer sends a packet to 192.168.200.5.  Let's say your computer has an address of 10.1.2.3.  First, it checks if the address is on your network.  Maybe your network has addresses like 10.X.Y.Z, but 192.168.200.5 doesn't look like that, so your computer needs to send the packet to a router that will send it to the right network.  Maybe the router has address 10.0.0.1.  So your computer sends a packet to 10.0.0.1, with the instructions &quot;please send this to 192.168.200.5 for me&quot;.</p>
<p>Your router is dumb, and only knows that it should send everything over your internet connection to your ISP.</p>
<p>At your ISP, there are some smarter routers.  One of them will get the packet, and look at it, and say, &quot;I know where the 192.168 network is, I'll send it that way.&quot;  Your ISP isn't connected directly to that network, so it takes a few hops and visits a couple more routers along the way.  Later on, a router might say, &quot;192.168, that's me! Actually, 192.168.200 is its own network, but I know where that is&quot;.  Eventually, you'll get to the 192.168.200 network, and the router will just send your packet straight to its destination.  Each router only has a little bit of information.</p>
<p>(There are other ways to route packets… sometimes you take a smart router, have it write some instructions on a packet, and then send the packet to a bunch of dumb routers which just read the instructions written on the packet.)</p>
<p>If you want to see exactly which routers you use, try running a terminal command like <code>traceroute www.example.com</code></p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Routers are connected to each other mostly through fiber optic cables buried in the ground.  This is super expensive but very fast and reliable.  Some connections go across the country, or across the world, and some connections just go to other parts of the city.  They mostly work the same way: you take a router, give it a little bit of information like &quot;192.168 is that way&quot;, &quot;10.0 is over there&quot;, &quot;172.16 is behind you&quot;.</p>
<p>However, it gets a fair bit more complicated when you realize that for every router and piece of fiber optic cable, somebody <em>owns</em> that piece of equipment, and wants to get paid for letting you use it.</p>
<p>The way it works is each company builds out their own networks, and then the networks get connected to each other at special places.  So maybe I have my own network, CoolNet, and I run fiber optic cables from Seattle to Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.  Then another company, AwesomeCom, runs a cable from San Francisco to Reno to Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>If you're Kirkland, WA and make a video call (Facetime / skype whatever) to your uncle in Provo, UT, your packets goes through a few networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, it goes through your home WiFi network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then it goes to your ISP's network.  Your ISP has a bunch of cables going from their buildings to their customer's houses, and a cable which goes to Seattle (plus a few backup cables).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once in Seattle, it goes to what's called a &quot;colocation facility&quot;.  It's a building, or maybe a couple floors of an office building, where everybody connects their networks together.  Your ISP has a cable that goes here, and they have a router inside the building.  They rent space from the colocation owner.  The colocation facility has its own little network inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since CoolNet also has cables going to the Seattle colo facility, your packet now goes through CoolNet.  I can't connect you to Provo, but I can send your packet to another colocation facility, this one in San Francisco, CA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now AwesomeCom carries it to a colo facility in Salt Lake City, UT.  (AwesomeCom and CoolNet are both huge networks, so we have a &quot;peering&quot; agreement where we can just send packets through each other's networks for free, since it's good for both of us.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And your uncle's ISP carries it to Provo, UT.</p>
</li>
<li>And your uncle's router will send it to your uncle's iPad or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a business and want a website that's easy to access, a great way to do that is put your computers inside a colocation facility.  That way, your servers will have like 20 internet connections, instead of just one or two, and it will be easy to access.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Network engineer here in the Portland, OR area.</p>
<p>Internationally, you have few grade 1 providers such as L3 networks, XO communications, ATT, Verizon, etc.  Pretty much old school telco providers that have the scratch $ to invest in high speed cabling.  Most of this cabling is fiber optic bundles of a few strands to several thousand strands. Each pair of strands can currently carry up to (theoretical max at this time) 255Tbit per second, but most pairs are currently carrying 100Gbit and are aggregated together into a single connection for trans continental or trans oceanic crossings.</p>
<p>They essentially hop along the shortest path of each respective network from router or Layer 3 switch (which is also a type of router) to the next and often utilize border gateway protocol (BGP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) which is are algorithms that find the shortest paths on networks. BGP is self healing and automatically detects accidental fiber cuts or outages due to hardware failure.</p>
<p>Think of these as &quot;upstream&quot; networks as most international traffic terminates at these types of carriers.</p>
<p>Going down to more the local level, there are usually major network hubs in the world.  Examples of this are:  Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, London, (Fortaleza, Brazil), (Seixal, Portugal), (Mumbai, India), Hong Kong, Tokyo, (Pusan, S. Korea) etc.  There are more worldwide, but I only usually deal with US based carriers as my work only serves US needs since it has to do with a national healthcare network.</p>
<p>These terminate all of these high speed connections to lower level providers like your Comcast, Time Warner, ATT, British Telecom, Telekom, etc. distribute their private and public networks which then resell the upstream bandwidth to individual customers.</p>
<p>Here in Portland specifically, there are roughly 2 single buildings that if, were destroyed would probably knock the whole state of OR offline because almost everything downstream flows through them and are the terminus for most of the networks from CA and WA and far east.</p>
<p>This reselling of bandwith is sometimes done on an oversubscribed method. They sell more than they have. This is where you get into instances of &quot;slow&quot; internet locally and used to happen a lot more than it does now, but is still an issue in a lot of places. The carrier simply does not purchase enough upstream bandwidth to carry all of their customer's data.</p>
<p>This is where caching nodes come in, such as Akamai, Amazon cloud, Microsoft Cloud, Netflix etc.  These are geographically disbursed data centers that basically have local copies of all content on the internet that people are trying to access.  For instance, someone in San Jose, CA wants to Netflix &quot;stranger things&quot; they get it straight from Netflix's data-center near San Jose.  But then Joe in the UK wants to watch it, that data is sent from San Jose to somewhere in London to a cache node at super high speed and then stored there. Joe doesn't notice this but now that it's stored locally in London's cache node, everyone else on that node has access to it without having to make additional pulls from the original and thus slowing down the internet as a whole.</p>
<p>Some 3rd world countries that have extreme restrictions on what their people can access, such as North Korea, use deep packet inspection and firewalls to say what people can access. This also results in them usually only having one single point of internet coming into the country which can be knocked out easily if someone gets out with a backhoe and digs up the fiber cable.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course there is more to it than this, but it gives you an idea of routing and priority.  When visualizing the routing protocols I try to turn it from data packages into real packages (mail), imagine this scenario.  There is a post office at each local, city, region, country.  </p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong>
The example address of  3805 S Keystone Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46227 USA  going to 1400 E Hanna Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46227 USA.</p>
<p>When the letter is given to the clerk at &quot;Indianapolis, IN 46227&quot;.  They recognize that the destination is already from their routing point and just puts the letter back in the out box.  The local mailman knows about &quot;1400 E Hanna Ave&quot; and proceeds to drive to the destination.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong>
The example address of  3805 S Keystone Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46227 USA  going to 87-135 Brompton Rd, Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7XL, UK</p>
<p>The clerk at &quot;Indianapolis, IN 46227&quot; sees this is for a different City and sends it up to state level.  The clerk at &quot;Indiana&quot; sees this is for a different country and sends it up to the National level.  The clerk at &quot;USA&quot; Sees this is for &quot;UK&quot; and then sends it to their routing hub.  From there &quot;England&quot; down to &quot;London&quot;, then finally to &quot;Knightsbridge&quot; Which hands it to the mailman that goes to 87-135 Brompton Rd for delivery.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as the global internet infrastructure is,</p>
<p>A device can connect to the internet and transmit data via an <strong>Internet Service Provider</strong> or <strong>ISP</strong>. Some examples of ISPs would be companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T (these companies provide in the U.S.). These ISPs house their own data communication facilities called <strong>Points of Presence</strong>, or <strong>POPs</strong>, in local regions. These POPs just houses racks of routers and modems. Each POP gathers the data received from local users' devices and transmits this data further out in the internet infrastructure. And this works vice versa - POPs receives data from further out of the internet and sending them to their locally connected devices. The POP's functions are analogous to those of a local post office, but by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem" target="_blank">modems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)" target="_blank">routers</a>.</p>
<p>The physical means for the data to travel between device and POP and then onwards, I'm not sure, but it varies depending on the existing local infrastructure and what the ISP can make use of.</p>
<p>So what happens beyond the POP?<br />
These POPs, which belong to ISPs, are linked together with other POPs from other ISPs (by, again depending on the existing local infrastructure) along with data centers owned by governments and large organizations, at <strong>Internet Exchange Points</strong> or <strong>IXPs</strong>. IXPs houses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch" target="_blank">network switches</a>. Just as POPs are like local post offices, the IXPs are like the larger sorting offices. (No single organization owns an IXP. The ISPs and other participants voluntarily agrees to link together for the sake of serving their customers and lowering costs, practicing what is known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5oe63pOhLI" target="_blank">peering</a> . <strong>You can check out an interactive map of the IXPs around the world by TeleGeography <a href="http://www.internetexchangemap.com/" target="_blank">here</a></strong> </p>
<p>The IXPs are then connected to other IXPs through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone" target="_blank">internet backbones</a>. An internet backbone is made of fiber optic cables serving as principal routes for data to transmit at high capacity. Many of these fiber optic cables - <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/business/a-connected-world/305/" target="_blank">more than 550,000 miles of cable - are buried under sea to connect IXPs worldwide</a>. <strong>You can check out an a interactive map of the undersea fiber optic cables <a href="http://www.submarinecablemap.com/" target="_blank">here</a></strong> also by TeleGeography. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>
<strong>Globally: From device to local Point of Presence(racks of routers and modems) via an Internet Service Provider, to Internet Exchange Point(racks of network switches), to an internet backbone(under sea fiber optic cables), is how information is sent. Then from the internet backbone, it is received at a different IXP, POP, and finally device somewhere else on the globe.</strong></p>
<p>Another key aspect of the internet infrastructure is how the information is sent – for example, a data file is not sent whole like mail. You should look up <strong>I.P. address</strong> and <strong>data packets.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CDs contain what's called &quot;error correction&quot;.</p>
<p>Think of the music as being a string of numbers. These numbers are basically the values of a line graph, which is just the shape of the sound waveform that gets played back. So the first point is a 0, then the next is a 5, then an 8, then a 5, 0, -5, -8, -5, for instance. That's kind of a sine-wave shape that I just estimated. It's typical of a sound wave.</p>
<p>CDs contain that data. But they also contain <em>extra</em> data. There may be some data that says, &quot;the first 3 pieces add up to 13&quot;. This is error correction.</p>
<p>Let's say there's a scratch that renders the first &quot;5&quot; unreadable. Well, we can see there's a 0 and an 8, and the extra info says they should add up to 13. So even though it's partly damaged, we can tell it should be a 5 in the middle.</p>
<p>Additionally, those different pieces of information are intentionally scattered around the disc a bit, so a scratch is unlikely to ruin enough of them at once to make it impossible to recover the missing data.</p>
<p>The actual amount of information and complexity of the error checking algorithm is more complex than this example, for better resistance to missing data, but it's the same basic idea. Extra information to recover damaged portions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: Please refer to the error checking and correction posts. Also, in pressed disks, it's not burned dye that holds the information, but indentations caused by pressing. What's still the same is that damage to the reflective layer is usually more disruptive than damage to the underside of the disk.</p>
<p>That depends on how it is scratched, the sensitivity of the cd player, and the type of data on the CD.</p>
<p>A CD is basically made of four layers, from top to bottom:  </p>
<ul>
<li>a label  </li>
<li>reflective aluminium  </li>
<li>the information layer (dye)  </li>
<li>a protective transparent layer.  </li>
</ul>
<p>When you want to put something on a CD it is translated to a long string of 1s and 0s. Next that information is burned in the information layer: A zero gets a small burn spot, a one doesn't get a burn spot. </p>
<p>When a CD player wants to read the disk, it points a very small laser at the underside of the disk. When the laser hits a black burn spot (a &quot;zero&quot;) the light is absorbed/stopped by that black burn and will never be reflected by the aluminium above. When the laser hits a clear spot (a &quot;one&quot;), the laser goes right through the information layer and gets reflected back by the aluminium.</p>
<p>So, scratches to the upper side of the disk, damaging the reflective aluminium layer, are really bad: When the aluminium is damaged, the laser will never be reflected. Scratches to the underside only cause the disk to skip when it really changes the path of the laser or truly blocks it. So, (deep) scratches on the top side are usually really bad, scratches on the underside may not be as bad.</p>
<p>Whether or not a scratched disk plays also depends on your CD-player. Some are really sensitive and can't handle a slight change in the strength of the light, some can handle it better. When your laser lens is dirty, so that the light level is already lower, the sensitivity to scratches  may also increase(if you begin with less light, you don't have a lot of margin for scratches). </p>
<p>It also depends on the type of data: You can skip a few places with music (missing a few 1s and 0s), but with data (CD-rom) your data is probably &quot;corrupted&quot; (you're missing information that is vital to the program or file; you need every one and zero).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Audio CDs are hideously inefficiently encoded - although to be fair when the standards were being written decent lossless compression (e.g. FLAC) was nowhere to be seen, even good lossy compression (e.g. MP3) was still a way off. So Audio CDs used two channels of 44.1KHz 16-bit raw audio samples, plus some extra error correction and detection bits.</p>
<p>That means that there is a relatively low data density on the disc. The fact that it is error correction <em>and detection</em> means that even if a chunk of data is read and is so badly corrupted that the ECC algorithm cannot fix it, it still knows the data is corrupt.</p>
<p>In audio CD players they had a 0-255 volume level built in and for every uncorrectable sample it turned it down one notch and played the last known good sample again, only turning it back up again when correct data is seen. This led to a gradual turning down of the levels around duff samples rather than a sudden dropout which would have cause an audible 'thump' from the speakers.</p>
<p>This is why even a hole in the disc up to 1/8&quot; could be unheard in the output.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Vesiculus wrote a very comprehensive answer. I'd like to add that audio CDs were designed to handle dirt and scratches: they contain a lot of error-correction data (extra data that's used to reconstruct the original if it wasn't read properly). And many players use oversampling, which reads the same data multiple times (2, 8, or 16 times, possibly more) and uses the result it got the majority of the time.</p>
<p>Also, the orientation of scratches makes a difference. Data is arranged in concentric rings on the disc. Scratches that cross perpendicular to these rings cause only a small amount to damage to each, which is easily correctable. Scratches which are oriented so they wipe out too much consecutive data cause unrecoverable errors. (This is why manufacturers always tell you to wipe discs from the center to the edge.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
