		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't work for reddit so I don't know how they have written their algorithm, but maybe I can explain a little about search algorithms in general. (CompSci bachelors here).</p>
<p>There are three major comoponents that go into how a search algorithm runs: how the algorithm is written, what systems the algorithm has to chug through, and how many resources are available for the algorithm to run.</p>
<p>About how algorithms are written. There are many different ways to write a search algorithm. If I put in &quot;water&quot; as a search term for example, I could match in many ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Match on terms that begin with &quot;water&quot; (&quot;water is great&quot; would match. &quot;I hate water&quot; would not.)</li>
<li>Match on terms that end with &quot;water&quot;. (the opposite result of number 1.)</li>
<li>Match on terms that have &quot;water&quot; in them. (&quot;I love water sometimes&quot; would match, and so would the two examples in 1.)</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, the first two methods of matching would run more quickly because terms can be eliminated much faster. But obviously it is much less accurate. The problem with the last method of searching is that the algorithm must go through almost every piece of data to find matches. </p>
<p>About the systems used in an algorithm. I have no idea what reddit uses specifically, but I will give an example of how something could be built. There are many layers to a website: front end, back end, and the database. The front end is things like javascript amd html, which format the page the user sees, and the results of a search must be loaded into. The back end is where the server doing computations lives, and this is where the server takes the user's search query and decides what to do with it. Usually, the backend will translate a simple search like &quot;water&quot; into something that the database can understand, and then asks the database for the info. Then the database receives the request for data, chugs along the query and looks for the results. Then the database sends the results back up the chain, eventually getting to the user. As you can see, even something as easy as &quot;water&quot; goes through multiple layers. The problem here is not necessarily how many components there are to the system, but rather the time it takes for one layer to talk to the next. The system usually has a built in timeout if a query takes too long, because nobody wants their server held up on a query for ages. It is possible reddit's timeout is 30 seconds for example, when the query actually needs 1 minute to run to completion.</p>
<p>Finally, the resources available for a query. This is not so much about the server's resources, but the database's. If the database does not have a lot of processing power, it will take a little longer to run, especially if the database has A LOT of data to go through. Some database systems are better designed for big data than others. It is possible reddit has chosen one type of database system that isn't suited for querying large amounts of data in a reasonable amount of time. But now they are &quot;stuck&quot; with the system because trying to move mountains of data to a new system would be tons of effort.</p>
<p>Sorry this was so long! Hope it helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why is reddit's search feature so bad? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor/rudimentary search algorithm. I'm not sure if it's open source, but you can tell that it tends to look for literal matches. It gets easily confused by partial terms. Search engines like google are high optimized to use things far beyond the literal words to rate how likely something is close enough to what you wanted</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the time it says &quot;search failed&quot; and it's always slow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a resource thing. They intentionally put the search on low priority. Reddit seems to run pretty close to the line on server power/capacity, and search is the first thing to die when things get busy. </p>
<p>It makes sense, from a limited resource perspective- you want the main site to work well, search is &quot;less important&quot; most of the time.</p>
<p>Speed is a mix of both of those things- lack of resources to crank through stuff, and inefficient algorithms to sort through junk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here are talking about algorithms and resources and code, but that's not the real underlying cause for Reddit's search sucking. I'm a web developer, the fact is, site search is a solved problem. There are countless search libraries and services they could use, and they have all the talented engineering resources they could ever need to do it. There's no technical excuse for it being so bad.</p>
<p>The legit reason is because Reddit management has decide poor search is a feature and not a bug. They've decided that bad search functions indirectly spur new site activity. People post new things rather than simply digging up old threads. There are even full communities dedicated to fulfilling a search like function. In addition to this, there's no reason to believe that better site search will yield increased traffic, so it's probably difficult to justify expending resources on it anyway. Trust me, engineering issues are not causing a site of this scale to have bad search.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The explanation I've always gotten is, roughly, 'well, in chromium each atom pairs with another atom, cancelling out the magnetic field' (i.e. antiferromagnetism) - but this leaves a lot to be desired. Why do such pairings form in chromium but not in iron? And why do such pairings form in such a way to cancel out the magnetic field? On a large scale, it's energetically favorable for magnets to orient themselves such that their fields add - why is it any different on an atomic scale?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism#Explanation" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> has a decent (and much better than I could do in a reddit comment) explanation of how ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) work. To properly understand why in some atoms parings are made and others are not requires a decent amount of <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/JamesBinney/qb.pdf" target="_blank">quantum mechanics</a> at the 2nd/3rd year undergraduate level. The topic is actually hard to find a good book on online, the closest I could find were <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~pjh/teaching/phz7427/7427notes/ch3.pdf" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmjk/keeling/teaching/magnetism-notes.pdf" target="_blank">three</a> on <a href="https://www.upjs.sk/public/media/5596/Qauntum-Theory-of-Magnetism.pdf" target="_blank">quantum magnetism</a>.</p>
<p>To provide some quick hand-wavy answers:</p>
<p>Why do such pairings form in iron and not chromium?</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron valence electrons find it energetically favourable to align their spins rather than anti-align them (it's to do with an interaction between the pauli-exclusion principle [PEP], electromagnetic repulsion, and the exact arrangement of electrons).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do pairings cancel out the magnetic field?</p>
<ul>
<li>All electrons have a magnetic moment (this is what gives rise to the magnetic field), it's orientation is dependent upon the particles' spin (either up or down). Due to the PEP, electrons in a filled shell will always pair up (one up and one down) and their magnetic moments will cancel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is it sometimes more energetically favourable on an atomic scale to anti-align magnetic fields?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of antiferromagnets the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction (which will anti-align fields) is stronger than the combination of the PEP and electrostatic repulsion that causes ferromagnetism. The exact reason for this requires lots of maths. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/news/events/kkr_greens/programme/dias-wednesday.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good slideshow with some good books at the end (I can't find any of them online for free though)</p>
<p>I hope some of that is useful.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gist: electrons define magnetism as a side effect of quantum spin. The more electrons with the same spin (up) and no countering spin (down), the more magnetic the atom can be. Each orbital has two electrons in it - one of each spin. A valence shell has X number of orbitals in it, and each shell has more orbitals than the one before it and a higher energy level, but the higher the shell is, the narrower the energy level difference is between them. Each shell fills each orbital with an up electron first until the shell is half full, then the lowest orbital gets a down electron, then the next, etc. When shells' energy are close enough, adjacent orbitals in the nearby shells will also fill with up electrons before the down ones come into play. </p>
<p>Iron is in this sweet spot where the electrons can fill out several orbitals with up electrons without being countered by down electrons, and, because of the properties of paramagnetism, these &quot;ups&quot; can be matched with the &quot;ups&quot; of surrounding atoms when a magnetic field aligns them. Basically this means that iron can be stably filled with electrons without filling any of the outer orbitals with two electrons, and interactions between these shells of ups induces the same direction of up in nearby atoms. When this happens, the magnetic field has multiple contributions from different atoms and forms a larger magnet, and can continue to align nearby atoms with the same properties. </p>
<p>Chromium and other metals don't have as many &quot;exposed&quot; or disparate valance orbitals. Other metals usually have fewer exposed orbitals and/or the spins of the up electrons are mitigated by the spins of the down electrons in the same orbitals. </p>
<p>Think of magnetism as a disparity caused by quantum spin. The field is created when the net quantum property of the sea of electrons in a magnetic chunk of metal is very up and wants some down. Non-ferrous metals don't have as much of an up/down disparity, so the sea of electrons have a balanced spin proportion and the field created by whatever imbalance is much weaker. All the electrons are paired and happy. </p>
<p>Quick edit: I'm operating off of memory of knowledge I don't really use often, so please correct any lapses in vocabulary or understanding! ✌️</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

	</div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read about how people, after a complete corpus callosotomy, can continue performing tasks requiring coordinated action from their right and left sides, e.g. running. Yet, if the brain hemispheres can not communicate directly, then in such cases, how does the coordination, or even the initiation of a gross action occur? Could it be like this:</p>
<p>Let's say there is a stimulus to run, e.g. a dinosaur comes chasing and both hemisphere fire, yet whichever side gets going first, the other side starts complementing it with a response that will keep the body balanced and running. E.g. If one side speeds up, the other either agrees and speeds up accordingly, or maybe it quarrels. But both sides know that it is in their interest to escape the velociraptor.  </p>
<p>Essentially, I'd guess that the hemispheres' coordination is via the feedback that they receive from the already effectuated actions of their other half. Maybe this occurs on a subconscious level for both sides? Anyways, if true, I can't understand how it doesn't lead to massive problems, e.g. you see your Ex and one side want's to interact and the other wants to walk off. On the other hand, does the operation enable legitimate multitasking? </p>
<p>Finally, as a extra, is there any resolution for the debate on whether split brains constitute to 2 incomplete minds in 1 body? It seems reasonable to say, no? Sorry for the long post. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They still can do basic motor tasks involving coordination, not complex (for a while, anyways). Basically, the corpus callosum connects both hemispheres of brain, this makes it easier for us to use our coordination more efficiently. So they still can do these functions, but it's two different sets of motions and thought processes. </p>
<p>Use an example of tying your shoes. When you tie your shoe, you don't think for both your hands, you just act and think of the action of tying your shoes, and act.
They on the other hand, have to have two different thought processes for each of their movements, as they can't connect the motions together properly.</p>
<p>These motor functions are simply more complex and complicated, rather than impossible</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an addiction counselor. I've also spent four days in a coma from a polysubstance overdose, and subsequent withdrawal. </p>
<p>Let's get a few terms straight first. Addiction is not diagnosable. Instead, let's call it a (substance) use disorder. There are 11 diagnostic criteria for a use disorder. If someone meets 3, or 7, or 10 of these criteria, their disorder could be mild, moderate, or severe. Someone with a mild substance use disorder might not have the same obsessions or compulsions that another patient may have, or the same feelings of guilt/shame as another, or hasn't been using as coping skill since age 13, or has a very supportive home life with access to a continuum of care, etc. </p>
<p>So, the answer is yes, it's possible for them to wake up not 'addicted' or at least not physically dependent... but completing withdrawal is not enough for most patients to find long term wellness. About 92% of opioid users that complete a detox-only level of care, without residential treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, etc., end up using again within one year... using problematically... not just using...</p>
<p>So, while it's possible, the patient would likely need to be mild case, and present with mostly withdrawal related symptoms and none of the thought-life, amygdala activation, guilt/shame, society pressures, home life difficulties, have many coping methods that actually help the patient, etc., that most problematic users face daily. So... let's not try... ok?!?!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Addiction has both physical and mental components. When you are physically addicted to something your body goes into withdrawal and makes the addict sick. That physical withdrawal can vary from unpleasant, to life threatening and it can last days. </p>
<p>The mental component is drug seeking behavior. The user wants the drug because it helps them cope or satisfies a need they have. Those cravings and needs are likely still there when they wake up, maybe even more so with the stress of a hospital stay. </p>
<p>I'll give you some examples.
Cigarettes - They have a mild physical addiction that can cause irritability, headaches, and low energy when quitting. These usually fade in a few days. However the mental addiction can last for months or years. The user is used to fidgeting with their hands, they often smoke during other activities and doing those activities without a cigarette makes them crave them all the more. Being around other smokers, or in situations where one usually smokes like drinking in a bar, makes it very difficult to abstain. </p>
<p>Opiates - Very strong physical addiction and dependence. Quitting cold turkey leads to intense nausea, diarrhea, sleep interruptions, headaches, intense feelings of hopelessness and malaise. The opiates caused their bodies to produce less endorphins and 'feel good' brain chemicals. Without the drug, the bodies natural pain killers and chemical rewards are not working properly leading to the person being in a lot of pain and discomfort, and things that normally bring joy like friends, food, favorite music and movies, provide little to no relief. This usually fades in several days. The mental aspects of it can last the rest of a persons life. The problems and behaviors that led them to abuse the drug in the first place are often still there when they quit, and recovery can be very difficult and require years of careful control over their behaviors and lives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You (like most people) are conflating <em>addiction</em>, which is a behavior and a psychological/spiritual/brain-chemistry problem, with <em>chemical dependence</em>, which is a medical condition. Any person can, for instance, be over prescribed painkillers and their body develop a chemical dependence, which will result in physical withdrawal when the substance is removed.  That part, you can sleep through.  Being an <strong>addict</strong> is a different thing.  An alcoholic who hasn't had a drink in five years is <strong>still an addict</strong>, despite having no physical chemical dependence. It's a reference to the fact that their brain chemistry is simply different, and always will be at our present level of understanding. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physically yes. But most addictions are not about the actual substance though. When it comes to substance abuse then people have that as the solution to their problem but it's not the actual problem. Many look at a drug addict and think if you only took away the drugs then the problem would be solved but what they don't realize is that the drugs is to cover the pain inside them. So it could have been alcohol, drugs, food or whatever. It's kinda like people who cut themselves. It doesn't help to take away the knife cause they clearly have issues. No I am not saying the two are the same, it's just an example. So most likely they will still need a fix and will still be addicted.</p>
<p>I want to point out that there are many who at some point try drugs and then suddenly get addicted and need it and in this case I think your example would actually be a big help. But for many addicts then it wouldn't work cause they would wake up and feel like hell and need something to numb that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

When you are awake, and most importantly upright, excess fluid tends to accumulate on your lower half, just because of gravity. When you are asleep and laying flat, the fluid is evenly distributed throughout your body. So when you first wake up, your face is &quot;puffier&quot; looking than usual. Add to that messy hair, and lack of makeup for some people, and you're going to think you look bad in the mornings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason why you look uglier in the mornings is due to a build up to lymph in your face. The lymphatic system doesn't actively transport lymph, it primarily uses the surrounding muscles that are moving to push itself around. Since when you sleep you move very little, the lymph that gravity pulls to your face while your sleeping doesn't leave, your face is left looking puffy. This, along with other factors like bed head and general groggyness makes you look ugly, compared to your usual self. By the time you get up out of bed, brush your teeth, and comb your hair, you've moved around enough that the lymph in your face gets redistributed and you look perfectly normal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These particular pictures look like the snails are working with a mucus layer, so I'd have to be able to see the whole tank to tell you what's happening for sure.</p>
<p>We'd see this a lot in Beta fish tanks. The Betas (a.k.a. &quot;fighting fish&quot;) are native to a flood plain that only really floods seaonally. So they &quot;fight&quot; for the depressions because most of the tiny divots can not support two fish for the dry season.</p>
<p>They also produce a thick slime/mucus that floats to the surface of their fist-sized dollop of water. This mucus layer slows evaporation and so increases the chance that their little blob of water will survive until the next rainy season.</p>
<p>This is why you can keep a beta in a literal cup (eight fluid ounces) of water for months at a time.</p>
<p>The mucus is quite thick and slimy.</p>
<p>The snails are very small, so they can stick to that mucus layer and crawl along it quite easily.</p>
<p>Now other fish have similar mutations for similar reasons so in a still water tank you'll get surface scum where various material joins with the water's &quot;surface tension&quot; to make a surprisingly strong layer of one composition or another.</p>
<p>It's not strong compared to your finger, but it's strong compared to the more-or-less neutrally buoyant snail's means of propulsion.</p>
<p>And even in clean water with virtually no scum the water's surface tension is pretty strong to start with, and the mucus from the snail's foot is going to let it create the needed thickness.</p>
<hr />
<p>Beneath all this is the question of &quot;what is surface tension&quot; in water.</p>
<p>If you look at an water molecule it's one Oxygen and two Hydrogen atoms. This forms a little &quot;V&quot; shape because the Oxygen atom is about eight times larger than the hydrogen. The Oxygen needs to &quot;borrow&quot; an electron from each of the Hydrogens so it gets very minus-ee, and the hydrogen's one electron each spends so much of it's time servicing the Oxygen atom's needs that the two hydrogens get very plus-ee.</p>
<p>Basically if you draw that &quot;V&quot; shape and put two little pluses, one on top of each horn of the &quot;V&quot; and put a big minus under the point at the bottom, you've done a decent job of making a &quot;charge map&quot; of the water molecule.</p>
<p>Now the plus-ee parts of any one &quot;V&quot; are going to be attracted to the minus-ee parts of another V. This is called the &quot;hydrogen bond&quot;. So if you made a bunch of these V, like if you printed a bunch of large &quot;V&quot;s and cut them out, you could make shapes by lining up the pluses and minuses.</p>
<p>It turns out that the water molecule shape is slightly wider spread than most Vs in fonts. In particular if you put six together plus-to-minus it would make a circle with six outward-pointing pluses. (This is why snowflakes are six-pointed if they are flat, more minuses stick to the six outward pointed pluses, and so on.</p>
<p>So in the full thickness of the water the V's are arranged in three dimensions. They are pointed in every conceivable direction.</p>
<p>But at the surface of the water they don't want to point their pluses up into the air. So at the surface they tend to form a &quot;mat&quot; Some of their pluses point down into the water, and the rest are horizontal.</p>
<p>So the surface of the water is a tightly laced arrangement of pluses stuck to minuses. This interlocked mat of molecules is so strong that it can hold up things. Heavy things like bugs (look up &quot;water strider&quot;) and sewing needles (a fun science experiment).</p>
<p>What's strong from above is strong from below.</p>
<p>Some things, like particular mucuses, can make this barrier extra strong and thick. While other things, like soaps (e.g. &quot;surfactants&quot; as in &quot;surface actors&quot; but in academic speak) can weaken and break this tension.</p>
<p>So the snails may be small enough to just use the surface tension...</p>
<p>Or they may be adding to the surface strength with their own snail slime.</p>
<p>Or something else, like a fish or decaying plant matter, may have already added some structural reinforcement to that surface tension.</p>
<p>TL;DR? Scum. Scum is strong. Scum is common. And snails are good at making and using scum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Parasnailing is when they climb something tall within the tank (a plant, decor, or just the glass wall of said tank) and jump off, letting all of the air out of their shells. I had one snail that did basically nothing else with his day - every time I looked over, he was climbing the glass and jumping off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something I can contribute to very well. I've given lectures at universities and museums on the history of beer. It's a fascinating topic that I love delving in to. If I go long my apologies, but beer is so important to our civilization. </p>
<p>As has been stated several times in this thread, it's the reason why we became an agricultural society instead of just hunter/gatherers. It's the reason we have society. In early Mesopotamia it was also used as currency. Hell, Jewish slaves were paid in bowls of beer, it wasn't beer as we know it today, but it was a porridge-like substance that was created with grain and water. The pyramids were built on beer.</p>
<p>I stated earlier that the reason why wine is used in Christianity is because it was easy to grow grapes in Italy and as Christianity spread through the Roman Empire that became the norm. If you couldn't grow grapes you had to buy it from Italians and thus helping their economy. It that time beer became a lesser drink in the eyes of many. </p>
<p>As beer became a drink and not just for food its secrets were passed down through the monks. Which has also been stated several times in this thread. What I havent seen mentioned is the importance of Reinheitsgebot. In 1514 Bavaria passed a law stating that beer could only be malted grain (barley, oats, wheat, rye), hops, and water (later amended to include yeast).  This is significant because it was the first food law passed in the history of humanity. At the time people were trying to balance out the sweetness of beer with whatever they could find. It was called gruit  and it could include figs, dates, sticks, and even charcoal (again, not as refined as we know it today). Beer was important because it kept people alive, but some of the ingredients were killing people or making them sick. They decided on hops because, like the Counsel of Nicaea, they chose an available crop that was easy to grow in the area. Hops.</p>
<p>Hops became the standard for the bittering agent in beer because both Germany and England could grow them and it helped the local economy. </p>
<p>Beer also helped the Champagne region of France with exploding bottles. The Belgians have many styles of beer that have residual sugars still in them, much like champagne. The Belgians figured out that if you have a flat bottom bottle the residual sugar can continue to build up CO2. If it builds up enough over time, it'll explode. The Belgians put a divot in the bottle to break up the amount of concentrated sugar in one area and thus the bottles wouldn't explode.</p>
<p>Pasteur was looking at wine when he discovered yeast, but IIRC refrigeration was developed to cool wort quicker. I have to look that up though. </p>
<p>Beer took a big hit after prohibition in America. With the WWII soldiers coming home from Germany and developing a love for the taste of pilsners, and the rise of Bud and Miller, beer was thought as a one trick pony.  It wasn't until Carter passed a law in the 70's allowing for homebrewing that we see the start of the rise of craft beer in America. Styles that were dead became revitalized (i.e. IPA) and depth of the beverage really started to emerge.</p>
<p>Beer is incredibly important to us as a society. It helped form us and shape how we became. I can literally talk for hours on the subject. This is the cliffs notes version that I can pull from memory, I'd need to do more homework to get it down a bit more proper. But, until I can get paid for it, why the hell am I going to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1) Beer isn't the sole important alcohol in history, you're forgetting wine. Wine dates back thousands of years, and in the AD calendar the importance of wine can't be underestimated (especially considering the rise of Christianity). There are monastic orders that have made beer for centuries (Trappist, others), but to my understanding wine has been an essential part of Catholic/Christian ceremonies for a long, long time. Wine even did relatively well during prohibition in the US because of church usage. So, I would argue wine is equally important, if not more.</p>
<p>2) Include beer and wine, same question. My best guess would be that a lower alcohol percentage drink allows people to still be functional after consumption, where something like Brandy is going to make someone drunk, worthless, and a social outcast (you can't function when you're hammered, and especially in early cultures you had to be able to contribute to the group in some way).</p>
<p>Also, distilled liquor required, well, a still. Wine or beer (I think) can theoretically be made in any kind of clay pot or vessel. Then liquor has to taste good. You still can't drink too much of it if it's high proof. There's centuries old liqueurs and Brandy and grappa that fit the bill, but for the few historical successes there must be thousands others there were lost to time because they didn't do a good job tasting good, being easy to produce, and allowing people to be functional.</p>
<p>Just my best guess, I'm not great on the technical side of booze but I work in the restaurant industry and these conjectures are based on my limited understanding.  </p>
<p>Edit: One of the big things I missed is the ease of growing grain compared to fruit (worldwide). Also, the proof is less important than the actual ease of making wine/beer. </p>
<p>Some people are pointing out beer was safer to drink than water, but some people are disputing it. I don't my know, I'm not a German beer doctor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beer (and wine and mead) come first. All other alcoholic beverages are products of refining (properly &quot;distilling&quot;) the various beers into stronger mixtures.</p>
<p>So to make vodka, for instance, one makes a potato mash, then ferments that mash into potato beer, then uses heat and condensation to separate the alcohol from the water, concentrating the beer into a liquor.</p>
<p>So beer isn't &quot;more important&quot; as a comparison of equals, it's a predicate. So the invention of the wheel is more <em>significant</em> than the invention of the tire, because you have to make the wheel <em>first</em> and wrapping that wheel with padding makes it into a tire.</p>
<p>Without the predicate the follow-on technology never happens.</p>
<p>So without beer there are no other alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>In general the historians talking about this subject are talking about the &quot;big three&quot; - beer, wine, and mead - when they talk about the discovery of beer. Since wine needs specifically grapes, and mead needs the domestication of honey, while beer can be made from any grain or sugar in general, it's something of an understood generalization.</p>
<p>There is far more beer-making land throughout the cradles of civilization than there is wine or mead producing land.</p>
<p>So the beer is though to come before the domestication of bees for mead, the domestication of the grape for wine, the domestication and enrichment of fruit trees for cider.</p>
<p>So the various grain beers was likely first and foremost, and certainly lead to the invention of the other alcohols.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that it also lead to the domestication of yeasts and so the baking of leavened bread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food Scientist here. One of the fundamental importances of beer is the fact that it was the only safe form of drinking water for many people. As old towns grew, the water supply became more contaminated and disease was quite prevalent. The water supplies were full of bacteria.</p>
<p>Now, bacteria don't thrive in alcoholic solutions, even low alcohol, and so by fermenting the water, it was effectively disinfecting it for drinking. Why beer though, and not other drinks?</p>
<p>Grains are very prevalent and have been for millennia, they offer nutrition which carries through to the beer and when malted, are easily fermentable. </p>
<p>Originally the beer was spiced and flavoured with all sorts of plants to make gruit. The switch to using hops was because of the superior flavour, and more importantly, the antibacterial properties of hops which further improved the benefit of drinking beer over lake or river water.</p>
<p>EDIT: I hurriedly wrote this out and missed an essential part, which is the boil, which kills a lot of the bacteria. Much of the rest of the brewing and fermentation makes it harder for bacteria to grow. Just because not all bacteria will die in beer, does not mean it is just as unsafe as some water sources in the past.</p>
<p>Many breweries formed because of the increase in populations and industrialisation when the water was at it's worst (last few hundred years)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Beer and bread were invented simultaneously in ancient Sumeria. as they involve the same basic ingredients - ground wheat and yeast. Yeast would have been airborne to start with, and both processes would likely have involved soaking the kernels to soften them. You could make bread from the solid bits, and the liquid bits would have been beer. It's an ancient drink. </p>
<p>In the Americas, the Wari went through a similar process with corn. Agriculture spread quickly across ancient Peru, because the Wari realized that by growing slightly more corn than you needed to live, you could brew it into a fantastic party drink. Their empire spread based on this teaching, they built huge stone terraces and had dance festivals, and worshiped gods of drink. The drinking cup was sacred. It was basically corn beer, and is still popular to this day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Beyond that, who can start attaching oxygen atoms to form oxoanions. The convention for these is that <em>-ite</em> denotes two more oxygen atoms than <em>-ide</em>.

<p><em>-ate</em> is <em>-ide</em> plus three oxygen atoms (Chlorate = ClO3-) and <em>per-...-ate</em> is <em>-ate</em> plus one more oxygen, or in other words, four more than <em>-ide</em>. (Perchlorate = ClO4-)</p>

<em>-ite</em>: 2 oxygens (ClO2-)
<em>-ate</em>: 3 oxygens (ClO3-)

<p>The exact numbering of the nomenclature is a little different for other groups besides halogens - e.g. sulfate is SO4-2, rather than SO3-2 as you might expect from the name (SO3-2 is sulfite) - but it still follows the pattern of <em>per-...-ate</em> &gt; <em>-ate</em> &gt; <em>-ite</em> &gt; <em>hypo-...-ite</em> &gt; <em>-ide</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a wide range of variation in the number and frequency of offspring. This has been studied under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory" target="_blank">R- or K-strategists</a>. Essentially, it comes down to a trade off between quantity and quality. Humans have very much gone down the 'quality' path - we spend a lot of time and energy raising each child. As such, we are an extreme K-selected species.</p>
<p>As a result of this, each child has a very good chance of surviving to adulthood and having offspring of their own. The opposite end of the spectrum is to have many offspring, but each receiving very little care. For example, most fish lay clutches of hundreds of eggs, and then leave them the hatch and fend for themselves. The mortality rate is very high - many eggs and young fish are eaten, and others will starve do death or die of disease. As such, despite the huge numbers of eggs produced, very few go on to reach adulthood. This is a typical R-selected strategy.</p>
<p>Of course, these are two extremes on a spectrum, most animals fall somewhere in the middle. Species breeding patterns will evolve toward one end or the other according to the specific ecological conditions prevailing. Furthermore, there is even evidence that <em>individuals</em> of some species can alter the number and quality of offspring <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/210/4474/1148" target="_blank">according to the local conditions</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It varies based on a number of things such as gestation, length of time the young stays with their mother, how active of a parent they are, and overall survival rate of the species. For example, frogs lay tons of eggs. That said, it's easy for those eggs to be eaten. Her tadpoles are also easy prey, so she has to lay lots of eggs to ensure that some survive. Mom doesn't really do much after the eggs are laid in most species, so she's free to mate again pretty shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Dolphins and elephants are typically closer to us. They invest several years raising their offspring. Their social structures improve the safety of the young and therefore give them better chances of survival. Like us, they only breed every few years because of the tremendous amount of work they put into raising their young. They just don't have the time or resources for more.</p>
<p>Even going back in human history, you can see similar trends. Back in centuries past, women tended to have more children because few of them survived to adulthood. Now that our survival rates have improved, our children live longer, they take more time and resources to raise, therefore we need fewer of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

These animals are neither intelligently nor gentically close to humans. This trait is certainly not unique to humans or even to intelligent animals.</p>
<p>Whether an animal is able to have a litter of offspring depends on multiple factors including 1) the shape of the uterus and 2) predation. Animals with uteruses that have horns (like dogs) are able to have litters because the offspring are lined up along each of the horns. In humans the uterus has only one cavity  and so humans are unable to have litters. </p>
<p>As other answer have mentioned, having multiple offspring is advantageous to prey animals because the genes will still be passed on. This may explain why primates (including humans) and large herbivores are tend to only have one offspring  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It includes, amongst many other notable portions on the pathology, the current understanding of the disease, the treatment options, and further avenues of exploration and clinical management of patients with the disease.</p>
<p>They classify Primary and Secondary tinitus as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primary tinnitus is used to describe tinnitus that is idiopathic and may or may not be associated with SNHL <em>[sensorineural hearing loss]</em>. Although there is currently no cure for primary tinnitus, a wide range of therapies has been used and studied in attempts to provide symptomatic relief. These therapies include education and counseling, auditory therapies that include hearing aids and specific forms of sound therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medications, dietary changes and supplements, acupuncture, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</p>
<p>Secondary tinnitus is tinnitus that is associated with a specific underlying cause (other than SNHL) or an identifiable organic condition. It is a symptom of a range of auditory and nonauditory system disorders that include simple cerumen impaction of the external auditory canal, middle ear diseases such as otosclerosis or Eustachian tube dysfunction, cochlear abnormalities such as Ménière’s disease, and auditory nerve pathology such as VS. Nonauditory system disorders that can cause tinnitus include vascular anomalies, myoclonus, and intracranial hypertension. Management of secondary tinnitus is targeted toward identification and treatment of the specific underlying condition and is not the focus of this guideline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper is rather technical in looking into clinician practice and epidemiology, but it does give a very thorough breakdown of tinnitus as a physical malady. Understanding the specific pathology of the patient allows for more effective treatment. Unfortunately, this has the effect of splitting tinnitus into many subgroups of categories, though it may be a good place for OP to start to understand why this is a more difficult question to answer than he might've anticipated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>I noticed this thread is becoming filled with speculative answers (even after being unlocked), so I am prematurely submitting this with only a few sources and will be adding more soon. Now updated.</strong></p>
<p>The best answer for this question is simply that the neuroscience of tinnitus is still poorly understood. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3073522/" target="_blank">Here is a review from 2010</a> (no paywall) and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v16/n10/full/nrn4003.html" target="_blank">another from 2015</a> that focuses on human neuroimaging (paywall), but both of these reviews say that more research needs to be done. Part of the problem is that tinnitus is very heterogeneous. People can perceive very different types of sounds, and it can affect/distress people in very different ways. This makes tinnitus a difficult thing to study.</p>
<p>With that disclaimer, let's jump in.</p>
<p>The filtering mechanism you're referring to is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation" target="_blank">adaptation</a> and there are versions of it in every sensory system, including hearing. For example, in the presence of loud noise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivocochlear_system" target="_blank">the medial olivocochlear system</a> is a neural circuit that helps to shift the sensitivity of the sensory cells in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea" target="_blank">cochlea</a> to maintain a good dynamic range, i.e. it helps your ability to hear despite the presence of noise. However, there are different types of adaptation that occur at multiple levels in the auditory system, from the most peripheral parts in the cochlea to the most central parts in the cortex. My point here is that just because one type of adaptation exists (like your vision example) does not mean the brain is able to adapt perfectly to <em>any</em> input.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> </p>
<p>In most cases, tinnitus is associated with some type of hearing loss, and usually, the perceived sounds occur near the affected frequency range. The most commonly proposed explanation for these cases is that damage in the cochlea leads to reduced input into the brainstem structures that first process the sound. Here, plastic changes occur in order to compensate for the reduced input. It's thought that these types of changes lead to abnormal activity that are eventually interpreted by higher-level areas as phantom sounds. </p>
<p>But as I said earlier, higher-level areas in the cortex have their own adaptation processes, so you may ask why can't those adaptive processes prevent tinnitus even if the sub-cortical adaptive processes are damaged. It turns out that many non-auditory areas do have abnormalities in people with tinnitus, e.g. parts of the prefrontal cortex and limbic system (this is from the second review I linked). These areas are involved with a wide variety of functions and <em>may</em> be involved in how distressing people find their tinnitus. </p>
<p>In other words, people who are not bothered as much by their tinnitus may have more effective filtering due to adaptive processes in these non-auditory parts of their brain. Conversely, these areas may not be as effective in people with more severe tinnitus. To quote the second review I linked: &quot; ... the sound percept itself could be the result of increased activity in the auditory pathways and permitted or even facilitated by interactions of auditory brain areas with non-auditory brain networks.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2 [tl;dr]</strong></p>
<p>Tinnitus is a complicated disorder that likely involves many parts of the brain and is still poorly understood. The brain's ability (or inability) to &quot;filter&quot; out tinnitus may be related to how distressing people find their tinnitus. People that are less distressed by their tinnitus may have more effective adaptation processes that involve the interaction of non-auditory and auditory parts of the brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tinnitus could be from a number of causes. Even simple things like aspirin sensitivity can cause it along with electrolyte imbalance, but trauma and acoustic insult to the hair cells in the inner ear are likely the most common causes. Anyway the auditory cortex is wired through the brain stem and not a cortical (cerebral) function. The brain stem does not answer to cortical 'filtering' or adaptation/desensitization. </p>
<p>A good example is nausea you never become used to being nauseous even if it was pervasive. That's because nausea is not a cortical function but rather a brain stem trigger. </p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tl;dr: The brain doesn’t filter out tinnitus because the brain creates tinnitus. If anything, the brain’s attempt to “filter out silence” (i.e. hear quiet things) might cause tinnitus.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As many have noted, tinnitus is often correlated with hearing loss. Whether it’s age-related or noise induced hearing loss, hair cells in the cochlea aren’t working as well as they once did, thus require louder sound to activate. This also means <strong>the acoustic world of a person with a given level of hearing loss is, on average, quieter than someone without hearing loss.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As u/vir_innominatus noted, the <strong>brain adapts to constant input</strong>. This is probably the most important part. Adaptation occurs for sensory input, but also a LACK of input. This is definitely the case for hearing, for example when people walk into sound attenuated/anechoic rooms they may begin to hear their pulse, their breathing, or experience tinnitus.</p>
</li>
<li>We don’t have a great mechanistic understanding of how tinnitus really works in the brain, but <strong>one hypothesis is that after hearing loss the brain adapts by boosting auditory sensitivity</strong>. With hearing loss, there’s less auditory input into the brain. The brain adapts to this low level of input by turning up the volume, sort of amplifying everything, making auditory neurons more sensitive. This is just another form of neural adaptation, and in general, it’s useful, because if the brain didn’t do this, the effects of even mild hearing loss could be worse. But with this comes the risk of introducing false positives, detecting signals when they aren’t there, i.e. tinnitus. (This is sometimes referred to as the “central gain control” hypothesis of tinnitus, or involving “homeostatic changes” in the central auditory system after hearing loss). This is briefly mentioned here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus#Subjective_tinnitus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus#Subjective_tinnitus</a> , citing <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/38/13452" target="_blank">http://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/38/13452</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also useful to know that in brains that hear fine and do not have tinnitus, <strong>many auditory neurons fire action potentials even in silence</strong> (this is caused by random movement of hair cell stereocilia). With normal hearing and in a normal acoustic environment, your brain filters out this activity because there are many other things around that are much louder (and cause auditory neurons to fire more action potentials). If the brain detects a dramatically lowered level of input due to hearing loss, its attempt to amplify everything might also amplify this spontaneous activity, which is then perceived as a phantom sound, creating tinnitus.</p>
<p><strong>Most of what I’m talking about is covered in a review by Noreña (2011)</strong> “An integrative model of tinnitus based on central gain controlling neural sensitivity.” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094182" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094182</a> (sorry probably paywalled beyond the abstract)</p>
<p>That being said, u/vir_innominatus emphasized expertly that tinnitus is very heterogeneous and difficult to study. What I’ve said above is mostly from easy to study scenarios, mostly in animal models. There’s just so much we don’t know yet.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, here’s an incomplete list of Google-able neuroscientists trying to figure out the details: Susan Shore, Thanos Tzounopoulos, Arnaud Noreña, J. Eggermont, David McAlpine, whose papers you can find on their webpages, PubMed, or Google Scholar.</p>
