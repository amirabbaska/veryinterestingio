		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cultural variances. Being nice and being polite aren't the same thing. Some cultures value being polite (abiding by perceived social norms to avoid conflict), some value being honest even if it is abrasive and &quot;not nice&quot;. </p>
<p>A polite person won't tell you you're being an idiot to your face. A nice person will help you avoid looking like an idiot in future interactions with other people. Polite people may talk about you behind your back to their friends and the greater community saying you're an idiot even if they tolerate you on the surface. That's where the insidious aspect of being &quot;polite&quot; comes into play. Just because someone is polite doesn't mean they like you. People confuse being &quot;polite&quot; and being &quot;nice&quot;.</p>
<p>There are some cultures where if you do something that makes you stand out, people will tell you about it bluntly. That's considered &quot;not nice&quot; but in many ways people learn from the experience faster than cultures that promote social cohesion (nice) over corrective communication.

<p>Now... the fact that the homeless guy was rude to you when he found out you were from the USA may have more to do with the fact that you are from the USA than the fact that he is in Canada.  Some people don't agree with American policy world wide.  Some people don't like American arrogance (my husband is American and he can be very arrogant at times).</p>
<p>Generally speaking though, Canadians are more chill than Americans, and tend to be more polite (which is akin to being nice).  Canadians tend to hold doors open for others (although to be fair this is not as common as it used to be) and to apologize to others even for the slightest of wrong doings.  </p>
<p>I am in my 50's and will say that over all Canadians now are less nice than they used to be but I attribute that to the general growing population, and more stress.</p>

You know how you can compress a jpeg image to shrink the file size but make it less detailed even though the physical dimensions of the image stays the same? Youtube does mostly the same thing, but to the video instead. When you chose 4k instead of 1080p youtube doesn't compress the files as much when it gives it to you to watch, thus leading into a better video even though the physical dimensions of the video for you is the same (at 1080p) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A 1080p video is usually 4:2:0. That means that for every 4 pixels, there are 4 pixels worth of luminance data. 2 larger pixels for part of the color data and zero pixels for the other part</p>
<p>4k video encoded in 4:2:0 has doble resolution. And obviously double color resolution</p>
<p>So a 4k 4:2:0 video is equivalent to a 2k 4:4:0 video when played in a 2k display</p>

A scaled 4k to 1080p will have a subjectively better visual appeal than one that's captured natively at 1080p. Super sampling your source and downcompressing later will always yeild a more qualitative superior result. A number of factors are at play when down scaling though.

<p>There's no such thing as &quot;transferring cleanliness&quot; much like there's no such thing as &quot;transferring coldness.&quot; Hot things transfer heat to cold objects, much like there was a net transfer of (temporarily) live bacteria from your hands to his. </p>
<p>In reality, what probably happened was a transfer of some bacteria to his hands (which were killed if he still had disinfectant on them like you say), and you took some of the disinfectant onto your hands too, which killed bacteria on your hands as well.</p>
<p>By the way, your body is crawling with bacteria like you wouldn't believe. They aren't bad—your skin exists to keep them out and to control. In most cases, there is no need to disinfect your kids' hands unless you or they have an active cold. And the immune system—especially in childhood—requires stimulation for proper development and function. There's been a slew of research that correlates insufficient exposure to &quot;germs&quot; and other foreign bodies with a higher rate of allergy development as well as autoimmune disorders. One reason for the recent FDA move to pull antibacterial soaps off the market is because they didn't actually do anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Those aren't mutually exclusive, so it could be both. The question would be whether or not you used enough hand sanitizer to destroy the bacteria on both of your hands.  </p>
<p>It's like asking, &quot;If I pour hand sanitizer on my left hand and rub my hands together, am I making my left hand dirtier or my right hand cleaner?&quot;</p>
<p>If you used just enough for his hands, it's likely that the sanitizer took care of the bacteria on his hands, but couldn't kill all of the ones on your hands. If you put too much on his hands, and it was enough for both of you, then ... it's enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The supposedly &quot;sterile&quot; hands after washing are actually a breeding ground for new pathogens. The instant the disinfectant stopped acting (after water rinse) an exponential growth pattern of any and all air born microbes began on your child's hands. the moment you touched his hand, you re-inoculated his hands with whatever was growing on your hands... the cracks and crevices of your wrinkles probably had a different ecology than the smooth surfaces, mites and other slightly larger microbes probably went along with the bacteria, viruses, and whatever else happened to be there... the niches may be slightly different between you and your kid so the end ecology of the two area's likely ended up slightly different.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Germs will always spread to areas of lower concentration given they can stay alive/dangerous in that medium. The adhesive and cohesive properties of microbes depends on many factors and can be quite complex. When you probe smaller regimes, water tension and van der wals forces become significant. But ultimately, a clean hand can only gain dirt and a dirty hand loses dirt to the clean one. If you define cleaning as the subtraction of dirt from something that isn't dirt, then it should be acceptable to say when the dirty hand loses mass in the form of dirt, it is quantifiably getting cleaner. The dirt lost partially escapes into the environment, and the remainder attaches to the clean hand. So if losing mass in dirt is becoming cleaner, the inverse can be said too. As the clean hand gains mass in dirt, the hand becomes dirty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fiber. </p>
<p>The density and, er, stability of feces is a measure of water and fiber, at its most basic. </p>
<p>Consume a proper water and fiber for the 'best' feces. Other things like indigestible sugars also contribute (sugar alcohols like xylitol) by passing through largely intact.  </p>
<p>Long version:</p>
<p>Fecal make-up is based on health and diet. A diet rich in fiber will produce denser, drier (but not too dry, it should still be 'soft' but firm), and sturdier feces. The best wiping feces are the ones you don't have to push out, but come out as a semi solidish 'log' mostly on their own. </p>
<p>When you push, you're forcing fecal matter that may not be 'ready' through a small hole. Imagine pushing a banana through a rubber tube. If the tube and the banana are properly aligned, the banana will slide through easily. If the banana is too soft, you have to press it though, and that causes smearing. </p>
<p>Fiber firms up and gives structure to your feces. Proper water supply allows your colon to coat the feces in a mucus for passing. You need enough fiber to have sturdy feces and enough water for it to be slick. If it's off, then the feces can be too soft for the mucus to help, requiring you to push it out, which smears it like the banana. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The optimal ass-hair length is short but not bare, like facial hair after a week or two of not shaving. I shave once every couple of months and bear the itching for a day in order to get months without a dingle-berry as my reward. Wipes with a bald ass are the worst because your toilet paper tends to get stuck to your skin.  </p>
<p>if you want proof I'm right, take a gob of peanut butter and put it in your hair when it's ~1&quot; long, then try to wipe it out with toilet paper. It gets all in the hair and you can't get it out without a million wipes. If you have a buzz cut it will wipe out much easier.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Timing. It may be a medicine you have to take throughout the day (like every 8 hours for example) rather than all at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unusual use. Some medicines can be used to treat problems they weren't originally developed for. This may require an uncommon dosage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance. Insurance is <em>really weird</em> and may only pay for a certain size of pill. They may agree to pay for 10mg pills but not 20mg pills, so if you need 20mg a day, the fastest and easiest way to get around insurance shenanigans is instructing you to take 2 10mg pills instead of 1 20mg pill. Otherwise, your doctor will have to write your insurance a letter explaining that yes you need this and they should cover it or you'll have to pay out of pocket for it. Usually the pharmacy will contact the doctor and ask for permission to substitute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pharmacy is out of the larger size. This happens from time to time. Again, they'll clear this with the doctor first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It just doesn't exist in a bigger size. Drug companies make their medicines in commonly used dosage types. Smaller is generally better. You can usually just take more pills if you need a bigger dosage, with some exceptions, but it's harder when you need a smaller dosage and only bigger pills exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger pill sizes may be available only with a prescription, but the smaller ones can be bought over the counter. Ibuprofen (Advil) is an example of this. You can buy 200mg pills over the counter, but 600mg and up require prescriptions. In this case, the pharmacist can't give you the bigger pill unless you have a prescription from your doctor saying you need it. But giving you smaller ones is a-ok.</p>
</li>
<li>Bigger pills can be a pain to swallow. Going back to the ibuprofen example, if you've seen the larger sizes, they're huge. Swallowing them can be difficult, especially if the patient is a child or elderly, so going with smaller pill sizes or the medicine in a liquid form would be better for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's probably more that I didn't think of, but these are really the most common.</p>

<p>Possible reasons why different people might need different doses: weight, size, severity of issue, etc. </p>
<p>Another reason is that some pills can just become uncomfortable to swallow/digest. Think of NyQuil pills. You're supposed to take 2. Imagine that, in one giant pill - hardly comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>I'm not looking for a solution - I'm interested to why this happens.  Bacteria Poo is my favourite so far. </li>
<li>Yes, a clothes horse is a real thing. Maybe it's a UK term, but it's essentially a multi-story rigid washing line that sits in your house. (credit to the dude who posted Gandalf.) </li>

<p>Note that most laundry detergents never claim to be antibacterial/antifungal because the wash cycle or its temperature isn't the &quot;antibacterial&quot; component of washing. It removes dirt and oils generally.</p>
<p>It IS the drying of the clothes that kills the bacteria and mold and prevents further growth. This is why slightly damp clothes that aren't fully dry, can end up smelling after a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>googled it:</p>
<p>Clothes that have recently been washed may smell sour due to a build up of soap scum inside the washing machine. Bacteria and mold grow in the dampness of the washing machine and feed on soap scum, which is typically made up of body oils, skin and soap residue.</p>
<p>To prevent the sour smell from freshly washed clothing, clean, sanitize, and deodorize the gaskets, dispensers and drum of the washing machine. Remove the soap, bleach and fabric softener dispensers, and wash them in the sink. Clean the rubber door seal, or gasket, with an old toothbrush or cotton swab and a solution of 1 cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of bleach.
After surface grime on the inside surfaces has been wiped away, sanitize the washer by setting the wash cycle to hot and adding 4 cups of chlorine bleach to a top-loading washing machine and 2 cups of bleach to a front-loading washing machine. Pause the cycle halfway through, and let the bleach water soak in the basin for 30 minutes. The bleach water eliminates the bacteria and mold that has been growing in the unreachable crevices of the washing machine. Drain the bleach water, run a water-only rinse cycle to remove all leftover bleach, and use a water and vinegar solution to deodorize the washing machine and remove hard water stains. Add 4 cups of vinegar for a top-loading washer and 2 cups for a front-loading washer, and set the cycle to hot. Let the solution soak for 30 minutes, and rinse the machine with plain water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When in doubt, draw a free body diagram. In case you are unfamiliar, this where you draw arrows for all the known forces on &quot;body&quot; or object. We do this because of Newton's Law, and use it to help us better understand motions or stress on objects. We also take advantage of the fact that F(orce)=M(ass) x A(cceleration)</p>
<p>On the hovering magnet, it is motionless, so we know A = 0. Same for the magnet resting on the surface. On both magnets, we have multiple forces acting, but they all must cancel out, because no objects are accelerating. Since the directions exactly oppose each other the forces exactly cancel out, and there is no acceleration. </p>
<p>For the hovering magnet, we know the force of gravity is equal to the mass of the magnet times the acceleration of gravity. Since it is stationary, the magnetic force is exactly canceling out the force due to gravity.</p>
<p>For the magnet resting on a surface, we know the force of gravity is also the mass of the second magnet times the acceleration of gravity. We also know, since every action has an equal and opposite reaction (think of it as the hovering magnet pushing back on the resting magnet), that this magnetic force is equal to the gravitational force in the hovering magnet. But, since the stationary magnet is also not moving, we know there is a force opposite in direction that exactly matches the sum of the gravitational force and the magnet force on the resting magnet. The &quot;normal force&quot; of the surface pushing back against the magnet is equal to the sum of the force of gravity on the resting magnet, plus the force of gravity on the hovering magnet. Normal force is the &quot;effective weight&quot;, as that is what you would see read out on a scale. But, normal force is not the weight. </p>
<p>Thought experiment: imagine both magnets lose their magnetism, and now are just resting on top of each other. What are the forces acting on each body now? What is different and the same between this scenario and the scenario you bring up?</p>
<p>Edit: So to explicitly answer your question, the resting magnet does not &quot;gain weight&quot; by repelling a hovering magnet. If you put it on a scale, this would appear to be the case, but in fact, but that is because scales actually measure the normal force they exert, not the weight of the object on them. The term &quot;weight&quot; is reserved for the force of gravity on an object due to <em>its own mass</em>. Consider when you measure yourself on a scale, and a friend pushes down on your shoulders. Do you weigh more because a friend is pushing you harder into the scale? Do you weigh less if your friend is slightly lifting you upwards? The answer is no, the scale is simply reading out the normal force it is exerting, which is simply your weight plus any outside forces it must counteract to stop your acceleration.</p>

<p>Although I'd be careful about saying &quot;weight placed&quot;- the force applied is via the magnetic force interacting between the two, it just happens to be equal to the weight in this particular set up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question has already been answered but I'd like to try a simpler explanation</p>
<p>Let's list down the forces involved </p>
<p>The <strong>top magnet</strong> is affected by gravity so it has a force going <strong>down</strong>. But it's also affected​ by the magnetic force of the bottom magnet so that's a force going <strong>up</strong>. Together they cancel each other out so the top magnet floats.</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom magnet</strong> is affected by gravity so it has a force going <strong>down</strong>. <em>And</em> it's also affected by the magnetic force from the top magnet, so that's another force going <strong>down</strong>. Together it totals the weight of both magnets!</p>
<p>I tried my best to explain it without difficult words or needing prerequisite knowledge but I couldn't find a simpler word for force. Any suggestions are welcome</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is pulling both magnets down towards the center of the earth.  The electromagnetic force is then pushing as well - each magnet pushes on the other.  The force is strong enough at close distances (as they follow the inverse square law) to push stronger than gravity. But just as the bottom magnet pushes up, the top, hovering magnet is pushing down with the magnetic force. </p>
<p>So the bottom magnet has both gravity pulling it into the ground and the magnetic force pushing it into the ground. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best answer anybody can give is that some gene (or most likely genes) on chromosome 21 is responsible.  We don't have a specific answer to the question yet.</p>
<p>One known factor, however, that almost certainly plays a role is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23452080" target="_blank">overexpression of a gene associated with collagen.</a>  Collagen plays a major role in the development of many different structures in the body such as bone, muscle, tendons, and cartilage.  Needless to say, anything that affects these is going to have a drastic affect on one's appearance.  It's also likely that this is responsible for many of the other issues associated with Down's such as muscular deficiency, weak joints, and cardiovascular problems.  There are many more factors involved but to my knowledge, this seems to be the one that's most responsible for many of Down's most identifiable traits.</p>
<p>It's also worth looking at the genetics behind the disorder.  First off, there is very little variation across typical humans: roughly 99.5% of genes will be the same when comparing one person to another.  Down's syndrome, however, is the addition of an entire chromosome.  Humans have 46 chromosomes so an additional chromosome equates to roughly a 2% difference from the norm.  This means somebody with Down's is effectively 4x more different from you or me than we are from each other.  Furthermore, since 99.5% of genetic material will be the same, virtually all of the differences due to Down's syndrome that are present in one person will also be present in the next.  In short, instead of just having a few random individual variations from person to person you have a large set of common variations from a normal person to a person with Down's.  Of course, this is a gross simplification but it illustrates the principles at hand.</p>
<p>As you can see, it's really 3 different questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What mechanisms are responsible for the typical Down's morphology?
(We're not entirely sure but differences in collagen probably play a major role)</li>
<li>Why do we see a similar morphology across different cases of Down's?
(Because it's a common set of genes that are affected)</li>
<li>Why do these differences stand out more than the typical differences across normal humans even when looking at diverse populations?
(The variation associated with Down's is much larger than the typical variation from one person to another)</li>
</ol>
<p>That's the best I can do to explain it, hopefully it tells you what you wanted to know.  And of course, please correct me if I'm wrong on anything or add on if you see something important is missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Facial dysmorphologies are quite common among syndromes that affect the body globally (as opposed to only affecting one organ or body part). Sometimes these are highly recognizable but often they are quite subtle - deep set eyes or thin lips or a broad nasal bridge or low ears or other things that are within the range of normal, yet are typical of the condition. Clinical geneticists have a picture book (presumably online now but a book when I saw it) of photos that guide them towards possible diagnoses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers address the ways in which the face is changed by the genetic differences of Down syndrome, but you are asking why they are all similar in appearance, not just why they are different from those with two copies of chromosome 21.</p>
<p>The fact is that people with Down syndrome have quite different-looking faces from each other, too. Search google images for the syndrome and you'll find a bunch of faces and, while they all have to a greater or lesser extent those characteristic features, they are clearly discernibly different. It doesn't erase racial differences in facial structure either - there's an Asian kid on the first page who's obviously Asian (and who obviously has Down's) for instance.</p>
<p>Probably what's going in is a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race_effect" target="_blank">cross-race effect</a> which is the name of the phenomenon whereby it's harder to tell the difference between faces of people whose race you're less familiar with. (Hence the well-known racist remark, &quot;black people all look the same&quot; - an offensive exaggeration of a real effect.)</p>
<p>The faces of those with Down syndrome amount to a kind of &quot;race&quot; in that they share certain typical features which are atypical in the &quot;race&quot; you're most familiar with (i.e. those of your own race who don't have Down's, most likely.) So your brain is able to use things like subtle differences in the angle of a person's eyes, the protrusion of their nose, etc., to discern most people, those parameters are so different in those with Down's that they're off the charts as far as your brain's face-recognition is concerned. That makes them seem more similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I won't bore you with the specifics regarding aetiology, but essentially Down's is due to a an extra chromosome leading to significant neural and physical defects, one of which is their 'similar' appearance as you term it.</p>
<p>Those with Down's appear to have a significant degree of deficiency in midfacial area, mandibular area, and endocranial area1, perhaps due to muscular atrophy caused by the disease.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why they look similar is down to human conditioning. In simple terms, we are very adept at noticing facial differences in our own race, however often, we look at other races, black, asian etc. and cannot differentiate as well between the faces2. This is what occurs with those with Down's syndrome; we see a similar trait and assume they all 'look the same'. This is obviously not the case as those with Down's syndrome often have very different features, but we can't see past this human trait of recognising those similar to us, far better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They are spending a ton of money on litigation and lobbying to be allowed to operate, since most urban areas had strict regulations on taxi services. They are fighting law suits, they are hiring lobbyist to pitch legislation changes to allow them to operate.</p>
<p>Uber also needs to build a symbiotic network of drivers and passengers in order for their platform to work. Drivers don't drive if there's no passengers, and customers won't use this service is they can't dependably get a ride when they need one. This means sign-on bonuses to drivers and discounts/artificially low fares to lure in passengers to build up a base of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Once they've established that they can operate legally, and have a base of drivers and passengers, then those expenses taper off considerably and the make profits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
