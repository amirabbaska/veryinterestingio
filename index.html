		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>What is the Big Bang?</h2>
<p>The origin of your confusion seems to be the very common misconception that the big bang originated from one point in space. That is not true. </p>
<p>But let's back up a little:The observable universe is the sum of all points in space that are causally connected to earth. That means, it is a sphere around earth encompassing all the space from which photons have had the time to reach earth since the big bang ~13 billion years ago. </p>
<p>This observable universe was indeed compressed into a tiny portion of space shortly after the big bang. However, the observable universe is by far not all there is. Current data shows, that the universe is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe" target="_blank">probably at least 3*10^(23) times bigger</a> than the observable universe. And many cosmologists believe that the universe is infinitely big. </p>
<p>Hence, the big bang did not occur at one point in space, but everywhere at one. Which is why the name big bang is horrible. Henry Reich from MinutePhysics argues that the Big Bang should be renamed into Everywhere Stretch in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3MWRvLndzs" target="_blank">this</a> video. (You should definitely check this video out, it does a good job explaining your very question.)</p>
<p>The Cosmic Background Radiation is the residual radiation from a time shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe cooled down enough to become transparent to photons. And the photons we detect on earth have traveled since that moment and are reaching us just now. </p>
<h2>Can we see Background Radiation from everywhere in the universe, or is earth somehow special?</h2>
<p>One of the most fundamental assumptions of cosmology is that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous - which is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">cosmological principle</a>. That means by and large the universe looks the same in all directions and at all points. This suggests, that earth is <em>not</em> special in being able to see Cosmic Background Radiation. Indeed, every observer, anywhere in the universe is in the center of their own observable universe and will receive CMB (cosmic microwave background) from the edge of <em>their</em> observable universe. Thus, the question what it looks like to stand at the edge of the observable universe cannot be answered in any meaningful way. An observer is <em>always</em> at the center of their own observable universe, so - by definition - there cannot be an observer at the edge of an observable universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So does this mean 14 billion light years away we can look at the big bang itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! Although, due to the expansion of spacetime it is actually more like 46.6 billion light years away, and what we can actually see is the time when the universe was full of a hot, glowing plasma. That plasma was opaque (can't see much through glowing clouds) so we can't actually observe even more into the past because light from then ran into the glowing clouds at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do we somehow see the same singularity everywhere in the edge of the observable universe in any direction? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite, but sort of in the sense that everywhere was the singularity at one point. What we see is the period where the universe was close and very hot, but not when it was a singularity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And this is visible anywhere in the universe for the boundary of the snapshot particular to that point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by this, but any other point in the universe would be able to see the same thing as we do relative to their location. Their visible universe would be centered on their location.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

	</div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that a lot of sites store password hashes rather than actual plain text passwords. And when the user types in their password, the plain text is put through a hashing process (like MD5 or SHA-256) and then the output (the hash) of that process is actually used to authenticate the user. So when someone hacks a website they usually end up with hashed passwords rather than actual passwords.</p>
<p>I've always heard that it is impossible (or at least so difficult it is practically impossible) to reverse the hashing process (i.e. you can't take a hash and turn it into plain text) unless you just brute force a ton of plain text strings and compare the hashes. </p>
<p>So my question is, why can't hashing be reversed?</p>
<p>Related question - could machine learning be used to reverse hashing? If a computer using machine learning tried to find patterns between hashes and respective plain text, could it get there eventually?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hashing is destructive. To take an easy example that's easier to wrap your head around, we can make our own hashing algorithm. </p>
<p>For simplicity, imagine we have a password system where users have 4-digit pin codes as passwords.</p>
<p>So a real simple hash would be something like this: </p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a number between 1111 and 9999 (3456)</li>
<li>Multiply the number by itself (3456 * 3456 = 11 943 936)</li>
<li>Store the last three digits as the password (936)</li>
</ol>
<p>Turning 3456 into 936 was real simple - Turning 936 into 3456 is very hard. </p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a few not-to-rare caveats that occur, such as the need to use salts to prevent identical passwords from rendering identical hashes and avoid excessive truncation of both the input data and the stored hash. In our system above, for instance, any input that results in 936 will be a valid password, which means we have a high rate of collisions, which is bad. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So my question is, why can't hashing be reversed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because each calculation in hashing offers a single and straightforward option going forward; but multiple options in reverse.</p>
<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://fluidpowerjournal.com/2013/10/teslas-conduit/" target="_blank">Tesla's valvular conduit</a> &ndash; a valve without moving parts? A hash function is hard to reverse for similar reasons. Each step is more difficult in one direction than the other. When you chain enough steps together, the difficulty multiplies in a way that flow in the wrong direction is close to impossible.</p>
<p>Imagine you're at one of the source flows that join a large river. It's very straightforward to go downstream and end up where the river meets the ocean. Every turn is obvious - you always go downstream. However, if you're starting at the ocean, it's very difficult to go back to the place you started. Going up, you have to make countless decisions where the origin streams diverge, and it's highly unlikely you'll make all of them right unless you already know exactly where you're headed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say instead of your password, it's the city you live in that we are trying to verify. If I want to verify that you live in the place you lived before but I don't want to save your actual home city in a database for security reasons, I could calculate something based on your city instead.</p>
<p>One easy thing to do would be to store how many miles away your city is from a given spot, such as Chicago. When you tell me your city again, I can calculate the distance from your city to Chicago and check that against the distance stored in the database. This isn't a great hashing scheme though because you can easily figure out all cities that are X miles away from Chicago and guess what city the person is from. You can make this kind of check harder by making the distance calculation more complex. So instead of just straight line distance, maybe you map an actual travel route between the two cities, then maybe add 1 to your distance count for every mile traveled North, subtract one for every mile traveled West, etc. Now when someone sees &quot;42&quot; in the database, it's not clear if the city is 42 miles North, or 70 miles North and 28 miles West, etc. Ideally, the results for your calculation seems like a random number, so that if one city's code is 122, a city right next to it could just as easily be 25 as 429, there should be no correlation between similarities in the city geography and the code you generate. As long as it's just a set of simple math operations to calculate that distance number, the system can easily create a code for any city and then recalculate the same code later to verify.</p>
<p>There's still a problem though. Let's say New York's distance code is 149. Since this distance calculation itself isn't secret (if it works well it would be used for all kinds of websites and software), someone could just make a list of every major city and its corresponding distance code when compared to Chicago. So later if you find 149 in a leaked database, you know every user with that code is probably from New York. The solution is salting, which basically makes each calculation more unique. So instead of calculating distance from Chicago every time, you could calculate from a random city every time. Instead of user1:149, user2:149, user3:149, for three users from New York being stored in the database, it could be user1:149 from Chicago, user2:418 from Miami, user3:12 from San Francisco, so that now every user from New York has a different code stored. Now if someone wants to be able to know every user that lives in New York, they have to do the work of calculating the distance to New York from every other possible city that the system uses.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is missing from all of the answers so far is a statement of just how hard cracking is.  A hash function is a mathematical function, or algorithm, that takes some string as input, and produces a number as output.  It has the property that given the same input, it produces the same output.</p>
<p>A modern, cryptograhic hash function does this in a way that is hard to reverse.  That is, given the output if the hash function it is hard to find an input that, if run through the hash function, will produce that output.</p>
<p>How hard?  Hard enough that mathematicians believe there is no algorithm for reversing the hash function that is faster than trying all possible inputs until you find one that works.  (Note: belief is not the same as proof.  No hash function has been proven to be this strong, yet.)</p>
<p>The number of possible passwords is very, very large, so trying them all is not practical.  Nor will it ever be practical.</p>
<p>Passwords as a system are widely regarded as no longer secure, but not because people can reverse the hash algorithms.  People have gotten too good at coming up with plausible passwords you might have used, or at stealing your password.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First, it is designed to be hard.  In mathematics, there are functions that get harder when you reverse them.  It is typically easier to multiply than divide, or to raise to a power rather than taking a root.  A well designed hash takes this to the extreme, and is a function that is computationally infeasible to reverse.</p>
<p>Second, hashes lose information.  They aren't encoding the information, they are taking its fingerprint.  The best you can to is find one of the infinite number of strings that created that hash.  Now if that string turned out to be &quot;Password123&quot; and not &quot;a67ab5ba895526eb3a7695c7b16bd910&quot;, you could be reasonably sure you had the password...just not completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are a ton of reasons why a placebo might work:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a mind-body connection and psychosomatic therapies are valid</li>
<li>people pretend or believe themselves to be sick when they are not</li>
<li>people misreport disease symptoms and therapy effects</li>
<li>diseases can cure themselves given time</li>
<li>diet and environment cure diseases</li>
<li>statistical data and double-blind tests are the only valid medical evidence and drug development method</li>
</ul>
<p>New-age and alternative medicine play up the possibility of mind-body connection and that positive thinking, prayer, energy etc. cure diseases. This approach is unprovable and not scientific.</p>
<p>In addition to the various circumstantial and accidental factors, there is the pragmatic statistical approach that indirectly takes all factors and hypothesis into consideration. Thus, modern medicine focuses on validating (rather than explaining) drugs and therapies via placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has less to do with our minds being able to cure our ills, and more to do with changing our perception. Imagine a light is blinking steadily one second on, one second off. Now imagine that you are told every 3rd blink is slightly longer than the rest. You might then perceive this as so even though the light is blinking at a steady rate. What matters is that your perception of the event is altered. It is very difficult for us to make purely objective observations of things without measuring devices like a watch or instruments to measure things we want to observe. </p>
<p>Since we don't have instruments like this that tell you how much pain you are in, or how healthy you are, or how stressed you are, it is much more subjective to your perception and other factors can easily influence your experience. </p>
<p>Your body actually has 3 brains so to speak. There is your brain, your involuntary nervous system, and the enteric nervous system in your gut. Each has nerve communication with the other, but also each can operate independent of the others. So for instance if you feel threatened, you can force yourself to be calm, but you can't force your body not to produce adrenaline and prep you for fight or flight. That is an involuntary reaction you are powerless to control. </p>
<p>However you can practice breathing techniques to try to control your heart rate which can affect body temperature and relaxation. That is a far cry from the mind healing wounds or telling your liver to metabolize alcohol faster etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This could include this mystical mind over body effect but it is mostly a mix of biases, from the patient and the scientist and external effects. For example, if I would conduct a research about a new pill for pain reduction and some of my patients take aspirin but don't report it, it will show up in my data set as positive even in my control group. It serves as a way to remove these factors if we assume they will effect all groups the same way. An example of researcher bias could be two doctors having slightly different idea of, let say, a cured tumor. Two different research on the same treatment will show different results but factoring the placebo effect with a control group should show the same results. This is also why, if you look at the control group of similar researches on the same treatment you will often see different effect, because they do not have the same way of looking at data. Then there is the problem of reported effect vs real effect. A patient can report positive effect of a placebo because, while they do not experience any physiological effect, they feel they must report it as working because, &quot;hey this must work right?&quot;. You will thus see very strange results if you compare reported data of let say, asthma attacks with a bio metric measurement, here, lung strength. The placebo affect is a great tool of analysis because most medical experiments is done on humans by humans in an open environment and we need a way factor for all the implicit biases and uncontrollable factor that are not cause by what we are observing but it is not a therapeutic method and was never meant to be. There might be an influence of the body in healing, but we should not jump at this conclusion before considering all the others, more plausible influences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI(Actually)5:</p>
<p>Let's use our imaginations and pretend that you and your best friend are playing outside on a sunny day, and you both fall down and get an owie (scientifically referred to as a boo-boo) in the exact same way. </p>
<p>Your mommy is outside watering the lawn and she sees you when you start to cry. She comes over and kisses your boo-boo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile your friend's mommy is in her house drinking Rosé and thinking about what a mistake it was to get married so young, so your best friend's has to settle for his weird aunt Placebo (you know she's weird because her name is Placebo and she has a weird mole on her face) kissing his boo-boo.</p>
<p>Now you obviously feel better because mommy kisses are a very effective scientifically proven cure for boo-boos. But everyone knows weird aunt kisses don't actually do a thing to help fix a boo-boo, and your friend has also stopped crying! So what happened? Why does Aunt Placebo have such a noticeable effect?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maybe both of your boo-boos would have felt better anyway after a few minutes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the act of kissing the boo-boo, even from a weird aunt, somehow distracts your friend and makes him think his boo-boo is better even if the underlying boo-boo is still there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe your friend stops crying because his aunt is a grown-up and he knows that grown-ups like to think that they helped (the word &quot;Placebo&quot; comes from a Latin word that means &quot;I shall please&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe in the process of your friend's aunt kissing his boo-boo, he (accidentally or on purpose) rubbed some dirt on it (another scientifically proven pain reliever almost as good as mommy kisses) and you didn't notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe your friend's brain has an (as-yet unidentified by science) secret magic store of mommy kisses that it releases after getting a kiss from someone other than his mommy.</p>
</li>
<li>Maybe more than one of these could be happening at the same time!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you had to put these possibilities in order from the highest to lowest chance of being right, where would you put the magic brain one? Is it more likely that the brain has a secret magic power that science hasn't found yet? Or that something else caused your friend's boo-boo to feel better? Probably the &quot;something else&quot; right?</p>
<p>It turns out that it's really hard to study boo-boo cures while getting rid of the things that are higher on the list, so there is a very good chance that something else besides the magic secret store of mommy kisses is going on. We should probably just assume that the Aunt Placebo effect is from one or more of those, before we jump to the conclusion that Aunt Placebo gives your brain magic powers.</p>
<p>Now let's get a band-aid on that boo-boo and get you back outside, eh sport?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are stages of sleep where you take in next to no outside information--you are dead to the world, basically. There are lighter stages of sleep where you take in more information and can be easily woken up. We cycle through many stages in a night of normal sleep, which means there will be several points during the night when sleep is light and you are more likely to be disturbed.</p>
<p>Your brain also doesn't remember much in REM/deep sleep, while you remember more in lighter stages of sleep. You literally forget that you hit deep sleep.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that mess up deep stages of sleep: alcohol, sedative-hypnotics like benzos and z-drugs, some mental illness, some sleep disorders, etc. If you aren't hitting dead-to-the-world deep sleep, of course you will be woken up more easily.</p>
<p>Problems like hypervigilance can disturb sleep because you are basically scanning for a reason to find a threat, and it's pretty hard to fall asleep with that sort of anxiety.</p>
<p>Thay said, research suggests that outside of major sleep disorders, the difference between good sleep and bad sleep is highly subjective. Many people who consider themselves light or poor sleepers are actually quite average.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: this got bigger than I thought it would, so I would like to take a minute to get on my own small soapbox:</strong></p>
<p>If you are concerned about your own sleep, <em>please please please</em> talk to your doctor. There are thousands of things that impact sleep. Don't leave it to strangers on the internet. Your health and well-being are worth it. </p>
<p>/u/none_shall_pass touched on sleep apnea, which I didn't mention, but I think it warrants extra attention. [The Mayo Clinic has a good overview.] (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/basics/symptoms/con-20020286" target="_blank">http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/basics/symptoms/con-20020286</a>)</p>
<p>If you are concerned about anxiety, hypervigilance, or anything else related to mental health, <em>please please please</em> think about reaching out for help. Doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors, social workers, mental health clinics, school counsellors, campus counsellors, online counselling resources, workplace employee assistance programs, mental health advocacy organizations, whatever is available in your area. Anyone can learn skills to feel better and handle the ups and downs of life more easily. And everyone deserves to feel well and healthy.</p>

<p>The short answer is, it's not fully known why this occurs. Humans have a wide range of variability in our species (by the way, current top comment keeps referring to subspecies of humans sleeping different, that's some false terminology), and thus behave and interact with the environment in an equally wide range of ways. </p>
<p>Add to this situational events such as lack of recent sleep, stress, or even familiarity with the area you are sleeping in, and it is more understandable why this variation occurs. That's not to say there is or isn't one overarching reason, but mainly that many factors influence how a person sleeps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It <em>highly</em> depends to what you wake up for.
Young mothers wake up to anything that sounds like baby crying. While some other sounds don't seem to matter at all.</p>
<p>For me, I'm a really deep sleeper and can easily shut down 7 alarms without even remembering I woke up to do this.
I once woke up, lit a cigarette, got long-time-no-nicotine-dizziness, fall asleep again and didn't even wake up when half of my duvet burned down. Thank god my dog started barking like mad due smoke.</p>
<p>But whenever I - before falling asleep - give myself mental command &quot;if it rings, get up, get up&quot;, I jump up like a spring, sometimes even a minute BEFORE first alarm. And like a fool, wonder if I have a superpower like Jack Reacher or something to tell time in my head. Even weirder that it has nothing to do with tiredness level, sometimes I play games till 5 and still jump up at 8, just because I told myself to do this before falling asleep. Telling yourself to wake up doesn't sound very convincing when you're dead tired, but for some reason, it works. For me at least. 90% of time or so.</p>
<p>There is antidote to this: cold room with super warm blankets. If that happens, and especially if room gets warmer in the morning, there's no sound or force in the world that can wake you up. My dad used to lit the stove in the early hours to warm the room up in our country house (military smarts, probably) and I remember those days as absolutely most luxurious sleep I've ever gotten. I woke up and felt like I've gained super health and energy.</p>
<p>I think It's how brain and conscious are wired. I think your ears don't really turn off while you sleep, but your mind wires what ears should consider important and what not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense for a communication-based species to have members that can be in constant &quot;guard mode&quot; in case of any overnight danger so that they can alert their whole tribe. But because most of the time there is no danger and the light sleepers will wake up because a cat meowed, you don't want everybody to be light sleepers, because fully rested members of the tribe are more efficient for the daily work.  </p>
<p>So basically what happens it that evolutionary speaking, a humanoid sub-species with only light sleepers will lose in combat or any less brutal competition to well rested enemies and, over generations, eventually go extinct. A humanoid sub-species with only deep sleepers will get regularly robbed from their resources overnight or even murdered in their sleep by predators/competitors; eventually going extinct. The subspecies with a mix of both, however, will thrive; and that's our ancestors.  </p>
<p>Like many evolutionary traits, sleeping variety is an artefact of a time it was more useful than in nowadays' society. But since it's not really detrimental to our survival, that characteristic is still around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most of the time we can simply make noise to show that something is wrong, but some times, when we are suffocating for example, we have no way to express that we are in danger. Here, crying can be the solution to let others know we need help.  </p>
<p>Now, crying or being extremely happy aren't 'normal' situations, so the body interprets this as 'wrong'. Even though being extremely happy isn't bad, it's still seen as abnormal by the body, and thus a potential danger to our survival. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A huge part of human survival roots in compassion and empathy. If something is wrong, you <strong>have</strong> to communicate it to others.</p>

<hr />
<p>In order to answer this question, we need a working definition of 'emotion'. To this end, we can use the definition proposed by Tooby &amp; Cosmides (1990) of <em>adaptations that have arisen in response to the adaptive problem of mechanism orchestration</em>. In layman's terms, emotions help us make sense of our environments and circumstances.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of evolutionary psychology, it's likely that emotions developed and were cultivated/refined through the process of repeated encounters with stressors that required early humans to process information quickly and accurately. Situations such as mate-stealing, encroaching on territory, finding a mate, and death of other humans lead to recognizable patterns of behavior that became ingrained in human behavior as emotional responses. </p>
<p>We can see a perfectly good example in <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.337.109&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Tooby &amp; Cosmides (2000)</a>. Most people experience fear when it is dark, to varying degrees. It is likely that this is a relic of a time when humans needed to be aware of nocturnal predators. Fear served the purpose of making early humans more cautious and avoiding situations where they may be hunted or killed. Humans that exhibited a fear of the dark and utilized it to avoid dangerous situations had a better survival rate than those that did not, leading to the residual fear of the dark we experience today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming there is some form of selection pressure favouring emotional development then presumably this is how emotions developed in humans.</p>
<p>In your examples there is no evidence that 'love' would spontaneously occur in a formerly emotionless species, however it seems plausible that there would be favorable pressure towards individuals that experienced love (for example leading to pair bonding, more successful mating and so forth)</p>
<p>Equally with anger, I think its fair to assume that hardship would be common throughout early human history and individuals who experienced anger in response to injustice could be more fit than those that did not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to someone like Paul Ekman the basic emotions (Ekman identifies at least five: joy, sadness, surprise, anger, and fear) and their non-verbal facial cues should be considered universal. This is in accordance with Charles Darwin's own theory on the development of emotions which you can read about in his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expression_of_the_Emotions_in_Man_and_Animals" target="_blank">The Expressions of the Emotions in the Man and Animals</a>. This is in line with the response given by /u/NawtAGoodNinja, which is clearly given from an evolutionary perspective. </p>
<p>The anthropologist Margaret Mead disagreed with Ekman and instead  claimed that the development of emotional expression are more dependent on behavioural learning, and therefore not universal. This is also what the answer by /u/Glaselar reflects. </p>
<p>Both answers reflect two sides in a debate that is still ongoing. John Dewey also critiqued what he saw to be Darwin's functionalist view on emotions (see <a href="https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Dewey/Dewey_1894a.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Dewey/Dewey_1895.html" target="_blank">here</a>). So it is difficult to say who is in the right. However, it is important to note that a lot of evolutionary psychology is theories grounded in speculation with very little evidence backing up individual theories. That is not to say that there can be no truth to them, but simply that we have to be careful in our assumptions. </p>
<p>I don't think there is an actual and conclusive backed-by-science answer to your question, OP. At least not at this moment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer: No, that's likely not how it happened.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Acquired traits are almost never passed on. Evolution requires that something is heritable, and that requires it to be genetically encoded. You can't change your genes in response to your life.</p>
<p>It's much more likely that the desire to find a mate and to find food (neither of which require emotions) were more successfully acted upon by those whose genetic programming not only gave them instincts to find food but also to zealously guard what they'd won. That made them more successful at having more offspring. That act made their genes more prevalent in the population, thus making emotional acts evolutionarily important. </p>
<p>With the exception of epigenetics, which is a change in the way existing genes are turned on or off rather than the development of new gene variants, it's not possible to train something into a heritable feature.</p>

They would be there, just not easy to detect. </p>
<p>Gravitational waves are emitted, in layman's terms, when the system has some kind of asymmetry. I.e. the system I just described is different to, say, if we crushed the earth into tiny rocks and spread them in a perfect circular orbit round the sun.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason that a choir can sound fuller than a soloist, or an orchestra can sound fuller than a single instrument. It is very difficult for multiple singers or instruments to be perfectly in pitch with each other all the time. These slightly detuned pitches get averaged together when we hear them and this leads to a thick and full sound. </p>
<p>We can produce this artificially by doing the same thing, take a tone and split it into several tones each slightly detuned from the others and we call this a chorus effect. The sound of 1980's pop guitars was heavily influenced by this. </p>
<p>However, when there is just one tone that is out of tune, this causes 'beating' which is when the sound waves sync up in an irregular pattern and it sounds harsh. </p>
<p>When two tones are in tune, they either sound at the same frequency, or at perfect divisions of that frequency. For instance 440hz and 880hz sound good together because the 880 vibrates exactly twice for every vibration of the 440. It adds up. </p>
<p>But 440hz and 450hz do not perfectly match up, and so it causes the sound to fluctuate unharmonically leading to beating. </p>
<p>To put it another way, music is math that we can hear. Chords are fractions and if the fractions divide evenly, it sounds good. If the fractions do not divide evenly, it sounds bad. When you hear about people comparing music to math, this is what they are talking about. Each note has a numeric value in hertz, and chords are formed by taking a root note or root tone in hz and producing complimentary tones that divide well with that root note. Notes that do not divide well will produce chaotic waves that break up the simplicity of the root tone instead of re-inforcing it and we find this displeasing. So music sounds good because math. ;) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Coulomb -&gt; EM force -&gt; EM interaction -&gt; electroweak interaction -&gt; String Theory?</p>
<p>As the velocities, energies and 1/size of the system being analyzed increases you have to move up this scale. The Coulomb force alone is too simple when you start looking at the electron orbitals of an atom, you need to account for magnetic effects. As you reach the nucleus, the combined electromagnetic force is too simple and you need to account for individual effects such as photon emission, pair production, weak decay (radioactivity). As you start accounting for proton vs proton, you need to look at the nuclear force which is roughly modeled as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_interaction" target="_blank">Yukawa interaction</a> between nucleons. As you look inside nucleons, you need to look at the theory of quantum chromodynamics between quarks and gluons.</p>
<p>To demonstrate why the theories fail, think of the Coulomb force of a pair of parallel plates. The force from the E field is constant between the two plates. Clearly, as you get extremely close to one plate, you start feeling the Coulomb force of individual electrons. At that point, the proximity to those electrons will become a strong effect than the combined E field of the rest of them. The &quot;Parallel Plate Force&quot; is just a low energy theory explaining the Coulomb force. When you get to small distances you need to account for more detail. </p>
<p>In the case of the EM interaction, the Coulomb force is described as the combined force of 10^(big number) photons bouncing back and forth. At a large scale, this seems to be 1/r^2 constant force. At close scale, it's important to account for the individual interactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electron_radius" target="_blank">Classical electron radius</a> is an example of this failure.</p>
<p>So it doesn't go to infinity, but it still exists. The residual strong force between neutrons and protons (caused by one emitting a meson and the other absorbing it) holds them together.</p>
<p>Since mesons decay pretty quickly, so the residual strong force has a short range.</p>
<p>The strong interaction is also known as the color force and is responsible for holding quarks together to make up protons, neutrons, mesons, and other hadrons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
