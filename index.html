<p>Edit:
On second thought, maybe you are describing a gasp? Like when you drink a lot at once and you take a big breath after because you lack air? Maybe that's what you're talking about. It's likely that you make that sound not necessarily because the drink is refreshing, but finding it refreshing causes you to drink a lot at once, thus holding your breath for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Edit:
Third thought, calling it a gasp is incorrect actually. It's an exhale. The gasp comes after that.</p>
<p>Fourth thought, testing it now. I seem to exhale after every gulp I take. The longer I drink, the more exhale that follows. So I believe that's what the explanation is. When the drink is refreshing, you drink more/longer, meaning your exhale will be bigger. But you can exhale without saying &quot;Ah&quot;. Gyms and marathons aren't filled with people constantly going &quot;Ah&quot;. Adding vocals to it is purely theatrics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not a simple video file that you would download from a torrent or through P2P.</p>
<p>It's an adaptive stream using what's probably a proprietary format. Meaning, if your connection slows down, the quality will adapt and look blurry. If your connection is fast, the quality will get better.</p>
<p>Most offline video players support something called variable bitrate (VBR) but it's not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>That isn't really the issue though because if people wanted to get around that and save the videos they could. But the point is that it's not worth the effort when the subscription is so cheap and they can watch the shows immediately when they're released.</p>
<p>With that said, people <em>do</em> download Netflix shows from torrents so it does happen. Also, I believe Netflix started allowing offline viewing not too long ago so that probably makes it easier.</p>
<p>Another important point that makes it more difficult is that Netflix doesn't download the whole movie. If you pause the stream, it will only buffer so much ahead of where you are. This also allows it to pick up where you left off if your computer crashes. So there is a constant communication between your browser and Netflix that makes downloading videos a bit more tricky than they otherwise would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>People don't want to pirate content, its just that when someone wants to charge an unfair price for it, or tie it down with all sorts of BS use restrictions, people will.  Netflix proves that if you ask people to pay a reasonable sum for content and provide it in a nice, easy, manner, you don't have to worry about piracy.</p>

<p>These packets can then contain cookie-specific information that only correctly parse data for the current web client, so copying and pasting the video address into another browser won't work because it lacks the same cookies (or that cookie is already in use).</p>
<p>Most browsers worth their salt let you jump around this though, by holding a record of all packets that were recieved and letting you save them externally.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pirate here. Been doing it for almost 10 years from sites like PirateBay, Demonoid, Kickass and even Mininova (back when it was good). Netflix really can't protect their stuff from being downloaded fully. They can protect it from things like Extensions on Google Chrome (like video downloader professional) but if someone has recording software, like Bandicam, and uploads it on a website? then it can be downloaded of course but the quality isn't that great. However most people don't download Netflix original content (house of Cards, Daredevil..) because the membership fee is so cheap, maybe something like The Walking Dead because it doesn't hit Netflix til later in the year after it finishes off the season on AMC.</p>
<p>Personally I don't see a point in pirating Netflix original shows because of how cheap it is and there are even shows and documentaries that are old enough that you'd be hard pressed to find on any pirating website. The only people who do are those who're tight for cash or live in countries where Netflix isn't available or the show itself is not available on Netflix in their region. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

We also have a patient who is a professional medium.</p>
<p>Personally I think that they're just awful frauds preying on people's emotions and gullibility, but what I do find interesting is that between all of the usual &quot;your father is here, he loves you and is with you always&quot; patter, there is specific, personal information, that they don't really have any way of knowing. Obviously some of it could have been overheard, and I assume guesswork plays a big part; people are more likely to remember the one time the psychic was right over the 20 times they were wrong, especially if they <em>want</em> to believe it. But it still seems too accurate to be pure guesswork.</p>
<p>So, how do they know all this stuff? How are they able to be accurate enough to convince otherwise intelligent, rational people that they can speak to dead people?</p></div></div>

<p>edit: &quot;But (1)some/(2)every situation is manipulative/problematic!&quot;  </p>
<p>(1) For the one's that are problematic, I would absolutely espouse some kind of resolution - do not allow people you care about to be taken advantage of in detrimental ways, or for anyone's superstitions to affect their professional responsibilities.   </p>
<p>(2)<br />
<strong>On the psychic side</strong>, sure - psychics are always manipulative, if not outright delusional. I would probably advocate strictly regulating the whole practice, or at least slapping a bright neon disclaimer on it; it wouldn't take much for me to believe it should be outlawed all together.<br />
<strong>On the believer side</strong>, it is simply false that it is always problematic to believe in psychics or to hold other superstitions. If you think it is <em>always</em> a problem to believe such things, show me an argument that can handle the abundance of counterexamples of people who believe crazy things to the benefit of themselves and those around them. Such counterexamples are by no means the majority, but they're also not uncommon. Simply <em>assuming</em> all situations are identical and that you can apply universal policies to them without taking account of particularity is itself a falsehood, and one that - as I agree is the case with superstition - can <em>often</em> do more harm than good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, for a number of years, while living on the road, I made my way by psychic readings. My grift was using I Ching diviniations. If you were at a Phish concert in the early 90's or other outdoor gathering, I might have been there in my tent. Long hair, beads, sitting cross-legged. My two traveling companions would work the crowd.</p>
<p>They would strike up conversation with somebody. Talk about an amazing experience they just had with a fortune teller. Along the way they would gather some basic information before directing them my way. We had a basic code worked out. Crossed arms. If they had one finger out, the person lost somebody. 2 fingers meant a recent breakup. So on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, doing a reading is a combination of &quot;cold&quot; reads and &quot;hot&quot; reads. &quot;Cold&quot; is where there is <em>no</em> information given before hand.</p>
<p>Here's the big trick. The person giving the read has to both believe in what they're doing and disbelieve at the same time. It's an odd head space to be in.</p>
<p>So the mark is led in, and I see there's one finger up. They say &quot;I heard you do readings?&quot;. I would look up and make eye contact. Longer than is comfortable. When their gaze broke, I would smile and say &quot;I sense a feeling of grief about you. A loss.&quot; and then break into the patter of how the I Ching represents the binary code of the universe, and how all around us are reoccurring patterns that can offer insight.</p>
<p>From there, it's a bit of showmanship. Throw down the sticks, etc.</p>
<p>For a cold reading, it's easier than it seems. First, your mark <em>always</em> gives you free information. Names, relations, etc. You just need to listen. When you parrot them back later, they've forgotten they ever said anything to you in the first place. Next, there are universal experiences that feel unique to every individual. &quot;You feel as if you are underappreciated&quot; or &quot;you feel like you're giving more of your energy than you receive in return&quot;. Everyone has a love they still hold on to that they fail to tell anyone else about. Everyone has memory of a smell that reminds them of someone. Those sorts of things.</p>
<p>You don't even need to be good, or even smart. Memory is an amazing thing. I could get twenty things wrong, but if I got one thing right, the marks memory of the event is that I got <em>everything</em> right.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you're there to listen to them. To offer them a sympathetic ear. You become their confidant. Your advice is vague enough that they apply it to whatever they had already decided to do, and give you credit for it.</p>
<p>After a while, I felt pretty crappy about preying on people in need. Might be why I try to debunk those bastards every chance I get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there are a lot of tricks. involved. </p>
<p>shotgunning - is a basically a technique which gets used all over the place where you say things that are in reality very general but relate to people personally so sound very specific. (see buzzfeeds X number of things show you come from X. hint: they are all very similar)</p>
<p>cold-reading - another technique where you basically spew a lot of bits of information and watch the target for some sort of reaction. people will generally involuntarily react when they hear the beginning of something they are thinking about, like names.<br />
Added into this if the 'medium' is close people will often jump in and correct them, whilst stil believing they are being read. </p>
<p>pre-prep - For much more targeted work, it is very possible to gather a lot of free information about someone before you ever meet. Thinks like twitter and facebook are a treasure trove of information. So if you know the details already you just need to add in the act of diving the information from them.<br />
This also works in studios etc, where they will ask you to do something like fill in a basic survey or give certain details when you buy the ticket for example. </p>
<p>they key thing to remember, is if you are seeing someone do this publicly in some sort of show, they it is likely they have practices their techniques over many hours/years. Much like magicians and sleight of hand, they are able to pick a lot of information from people that might not seem immediately obvious unless you have the expertise in looking for it.<br />
The secondary part of this is, they will always find more success with people that want to believe.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because they <em>look</em> like dress oxfords, doesn't mean they <em>are</em> dress oxfords.</p>
<p>For example, I am not a cop, but my buddy that IS a cop turned me on to duty shoes. I work in commercial real estate. So you kinda are expected to have a professional appearance for showings and whatnot, but it's a 365-day a year job, rain, snow, mud whatever.</p>
<p>Anyways the brand I like are the Bates oxfords, they have great support, are pretty water resistant, have a proper outsole that doesn't slide everywhere on snow and ice, they weigh nothing (like, about as much as a pair of sneakers) and last really really well. These are all the things you want from a low pair of hikers or whatever, but it looks like a dress shoe. Perfect for my job. Not bad on the pricing either - Under $150 in my size (12.)</p>
<p>Though, most of the police officers I see nowadays are more dressed like &quot;Paramilitary Outfit&quot; and less like &quot;Officer Friendly.&quot; Combat boots seem to be more popular than oxfords these days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most officers I know now (pretty high number, nature of my job) favor all black boots on duty. Not western style boots, more of a military / hiking / trail runner style that is pretty comfortable, provides ankle support and foot protection and is conducive to running. </p>
<p>When my dad was a patrolman (early 70s) it was black oxfords and they wore a tie as part of their uniform, which was a holdover from earlier times when even bus drivers and the milkman wore a tie. Usually a clip on so it couldn't be used against them in a fight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cop here. I have two issued footwear. I have my dress shoes for my dress uniform. Standard slick bottom shoes for formal events, funerals, parades, etc. I am also issued boots. The boots they give us aren't the best, but they work. And we can trade our boots in and pay an upcharge to have them order any other pair of boots we'd like. What most officers here do, myself included, is go for whatever style we want and just pay the difference, which is around 50 to 100 bucks.</p>
<p>The kind I use is a boot designed like a pair of running shoes. They offer protection like a boot around the food and ankle, but don't have the rigidity of a boot. Some prefer to have thicker/taller boots though.</p>
<p>The main reason I think there isn't a standard issue black running shoe is due to proneness for injury. While my Brooks GTS would be fantastic to wear, I have been in foot chases before where I've completely eaten my ass. The boots I wear protected me from spraining my ankle or otherwise hurting more than my pride. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This kind of resembles the panspermia theory but at a smaller scale. There have been experiments showing that some microbial life (extremophiles) can survive in space, though they stay inactive until brought back to a pressurized environment. So far the weak link in this theory is atmospheric entry: microorganisms would be burned by the heat of the shockwave if the are on the surface of a meteor. This weak link is irrelevant for the Jovian moons as they have no atmosphere, so it would be more plausible.</p>
<p>There is another environmental hazard, though. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3t6giv/how_does_jupiter_bombard_europa_with_radiation/cx3mqp3/" target="_blank">Jupiter has a very strong radiation belt around it</a> as charged particles spin in its magnetic field. Life in the hypothetical subsurface ocean would be shielded pretty well. However, your scenario involves chunks of ice orbiting Jupiter for a while, falling on the surface of another moon and staying there until convection in ice can take it down to the depths. I'd like to have some numbers but it sounds like this can only happen over geological timescales.</p>
<p>It is true that some extremophiles are much better than humans at surviving ionizing radiation, notably deinococus radiodurans, but this doesn't mean they can take an arbitrarily high dose. With a sufficiently prolonged exposure, any living thing will eventually turn into a kind of &quot;organic soup&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on whether the life was like ours or not. If life on other planets is similar to ours it would suggest a common ancestor. This suggests life is spread easily, and that life would be likely to be found on all bodies in the solar system that could support it.</p>
<p>If life evolved independently in the Europan oceans then that makes the question simpler. It suggests to create life from scratch is not so difficult given suitable conditions. The appropriate question then becomes 'what are those conditions and are they on other moons'. Also this would imply the Europan ocean is isolated. Other moons must independently evolve life.</p>
<p>Additionally, something not mentioned often is the immense pressure sub surface oceans are under. Because of this the water chemistry is physically different to water on Earth so whilst there might be life, it might be specific to those pressures and not be able to 'spread' easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When it was all liquid, we talked about how it was still getting warmer. What will happen next.</p>
<p>And when the pan was dry, we talked about where the water went.</p>
<p>A few days later she is asking what are clouds. So we talked about where the water in the pot had gone. I asked her what she thought would happen when the water cooled down.</p>
<p>She said &quot;it will be a liquid again,&quot; and just then it started raining. So I asked her what she thought would happen if it got really cold. Ice, snow.</p>

<p>Water has an easier time of hanging out in the air when it's warmer, so when the chilly glass makes the air around it colder, the water in the air has a hard time staying in the air and sticks to the glass instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><strong>&quot;BUT WATER IS A LIQUID!!&quot;</strong> Kinda, water prefers to be in the liquid state but a small percentage goes to the air, this percentage depends mostly on the temperature. Hot environment can hold more water in the air and Cold ones don't hold up to as much water. </p>
<p><strong>Are you serious?! This happens?</strong>&quot; Yes. Actually how to clothes dry up in the sun? The shirts don't heat up to 100ºC / 212ºF. The sun just heats up the air around the shirt and the water mixes up with the air. Removing it from the shirt to the air.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAS THIS TO DO WITH CONDENSATION?!&quot;</strong> Well, hot environment hold more water than cold ones. So what happens when he pass from hot air to cold air? Well, the cold air can't hold up as much water and the water starts to leave the air and forms droplets.</p>
<p>Usually this happens in walls or cold surfaces like Mirrors or windows because the hot air is touching there and getting colder. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IANAL but I do mod a site that has to deal with this. The laws are rather iffy. In Canada and Great Britain (but i don't know if that includes the whole UK) it IS illegal to own/view such images (and if nothing else they can be the basis to search your computer or belongings for more 'solidly' illegal material). In the US it is mostly not illegal as long as it is fictional and not realistic. The site i mod for is hosted in the US and for years we instantly removed anything that depicted the characters as children, or explicitly called them younger than 14 (but also based on art style to exclude the 1000 year old 6 year old bullshit). </p>
<p>We have since allowed the loli/shota/cub stuff but only quarantined behind a secondary filter in a community you have to sub to to see, same for bestiality themed content: you only see it if you really really opt to and if it's anywhere else we burn it with fire.</p>
<p>The reason for the change was that it was figured to be far enough away from the crime. A picture of murder is not a murder - the crime is killing, not seeing it - a picture of a naked child is a naked child - the crime is 'sexually viewing' a child - but a picture of a fake naked child is not a naked child. It is blurry as all fuck. However, and this is where the admin talked a bit to a lawyer but i don't have the conversation anymore, there is a weird legal bit where the more realistic it is the more blurred the line becomes; shota-cub is pretty far from a real kid being harmed but editing a picture of a 12 year old to make them seem sexual is pretty close to a kid being harmed. The same rule weirdly enough goes for bestiality themed drawings and animations; the closer it looks to being real the closer it is to the crime itself. </p>
<p>The main reason is that children are &quot;Our Children&quot; and being soft on any issue like that is political suicide; so where other things can still be called art as soon as kids are involved the art claim gets overruled by the &quot;My Kid&quot; claim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There are certain concessions made for non-photographic work imported from outside the country for non-mainstream entertainment (manga, anime, visual novels, etc.) but for most of these they'll adjust the ages of characters up to 18 where possible in translated versions or downplay the sexualisation through careful editing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I believe it has to do with the majority of individuals not having an innate attraction to adolescents. The concern is that with exposure to sexualized images of children people will begin to sexualize adolescents when they otherwise would not and therefore lead to more instances of sexual abuse in real life. </p>

Showing images in regards to violence in essence isn't going to instill any feelings that weren't seen to be naturally there in the first place.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laws are sometimes based on emotion and not actual logic because laws are made by people.  Many people including law makers believe if sexualized images of children were freely legal, it would promote more danger to the welfare of children.  This idea is as antiquated as prohibition laws in the US for alcohol. What it amounts to logically is a thought crime. This does not somehow apply to murder and gore. </p>
<p>The same idea of laws based on emotion go for hate crimes. The idea is that for some reason already heinous crimes are &quot;more&quot; illegal now because the intent was based on hate. The idea of making possession of pornographic imagery illegal is akin to the war on drugs or making prostitution illegal. What we are doing is not attacking the root of the problem which is the heart and mind. </p>
<p>Back to the CP problem and why it is a thought crime.  If I view sexual imagery of children, the thought is I have the &quot;potential&quot; to harm children or promote the harming of children. So I must be jailed for the &quot;potential&quot; and not for the crime of raping children. </p>
<p>Let's use that logic for something else such as murder, which we should inherently think is very bad. In a world of complete command and control, we would make any imagery of killing illegal including video games because it has the &quot;potential&quot; of spreading violence and murder. </p>
<p>Please try and convince me otherwise in a logical manner, or just let the flaming and down votes commence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ask yourself why a room doesn't just grown infinitely bright over time after you turn the light on?</p>
<p>Light is absorbed by everything in the room at some rate. It's also reflected at some rate as well. When you turn on the light there is an initial period  of increasing brightness as the reflected light builds up, but then it reaches a state of equilibrium (much too fast to be perceptible, except in regard to the ramp up of the brightness of the light source itself). The light will have a characteristic number of average &quot;bounces&quot; in its lifetime before it is absorbed. Let's say you have a very &quot;bright&quot; room with 90% reflectivity (roughly mirror-bright). That means 10% of light is absorbed. After 131 bounces a given photon will have only a one in a million chance of having avoided being absorbed in such an environment.</p>
<p>If you have, say, a 10m wide room, that's roughly 1310m of total distance traveled. Which a photon will travel in only 4.4 microseconds. So when you turn the lights off in a 10m wide mirror room the light will be one millionth as bright within 4 microseconds of the light going out. And 4 microseconds after that it will be one million times dimmer still, after only 12 microseconds the light will be a quintillion times dimmer than the start. In a very short amount of time even the vast number of photons produced by a light source will be completely absorbed on an instantaneous timescale for a human. A 100% efficient 100 Watt source of 2 eV red photons would produce 3e20 photons per second, which would be reduced to fewer than 1 photon in our hypothetical room in only 15 microseconds.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I corrected some math mistakes! Sorry, I was tired last night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Fijian and Tongan iguanas form a genus of their own, <em>Brachylophus</em>, which is a part of the Iguaninae (also containing marine iguanas, spinytail iguanas, green iguanas, and others). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain their isolation. The most widely followed one involves rafting from the Americas. It is not unthinkable that iguanas would be able to raft for such long distances; they possess nasal salt glands and also thick skin. </p>
<p>Where exactly in the Americas they actually originated from is hard to determine. Interestingly, morphologically <em>Brachylophus</em> is more similar to the likewise arboreal <em>Iguana</em> than other island-dwelling iguanas like <em>Cyclura</em> and <em>Ctenosaura</em>, which tend to be ground-dwellers. <em>Iguana</em> is incidentally relatively widespread in South America. It remains possible that <em>Brachylophus</em> diverged from the latter through some ancestral population around Mexico or the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
<p>Like <em>Brachylophus</em>, the red mangrove <em>Rhizophora mangle</em> is known from Fiji and Tonga (and also Galapagos), but basically nowhere else in the Pacific. Interestingly, it forms a large part of the diet of <em>Cyclura</em>. <em>Iguana</em> and <em>Brachylophus</em> eat it too. Certainly suggestive that <em>Rhizophora</em> may have played a role in the dispersal of <em>Brachylophus</em>.</p>

Look at this map and consider that for tens of thousands of years prior to the end of the last ice age, sea level was more than 300 feet lower than it is now. There would have been a line of islands providing a route that many species could have taken to cross the pacific, including humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Seriously though, /u/iorgfeflkd's answer is a good one in general, but only if you can bring a detailed &quot;map&quot; with you. If you can bring a reference then by identifying the location of certain objects you can easily identify across galactic distances (like pulsars) then you can locate Earth in 3D space pretty straightforwardly.</p>
<p>But your question seems to be more &quot;how would someone find their way to Earth if they just had their memory to go on?&quot; Which is a different and more complicated problem.</p>
<p>First off is the easy stuff, like knowing that Earth isn't near the core or near the edges, that eliminates a big chunk of the galaxy as search space. Then you have other things, like having the Andromeda galaxy and the Magellenic Clouds being visible in the sky. That eliminates a lot of potential stars that would otherwise have the Milky Way in between those objects and obscure them from view.</p>
<p>Then you have some &quot;trivia&quot; which you might be able to use if for some reason you could remember it. For example, the mass. If you have some alien star catalog you could figure out what the equivalent of 2e30 kg would be and look just for stars of that type. Solitary stars (non binary or trinary stars) and then if you got lucky you might be able to search that catalog for systems with Earth's planetary menagerie.</p>
<p>If that sort of thing isn't an option then you're going to have to fallback on other techniques. Generally you'll look for notable stars and nebulae that are near Earth to find the neighborhood and then find the star system that would end up matching the same stars in the sky as Earth. You might be able to track down the Orion nebula, the Pleiades, Betelgeuse, and Sirius, for example. And between those you should be able to get <em>really</em> close to Earth. Once you can find Sirius (a bright white star only about 2x as massive as the Sun with a white dwarf companion) then you can basically just look at the nearby stars and find which one is the Sun. You can also try looking for the alpha centauri system, which is a triple star system near Sirius with two closely orbiting stars and one more distant dwarf star. The closer you get to Earth the more the constellations will start looking similar to what you're familiar with, so that's a big help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But if you let the traveller have some familiarity with the galaxy, then it's possible to find your way to Earth using only your human eyes. I've played enough with 3D stellar maps in VR to have worked out a reproducible procedure...</p>
<p>From the outset, you'd need to have an awareness of the spiral structure of the galaxy, and know which arm the Sun is in and roughly how far out from the center it is. </p>
<p>Within a few thousand light years, the Hyades is an extremely recognizable signpost. From there, the Pleiades is easy to spot. Given those two points of reference, plus the vector toward the center of the galaxy, one can recall a rough vector toward the Sun. Moving along this vector, you'll know you're close when you see Orion take shape. You fine tune it by aligning the stars in the hand holding the bow, as they are nearest the Sun.</p>
<p>From that close, you should be able to spot Alpha Centauri and the Sun as they are a close pair. Within the system, motion parallax should reveal each of the planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
