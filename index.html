		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stalinism doesn't exist. It's basically a slur for anyone who loves Stalin. But usually it references the tendency of Marxist-Leninism.</p>
<p>Before showing what the difference between Marxist-Leninism, Trotskyists, and Maoism (short for Marxist-Leninist-Maoism) you must know what Marxism is.</p>
<p>Marxism is a body of analysis and critique of capitalism. It forms the basis of the worldview of communists and it is the utter rejection of liberalism. Marxism is considered by communists to be a science in that it is a constantly developing theory shaped by a cycle of making theory, practicing it (applying it to the real world), and then changing the theory to accommodate for what works and what doesn't. Marxism also assumes the world to be ever changing so it develops as the world evolves. </p>
<p>Marxist-Leninism is considered to be a major scientific advancement of Marxism and also differs from Marxism in that it isn't solely analysis and critique, but also a description of how revolution should occur, how we organize the workers, how society should look like, and how to continue combating capitalism and liberal ideology after revolution. Some of the major advancements include:</p>
<p>-<strong>Analysis of imperialism</strong>, how rich Western countries maintain overall high living standards, wealth, and decadence by exploiting the Global South (what some people today would call world systems theory, neoliberalism, or 'globalism').<br />
-<strong>The vanguard party</strong>, posits that the revolution must be organized in order to be successful. The most devoted workers form what is called a vanguard party which acts as the central leadership in revolution, and after revolution becomes the government.<br />
-Indepth analysis of the state and how it can be a tool of oppression depending on which class controls it.<br />
-Posits and proves that revolution is more likely and more successful in developing and more exploited Global South countries.<br />
-<strong>The Peasantry is Revolutionary</strong>, it is recognized that the peasantry is also an oppressed class with similar interests to industrial workers. In agrarian societies like Tsarist Russia, uniting the proletariat and peasantry is necessary for successful revolution.<br />
-Creates the idea of <strong>Left wing nationalism</strong> as a nationalism for oppressed people/nations that is compatible with communist internationalism.<br />
-<strong>Socialism In One Country</strong>, the strategy of a socialist state after revolution should be to rebuild and fortify itself against possible counter revolution or invasion/coup/embargo by the West, rather than take an immediate active stance in exporting revolution to other countries.</p>
<p>Trotskyism is in opposition to Marxist-Leninism. Leon Trotsky, Bolshevik revolutionary, believed the Soviet Union was abandoning internationalism and was also losing touch with its workers, so he created a new theory that is based on Marxism, is similar to Marxist-Leninism, but rejects some of the advancements and contributes new analysis of its own. Some of these things were:  </p>
<p>-Rejection of Socialism In One Country for <strong>Permanent Revolution</strong>, a socialist state after revolution must immediately devote as many military and economic resources as possible to exporting revolution to the entire world, so as to subvert capitalism as fast as possible.<br />
-Posits the <strong>Degenerated Worker's state theory</strong> which says that the USSR was becoming 'degenerated' or slowly giving way to a new bureaucratic class with interests of its own to the detriment of the workers.<br />
-<strong>United Front and Antifa</strong>, Trotsky was the first person to recognize that fascism was not only worse than liberalism but the greatest threat to communism ever faced. He believed that communists should do whatever it takes to combat fascism, including fighting on the streets AND temporarily siding with liberals (United Front). This is also Trotsky's most important contribution, so important that all tendencies of communism from anarchism to Maoism have accepted it and implemented it.</p>
<p>Maoism, short for Marxist-Leninist-Maoism​, is a scientific advancement of Marxist-Leninism as the name suggests. Currently it is the most popular communist tendency in the world, especially in the Global South. Maoism is not as a big jump from Marxist-Leninism as Marxist-Leninism was from Marxism. Here are a list of some of its advancements:</p>
<p>-<strong>Protracted Peoples War</strong>, strategy for revolution which says that the best way to win is to use guerilla warfare and make the war last as long as possible so as to outlast the state and bleed out Western support.<br />
-<strong>The Mass Line</strong>, the best keep the Communist party in tune with the people by taking the unorganized ideas and aspirations of the people and forge policy out of it.<br />
-<strong>Theory of Social Imperialism</strong>, in many ways this is similar to Trotsky's Degenerated Workers State theory but Social Imperialism theory is considered more accurate, developed, and comprehensive. It posits that the USSR succumbed to revisionism (which is the unscientific rewriting of Marxism) and started engaging in imperialism, an act previously thought to be exclusive to capitalism. Many also conclude from this theory that the USSR was no longer socialist after Khrushchev took power.<br />
-<strong>Cultural Revolution</strong>, Mao recognized that a threat to communism would not just come from the outside but also from the inside in the form of revisionism, and if nothing was done to stop it then it would slowly deteriorate and destroy socialism. Cultural Revolution is a method of stopping revisionism by actively finding and removing members of the party and the state who pretend to be communist and do not believe or care about workers liberation, and to continue the fire of revolutionary fervor in the population by having the people take an active effort in fighting dated or oppressive cultural traditions, and destroying positive symbols of the capitalist past.<br />
-<strong>&quot;Class struggle only intensifies under socialism&quot;</strong>, a new understanding of socialism that reinforces the importance of taking defense very seriously and actively. It is said that class struggle intensifies under socialism because instead of strikes, riots, and insurrection, there is now proxy wars, coups, spies, covert warfare, and more. The capitalist class will do whatever it takes to hold power, and so will the workers, resulting in intensified struggle on a global scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's probably a lot of tedious differences that the nice folks at /r/socialism will be happy to explain to you in way too much detail but the main differences are these:</p>
<p>Trotskyism: Trotsky believed that the only way to achieve long-lasting communist utopia was to ignite a &quot;global revolution&quot; where capitalism worldwide is overthrown and replaced with a single communist society. This is contrasted with...</p>
<p>Stalinism: which believes in &quot;socialism in one country&quot;, i.e. the USSR could survive as a single communist entity and still compete with the capitalist world. Stalinism is also what you think of when you think of the stereotypical USSR: purging political dissidents, rapid, centrally-planned industrialization, and collectivized resources.</p>
<p>Maoism: Maoism was Mao's take on socialist revolution as applied to the socio-political climate of china at the time. Mao believed that the peasant class, as opposed to the worker class in Russia, was the key class of a socialist revolution in China, and his policies were mainly geared towards (in theory) improving the lives of peasants through policies like teaching all of the peasants how to forge iron and having them keep small-scale forges on their property or teaching them to exterminate pests to increase their crop yields. These policies would turn out to massively backfire but that's neither here nor there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is by no means a comprehensive answer but Stalinism is usually identified with Socialism-In-One-Country (as opposed to international workers' revolution) and totalitarianism. Maoism assumes an agrarian peasantry instead of urban proletariat and calls for a mass peasants' uprising instead of an ivory tower vanguard party. It also considers cultural revolutions necessary, since it does not promise socialism will sweep away capitalism quickly at all, and expects to fight ideological battles domestically (possibly forever)
Trotsky is tougher, he means different things to different people. He rejected the idea of socialism in one country and insisted it was global or nothing. He took an active part in the revolution (which he would have understood to necessarily include the executions of civilian capitalists) but later on developed a reputation as less fanatical and/or violent than other communists- possibly because he opposed Stalin and flirted with anarchists. If you hear the word &quot;trotskyism&quot; IRL though it's probably uttered by a leftist referring to wimpy pseudo-communists who don't read the books and think of communism as &quot;super-super-liberalism.&quot; Such people are usually drawn to Trotsky because he's more palatable to liberals. (Note that leftists don't usually consider themselves liberals)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stalin and Trotsky were both proletariat communists. Mao was an agrarian communist. In more simple words Stalin and Trotsky believed in the workers struggle (more in line with Marx though Marx thought it would happen in industrial nations). Mao believed in the farmers struggle.  </p>
<p>Stalin believed in communism in the nation. Stalin wanted to strengthen the USSR rather than expand the revolution. I also believe Stalin wanted to get rid of the SFSR Russia and SSRs in the USSR. Rather than a federal nation have a one nation policy similar to the former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Stalin was more to the right (in the bolsheviks so still very far to the left).  </p>
<p>Trotsky was a military commander and wanted a global revolution, the USSR should invade the other Bourgeois nations and make them good SSRs. His view on this is similar to the French President and Emperor Napoleon I. Trotsky was to the left in the Bolsheviks. Trotsky was also the legitimate successor to Lenin as leader but a conspiracy led by Stalin robbed him of this.  </p>
<p>Mao didn't believe in the workers struggle but the farmers and focused his revolution on this. If you look at a GDP chart in china you can see the industrial revolution comes much later than the communist revolution. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have high functioning autism and while I don't do the hand flapping thing, I will on rare occasions drum my fingers. I don't do it often enough or in rigid enough contexts to consider it a full blown stim, but I do find myself doing the motion in mid-air when I'm trying to remember something during conversations. I usually drum my fingers against something when I'm extremely stressed or trying to find a solution to a problem or scenario.</p>
<p>Like a majority of people with autism I have Sensory Processing Disorder, sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity. It dials my senses up to eleven and my brain does not have the ability to tune out portions of my environment or any surrounding stimulus, everything is processed at roughly the same level and understandably can be very overwhelming. It takes a lot of focus to be able to 'tune in' to certain things; in my case spoken words if there are multiple sources of background noise, but it can be almost anything you would try to process/learn. Visuals, smells, questions on a test, etc.</p>
<p>Stims are self stimulating behaviors that sort of comfort and calm the person doing them. In the cases in which I'm drumming my fingers I can very clearly feel the interior movements of my fingers joints and how that interior motion is unbelievably smooth within the joint itself. Combine that with hearing the clicking of my nails and the vibrations feeding into my fingers as they connect with whatever surface I'm tapping on, and the tiny twinges of the ligaments and muscles after I've done it for an extended period of time... It's incredibly pleasant to process. Also if you can't glean from my description it's a distracting and strong sensation, enough to distract me from all of the extra outside stimulus the average person is able to automatically filter out. You could almost consider it a form of mediation, at least in my case (remember, this disorder is a spectrum, so experiences can vary wildly) since it can calm me down when I'm under a lot of pressure but it also allows me to focus significantly better when needed.</p>
<p>I hope that helps, I'm happy to try and answer more questions or elaborate further if needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a common physical tick that feels good and relieves stress. Another common tick is spinning or running in circles, as well as rocking and turning their heads. Doctors sometimes call these behaviors &quot;stimming&quot; and it is commonly believed that autists are more sensitive to physical stimulation than most people. This also is thought to be a reason why they can be extremely averse to touch, and are hypersensitive to seams or scratchy fabrics in clothing. This is the general reason why people with autism tend to have so many physical ticks, but why hand flapping specifically is so common isn't well understood.</p>
<p>One theory is that since they are so prone to physical sensation, and since our hands are incredibly sensitive, hand flapping is akin to yelling for people who tend to communicate with their hands/gestures. This would explain why hand flapping so often accompanies laughter, anger, or just excitement in general. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying this is an acceptable or reasonable argument, but in general it seems to be based around the fear of imitation.</p>
<p>While some violence can be imitated, most of what we see in films really can't. Your kid isn't gonna be able to fire off a missile or get in a sword fight or fire off a machine gun or stuff like that unless you're a <strong>really</strong> bad parent. But a kid with some free time and a friend of the opposite (or same in some cases) sex and some curiosity? That can go places.</p>
<p>Combine this with a heavily lobbied focus on abstinence-only sex education (the argument generally being that teaching them how to be safe during sex &quot;encourages&quot; it) means that there's a paranoid fear of sex among more heavily conservative parents, which means they don't want their kids exposed to it at all under fear of them doing it. And that fear can tie back into the heavily puritan roots of the founding of the USA, which focuses a lot on the &quot;original sin&quot; of man being sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of a deep rooted mentality in America of Sex being Taboo or something not to be talked about. This first cane out of Puritan ideology during early America and rose again during the late 1800s and 1900s.
This conservative nature can be seen in portrayal of the Gibson girl vs the &quot;Flapper&quot; where freedom of expression (of ones body) was shunned and so on...</p>
<p>We've became more liberal as a society as time goes on but sexuality and nudity still is a big NO because of this old way of thinking. </p>
<p>It's funny because this wave of puritan Ideology with began England long ago never really rose back up like it did in America. Moreover, Europeans have a great understanding of Nudity used in Art as they have been subject to it in their history and culture unlike Americans. Just look at the statues and paintings around old Europe and then look at the younger but still older American paintings... you will see a variation in the amount of clothing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming by caveman you mean early humans (homo sapiens sapiens), the answer is stone tools. Humans have had stone tools since before we became 'humans' - i.e. since about a million years ago (and some are argued to be over 3million years old). </p>
<p>Stone tools were the standard item for cutting and trimming - including nails and hair. Despite popular imagination of them as just rocks they were highly crafted and sophisticated tools, carefully shaped for purpose. We can see this behaviour described in the historical record when different cultures meet. People did also of course wear/break nails through daily use and tie their hair back, both of which happen today. Some cultures used animal fat in their hair as a kind of grease to hold it back or make it stick up and make them look bigger. </p>
<p>Medieval people used scissors for hair but the scissors that existed were too big for nails. They did it the same way Romans did - with small knives (think paring knives rather than daggers). </p>

<p>Enceladus is much smaller than Earth and therefore has far weaker gravity, which would correlate with smaller pressure at a given altitude. However, its ocean seems to occupy a larger percentage of the planet's volume compared to Earth's, in addition to being buried under a thick sheet of ice.</p>
<p>Given Enceladus' size, gravity, and nature of it's sub-surface ocean, what would its water pressure ranges be? Could a human swim in it without a pressure suit? Could a submarine reach any depth?</p>
<p>Bonus question is to estimate the temperature range of the ocean. Since it's liquid, it'd have to be above zero celsius unless it's highly saline. Is there expected geothermal or tidal friction heating? How warm would it be purely from solar exposure, or radiation coming from Saturn?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can calculate this with the equation:</p>
<p>pressure=density <em> force of gravity </em> height. </p>
<p>This gives you the pressure of the fluid column above you, but this works pretty well for very large amounts of solids. We are assuming that gravity doesn't change much over that distance, I suspect it might since Enceladus is so small. Wikipedia says that Enceladus has 30-40 km of ice and has a surface gravity of . Pushing this all through <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=30+km+*1%25+earth+gravity*density+ice" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a> gives a &quot;sea level&quot; pressure of 3.11-4.15 Megapascals. This is equivalent to being 320-420m(1000-1300 ft) underwater on Earth. That's about as far as any SCUBA diver has ever gone, but it has been done. The world record took 12 minutes to descend, but 14 hours decompressing on the way up. Deeper dives can be made, but you start needing a rigid pressure suit. It's also close to the pressure limit for military style submarines made of steel, but titanium submarines have gone to 10 MPa. Submersibles made for extreme deep sea diving definitely could. </p>
<p>The temperature is unknown but depending on how much ammonia is mixed in, it's anywhere from somewhere above a brisk -3 C that you could dip in for a minute or two without dying, or a -103 C ammonia water slurry. What we do know is that it is <em>deep</em>. 20-30 km(18 miles) deep. That's three and a half Marianas Trenches or Mount Everests. The water pressure down there (again, assuming the equation holds) is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=40+km+*enceladus+gravity*density+ice%2B30+km+*enceladus+gravuty*density+water" target="_blank">about 7.5MPa</a>, within the limit of some submarines and diving hardsuits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things about the Earth's oceans: its main sources of energy are wind, the sun, tides and fish (funny, right?). Enceladus' ocean, if completely covered by ice, gets no energy directly from the sun or any kind of light, but must get massive forcings from ice movements above (equivalent to wind forcings here on Earth) and tides from Saturn's gravitational pull. Geothermal could be a large source of energy too, although so far we have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Now, we usually talk about sea pressure in pneumatic, or relative terms, meaning that we take pressure at the sea surface to be zero and then vertically integrate density times gravity to estimate pressure at any given depth. We do that because humans are &quot;tuned&quot; to live at sea level, or absolute pressure 1 atm = 1010 hPa, so we define that as zero to measure deviations from atmospheric pressure. However, estimating absolute pressure would require integrating the density of our entire atmosphere. </p>
<p>If you wanted to do the same for an ocean that's buried under miles of ice, then you would have to take into account the weight of all the ice above a given point. Glacial ice is about 0.92 times as dense as water, so being under 1 km of ice is equivalent to having 920 meters of water above you. We know very little about these oceans, and since gravity is not the same in Enceladus as it is on Earth, I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty confident that no human could swim there. Considering that ice sheets in Greenland are up to 4 km thick, glaciers in Enceladus must be huge everywhere, creating gargantuesque pressures.</p>
<p>Given the mass of Saturn, maybe it could create tides strong enough to drastically reduce bottom sea pressure, as it 'lifts' water and ice upwards. Also, vertical shear during these tides must be a really important source of turbulent kinetic energy and thus provide heat to these oceans. So that's the only way I think humans could, at least momentarily, exist in an ocean like that.</p>
<p>This is all a theoretical construction, and the reality might be different, but if we could make a cruise to explore these seas for the first time, that's what we would base our experiments on before knowing any better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I can weigh in on as I'm looking at Enceladus as part of my PhD. </p>
<p>Basically it depends on which model you use. Currently the thinking is that there is a localised subsurface ocean around the southern pole that probably forms a lens shape with the thick part of the lens  only 5-10km beneath the South Polar Terrain/Tiger Stripes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0063" target="_blank">1</a>. And the deepest part being 50-60km beneath the ice shell <a href="https://twitter.com/NatureAstronomy/status/849212317552259073/photo/1" target="_blank">So for visual purposes</a>.</p>
<p>Now depending on the densities and thicknesses you use for the ice and liquid and the rocky silicate core you will get various values.</p>
<p>With varying thicknesses the sea floor pressure will be anywhere between 28 and 45 bar or 2.8-4.5Mpa <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-015-9475-9" target="_blank">2</a>. . Which is equivalent to 250-450m below sea level on Earth. This pressure is entirely habitable by known barophiles (pressure loving organisms!) which have been known to survive up to 50Mpa and plenty of multicellular organisms live happily below that depth in our oceans (Hadal Snailfish have been found at 8145m!) </p>
<p>The Pressure within a porous silicate core is likely to only be around 30Mpa which seems pretty tame too<img src="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910351500250X" alt="3" />. </p>
<p>What we can say is that pressure isn't going to be a problem for biology under Enceladus type conditions.</p>
<p>Now yes this new evidence suggests that there is hydrothermal activity and geochemical energy available but to form multicellular organisms you need a fair bit more energy - which may be available but at the moment this is only a theory.</p>
<p>So for temperature this gets fairly complicated. The temperature will depend on: the heat source - which may be down to tidal heating from Enceladus' resonance orbits, or from a possibly warm core thats lasted since formation; The chemistry and thickness of the ocean/shell - If its a relatively low salinity NaCl-H2O system or whether there is ammonia involved; And finally the amount of heat that is being stored/lost.</p>
<p>Geochemical evidence from the plume suggests the ocean is warm. Silica nanoparticles have been found in the E ring <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/ering_cassini_big.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> which is maintained by Enceladus' activity. These nanoparticles can only form in alkaline high temperature environments 323K-373K (50C-90C/122-194F)<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7542/full/nature14262.html" target="_blank">4</a>  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9604" target="_blank">5</a>. Other evidence such as radiation around the tiger stripes shows that the temperature of the vent systems are 30K warmer than the surroundings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0063" target="_blank">1</a>.
Other simulations suggest the core could be anywhere from 20-150C <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514006459" target="_blank">6</a>.
The chemistry of the ocean matters too, if there are significant concentration of ammonia salts, the melting point may be depressed up to 16K at 0.1%wt NH3 so there may be liquid but it may be below freezing temperature of pure water.</p>
<p>The combination of geochemical and geophysical data points to the ocean being warm i.e. above the freezing point of pure water, whether its been warm for its entire history or whether this activity is recent is another question.</p>
<p>In important distinction should be made between habitable and inhabited. Maybe this ocean is habitable but uninhabited and therefore a pristine niche that could be invaded by Earth species.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, this is cool and maybe the idea of a Biosphere doesn't stop at the stratosphere, but extends to the outer reaches of the solar system!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Where you'd use <em>he</em> or <em>she</em>, it's <em>who</em>.  Where you'd use <em>him</em> or <em>her</em>, it's <em>whom</em>.  For <em>his</em>-or-<em>her</em> and <em>his</em>-or-<em>hers</em> it's &quot;whose&quot;, but that's kinda beside the point.</p>
<p>Examples of the process:</p>
<p>&quot;[?] are they&quot;? -&gt; &quot;<em>He</em> is ...&quot; so &quot;<em>Who</em> are they&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;[?] did you go with?&quot; -&gt; &quot;You went with <em>her</em>&quot; so &quot;<em>Whom</em> did you go with?&quot; (but this sounds a little clunky, and most people would accept <em>who</em>.  If you rephrased it in a pickier way, as &quot;with <em>whom</em> did you go?&quot;, practically nobody would accept <em>who</em>)</p>
<p>We can go into the technical terminology if you like, but this is ELI5 so I thought I'd start with the answer that people know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>First an example for whom: &quot;With whom am I traveling?&quot;
You wouldn't say &quot;I am traveling with he.&quot; You'd use him, right? so you know it must be whom.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as others have stated if you can replace it with he/she, use who, him/her is whom</p>
<p>however the REAL answer is that as english has evolved, who has beome acceptable to use in all cases, and the &quot;who/whom&quot; police are generally regarded as annoying and insufferable. </p>
<p>they're not the same as grammar police, they specifically like to wait for moments to point out who/whom &quot;corrections&quot; whenever possible. but what they don't realize is that everyone hates them, and it's okay to just say say &quot;who&quot;</p>
<p>(i mean that. english is evolving to lose pronoun cases. whom is becomming an obsolete word. in casual conversations it's generally always considered ok to use &quot;who&quot; in either case....however you CANNOT use &quot;whom&quot; in both cases.</p>
<p>this presents a few issues about the word.</p>
<p>1) if you never use, you'll never have to worry about using it incorrectly.</p>
<p>2) 90% of the time people try to use &quot;whom&quot; in casual conversations they are using it incorrectly and they sound like pretentious idiots. you can avoid that by just not using it at all. everyone will always understand you for saying &quot;who&quot; in casual conversations.</p>
<p>3) that being said.. casual writing and convos &quot;who&quot; is always fine. they say you SHOULD use whom when possible in formal writing. but if you're using it make sure you use it correctly. it doesn't have the same interchangeability that &quot;who&quot; does... you sound dumb if you use &quot;whom&quot; in the wrong context. when in doubt, just say &quot;who&quot;.</p>
<p>but it's getting to the point where it's being phased out and eventually no one will say it anymore. (english does evolve over time, just like every language.  like i said we're phasing out pronoun cases.. and whom is the next to go.)</p>
<p>whatever you do, don't be a &quot;who/whom&quot; policeman in casual conversations or all your friends will hate you lol.</p>
<p>as you can tell from my post i'm starting a movement to phase out capital letters next. who's with me?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a quick one-number metric used by lenders to judge how able you are or will be able to pay back your debts. 300 is bad. Noone will lend you anything. 900 is perfect. You could walk into a bank and ask for a $500k mortgage and you should have no problem.</p>
<p>How they're calculated is a closely guarded secret. But generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the more you pay off your debts (credit cards, line of credit) = good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pay off big % of your debts every month (good) vs. just paying the minimum (bad)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do you have just a few big debts like a mortgage and a line of credit that you make regular payments on? good. Or do you have lots of small debts like 3 credit cards, and 4 store credit cards that all carry balances?</p>
</li>
<li>more outstanding debt = bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is one side of things. If you have a bad score but just got a massive raise, then your chances improve. Or a lender could also say &quot;pay off some of this debt first, then we'll talk about a loan.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a score that let's a bank know how responsible you are with your money, and how risky it is for them to lend to you. In other words, it's used to gauge how likely you are to pay off loans every month for long as it takes to pay the loan off completely. Essentially, a credit score is a <strong>responsibility score</strong> -- it won't <em>just</em> apply to loans. We'll talk about that later.</p>
<p>Several factors are used to come up with your credit score.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>35% of your credit score comes from you payment history.</strong> Basically they'll look at it all the loans and credit cards you've ever had, as well as stuff like insurance payments and rent, and see how often you make a late payment. So if the monthly payment on your auto loan is due on the 15th of every month, and you frequently pay it on the 25th, that will lower your credit score. <em>This means that paying stuff on time is really, really, important.</em></p>
</li>
<li><strong>30% of your credit score comes from your credit utilization rate.</strong> Your credit utilization rate is how much of your available credit you actually use. This is simpler than it sounds; take the amount you spend on a credit card, and divide it by your credit limit. Example 1: You have a credit card with a $1000 credit limit. You put about $200 on your credit card every month. Now divide $200 by $1000. The answer is 0.20. So your credit utilization rate is 20%. Example 2: You have a credit limit of $11000. You put about $9500 on your credit card each month. Divide $9500 by $11000. The answer is 0.86, so your credit utilization rate is 86%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, it's important to note here that a credit utilization rate of 20% or less is <em>good</em>. It means you're using credit to buy things, but not a crazy amount. This, along with a good payment history, makes you look great. BUT if your credit utilization rate is way higher, like, 86%, that makes you look very, very, bad. That tells bank that <em>most</em> of the money you spend is borrowed (credit is essentially borrowed money. Pay with your credit card now, then pay back the bank later).</p>
<p>So let's say I'm the bank and you're asking me for an auto loan. If your credit utilization rate is 90%, I definitely don't want to give you that loan. If so much of the money you spend is borrowed, how can you possibly have enough money to make payments on the auto loan? Onward, financially savvy  steed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>15% of your credit score comes from how long you've been using credit.</strong> Basically, this is just how long you've had credit cards, auto loans, etc. If you're 18, it won't be much. If you're 30, it'll be a lot higher. But remember, just like credit utilization rate, a long credit history doesn't help you if you have late payments; it actually hurts you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10% of your credit score comes from your mix of credit.</strong> Really simple -- do you have one credit card and that's it? Or do you have a credit card, a mortgage, two auto loans, and a personal loan? Much, much better. Having different kinds of credit to your name looks good. That doesn't mean run to the bank and start opening different types of accounts to get a good mix, though. You'll eventually probably end up with a good mix of credit without even trying to. Essentially, this is just a grownup thing. A really young person doesn't really need a mortgage and an auto loan. But a 50 year old probably does.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>The last 10% of your credit score comes from new accounts.</strong> What you don't want to do here is open a whole lot of new accounts (like credit cards) in a short amount of time. If I open five credit cards in three months, that tells the bank that I'm opening a credit card, finding out I can't pay for it, then opening another one just to pay for the first one. And a third credit card to pay for the second... You get the idea. </li>
</ul>
<p>And that's what a credit score is. But where does it come from? Who gives it to you?</p>
<p>Credit bureaus. There are three credit bureaus. Equifax, Transunion, and Experian. So here's how it works. You get a $3000 personal loan from the bank. You and the bank agree that you will pay them back $83.33 per month for three years. You pay the $83.33 every single month for three years, just like you said you would. Every single month, your bank will report to one of these three credit bureaus to let them know whether you're paying them on time or not. That information will go on your credit report and be used to come up with your score.</p>
<p>OR let's say you're renting an apartment for $600 a month. You pay your rent late about eight months out of the year. Every single month, your landlord tells the credit bureau whether you were on time or late. Those eight late payments  will make your score lower. (Not every landlord reports to the credit bureaus, btw.)</p>
<p>So one of those credit bureaus will use all that stuff that got sent to them by banks, landlords, etc, and use the above breakdown to spit out your score.</p>
<p>Two really important takeaways here.</p>
<p>One is to <strong>live within your means</strong>. Cannot be stressed enough. Just because you <em>can</em> buy a 2016 Camarro does not mean you <em>should.</em> Yes, you might be able to get the loan from the bank, but can you pay that loan back? </p>
<p>You might not have $1000 laying around, but if you really, really want to go ahead and buy that stupid really big TV, a credit card will do the trick. That doesn't make it a good idea. Remember, credit is <em>borrowed</em> money. Not <em>fake</em> money. Whatever you borrow, you have to pay back, with <em>interest</em>.</p>
<p>And the other takeaway is that <strong>the worse your credit score is, the more expensive life is.</strong> See, you can have a bad credit score and still get that auto loan. The difference is, if your score is bad, you might have an interest rate something like 18%. That's really, really, high. Like, stupid high. If you have an interest rate that high, you will end up paying many thousands of dollars more than the actual price of the car. Or, you'll have to pay the bank back <em>more</em> then you put on your credit card. See how a low credit score costs you money?</p>
<p>Let's say you're applying for a job, and the employer looks at your credit (this is really common with government jobs). Remember waaaay up top where we called your credit score a <strong>responsibility score</strong>? If your score is low, that employer will think you're irresponsible, and they won't give you a job. So again, your low score cost you money. A lot of landlords will even look at your credit. Having a low credit score can actually make it harder for you to find a place to live.</p>
<p>Your credit score is really, really, important. Having a higher one makes life much easier, financially. Don't just spend money and hope for the best. Use that breakdown above and maximize your credit score. Live within your means, be smart, and think about what you're buying. Thirty year old you will thank you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, when getting a loan (mortgage, car loan, credit card, etc.) the lending institution would have to review your credit report, and make judgement about whether to extend the loan or credit to you. But there were inconsistancies, and it took a long time. The 3 credit bureaus (who collect the data and provide it to lending institutions) developed algorithms that crunch all your data and spit out a score ranging from 300-850. This makes it easy most of the time, as the lending institution can set broad guidelines that make a decision almost instantly for 95% of people.</p>
<p>The score is compiled from pieces of data such as your credit utilization rate (amount of credit relative to amount of credit you have, ie. $1000 balance on a $5000 limit credit card is 20% utilization); number of accounts; history of on-time payments; whether there are negative marks on any accounts; length of credit history; how many other recent credit pulls.</p>
<p>So the way it's used is you go to buy a car and they request your credit score... let's say it's 770. They may not approve a loan to credit scores below 600, charge 6% on loans with scores between 600-720, 4% on scores 721-800, and 2% on scores over 800. So you'd qualify for a loan at 4%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 is that a credit score is an estimate of how likely you are to default on credit based on how often other people who have a credit history like you have done so. Note that there are different credit scores for credit cards, home loans, auto loans and just about anything else. </p>
<p>FICO works with the credit reporting companies to save everyone's credit report each month and they can basically look at people who had a credit report similar to yours in the past and see how many of them will miss a payment or default on their loan in the future. </p>
<p>Banks decide that they only want to loan money to people who have a low probability of defaulting or that if you have a higher chance of defaulting they will charge more interest on the loan. </p>
<p>The credit score is like predicting the weather. If the weather report says 80% chance of rain tomorrow It doesn't mean it will rain, just that in the past when the weather was like it is today that 80% of the time it rained the next day. </p>
<p>The credit score is not a judgement about you; however people use it to judge you; so if you're going to be judged by it then it's important to look as good as you can. How to do that is another topic. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: it's an estimate of how often people with credit histories like yours are likely to default in the future. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for one of the major credit bureaus and I can say most everyone here has laid it out pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>But explaining like you are 5:</strong></p>
<p>It is a number that lets companies, not just banks (car dealerships, department stores, banks.. etc.) know how likely or able you are to pay off a loan should you get one to purchase items. This is called Debt to Income Ratio.  They take into consideration how much money you make versus how much money you are paying out. If you earn a certain amount yearly, can you pay all your rent/house mortgage and bills and still afford that new car too? Also how well are you at paying off your loans or credit cards. The better you are at it, the higher your score and the more people are willing to lend to you.</p>
<p>It was originally invented as a way for banks/lenders to let other banks/lenders know that you already had a loan or account with them and if you were paying them like you were supposed to.  This also was supposed to prevent you from taking a loan out one bank and not paying it back and going to another bank and taking out a loan with them and not paying that one either.  This allows the second bank/lender know you were not paying your bills so they would not lend to you.  Much the way it is today.  </p>
<p>Later the Credit Score was added.  Basically, this was a way for a lender to quickly look at your credit history and see if you were someone they wanted to lend to.   By having a quick visual of a number, they didn't have to sift through the information and actually read or decide on their own if you were a good risk.</p>
<p>While everyone is right about how the score is figured, it is a bit more complicated than that.  The reason being is there is more than one credit bureau company.  Each one weighs or factors your score a bit differently.  That is why if you pull your score from each company, it is not the same. Some factor how well you pay your bills with more &quot;weight&quot; than how much much total credit you used in comparison to how much total you have to use. Some will drop your score more if you miss a payment to a lender, more than another one will.</p>
<p>Honestly, there really are too many variables to explain each one unless you seriously have a bad score and history and are trying to figure all this out and how to get your credit score up. So I will just leave it at there are several factors that the credit bureaus look at (Did you pay your bills on time, how much your total line of credit is versus how much you actually used, how long have you had credit... etc) to determine your score and if you are a good risk to take if you apply for a loan or line of credit.</p>
<p>I will also quickly mention that the lenders, when they pull your credit score and credit history, can also exclude factors on your credit score/history to alter the credit score number.  For example, when my daughter purchased her house a few years back, the lender that gave her the loan to purchase her house, removed any information about medical bills that were not paid, which increased her credit score and ultimately gave her a lower interest rate and the amount of money that they were willing to lend her.  This is not uncommon when it comes to medical bills on your credit record, unfortunately, I do not know the reason why.</p>
<p>TLDR, It is a number that tells lenders what kind of a risk they will take if they were to extend you credit for a credit card, mortgage loan, car loan... etc.  The higher the number, the better &quot;risk&quot; you are or the better chance you have to get that line of credit or loan.</p>
<p>I have personally helped many people look at their credit history and score, learn to understand it and also showed them how to increase the score or what steps they should take to &quot;clean up&quot; their credit history and how to actually get this done.  I do not get paid to do this, I do it because after working with a credit bureau for a while, they really can do a number on people who do not understand this information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me and I will be happy to answer any questions you have. Just please keep in mind I only check Reddit every few days or so, so I might not respond the same day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a part of your brain that paralyzes you when you fall asleep. It blocks every signal that your brain tries to send to your muscles. That part is unsynced or damaged in people who sleepwalk.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the person is also able to look around, espond to stimuli and do complex tasks like talking or making themselves a sandwich or even driving. There's a special condition in the same vein that causes the sleeping person to attempt to beat the shit out of their sleeping partner. That's an indication of brain degeneration.</p>
<p>This is during the dreaming part of sleep called REM, where your brain is very very active and able to do complex tasks. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a problem everywhere these drugs are available.</p>
<p>When many of the drugs were put on the market, the risk of tolerance/addiction was either downplayed or not fully understood. Keep in mind that there are <em>still</em> doctors who don't believe opioids are potentially problematic and just keep writing prescriptions. Research is a lot more transparent these days and more people understand that something isn't right, but it takes time to change the culture. </p>
<p>There are a few contributing factors. </p>
<p>One, opioid withdrawal is really, really awful and very difficult without the right supports in place. </p>
<p>Two, the standard practice is to simply cut people off and stop writing prescriptions rather than address the underlying addiction. With detox looming, street drugs become a substitution. </p>
<p>Three, there are relatively few evidence-based detox and recovery beds for prescription opioid users. </p>
<p>Four, a shocking number of people still see addiction as a moral issue rather than a medical issue. They don't want their tax dollars/research dollars/healthcare dollars going to <em>junkies on the street</em> who <em>choose that lifestyle</em> and should just <em>pull themselves together and contribute to society</em>. And things like <em>harm reduction</em>? You mean this program <em>doesn't</em> force abstinence? The end result is that objectively helpful approaches like harm reduction tend to be unpopular politically, so they just don't happen.</p>
<p>Five, alternatives to opioids in pain management are still catching up and opioids may be the only option in some cases.</p>
<p>Basically, a lot of different systems failed and continue to fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of pretty decent comments here so far. Jumping in from both the pharmacy profession inside the US and as someone who travels internationally a fair bit (including outside of the traditional &quot;West&quot;), I have a couple comments.</p>
<p>Prescription opioid abuse exists pretty much everywhere that prescription opioids exist. There are several reasons why its a mainstream issue here and less so elsewhere. </p>
<p>First, prescription opioids are just more common and more available here compared to most of the world. </p>
<p>Second, the relative availability and ease of access to prescription opioids versus the same for 'street' opiates makes prescription drug abuse much more attractive than it is in places where street opiates are cheap and easy to get hold of. </p>
<p>Third, we've had numerous public health and media campaigns here highlighting the issue. I have traveled in certain countries where vaguely similar epidemics are occurring, but the people there don't really recognize it for what it is.</p>
<p>Just a note - most of my experience with this outside of the US and the West in general is in the Middle East, where I travel frequently but do not practice. I've been struck by local ignorance when it comes to what types of drugs people are consuming and for what reasons. They know that some people are taking lots of medicine for less than medical reasons but they ignore it because it's unsightly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While opioids and other drug epidemics exist all around the world for many different reasons, the U.S. has it's own set of special problems caused by a very firm stance against drugs. The war on drugs is the best example. </p>
<p>Now, in other countries like Portugal, drug laws are a lot more loose. You don't go to prison for years just for doing heroin. At least not all the time. This means that instead of punishing people who have serious addiction problems, they offer them needle-exchange programs and healthcare. Heroin addicts in countries like these live much better lives and are given the opportunities to get their life back on track. This means that a lot of heroin users in some other countries are not only able to function in daily life, but they are also given the help they need to quit abusing. Addicts here don't often stay addicts, and thus their addiction rates are low. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in America the law isn't so lenient. Addicts in the U.S. of A. are severely punished for their problems. Addicts here aren't given the tools to keep their lives on track, and thus spiral into a drug-fueled nightmare life. Addicts in America are often poor, unhealthy, and looked down on. Not only this, but they are also thrown in prison for years because of their addiction, making them even less likely to get their life fixed up. </p>
<p>This means that American addicts often stay addicts. The numbers pile up. If you want to find out more about the negative effects of the war in drugs, I would suggest reading up on countries with better laws here </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big part of the answer hasn't been mentioned yet - opiates are cheaper and quicker than other forms of pain management. They make sense for the US labor market.</p>
<p>Say you have a herniated disc. In Europe, you might get four weeks of paid medical leave, a bunch of appointments with a physical therapist, instructions to avoid physical exertion, and some ibuprofen. In the US you might get powerful painkillers because a) you run a real risk of losing your job or at least the pay if you don't turn up and b) the next physical therapist is possibly not covered by your insurance if you even have one, and could be far away if you're in a rural area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
