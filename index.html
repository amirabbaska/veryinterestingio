		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite what you might think there aren't as many common medications available. Also, pharmacies only need to keep enough of any given medication in stock as long as they get frequent shipments every few days. They determine which medications are the most highly used by local physicians and stock those up enough to last until their next delivery with a safety supply always in reserve. And if they get dangerously low all they need to do is make a special order that comes a few days early. But pharmacies are getting shipments of medications all the time so this really shouldn't be a problem. Another thing that helps is that shelf life of most medications are at least a year. So even if you have to stock some exotic medication that no one really ever gets prescribed you can keep a small supply tucked away somewhere and have a computer system track when it is going to expire and you need to toss the old stuff out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres a lot of things pharmacies can do to predict trends. For example, coming up to bank holidays we order in surplus antibiotics, morning after pills and other contraceptives. We try to have a nine month supply of the more popular contraceptive pills so if someone comes in and wants their six month supply we can give it and still have enough for three other women to get a one month supply. At the end of August we get a big delivery of our flu vaccines, which we can top up if needed. Our computer system keeps track of sales statistics for each of our medications, we try to get people to leave in their prescriptions on file. It makes it easy for them, we get it ready, text them when they can collect and text them again of they havent collected after two weeks. But it also helps us predict what medications will be needed each month/week. Our pharmacy gets twice daily deliveries from our main supplier, and once daily delivery from our other suppliers so if the customer is in early and we dont have their meds in stock, we can have it for that afternoon. But we would still have a lot of medication readily available on the shelf, some of which we haven't dispensed in a year. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only talk about the UK as that's where I worked but I was a Dispensing Assistant for a 100 Hour Pharmacy for a few thousand people. Because we would get about 100 Customers a day, and dispense around 100-300 prescriptions depending on circumstance (If there is an outbreak of something like Noravirus or if it was a Monday because Repeat prescriptions that were sent on Friday come through) and most of these are for very common medicines. For example, we would stock around 30-40 boxes of Fluoxetine (Prozac for you Americans) in varying dosages because we knew around 10-30 would be dispensed. Every time we dispensed an item, we took note of it and ordered it.</p>
<p>Because Medicine boxes are usually small, you don't actually need that much space, but for the UK at least, do to daily deliveries, we didn't need to stock that much!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an EMT and it is a combination of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training time. An EMT is 6 months of training. A Medic is usually another 2 years after that. So in a little over the time it takes most to get an associates degree you can be a paramedic.</li>
<li>Supply and Demand. While your medic isn't as prevalent as say an EMT and those aren't as in supply as people who can work an entry level job without training the pay does go up as you become more sought after. This is partly to do with how fast Medics and EMTs can be trained. There are just oodles of EMTs and still many Medics and only a limited number of jobs.</li>
<li>Community Resources. Big cities have more resources and can pay Paramedics more than smaller cities. Every firefighter, police officer, and EMT/Medic wants to make big money in the big city. However, for the majority of Medics in the US that work for smaller towns they simply have to cut costs where they can and this usually comes in the community service part of things. It isn't just medical, fire, and law either. Schools are seeing their budgets tighten all the time. This is just the case across the board.</li>
<li>Medicaid/Medicare and the Uninsured: The law says that ambulances have to treat and transport you regardless of your ability to pay and that's the way it should be. But it also puts a strain on ambulance districts in two ways and this causes or doesn't help the bullet point above. The first way is that when Medicaid and Medicare pay they don't pay full price. Surprise, the government wants to keep its costs down and will only pay a certain amount. Sure, ok. At least we get paid from those programs. But the worse thing is people without insurance because we sometimes don't see a dime from people and have to send them to collections - which is terrible to ruin someone's credit over medical bills. But at the same time it would be equally terrible to see an ambulance district not be able to afford good equipment, hire competent staff and reward that staff appropriately, or, curse the thought, close down for good, because they didn't have an income. Most community ambulance districts aren't out to make a ton of money but that extra money is nice to afford better and safer equipment and afford training for the employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it really is a shame too because EMTs, Police, and firefighters usually have to pay for their own training (at least some if not all) and are really great pivot points of the communities they serve. I decided to get into EMS because it was a good job to have through college and I was helping people. It gave me purpose and made me feel good (and a little bit of money was nice too) but I ultimately did not feel it was a lifelong job I could do and make a real living at because of the low wages and near nonexistent benefits in that line of work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here, checking in late to the party, but I can offer some perspective. </p>
<p>There are too many EMS services in the U.S. Those who do the best pay/benefits wise are those who work for large, urban or county-wide EMS systems that are funded (at least partially) by the tax base of the area that they serve. I am fortunate enough to work for a municipal system that is funded via the tax base and billing for our services. With OT, I make over $100k. Since we are a municipal system, we are ran as a public safety bureau and not like a for-profit business. Why that is important is that the finances are viewed differently than the for-profit services. My Chief's salary doesn't change based upon how much profit he can squeeze out of the budget. We are viewed by our government as a necessary public safety service instead of a money making venture. Our government knows how valuable of a service we provide to our city and understands that in order to attract good people, they need to offer a good pay/benefits package. It's the cost of providing a service, not the cost of doing business. On top of that we are unionized, which is a big help. With every contract negotiation the union is working to improve the pay and benefits that we receive. </p>
<p>The for-profit, small town EMS systems that rely on subscriptions and billing to survive just cannot afford to offer good pay and benefits. They don't have the call volume to generate the billing revenue to bring in a ton of money, and they have to keep costs in line to remain profitable. As a result, they cannot afford to pay their employees a whole lot. That being said, many medics and EMTs will take these jobs because even though the pay isn't great, the workload is typically pretty easy, compared to what the city medics are dealing with day to day. So even if the pay is only $15/hr, a lot of guys won't mind working a slow 24hr shift once a week and then work their other jobs. </p>
<p>Others have touched on the other issues. The relative ease of education I think is a factor, however I don't necessarily think it's as big as some other people believe it is. I don't think the answer to poor pay is requiring a bachelor's degree. The million little EMS services that are barely financially afloat cannot afford to pay much more than they currently do, regardless of if their employees have a degree or not. They simply don't have the financial resources to do so. The flip side to that is that if paramedic became a bachelor's degree, you'd end up with paramedics who would have more student debt with only a marginal increase in pay. The increased student, coupled with the still low pay, would result in even less pay to live off of due to more money being spent on student debt. </p>
<p>TL;DR - There are too many small EMS services with poor revenue coming in that are barely surviving financially. What we need are more large, municipal, unionized, tax-funded services that are operated as public safety bureaus and NOT like for-profit businesses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>former paramedic for 10 years</p>
<p>A. Private ambulance service. Most community ambulances transportation occurs via private ambulance service that is dominated by American Medical Response. Profits drive that company and it's better to have high turnover, less experienced paramedics at lower pay scales over ones with more experience and will demand higher wages. Also the community ambulance 911 systems contract out emergency responses to a single company so that ambulance service is really the only game in town for a paramedic to work for.</p>
<p>B. Lack of a nationwide or state level association/trade union. Firefighters, police and nursing have had strong associations to help protect wages and politically push for more protections. Most paramedics/EMTs don't have a strong association and either get a small local union representation (like SEIU) who are not specifically set up to handle the needs of first responders or none at all. </p>
<p>C. Most people coming out of paramedic schools are young and the wage scale is set accordingly. It's a demanding job. The hours suck, the physical demands are high and the stress is unbelievably high. I was an EMT at 20 and a paramedic at 21. After 10 years I was in the top 20 on the seniority list out of 350 paramedics. The last 5 years I worked was hell I can't imagine working into my late 30s.</p>
<p>D. Most career advancement paths involved moving into the fire service. Moving into a clinical setting is often blocked by a lot of factors including the nurses who don't want to give up duties to yet another healthcare profession. I never wanted to be a firefighter.... I hate heights and the smell of burning buildings. </p>
<p>Most of my colleagues who stayed in the field got jobs with different fire services. I chose to get out of it completely although stayed in healthcare for about 20 years in medical devices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have conversations like this quite frequently with people who say shit like &quot;it's so unfair that pro football players make more than brain surgeons&quot;.  It's all about supply and demand of the labor force. Somebody like LeBron James has a much more marketable skill than a brain surgeon,  even though it could be argued that the brain surgeon as a more important job. However, the brain surgeon does not have a more <em>valuable</em> job from an economic sense.  A brain surgeon is not going to sell out a stadium multiple times a year with fans willing to watch him  perform surgery. And this is what you understand: the labor force in a capitalist  economy is paid what they're worth economically, not morally. EMT's  are common, low skilled employees that are easily replaceable. Yes, they are important, but they are nothing special.  If you want a good counterexample though, there is a big shortage of nurses here in America, and therefore the salaries of nurses has gone up because hospitals have to compete with each other to attract nurses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to be very cold, for a long time.  Most people know moving water can't freeze, but in real life scenarios, there's always a spot where water comes in contact with a solid surface (The rock or ice) that momentarily brings the fluid to a stop, in that short amount of time it has to be cold enough to freeze the water, this spot is called a nucleation spot (where things start).  From there it just basically builds outwards until the whole thing is frozen, the water freezing like a column as it flows down and hits the ice below, layer by layer.</p>
<p>Edit: I am surprised by how many people find this interesting/upvoting, it's ice to see so many people take an interest</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>If the water is continuously falling at a rapid pace</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many places where you get fantastic frozen waterfalls, the water is not falling at a rapid pace but is instead a slow trickle that keeps building and building from a single icicle into an entire frozen wall. Keep in mind that river levels will drop when temperatures are below freezing since there is no runoff to feed it, so they won't be running full tilt just prior to freezing.</p>
<p><a href="http://merge.canada.travel/sites/default/files/styles/page_gallery_main/public/photo/exp/se098_01rr_mike_gere_photo_mar_08_366.jpg" target="_blank">Maligne Canyon in Jasper, AB Canada</a> is a good example of that. If you go by in the summer time the walls are leaking but there is no waterfall there. In this case at least, there are parts of the river &amp; karst system that run underground and keep the water warm enough that it will continue flowing to the surface even when temperatures are -20C and colder.</p>
<p>Of course, when something huge like Niagara Falls freezes, that's a different story and u/Skaffer's explanation covers that scenario better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A waterfall gets the water from many small water bodies upstream from the waterfall itself. </p>
<p>If the area with the waterfall was the only area with freezing temperature, the mass of water would move to quickly to freeze. But this is not the case. As it gets colder the smaller streams upstream freezes. And all the water in the ground that eventually would make it to the river freezes solid in the soil. This brings the river that leads to the waterfall to also have less water, and eventually this also freezes. </p>
<p>This again reduces the amount of water feeding the waterfall, making it easier for the low temperature to take hold of the water and slowly freezing it bit by bit. Where it eventually is just a trickle of water reaching the once majestic cascade, that is now a solid frozen pillar of ice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The generalisation would be that education creates opportunities for people to get into stressful job situations, like in the comment from /u/Qui_est-ce_qui about lawyers.  In this case, it's not the education that's the proximate cause, but it's a catalyst and correlate.</p>
<p>Of course, you could also find lots of anxiety and depression and so on among people who aren't well-educated -- in particular they may be prone to another kind of deadly stress if they have trouble finding a job.</p>
<p>An interesting research question would be whether the mental illnesses of the educated and un-educated are different, not just whether they're more prevalent in one group than another.  I don't know the answer to that question off hand.</p>
<p>Another thing that comes to mind is the role of <em>inequality</em> per se in driving mental health problems, along the lines of:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends whose population estimates you look at, as every organization will have its own methodology. Firstly, even national population numbers in developed countries will never be 100% accurate. You have a never-ending mortality and birth rate, and presumably a steady immigration and emigration rate. Once you understand and can calculate the growth or declining rates of the latter noted elements of population, you can better calculate the representation of the country. Developed countries might also have a government facilitated census, and this helps at tightening the numbers. But they will never be perfect, I would say that most developed countries have a +/- 2% discrepancy. When you look at population numbers from a developed country's government, you can assume that they're correct.</p>
<p>Lesser developed countries have more difficulties when it comes to calculating the above noted figures. As a result, you want to use a proxy, or best guestimate. There are multiple approaches that you can take and this goes back to what I said about it depending on the organization. Some will have an agreed upon formula that encapsulates many factors (e.g. employment, real GDP, GDP PPP, gross exports and imports, energy consumption, etc.), And ultimately spits out a number. Other organizations might take the posted numbers from a developing countries, if they even have them available, and apply a +/- rate to adjust the accuracy and discrepancy.</p>
<p>Note: I'm writing this from my phone and there are many more things that I want to add. I also haven't proofread much of what I wrote above. If this post sticks and you want further clarification I'll add what I can when I get home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

We just have to remember, /u/Trunks572, that while our friends can no longer be active in <em>our</em> lives, their lives will always continue on in our memory. We hold a bit of them in us, they just can no longer actively contribute. Humans are balls of clay, my dear man or woman; we're passed into the hands of whomever we meet. Most of the times they leave just a fingerprint; sometimes, a bit of an impression. But every once in awhile, we meet someone who completely changes a bit of us, or all of us, and we'll always have that.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here, prepare for disappointment (that's how I start all clinic visits, btw). The disappointing thing is that this isn't well understood. That said, there are still some interesting things to think about so let's begin. There are two very different broad categories that could explain what is happening: </p>
<p>1) Emotional synesthesia. Think of the nervous system like an electrical system. Neurons are like wires that carry signals to different parts of the brain for processing. Some of these wires are known to be well-insulated and carry signals well. For example, the neurons that report light touch in the fingertips are very accurate. Other neurons are poorly insulated and the signals cross. That is why it is hard to localize pain in your gut. A pain signal from your colon can get mixed up with pain from your small intestine or even gallbladder. </p>
<p>The physical feeling of a 'sinking heart' associated with sadness could be caused by these crossed wires. There are extreme examples of these &quot;crossed wires&quot; in synesthesia, where people see sound and hear color. However this type of thing occurs on a more subtle level in other people and this MAY be an example of emotional synesthesia where we physically feel emotion.</p>
<p>2) Actual sensation. The emotion of sadness may actually cause physical changes that we can feel. It is known that sadness can cause weakening of the heart, causing the bottom of the heart (confusingly called the 'apex') to balloon out and weaken. This is called Takasubo cardiomyopathy. Perhaps sadness could cause subtle changes in the chest area that we can actually sense, leading to this sensation of a sinking heart.</p>
<p>As you can see, these two potential explanations describe very different mechanisms, one involving physical change and one purely neuronal. That is the level to which we don't understand this process. We don't even know the broad mechanism.</p>
<p>I read some other comments here and I am concerned because they present speculation as fact. For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5mq41s/eli5_what_causes_that_sinking_heart_feeling_when/dc5kxpm/" target="_blank">this comment</a> throws around a lot of unnecessary jargon that sounds like an explanation but they never identify how little is actually known about this subject. The mark of a knowledgeable comment is that it clearly defines the boundary between what is known and unknown.</p>
<p>BONUS TOPIC: Here is something fun to think about. If the sensation is truly due to crossed wires, is that a defect in our bodies or is this a feature that was selected for? There could be a benefit of having a physical sensation of sadness to accompany the emotional sensation. By using dual negative stimuli, individuals are more likely to avoid situations that cause sadness. Perhaps this topic isn't disappointing as it shows how much good science there is left to be done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This tube is squeezed together the majority of the time but when you chew, yawn, swallow, etc. it opens in order to equalize the pressure in your ear with the surrounding air pressure.  This is why chewing gum on an airplane helps to make your ears feel better and avoid the painful negative or positive pressure build up.  You might have some excess mucus built up within the tube, some inflammation, or a normal anatomical variant that may be contributing to the sound you are hearing.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have had this all my life from having had frequent ENT infections when I was a child. I can get temporary relief by getting them to drain sometimes.</p>
<p>I open my throat up as if to start a yawn deep down, and keep it open as I take multiple slow deep breaths. I open my jaw up and move it forward, and tilt my head back about 45 degrees and keep it tilted. After the first breath or two I keep my deeper throat as open as possible and close my mouth, breathing slowly in and out of my nose. It's okay to breathe through the mouth now and then too.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm making progress when the vibrating of my breathing jumps into my ears as well.</p>
<p>At some point at the end of an exhale I'll make a sharp inhaling breath through my nose which makes my ears feel really clogged up. (I don't recommend doing this if you have a head cold.) I leave my ears like that for a few seconds then make a full yawn with my throat as open as i can, and my head still tilted back, which makes my ears pop really good. As well flexing my jaw wide open and forward while deeply yawning can sometimes help with the drainage.</p>
<p>Other things I've tried sometimes is the yawning technique, then closing the nose while (not forcefully) trying to breathe out, which forces air out through the ears (but this seems to keep the fluid in place I guess); and pulling on my ear away from my head to flex the ear canal while I work my jaw open and shut, keeping it jutting out.</p>
<p>If your nose or throat feels like it's about to get runny or ticklish then you are definitely getting stuff moving around in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Green is a nice contrasting colour with the traditional white of the silkscreen, which makes text easy to read. Solder mask without many or any pigments added will look a little greenish because of the fiberglass beneath it, it's cheapest to not add any pigments. Other colours are used only for aesthetics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sometimes you might want it to be a certain color to easily distinguish it from other boards. A company I worked at made boards with controlled impedance and we decided that green would be 100 ohms, blue was 75 ohms, etc just to make it really easy.</p>
<p>We also had some products that had two boards (a top and a bottom) so for a product like this the top board might be red and the bottom might be blue just to make it easier on the assembly line to tell a worker that red goes on top and blue goes on bottom. This made life easier for us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Then, some great new process was devised and it became more common and cheaper. With the new process, it's squeezed, then stored in vats for months at a time. This process caused it to lose flavor. So flavor is added before it is sold. Different brands have slightly different flavor processes so taste different. And these have a different flavor and consistency than genuine fresh-squeezed OJ. Go get some genuine fresh squeezed from Whole Foods or similar and you'll taste the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are dozens of types of oranges: navels, tangelos, tangerines, temples, mercots, hamlins, valencias, parson brown, etc.</p>
<p>Just like apples, every different type of orange looks and tastes a bit different.   Some are better for eating fresh and some are better for juice.  Some are very popular, some are not as popular, and some are cheap since there is a huge supply and some are expensive.   Some are grown in Florida, some in California, and some in Brazil.    </p>
<p>So every manufacturer sources their oranges from a different place and of course that makes them taste a bit different.   And as other posters mentioned, December is the main time for oranges to be harvested, with some a bit before that to a bit after that.  </p>
<p>Freezes can damage or reduce the crop forcing juice manufacturers to change the mix of oranges they use.   Since we need orange juice year round, some manufactures put the juice in giant oxygen-free holding tanks at 33 degrees and keep it there for up to six months.  This damages the taste so they add in &quot;flavor packs&quot; which are also made from orange oils (which I think is somehow distilled out of the orange peels, but I'm not really sure).</p>
<p>So you can see, there are hundreds of variables which go into how orange juice tastes, and the big companies spend tons of money making sure that their juice tastes the same no matter what time of year it is, or what materials they have to make it with.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello I'm an advertising guy. Most of the replies in this thread are not incorrect, but seem to lack knowledge deeper than &quot;because of the brand&quot;.</p>
<p>Start by understanding that advertising is a huge, huge world. In that huge, huge world, you have lots of different 'methods' of advertising. Each type of advertisement will be seen by different people, at different times, will promote different products and will take different forms.</p>
<p>For instance, your advertisement can appear in a magazine, a newspaper, on a webpage, on a flyer, on the radio, on a billboard, or on the television.</p>
<p>Let's assume it's 7pm on a Monday, in a country with a population of 100. 2 of those people will be reading magazines. 3 will be reading newspapers. 10 will be on the internet. 8 will be outside. 1 is listening to the radio. 9 people are not exposed to any type of media. But a whopping 67 people are all watching television!</p>
<p>Your advert can appear in any of the media I just mentioned. But you need to consider the question, 'why am I advertising in this instance?' Are you trying to get people to buy direct from you, there and then? Or are you looking for exposure – for instance, because you're launching a new product?</p>
<p>In the first instance, your advert will be considered &quot;direct response&quot;. Think of an ad you see in the newspaper that has a coupon attached to it. &quot;20% off with this voucher!&quot; You take it to a store, buy a product, and now the store knows that you bought a product after seeing an ad in a magazine. It's instant feedback. Direct response isn't just print, mind you: ever see a TV ad that tells you to ring a phone number? How about an email that takes you straight to an online store? These are all forms of direct response marketing.</p>
<p>In the second instance, the ad is classified as &quot;ATL&quot;, which stands for above the line (direct response is sometimes called below the line; the two definitions are hard to stick to, however, because some ATL advertising can also be direct response, and some BTL may use ATL tactics). You're not looking for quick sales, probably because you're already an established and trusted brand, but you do want to uplift sales – perhaps you're approaching the end of this quarter and you need a sharp uplift in sales to meet your forecast. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Now, let's assume your product is what's classified as an FMCG, which stands for &quot;fast moving consumer goods&quot; – basically anything you buy off the supermarket shelves. Soft drinks, packets of crisps, fruit and vegetables, dairy and laundry detergents, as well as some pieces of hardware, furniture, and electronics.</p>
<p>You don't care who buys your stuff, because there isn't a specific audience. Everyone drinks soft drinks. Everyone sits on sofas. Everyone uses toothpaste. So, at 7pm on a Monday, when you can assume almost everyone in your country of 100 people will be at home, in front of the TV, after a long day's work, that's the best time for you to advertise.</p>
<p>You're just letting people know you're there. But in the week after you've played your TV advertisement, 99% of people in your country will have visited a supermarket or mini-mart. Some of them will want soft drinks. Some of them will want toothpaste. And when they stumble across your product on the shelves, the brand exposure they have already experienced is enough to increase their odds of purchasing your product – and that's a fact.</p>
<p>It's not guaranteed, of course. Your competitors might have run an ad campaign themselves. Or they may have a product next to yours on the shelves that is lower in price. They may even have advertising in the store, which we call POS (point of sale advertising). Such is the wonderful world of marketing.</p>
<p>So, I guess, TL:DR is: you may not pay attention to advertisements, but many other people do. And even if they're not asking you to buy there and then, TV advertising is proven to make you more likely to buy in the long-term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that you were shopping at the supermarket one day and you decided you were going to buy some laundry detergent.  For the sake of simplicity let's also say that in the laundry goods aisle there were only two product brands to choose from: Soapy Suds, and Sunshine detergent.</p>
<p>Now let's assume that at this point you had NEVER even heard of Soapy Suds before.  You know almost nothing about the product except that it's laundry detergent because it states so on the product label, and besides that it's in the laundry detergent section of the store.  However, while you also know little about Sunshine detergent let's assume that you have actually heard several commercials on the television talking about how great the product is.  So you've at least HEARD of that product before, if only in passing.</p>
<p>Faced between purchasing a product you had never heard of before, and purchasing a product that you had (even perhaps a semblance of a passing notion of) it would be human nature to choose the one you had heard of before over the one you knew nothing about.</p>
<p>This is the essence (highly oversimplified) of the power of brand recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Quick question: off the top of your head, when you think of NFL football, which beer comes to mind? If you live in the US, chances are you answered &quot;Bud Light&quot;. And that's because TV advertising works.</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily mean you are going to go out and buy a case of Bud Light right away, but next time you're in the liquor store staring a fridge full of cases of beers, you will &quot;know&quot; something about Bud Light, as opposed to the 30 other beer brands you've never heard of. And that &quot;knowledge&quot; might influence you to buy Bud Light, because hey, you like NFL football, and it's the official beer of NFL football.</p>
<p>TV ads work because we as human beings simply don't have the time or inclination to exhaustively research every single thing we spend money on every day. We make the vast majority of decisions based on what we &quot;know&quot;, not really caring how we got that information, or taking the time to judge its relevance or verify its accuracy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily about purchasing something &quot;different&quot; than you normally would. In some cases it's just providing a slight push. Restaurant/fast food ads are a big example here. Sure, if you absolutely never eat fast food or at chain restaurants then those ads mean nothing to you. But most people do have fast food or eat at chain restaurants, even if it's only occasionally. </p>
<p>We live in a age where, if you live in a decently sized town (in the US at least), you have a lot of options when it comes to eating out. There's local restaurants/diners, big chain restaurants like Olive Garden or Outback Steakhouse, and of course fast food. Some people develop habits and just go to the same few places over and over again, but most people want some variety. How do you choose where to eat/order from? Usually it's based on what you're &quot;in the mood for.&quot; Restaurant ads won't make you go anywhere that you'd never be willing to go without the ad, but they can provide a small nudge in one direction or another that could make you choose one place over another:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're hungry and are thinking about getting food. If you see ads for pizza, you might think &quot;hey, I haven't had pizza in a while.&quot; You might decide to get pizza instead of Mexican food or Chinese food or whatever, because why not? You like pizza and it's been a while. </li>
<li>You decide to get pizza. Your options are some local pizza places, or one of the big pizza chains. Maybe there's a local place you like, but it would cost more than you want to spend today, so you decide to go with one of the chains. You vaguely remember that Pizza Hut has some new garlic bread pizza thing, and that Domino's has a some sort of cheap carry-out deal, etc. Some of the things you know about these chains will be from personal experience, and some of the things you know will be from ads. You're not going to make a decision that you'd never be willing to make in the first place, like ordering from a place you hate, but the ads can nudge you into choosing one place over another, for reasons that are perfectly natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, ads can nudge &quot;getting food&quot; into &quot;getting pizza&quot;, or nudge &quot;getting pizza&quot; into &quot;getting Pizza Hut.&quot; It won't work all of the time, or even most of the time. But as long as it works on some people some of the time, it's going to have a sizable impact on a chain's business. Maybe they affect your pizza-buying decisions once a year. Even if ads only affect the pizza-buying decisions of every pizza consumer once a year on average, ads would still be responsible for millions of pizza purchases every year. Maybe most of those purchases would still happen without the ads, but the ads will affect which chains people purchase from, as well as whether or not they order from a chain or from a local place. </p>
<p>Now, it's possible that if all the pizza places just agreed to stop advertising, they could save money and people would still buy tons of pizza, because people love pizza. But there are a lot of reasons why that would never happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They're placed to make you aware that the Volkswagen Jetta is a thing. So that when you decide it is time for a new car, the Jetta might come to mind before the Chevrolet Malibu.</p>
<p>Some adverts are intended to induce rapid buying. Often these are placed by stores. An example would be a grocery store saying &quot;bananas just 39c a pound, fresh Illinois watermelon just $2.99 each, now through Sunday at Food Lion&quot;</p>
<p>I'd like to say it doesn't work, but I know I picked my plumber based on adverts. There's probably other things that don't immediately come to mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
