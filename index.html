		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Controlling a hot air ballon is a lot of guesswork. Educated guesswork, but guesswork nonetheless.</p>
<p>By controlling the heat inside the actual ballon (this is done using gas burners) it's possible to control if the ballon is rising (because it's hotter than the surrounding air) or declining (because it's colder, respectively.).</p>
<p>The ballon also has a valve at the top where you can let hot air out, to speed up the process of cooling down.</p>
<p>And that is really all there is to it. Hot ballon goes up. Cold ballon goes down.</p>
<p>Actual navigation, though, takes skill. A ballon is always and indefinitely moving in the direction the wind is blowing. Which means that if you want to go west, you'll have to wait until you have wind blowing towards the west.</p>
<p>Complicating things a bit, wind can blow in different directions at different heights. Which means that you can go higher and find a patch of wind going in sort of the right direction instead of staying low and going in the exact opposite direction.</p>
<p>The easiest way to find out exactly how the wind is blowing above you is to release a small helium ballon (because helium ballons always go up) and see in which direction it goes when the wind grabs hold of it.</p>
<p>The rest is all about skill. Knowledge. A tour ballon pilot would typically have several pre-planned routes to choose from depending on wind direction. &quot;If the wind is blowing westward, we'll have to start east of the national park with all the wild animals. And land someplace west of it.&quot; The problem is the &quot;someplace&quot; bit, because you don't necessarily end up where you intended to.</p>
<p>Most aircraft can fend for themselves and force a direction they want with a propeller, but an air ballon just...can't. So, to simplify things for everyone, air ballons got their own set of aviation rules where other aircraft has to make way for them. The obvious issue here is of course that ballons are not necessarily welcome in any airspace, because the extra considerations everyone else has to make for them.</p>
<p>Things that typically go wrong is that the wind changes at the exact worst thinkable time, pushing the ballon towards a high voltage power line. Or, you know, towards a forest. Or a cliffside. Any place where you can't immediately land is a risk that the pilot would try to avoid. Passing a risk area means that they have to plan ahead.</p>
<p>When all you can control is height, you'll have to go higher. Because if you can only go up, then you are soon out of options. But if you can also go down, then you got two options to choose from.</p>
<p>What happens when the ballon risks running into a power line is that the pilot has to consider the two options. 1) burn gas and get more heat so that the ballon slowly rises? 2) release hot air so that the ballon quickly goes down?</p>
<p>Going down is always easy. Going down comfortably, thats more difficult. Going down comfortably when you are in a hurry, When you desperately have to come down immediately, that takes skill. And could definitely involve bruises as a calculated better outcome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm sure there are times when that can't be accomplished at all, so they just go with the flow and see where it takes them.  As long as they don't hit a power line or get blown out to sea, it's probably all good with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>They're pretty much at the mercy of the wind. A rough idea of their direction can be found by checking weather reports before flying.</p>
<p>However, the one thing the pilot can control is his height. By changing how much and how often he uses the burner, he can control the temperature in the balloon. This changes the amount of lift the balloon has, so it goes up or down accordingly.</p>
<p>Some limited ability to steer is given by the fact that wind direction at different heights can vary. The pilot can use this to gain a small amount of control over his direction.</p>
<p>But most importantly, he has plenty of fuel. A wise pilot will land well before he runs out of fuel, normally in a convenient field. He then gets picked up by other people who have been following the balloon on the ground by road.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. They can raise and lower the balloon by firing their burners to heat up the balloon's air. The more they heat the air up, the higher they will go (the less dense the balloon is and therefore the more bouyant.) If they stop using the burners the air will cool down and the balloon will slowly start to sink. Besides that however, they have no other ability to steer. That being said, wind goes different directions at different heights, so they can adjust their direction that way. There is no guarantee that the wind will go the direction they wish though, so they are ultimately at the hands of mother nature. Often the fairgrounds or other take off locations will have several tools to measure the wind speeds so that they can get a general idea of where they are going so that they land in a field instead of the woods.</p>
<p>Since they don't know where they are going to land, most balloons have a van that follows them on the roads below. The people in the van have the job of picking up the passengers and taking them back to their starting position as well as help take down and haul the balloon. </p>
<p>Besides that, a lot of what can go wrong is stopped just by preventative measures. Hot air balloons won't fly on a very windy day or in lightning, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't appear cyclic to the human eye.  It appears cyclic to the human <em>brain</em>.  </p>
<p>Our eyes can detect 3 &quot;regions&quot; of color: red, green, and blue.  If we detect some combinations of those, we typically perceive that as an &quot;in-between&quot; color.  For example, orange light stimulates both the red and green sensing cells in our eyes.  So stimulating the red and green cells is what we perceive as &quot;orange&quot;.  And, interestingly, if we just use red and green light (no orange light), we can stimulate those cells exactly the same as orange light, and so we still see orange.  In fact, that's the basis for how computer and phone displays work:  They only emit red, green, and blue light, and our brains perceive combinations of those as other colors.</p>
<p>But here comes the strangeness!  What happens when you stimulate the red and blue cells in the eye with red and blue light?  Well, your first guess is that we should perceive the color that is &quot;in between&quot; red and blue on the spectrum.  But that color is green, and we're specifically <em>not</em> stimulating the green-detecting cells in our eyes.  However, your brain isn't really capable of seeing it as two different colors (red and blue) simultaneously, so it invents a new color!  Purple!</p>
<p>That's right, purple, the color that allows our sense of the spectrum to be cyclical, <em>isn't a real color</em>.  There is no such thing as a purple photon of light.  Purple can <em>only</em> be perceived by the human brain as a side effect of the limitations of our visual system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add something extra to the excellent explanation already provided...</p>
<p>Our color vision is usually a matter of our vision system interpolating between the colors detected by our three flavours of cones in our retina. Think of it like a triangle, with red, green and blue in the corners and all the other colors somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>But then consider that a small percentage of human females are &quot;tetrachromats&quot;. For them, there are 4 types of color receptors in their retina. For them, the perceived color is interpolated between 4 different points. You have to imagine this in 3d now, like a 3 sided pyramid with 4 point of detected color, and some interpreted color point somewhere in the 3d space of the pyramid.</p>
<p>Tetrachromats may be able to distinguish 100 million colors ...</p>

<p>So, attempting to find a graph of the efficacy of the flu vaccine after injection was very difficult. However, I did find <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank">this</a> page regarding the flu vaccine wherein it states that the antibodies build up over a period of two weeks.</p>
<p>From there, it was actually pretty easy to find a graph of the antibodies and how they build up over time, seen <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pnBf2.png" target="_blank">here</a>. But the reason why I'm posting is to direct you to <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/42977/why-does-immunity-from-the-flu-vaccine-appear-only-after-two-weeks" target="_blank">this</a> stackexchange post.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although antibody titer is helpful in gauging the response to an ongoing infection, that has nothing to do with the efficacy of the vaccine against future infections. Antibodies to the flu vaccine are produced by plasma B cells, which are proliferating and producing the antibody according to the graph that the other commentator posted. Technically, if you got infected by the real flu once those antibodies are at maximum, your body will probably fight it off instantly. You might not even know you ever got infected.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t get infected by the flu in that short time frame, your antibody titer will drop off dramatically, probably within a week or two (although I’m not sure how fast this drop off actual is). After that, it’s up to a different type of B cell, memory B cells, to respond to an infection. These respond much faster than the initial response and will differentiate and multiply into plasma cells to produce the antibody again.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, you’re not looking for the time in which it takes for antibodies to form in response to an infection, but the time for a sufficiently large population of memory B cells to form. Since both responses begin at the same time, the timeframe might be (but isn’t necessarily) the same. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That is hardly the case however, since you could have a subclinical flu, or you could have flu with a wide range of severely in symptoms. I think you will have more luck if you regard the problem as a question of antibody titers, preferable IgG antibody titer. I think information should be available for average antibody titer at different time points after infection.

The effectiveness that I think you are referring to occurs at the population scale, where the proportion of cases prevented by the vaccine can be estimated based on vaccine use, strain matching, and confirmed influenza cases. So, if the vaccine is said to be “10% effective” then 10% of total influenza cases predicted based on epidemiological data were prevented by vaccine use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human cells can replace themselves, this is correct. But they need a scaffold to replace themselves ON for them to be in the right place. And the nature of that scaffold is why scars stick around forever.</p>
<p>Let's compare our bodies to a multi-floor brick building that King Kong or Cloverfield or Godzilla or something punches a big chunk out of.</p>
<p>You have a couple choices to do something about that building before the weather gets in and wrecks it worse. But a feasible one of them isn't a complete tear-down and rebuild using scaffolding and heavy construction to recreate the building properly. People have got to go on living in there and there's not enough free spending money around to do it.</p>
<p>So you patch that hole as best you can and maybe brick up the opening, and that's good enough for people to keep living in it. But it leaves a not-very-pretty gap in your building. It's functional even if some of the electrical stuff or elevators don't work due to the still missing area, and it looks ugly because you couldn't quite get everything perfect without bringing in super-expensive heavy machinery and shutting everything down, and the bricks don't match. So you're left with a serviceable building with ugly spots that you can't ever afford to make perfect-looking again.</p>
<p>Scarring's the same. The body doesn't have the ability to regenerate huge missing areas because it can't create scaffolding once you're out of the womb. All of the 'heavy equipment' necessary for it is no longer available. This wasn't critical enough of a skill for us to evolve as a species because enough of us survived and had kids even without it to take over the world. So the body goes with a &quot;walling off&quot; strategy without coming with a bunch of perfectly set-up scaffolding to build new clean supporting structures for the new cells to grow back into their perfect original shape. </p>
<p>And those wall-offs are dead 'hard' tissue that is permanently set into their walled-off shape and can't be replaced. Again, perfect-looking repairs weren't necessary to the survival of our species so we didn't evolve them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human cells don't replace themselves every 7 years.  Different cell types regenerate at different rates. </p>
<p>I believe that muscle cells replace themselves once every 10 years at birth, but this declines rapidly as you age.  By the time you die, only about half of your muscle cells have been replaced.</p>
<p>Your intestines are replaced every 4 days or so (the poor things). </p>
<p>Your pancreas beta cells are replaced every 60 days or so.</p>
<p>Your epidermal cells (outermost skin cells) are replaced every month.</p>
<p>Your liver cells are replaced every year or so.</p>
<p>Fat cells are replaced at the 7-8 year cycle rate that the urban legend dictates.</p>
<p>When you get a minor cut that does not puncture the entire epidermis, the injury will generally heal completely because there are epidermal cells underneath that grow outwards.  As the cells above are pushed upwards and outwards they will slough off revealing the newer epidermal cells beneath. The skin is as good as new after a month or so.</p>
<p>However a deeper wound heals differently.  The wound fills with blood, platelets and clotting agents to form a clot.  Next fibroblasts are attracted to the wound site and begin producing collagen.  The epidermis then tries to cover the wound site with skin cells (this can only happen if the wound remains moist - if the wound dries out, the healing process slows immensely which is one of the main reasons why bandaging a wound is so important).  Scar tissue forms by filling the wound with collagen.  Once the wound has healed, the collagen remains.</p>
<p>Over time, the collagen around the edge of the wound may slowly get replaced by neighboring cells, but if the wound is simply too large the regeneration of neighboring cells isn't fast enough to replace the nonfunctional tissue with functional cells.  Remember, the neighboring cells have to pull double duty.  In order for the scar to disappear, neighboring cells have to replace not only themselves but also their neighbors.  They can do this to a point, but it is ultimately limited.  So the body keeps the collagen in place which prevents the scar from disappearing entirely.  The scar isn't functional, but it is strong, tough tissue that holds itself together so its better than nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your scar-tissue is replaced as well. Basically your body can simply “forget“ what is scar tissue and how it originally was supposed to look like.
Luckily we have developed a mechanism that reduces scar tissue back after it has done it's job but it's not perfect and since, most often, the consequence of this “failiure“ is only a minor optical flaw the evolutionary pressure to improve that process is rather low.
Possible causes for the system “failing“ are most likely quite diverse but what can be said is: Replacing cells does not automatically restore the information of how the cells were arranged. </p>
<p>Edit: Forgot burn scars- i assume they work quite differently from scars caused by purely mechanical damage.
But the basic idea is always the same: replacing cells can also copy the “damaged/faulty“ tissue...the correction of what is copied needs to be done separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that they don't replace themselves every 7 years.</p>
<p>While it's true that some cells are constantly replaced (e.g. the outer layers of your skin are continuously dying, falling off, and being replaced throughout your life), others are never replaced. Many of your cells (e.g. neurons, muscle cells) are the same ones you had when you were born or when you finished growing. This is why you can recover from a stab wound but not a brain injury - skin regrows quickly, but neurons never do.</p>
<p>I've heard the 7 years number before, usually in relation to specific cell types. I'm not a PhD in biology (did a minor with my BA and I'm a nursing student), but I'm calling urban legend on that number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Scars are not cells, they are extracellular (outside cells) materials, mainly 'collagen' formed when more severe injury can not be healed by simple cell replication. Some scars fade slowly over many years (depending on severity and location) because that dense collagen is reabsorbed by cells and replaced by living tissue (cells) again.</p>
<p>*Note this is a gross oversimplification (ELI5) there are many, many extracellular proteins, collagen being the most important and prolific in scar formation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;The channel is more like a high-gradient mountain stream with a very

through the divide and reached Malebo Pool, forming the present Lower Congo
River. &quot; </p>
<p>This is the location where that measurement came from.</p>
<p>However reading the rest of it, this is an anomalous depth and the majority of the river co forms to more normal standards and is around 10 to 80m on average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The first European to explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingstone_Falls" target="_blank">the Livingstone falls</a> (the long, steep stretch above Matadi), Henry Morton Stanley, said of them:</p>
<p><em>&quot;..the wildest stretch of river that I have ever seen. Take a strip of sea blown over by a hurricane, four miles in length and half a mile in breadth, and a pretty accurate conception of its leaping waves may be obtained. Some of the troughs were 100 yards in length, and from one to the other the mad river plunged. There was first a rush down into the bottom of an immense trough, and then, by its sheer force, the enormous volume would lift itself upward steeply until, gathering itself into a ridge, it suddenly hurled itself 20 or 30 feet straight upward, before rolling down into another trough. If I looked up or down along this angry scene, every interval of 50 or 100 yards of it was marked by wave-towers - their collapse into foam and spray, the mad clash of watery hills, bounding mounds and heaving billows, while the base of either bank, consisting of a long line of piled boulders of massive size, was buried in the tempestuous surf. The roar was tremendous and deafening. I can only compare it to the thunder of an express train through a rock tunnel.&quot;</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As usual, there is a relevant XKCD...</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/927/</a></p>
<p>Automod appeasement edit:</p>
<p>At one point, there was only one type of screw. I'm no screwolologist, but it seems fair that the straight slot would've been that one type.</p>
<p>Its ups were that it was easy to manufacture and it was easy to make a tool for it, but anybody who's used a straight-head knows it's a terrible, terrible screw head.</p>
<p>So somebody set out to make a better one. I've no idea if I'm right, but I'm gonna guess it was a guy named Phillips. So he said, if one slot was ok, then two slots should be better! But anybody who's used a Phillips screw knows that they come with an appallingly low torque limit before you now have a conical-head screw that's impossible to do anything with.</p>
<p>So somebody said straight heads suck, and phillips heads aren't much better, so I'll make one with some more meat in the tool and straight sides so rounding off and breaking tips wasn't such a concern. Thus, the Allen head was born. Except that allen/hex heads, below a certain size, are even easier to round out than Phillips heads were, and it's fucking impossible to get the hex key in there straight/to full depth in the fastener.</p>
<p>So somebody said, that Allen guy was on the right track, but he didn't go far enough. So the Torx bit got invented.</p>
<p>But then, people said that Torx was too complicated and it's impossible to tell the difference between a T25 and a T27 and oh my god why are there so many choices? So we went back to basics and saw if we couldn't improve on the Phillips design, which beyond its propensity to snap tips and round off fastener heads wasn't a <em>bad</em> design. So we got stuff like JIS, which is virtually identical to Phillips but designed to destroy your phillips bits, and Posidriv, which is the bane of my personal existence because they're designed to never, never strip while tightening (which they don't), but to always always strip immediately when removing (which they do).</p>
<p>So that shit got real complicated and somebody said, guys, guys, you're making this too complicated, eh? What if we took an Allen, which is ok but has too small a load-bearing shoulder and too-great leverage angles, and simplified it, eh? And the Robertson (us Yanks call it a square bit) drive was born. And it was good.</p>
<p>But somebody saw that the construction industry was using a messy hodgepodge of phillips and robertson screws and said, what if we combine them so construction people don't have to buy so many different bits? So now there's a combined R1/#2 phillips bit and screw. I guess that guy never got told about Torx bits, but hey, whatever. So now the construction industry is using an even messier hodgepodge of phillips, robertson, torx, and combi-drive bits.</p>
<p>And then, electronics came along, and at some point electronics manufacturers decided that we lowly consumers couldn't be trusted/were too dumb to open their electronics, so anti-tamper bits had to be made, because everybody had tools to open the bits that were already around, for the most part. So they made those, starting with the Torx bits with the little posts in the middle, but it turns out those are pretty expensive to manufacture so they started making tri-wing screws, and those dove-tail head screws and the two-post screws and etc. etc. etc. because all the same shit that happened in the 10 paragraphs above happened in the anti-tamper-bit world all over again.</p>
<p>Over time each industry sort of settled on certain screw type heads for certain applications, because as there was no &quot;perfect&quot; screw head each type had its strengths and weaknesses, and everybody is firmly entrenched in their own screw head system, and there is <em>very</em> little hope of ever unifying everybody, because there's a lot of money in it now. That doesn't stop people from trying, though - but since they don't understand the market dynamics and why there will never be such a thing as the one true screw head, all they do is just add yet another type to the mix, confusing everybody just that much more.</p>
<p>Edit 2: well now my inbox is screwed, and it seems somebody has put an idea for a new screw head next to my name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Flathead screwdrivers suck, but they were something you could make with a hammer and anvil and forge. Philips (the real ones) were designed before power drivers with torque control were invented.</p>
<p>There are a zillion modern designs to provide greater torque limits with reduced material (weight/space/size) that view standardization as an accomplice to theft.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to Skatingraccoon's answer, many companies develop their own screws or other methods of attachment for their products to make it harder for the consumer to repair the item on their own. A proprietary screw needs a proprietary screwdriver, and if the company that makes the screw doesn't sell the driver, then it means people have to go to the company for repairs, which allows the company to charge them more than it actually costs to fix the product. </p>
<p>Nowadays, smartphones are growing more and more proprietary, and the reason is so that it is more difficult to fix a damaged phone. With some of Apple's earlier iPhones you can see the unique shape of the screw: (<a href="https://goo.gl/images/sTQqgN" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/images/sTQqgN</a>)</p>
<p>Although apple did not create the 5-point screw, when they made the iPhone 4s they recognized that it was a very uncommon fastener, so they have used it to make their iPhones ever since.</p>
<p>As the industry is racing towards thinner phones with larger screens and smaller bezels, some manufacturers have removed external screws altogether. The Google Pixel for example, has no screws on the outside. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is another phone without visible screws. This is achieved by using an adhesive to fasten the screen to the frame, which saves space, and makes self-repairs much harder than before.</p>
<p>That's just the relation to smartphones though, in construction and industry there are many other applications for unique screws. A little-known fact about screws is that screws with more vertices and angles in the bit design grip the driver better. For example, if you had a screw that had a bit shaped like an octopus, that would give the drill bit 9 points to transfer energy into the screw (8 legs and the head). If you had a screw with a bit shaped like a snowflake, it would be even better. The problem with forcing a lot of vertices into the design of the screw/bit is that it becomes easier to break the screw/bit, and the time/cost of production increases. That's why there are so many kinds of screws, so that consumers can choose the right one based on what they're doing and what their budget is.</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another angle people are not really covering.  </p>
<p>The world wasn’t always as it is today. Transportation of products was far more difficult and expensive. </p>
<p>Things like screws, bolts, and fasteners are fairly cheap to make. People making more complex items would either make these fasteners themselves, or get them from someone local. </p>
<p>Now expand that idea across the entire world.  </p>
<p>With information and products being shared more everyday, there is less variation. However habit is a strong motivator. If my manufacturing process is working smoothly, why change?</p>
<p>In all honestly is surprising there are not more variations. </p>
<p>On a side note, this expands to many things.  Recently I took a truck driving job.  I found it really odd how many different warehouses, even by the same company, have totally different procedures in the way they do logistics. Unless I’ve been to that exact warehouse before, I have no idea what policy’s and procedures they will have. </p>
<p>What makes things even more complicated is that everyone assumes that things are done the same everywhere, so there’s an assumption I should know what to do.  </p>
<p>You’d think there’s one best way to do things, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A common way is to use a nuclear reactor. The chain reaction produces a lot of neutrons. By construction a neutron transparent &quot;window&quot; into the reactor, some of the neutrons will escape through the window, in a crude beam. You can then place the experiment in the beam.</p>
<p>Some experiments, can simply be done in the reactor - and a small test tube containing the experiment can just be installed into the reactor core.</p>
<p>While fission reactors are low tech and can produce very large numbers of neutrons, they are limited in the energy of neutrons that they can produce. Many designs of nuclear reactor use a &quot;moderator&quot; to reduce the neutron energy for the chain reaction, and this will reduce the energy of the neutrons available for experiments. Even &quot;fast&quot; reactors without a moderator are limited to the maximum energy of fission neutrons.</p>
<p>Where faster neutrons are required, a fusion reactor can be used. However, while fusion reactors can be constructed extremely cheaply and compactly, this type of design has been limited to very low power and therefore very low neutron production rate. A new generation of advanced &quot;compact neutron source&quot; fusion reactors optimised for very high neutron production rates (<a href="https://www.phoenixwi.com/product/high-yield-neutron-generator" target="_blank">https://www.phoenixwi.com/product/high-yield-neutron-generator</a>).</p>
<p>Some of the latest technology versions are so powerful and efficient, that they are often easier, cheaper and safer to use than fission reactors. Due to the risk of fission reactors being subverted for production of nuclear weapons, many governments are pushing for research institutions to replace their fission reactors with fusion sources. You can always add a moderator to reduce the neutron energy if the fusion neutrons are too fast for your experiment.</p>
<p>For experiments requiring neutrons which are faster than the maximum fusion neutron energy, then you need to use a particle accelerator and a &quot;spallation target&quot;. A proton accelerator is produce a beam of high energy protons - which are directed at a target made from a heavy metal. The protons hit the nuclei in the target and smash off neutrons. These can have energies as high as the proton beam energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the projects I work on uses a dense plasma focus machine, also known as a z-pinch machine. Trying to keep it ELI5, it uses a huge electric current to create plasma in a tube filled with tritium and deuterium. The way it's designed, the extreme magnetic fields crush the deuterium and tritium together, which causes a fusion reaction, to provide a burst of high energy neutrons. We then place the target in the path of those neutrons next to the source. I don't think I can really get more technical without leaving ELI5 territory, but at least I don't have to worry about what is and isn't classified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The second way of doing it is to take very fast moving protons (the middle of a hydrogen atom) and smash them into Tungsten. A process called spallation happens, but basically the protons are moving fast enough to 'knock' some neutrons out. This works well for scientists because essentially if you turn of the proton source you turn off the neutron source, unfortunately it requires building particle accelerators, which is quite an expensive thing to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have discussed the two main processes of producing a beam of neutrons, namely spallation and nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>I thought it should be mentioned that these two provide different types of neutron beams that are more or less suited to particular experiments.</p>
<p>In general, neutron scattering experiments tell you information about where the nuclei in atoms are, how they can be excited (e.g. Vibrations), and things like their magnetic moments due to the dipole moment of the neutron. This is very useful for a huge range of applications, including materials science / engineering, condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, archaeology etc, there really are a huge variety of neutron experiments performed every day at facilities around the world.</p>
<p>In a reactor source, you have a continuous source of neutrons, whilst in a spallation source you get pulses of neutrons. A spallation source will have a much lower flux, however it is important to know the initial energy of the neutron, and it is here where the pulsed nature of spallation sources has a great benefit. Since neutrons are created at well defined times in bursts, and since neutrons have mass and so do not travel at the speed of light, it is possible to work out a specific neutrons energy from its speed. Since the distance from the source to the detector is well calibrated, and the time of creation is known, it is possible to use how long it took to detect the neutron (aka its Time Of Flight) to label the energy.</p>
<p>In this way, reactor sources give very high flux of a specific energy, whilst spallation TOF give access to a range of energies, that can be separated out with the TOF, and is more suited for broad surveys where more than one incident energy is required </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound we hear is actually vibrating air that pushes against our eardrums, making them vibrate as well. But lots of things can vibrate (not just air), and when those things are in contact with air, they cause the air to vibrate as well. This is how materials can transmit or produce sound. For example, the sound of a violin is produced by the vibrations of its <del>snares</del> strings against the air. And the <del>snares</del> strings will also cause vibrations in the wood of the violin, which has a larger contact surface with the air, and thus amplifies the sound. </p>
<p>Sound 'escapes' the body because it makes the tissues in the body vibrate, and then those vibrations reach the air. It's the same reason why inside a sealed (airtight) room you can still hear sounds produced outside: the sound is transmitted through the walls and (especially) the windows. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound actually travels faster through solids (and liquids) than air because the next molecule to be pushed by the wave is closer in these media than in a gas. So sound speed is gas &lt; liquid &lt; solid. That's all to say that it just goes from your meat space to the air space with a change in the medium, but no real problem for the wave propagation,but the sound exists inside you too. Think about hearing something with your head under water. The water is a different medium than we're used to listening in, but our eardrums are still vibrated by it and so we can still hear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hail can only form in very specific conditions, and only in a very specific part of a very energetic thunderstorm. Rain or snow doesn't even need a thunderstorm - just any old storm will do.</p>
<p>For hail to form there needs to be a convective cycling of warm liquid water upwards at the front of a storm which then freezes. At that point it falls down towards the lower bits of the storm where the temps are above the freezing point. That ice ball then gets coated in liquid water, will cycle upwards again to freeze another layer over the first, and so on. At some point, it's so heavy that updraft winds can't carry it upwards, and it falls to the ground. It's shown more completely in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pl1DDLX.jpg" target="_blank">this diagram</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, the only place hail can really efficiently form is right at <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gbG9Koj.jpg" target="_blank">the edge between the leading updraft and the trailing downdraft</a>, leaving a relatively narrow ground track of the place where hail can actually fall to the ground. </p>
<p>You can also determine the number of convective cycles the hail went through before falling to the ground by <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZgwHvS3.jpg" target="_blank">looking a the cross section of a hail stone</a>. Each layer there was formed from a single cycle of liquid coating and refreezing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
