<p>We can produce elements up to 118, and beyond uranium (92) their lifetime decreases with increasing element number - while uranium has a lifetime of billions of years the heaviest elements just live fractions of a second. Even heavier elements could live a bit long<em>er</em> (maybe several seconds, maybe even days - &quot;island of stability&quot;), it is not expected that there are elements with a long lifetime. Even if supernovae can produce elements beyond 118 (which is unclear on its own), they would probably decay quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, broadleaf trees (as opposed to needleleaf trees) tend to have higher maximum photosynthetic capacities. If they are not resource limited, they can sequester more carbon. </p>
<p>What is also important to consider is how long carbon will be sequestered from the atmosphere (carbon residence time). Needleleaf trees tend to decompose more slowly due to their nitrogen content and carbon stability in the tree tissues, making them less degradable. They also tend to be longer lived, but it really depends on the environment that the tree is in. The boreal forests (northern latitudes) are dominated by needleleaf trees because it is colder. Most of the carbon is stored in soils because there is less microbial decomposition. In the tropics, there is a lot more primary productivity (growth), and there are no needleleafs in the tropics, but it is warm and rapid nutrient cycling, so much less carbon stored in soils in most locations. There are exceptions... a peat bog was discovered in the Congo and it stores a lot of carbon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are actually several different subtypes of photosynthesis and the one most efficient is called c4 (which also has several subtypes but we will ignore it for now). Photosynthesis is also dependent on humidity, temperature, plant health and of course light quality and amount. The ideal photosynthetic tree I would say would have broad leaves, be a c4 plant, not be under drought stress and is getting the right wavelengths of light and not too much of it. Though in reality photosynthesis is very very inefficient, I believe one of my professors say that maybe 3% of light is actually used to do photosynthesis while the rest is reflected off as heat or is accounted for in other pathways.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People think that trees convert CO<em><em>2</em></em> into oxygen, like they are factories that take carbon dioxide as an input and generate oxygen as an output.  They don't, this is a myth.</p>
<p>Trees don't <em>convert</em> CO<em><em>2</em></em>, they just <em>sequester</em> carbon, in their leaves and wood.  That is to say, so long as the tree is growing, sure, it consumes CO<em><em>2</em></em>.  But when a tree matures or is constrained (by oh, I don't know, that concrete slab right next to the soil in your urban environment) in it's growth, it stops sequestering carbon.  And when that tree dies?  It decomposes and returns all it's carbon back to the atmosphere as CO<em><em>2</em></em>.  So sure, trees do sequester carbon, though there seems to be little point in going out of our way to plant them in cities where space is at a premium when you can just plant them rural areas where it <em>is not</em>.</p>
<p>But if we ignore all that, I would imagine the best trees for your purposes might be ones that grow very very tall but stay narrow.  You're going to be constrained in how far it can grow outward by it's environment, but for most cities at least the roots can grow <em>downward</em>.  (NYC is an exception: Subways.)  Maybe bamboo?  Bamboo is so hardy it's considered an invasive species in many states.  Grows fast as hell, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Ejaculation, on the other hand, involves forceful rhythmic contractions. The vas deferens, the tube that carries semen, is wrapped with a ridiculous amount of smooth muscle. Cross-section:(<a href="https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1299736/286495313/stock-photo-cross-section-of-the-vas-deferens-tissue-in-the-microscopic-view-286495313.jpg" target="_blank">https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1299736/286495313/stock-photo-cross-section-of-the-vas-deferens-tissue-in-the-microscopic-view-286495313.jpg</a>) </p>
<p>This is further assisted by the bulbospongiosus muscle at the base of the penis, and the pubococcygeus muscle in the pelvis. </p>
<p>EDIT: It's been a few years since I've had to use this knowledge. The bulbospongiosus and pubococcygeus drive all the forceful emission; the vas deferens slowly propels sperm to its waiting place in advance of ejaculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Researches who somehow managed to capture “split ejaculates” for analysis found that the first spurts contain chemicals that protect against various kinds of chemical attack (they protect the sperm from the chemicals in the later spurts of men’s ejaculate). These final spurts contain a spermicidal substance that slows the advance of any latecomers.

<p>People always conflate the function of evolution with some motive. There is no thought process. If there were, then we'd all be walking around with great, hulking eleven inch dongs. Luckily for me, many other men do not.</p>
<p>Evolution simply says that the passage of genes is bound to the rules of statistics. Over some number of generations (n), a different number of loads will be delivered (n^l ). Of those, a different number of successful loads will be delivered (n^L ), which will lead to successful initiation of cell division within the female. </p>
<p>All traits that lead to an increase in n^L will accumulate, while those that lead to an increase in n^l may or may not. One trait that leads to an increased n^L could be a grisly, vascularized, girthy eleven inch dong. Another may be more fully developed set of cum shooting muscles. Another is very most certainly a dominating, mushroomed glans (which serves to physically scoop the cum from the last dudes load out, thus rendering his cum shooting strength irrelevant).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.</p>
<p>The hyperloop test track is about a quarter mile and about 4.5 feet in diameter, and by volume is the second largest vacuum chamber on Earth. There's a shit ton of energy in a vacuum, as the test track has ~14.6 psi on it which is nothing to scoff at when you have ~19,000 sq.ft (Edit: 2,736,000 sq.in, to keep consistent with the units - that's 39,945,600 lbs of pressure on the vessel) of surface area. Any falter in the structural integrity anywhere will cause a cascade implosion failure along it's entire length until the vessel ruptures and vacuum is lost. The thing is wildly dangerous just to stand next to it.</p>
<p>(Edit 2: rapid loss of vacuum is about as deadly and destructive as the implosion itself.)</p>
<p>But of course they said it's only a partial vacuum, but what they didn't get into was that their partial vacuum is ~99% to a perfect vacuum. The difference is irrelevant when you're talking a chamber this large.</p>
<p>The second prototype is currently using steel so thin it can't even support it's own weight, and they want to suspend it on pylons. And the suggested plan is to run this thing in a loop the length of California? Any earthquake, any car crash into a pillar, any punk kid who throws a brick at it, any significant falter in it's construction or due to weathering, and the thing can implode. Thicker steel and more structural support can only offset the danger until the construction is too expensive to be feasible.</p>
<p>Boarding would require chambers to hold the vacuum in the whole system while the train is accessed. Then it has to be sealed and vacuumed. They will have to build the biggest vacuum system in the world to pull a perfect vacuum in an appreciable amount of time and keep the whole system under vacuum, because the test track took about an hour per, and they had to pressurize the whole thing every time the opened it. It currently takes longer to pull a vacuum than it would take to travel the length of California by more conventional means.</p>
<p>Trains are not cost effective for passenger travel because the maintenance costs are astronomical and commuter needs are at odds, too many stops, and it's not time effective and will drive away customers, too few stops and you won't have enough customers to be cost effective. High speed trains are ever more so expensive and dangerous. In an airplane at 640 mph, any sort of bump, and you have miles space to gracefully dampen it. Any bump in a bullet train, and no matter what, it has to remain on it's rails, and now it has to remain on its rails and not hit the walls of the vacuum chamber.</p>
<p>Overall, the thing is insane and the liability is huge. No one would seriously fund this project and no government safety regulators would ever allow it to go into production. But I appreciate it for what it is, and that is to get engineers and students thinking outside the box. That's all. This is a publicity stunt and they know it, but it's also a prospect for innovation they might scoop up and invest in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terrorism is the pursuit of political aims by way of violence.  Typically, terrorist groups aren't large enough, or trained well enough, or armed well enough (or any combination of all three) to take on domestic armies, meaning that a military coup or invasion is impossible.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups try to spread their ideas through violence against the easiest potential targets, which has two factors working for it.  Firstly, the chance to succeed is much higher - if you want to drive an HGV through a military base, you're likely to be stopped fairly quickly.  If you drive the same HGV through a civilian crowd, you can do significantly more damage before being stopped.</p>
<p>Secondly, the military expect to be targets.  Civilians do not.  When civilians are subject to attacks, the population (in theory) becomes afraid.  Imagine if a country was subject to one terrorist attack per week, which killed ten people.  The entire population would learn to be afraid of the next attack, because who knows who's going to die next.</p>
<p>This leads to cries for politicians to take action to help.  By attacking &quot;soft&quot; targets (targets which are relatively unprotected, like public transport/spaces), the terrorists are ensuring that there's as little chance of stopping them as possible.  It becomes difficult, therefore, for the politicians to change <em>domestic</em> policy in a way that prevents further attacks.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the terrorists, the rational response here would be for the government to change their <em>foreign</em> policy to make the attacks stop.  The easiest way to do that?  Stop doing whatever you're doing that's upsetting the terrorist groups.</p>
<p>That's effectively what the aim is.  It becomes more problematic when you're looking at things like IS, whose goals are more nebulous.</p>

<p>watching current events you should be seeing that in actuality people hold a lot of power. </p>
<p>ask yourself if you think brexit would have happened or trump would be president if it were not for the threat of terrorists. </p>
<p>you could very well argue that in what has been a prolonged 'war on terror' when you compare what each side has achieved, the terrorists aren't doing a bad job.<br />
We are currently seeing a global move towards nationalist ideas which break down the strength of coalitions with inward thinking. This isn't just happening by chance, the people are demanding it because they see terrorism on the news and they see Islamic refugee coming to their countries, and it scares them. </p>
<p>it's not a well-educated disposition, but the people hold all the power in their vote, and there are enough people that buy into the terror as seen by brexit, la pen, trump, Party for Freedom etc etc. . </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terrorism was originally a term referring to &quot;the Reign of Terror&quot;, where the french revolutionaries used fear to reshape the french mindset regarding governance.</p>
<p>In practical terms terrorists are people too powerless to pursue actual war. So they incite fear (terror) in the population (civilians) to get that body to force it's own government to shift policies to make the bad men go away.</p>
<p>What is hoped for is &quot;appeasement&quot;.</p>
<p>For example after the terrorist act of killing cartoonists for drawing pictures of some particular guy, lots of governments and corporations outlawed drawing pictures of that guy by fiat because the people were all afraid of getting in trouble for laughing at that guy.</p>
<p>Terrorism relies on irrational biases. When we hear about one incidence of something dangerous happening we tend to fear it disproportionately.</p>
<p>For instance, when Jaws was released people were afraid to go to the beach because of sharks, but they weren't afraid to jump in their steel death carriages that kill tens of thousands of people a year to go to the mountains or the mall instead of the beach.</p>
<p>The United States was particularly well suited as a target for terrorism because we are surrounded by oceans and just the two very nice neighbors. So for many decades most other countries had atrocities every year. But when our weak leaders (Bush et al) decided to ring the bell of appeasement as an excuse to push a jingoist agenda the fear took root and flowered effusively.</p>
<p>Note that the fear fire wasn't fanned after Oklahoma because the white christian men weren't sufficiently &quot;the other&quot; to be useful, and the leadership was stronger, or at least less unified in an authoritarian goal.</p>
<p>So the point of terrorism is to make all the sheep run in one direction (away) and so force-or-allow the shepherds to get the sheep all into a line.</p>
<p>Even now, drawing a picture of that one guy is verboten, and that lasting victory has caused a lot of me-too, I want to make a difference, radicalization to take place world-wide.</p>
<p>If I can make you not draw that picture, then maybe I can make you wrap your women in sheets, or make you put ten-commandment monuments in your schools, or stop buying GMO ice cream.</p>
<p>Whatever my petty agenda, if I can make you see me as a boogy-man I can get <em>you</em> to demand that your lawmakers take me and my bullshit seriously.</p>
<p>Back when the IRA was bombing London, nobody said that Catholics were dangerous and should be deported. Everybody knew that terrorism was just a few cunts that need to be opposed. If enough people were like-minded they'd have raised a real army not a clutch of dick-bags with truck bombs.</p>
<p>So terrorism is the use of popular fear as a force magnifier to get otherwise stupid and unpopular goals into the public mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Civilians are weak and cannot fight back. Attacking military or police forces or other non-civilian group/organization won't likely gain the same attention as attacking those who are most likely not trained to go into danger. Killing non-civilian people and only that side is affected, it's unexpected and scared and terrible, but people as a whole would go on with their lives as usual. Politicians are civilians too, but since we're talking about normal people, they gain ten times as much security as military and police personnel. Of course, the use of illegal or immoral violence in order to galvanize the politicians' attention to their cause is an act of terrorism, but mostly likely, attacking civilians means that going after them affects the entire society and the government would do anything, even beyond legitimate measures to protect them. Civilians who have 20 times more population than any group and who have no role in politics and going about their daily lives are gonna be affected by those who have a grudge against our government's role in certain activities domestic or abroad.</p>
<p>The World Trade Center bombing in 1993, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the airliner filled with mostly civilians strike on the WTC on 9/11 caused the U.S. government to take permanent measure to prevent the incidents from happening, with bad consequences. The TSA exists out of 9/11 and is already the worst federal agency in regards to moral of its employees and civil rights in the name of fighting terrorism. More TSA agents have been arrested and convicted that terrorists. Then you have the unlimited spying power, which is decried by civil rights advocates and people having paranoid fear would likely reduce civil rights reform in a desperate hope to catch terrorists. Neither that is really possible. You have government agencies giving unlimited military equipment to local and state law enforcement agencies without a proper oversight to their abuse. Then you have Donald Trump who is elected to &quot;make America great&quot; by outright banning Muslims from six specific countries and use anti-privacy measures in the night of fighting terrorism, which puts us in anger. That gave people the idea that the effects of terrorism really worked and its ramifications can never be or hard to be put down.</p>
<p>Hope this really helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assume that we're talking about a body of water where the air temperature is constantly below freezing. The important thing to know is that is that water is MOST dense at about 4 degrees C. The reason for this has to do with the shape of the water molecule, but that's not necessary to answer the question. As water gets colder, approaching this temperature, it tends to sink, so the water at the bottom of, say, a big lake, is going to be that temperature. Once the whole lake is 4 degrees, the top starts to go below 4 C where the density starts to decrease again because of crystallization and becomes less dense than liquid water at any temperature. Hence, it floats. But it also creates a thermal barrier, so it's harder for more ice to form. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Well, in most substances a raise of pressure may provoke a passage from the liquid state to the Solid state (Solidification). This happens because the pressure forces the molecules to be closer.</p>
<p>However the Water molecules are further apart when they are in the Solid state compared to the liquid state. It has to do with the geometry of the H2O molecule. That's why at 0ºC Ice as a density of 0.9 (Water is 1).</p>
<p>So when you increase the pressure and force the water / ice molecules to be even closer they pass to a state where they can be even closer: liquid.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I know this is not a proper graphic. It's an illustration. Even if it had a scale it would be useless: engineers use Equations of state because we need to know partial pressure at different points of pressure and temperature (It's like knowing how much of the water goes to moisture / humidity. There is no 100% liquid water with air around it with 0% humidity ). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors... But one that is easy to ELI5 is to ask you if you have ever stuck a bottle of pop in the freezer, took it out and it was liquid but when you opened it if froze?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTiC0PZE3sg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTiC0PZE3sg</a></p>
<p>Pressure lowers the freezing point of liquids. The deeper you are in the water, the more pressure there is due to the weight of all the water above it.  Carbonated liquids like coke shown in the video above are under pressure in the bottle due to the carbon dioxide gas that tries to escape the liquid. this lowers the freezing point until you release that pressure with the satisfying &quot;TSHHHHHT&quot; you hear when opening a bottle or can.  This causes the freezing point to raise and it freezes before your eyes. </p>
<p>Fun fact, the reason why ice is more slippery the warmer it is is purely because the pressure of you walking on it melts the ice a little bit. If it is colder out, you don't melt as much ice by stepping on it. </p>
<p>It's also how ice skates work. That blade is pressing down on the ice, melting it ever so slightly and making it slippery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ice requires water molecules to move apart in order to assume their crystallized position. Under that sort of pressure of gagillions of tons of water, you simply can't move them apart because the forces involved (particularly hydrogen bonds) are weaker than gravity and its affect on the scenario.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that the difference is really as stark as you might be thinking it is.  The biggest beer drinkers in the world are from the Czech Republic.  The WHO says that over 73% of Czech men are overweight or obese.  Around 66% of all adults there are overweight or obese.  Something like 60% of German men are overweight or obese.  Germans are top 5 in the world for beer consumption.</p>
<p>The U.S. falls way down the list at #17 for per person beer consumption, but 74% or U.S. men are still overweight or obese.  So American men drink far less beer per person than Czech men, but have similar rates of overweight/obesity.  So you'll see the basically same percentage of &quot;beer bellies&quot; in the world's biggest beer drinking country as you will in the U.S., but far less beer is drunk by the American sporting that belly than by the Czech.  This is simplified of course but that means there are probably more real &quot;beer bellies&quot; on average in the top beer drinking European countries.... and a lot more &quot;burgers and fries&quot; bellies in the U.S. than in Europe.  It's more about overall diet and exercise rates than it is total beer consumption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Then there was the way they treat food. Refrigerators were 1/2 the size they are in the US. I'd stop each day at a market and pick up what you needed and take it home. Because there was no elevator, I'd carry those groceries up 4 flights of stairs. So I didn't have giant loads - just enough to get by for a day or so. So I didn't &quot;pig out&quot; because I would have had to leave sooner and go get more food. </p>

Many people have a big belly, but it is not related to beer, it is related to poor diet and sedentary lifestyle. The two are a different thing -they look different, and they have a different root cause. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/249985/view" target="_blank">This is ascites</a> , <a href="http://www.wow.com/wiki/Obesity" target="_blank">this is obesity</a>. A person can have ascites which gives them a very large belly without having particularly fatty arms, legs, face, or other extremities – the true mark of the beer gut is that it is fluid, not just fat. It is also related to alcohol in general, not just beer.</p>
<p>Drinking beer can definitely make you chubby if you were drinking lots of it and you have a high caloric intake and as a result of the combined beer and other calories at a little disproportionate to the output of calories. But that is not really a &quot;beer belly&quot;, it is a &quot;caloric overconsumption belly&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is one of the simplest self-organization principles, along with the golden ratio <em>phi</em> (which is the limit of the ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers), and the golden angle (which is the golden ratio applied to the circumference of a circle).</p>
<p>It would be useful for a sunflower to pack as many florets as possible into the space available, to increase likelihood of pollination and send as many seeds out into the world as possible. There are several ways it could do that: anything from randomly arrayed florets to some complex close-packing algorithm. But it's a plant, so it needs a simple rule that results in an optimal configuration: it needs a simple 'self-organizing' principle. And the simplest rules (known to plants) that lead to the greatest optimization tend to involve Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>The spirals come in because they fill round spaces efficiently. Suppose a flower has <em>m</em> lines of seeds, each containing <em>n</em> seeds. If those lines ran out radially from the center, the seeds would be too crowded near the center and too sparse further out, wasting space and resources. So you decide to curve them, to wrap them around the circle. If you don't curve enough, you get gaps between the curves. If you curve too much, you run into the next curve. The way to get the most out of the space is to find curves that turn just the right amount and intersect each other at just the right place to put a seed. (Anything else would leave spaces between the seeds, where one curve hit the other at a non-integer seed position and left a useless gap.) Take all of those constraints together, and the simplest efficient self-organizing solutions occur when <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> are (often consecutive) Fibonacci numbers and, because these things go hand in hand, when the amount of curvature is related to the golden ratio.</p>
<p>(There are all sort of arrangements of <em>this</em> number of curves containing <em>that</em> number of elements where those numbers are <em>not</em> Fibonacci numbers, but they mostly run into the problem that plants are not very good at math. Fibonacci numbers and various related golden ratios are very simple, but lead to very efficient coverage. A plant that figured this out would suddenly have a huge edge over other plants; millions of years later most of the plants that exist have <em>some</em> sort of simple-but-efficient harmonious relations, often involving Fibonacci numbers.)</p>
<p>mini-tl;dr: When you look at a sunflower you can see some number of clockwise spirals, another number of anti-clockwise spirals; only when those numbers are Fibonacci numbers do the lines curve in such a way that every seed is the intersection of two curves and unused space is minimized.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the other direction, the golden ratio is a simple but efficient principle for self-organizing, and any time it affects the curvature of something there are resonances that occur when the numbers of the elements making up the curve are Fibonacci numbers. </p>
<p>These numbers are given <em>way</em> too much significance in the popular press, but they do show up - almost always as part of some self-organizing principle - in many parts of nature. Like: it would be useful for plants to stagger their leaves such that they receive as much sunlight as possible. Too far away, there might not be enough leaves to collect the energy the plants need. Too close together, and the higher leaves cast a shadow over the lower leaves. The number, size, and shape of leaves that leads to optimal energy intake are often related to Fibonacci numbers; the spacing of branches around trunks and leaves around branches is often related to the golden angle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is the Fibonacci sequence so special? Because it occurs in nature quite often. That's the real Q&amp;A here, not the other way around. The sequence itself is not very mathematically useful (I think there's a way to check primes with Fibonacci?), but what's so special about it is that nature seems to like it, like how leafs grow and the pattern on shells, it's also tied to the golden ratio, which occurs in nature a lot too. That the golden ratio occurs in nature is very explainable by the way, it's the exact ratio of dividing a line in such a way that the ratio between the short and long part is the same as the ratio between the long part and the total length. This makes it the best ratio for expanding a shape onto itself without leaving gaps (what flowers, shells etc do to grow), <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibonacci.html" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because the golden ratio is the limit of the ratio of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, and the golden ratio shows up in a lot of weird places in nature.</p>
<p>Why does the golden ratio show up so often? No one has a definite answer to that question.</p>
<p>My guess is that its biology being lazy. The Fibonacci sequence is pretty easy to calculate with recursion and simple counting primitives, and it's pretty easy to accurately approximate the golden ratio from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit:
On second thought, maybe you are describing a gasp? Like when you drink a lot at once and you take a big breath after because you lack air? Maybe that's what you're talking about. It's likely that you make that sound not necessarily because the drink is refreshing, but finding it refreshing causes you to drink a lot at once, thus holding your breath for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Edit:
Third thought, calling it a gasp is incorrect actually. It's an exhale. The gasp comes after that.</p>
<p>Fourth thought, testing it now. I seem to exhale after every gulp I take. The longer I drink, the more exhale that follows. So I believe that's what the explanation is. When the drink is refreshing, you drink more/longer, meaning your exhale will be bigger. But you can exhale without saying &quot;Ah&quot;. Gyms and marathons aren't filled with people constantly going &quot;Ah&quot;. Adding vocals to it is purely theatrics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's an adaptive stream using what's probably a proprietary format. Meaning, if your connection slows down, the quality will adapt and look blurry. If your connection is fast, the quality will get better.</p>
<p>Most offline video players support something called variable bitrate (VBR) but it's not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>That isn't really the issue though because if people wanted to get around that and save the videos they could. But the point is that it's not worth the effort when the subscription is so cheap and they can watch the shows immediately when they're released.</p>
<p>With that said, people <em>do</em> download Netflix shows from torrents so it does happen. Also, I believe Netflix started allowing offline viewing not too long ago so that probably makes it easier.</p>
<p>Another important point that makes it more difficult is that Netflix doesn't download the whole movie. If you pause the stream, it will only buffer so much ahead of where you are. This also allows it to pick up where you left off if your computer crashes. So there is a constant communication between your browser and Netflix that makes downloading videos a bit more tricky than they otherwise would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>People don't want to pirate content, its just that when someone wants to charge an unfair price for it, or tie it down with all sorts of BS use restrictions, people will.  Netflix proves that if you ask people to pay a reasonable sum for content and provide it in a nice, easy, manner, you don't have to worry about piracy.</p>

Been doing it for almost 10 years from sites like PirateBay, Demonoid, Kickass and even Mininova (back when it was good). Netflix really can't protect their stuff from being downloaded fully. They can protect it from things like Extensions on Google Chrome (like video downloader professional) but if someone has recording software, like Bandicam, and uploads it on a website? then it can be downloaded of course but the quality isn't that great. However most people don't download Netflix original content (house of Cards, Daredevil..) because the membership fee is so cheap, maybe something like The Walking Dead because it doesn't hit Netflix til later in the year after it finishes off the season on AMC.</p>
<p>Personally I don't see a point in pirating Netflix original shows because of how cheap it is and there are even shows and documentaries that are old enough that you'd be hard pressed to find on any pirating website. The only people who do are those who're tight for cash or live in countries where Netflix isn't available or the show itself is not available on Netflix in their region. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
