All of that unspent love gathers in the corners of your eyes, the lump in your throat, and the hollow in your chest.

<p>I am so, so sorry OP. I've buried a lot of people in my 23 years, but Katy has been the most difficult. We just have to remember, /u/Trunks572, that while our friends can no longer be active in <em>our</em> lives, their lives will always continue on in our memory. We hold a bit of them in us, they just can no longer actively contribute. Humans are balls of clay, my dear man or woman; we're passed into the hands of whomever we meet. Most of the times they leave just a fingerprint; sometimes, a bit of an impression. But every once in awhile, we meet someone who completely changes a bit of us, or all of us, and we'll always have that. I'll always have Katy, and you'll always have your friend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here, prepare for disappointment (that's how I start all clinic visits, btw). The disappointing thing is that this isn't well understood. That said, there are still some interesting things to think about so let's begin. There are two very different broad categories that could explain what is happening: </p>
<p>1) Emotional synesthesia. Think of the nervous system like an electrical system. Neurons are like wires that carry signals to different parts of the brain for processing. Some of these wires are known to be well-insulated and carry signals well. For example, the neurons that report light touch in the fingertips are very accurate. Other neurons are poorly insulated and the signals cross. That is why it is hard to localize pain in your gut. A pain signal from your colon can get mixed up with pain from your small intestine or even gallbladder. </p>
<p>The physical feeling of a 'sinking heart' associated with sadness could be caused by these crossed wires. There are extreme examples of these &quot;crossed wires&quot; in synesthesia, where people see sound and hear color. However this type of thing occurs on a more subtle level in other people and this MAY be an example of emotional synesthesia where we physically feel emotion.</p>
<p>2) Actual sensation. The emotion of sadness may actually cause physical changes that we can feel. It is known that sadness can cause weakening of the heart, causing the bottom of the heart (confusingly called the 'apex') to balloon out and weaken. This is called Takasubo cardiomyopathy. Perhaps sadness could cause subtle changes in the chest area that we can actually sense, leading to this sensation of a sinking heart.</p>
<p>As you can see, these two potential explanations describe very different mechanisms, one involving physical change and one purely neuronal. That is the level to which we don't understand this process. We don't even know the broad mechanism.</p>
<p>I read some other comments here and I am concerned because they present speculation as fact. For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5mq41s/eli5_what_causes_that_sinking_heart_feeling_when/dc5kxpm/" target="_blank">this comment</a> throws around a lot of unnecessary jargon that sounds like an explanation but they never identify how little is actually known about this subject. The mark of a knowledgeable comment is that it clearly defines the boundary between what is known and unknown.</p>
<p>BONUS TOPIC: Here is something fun to think about. If the sensation is truly due to crossed wires, is that a defect in our bodies or is this a feature that was selected for? There could be a benefit of having a physical sensation of sadness to accompany the emotional sensation. By using dual negative stimuli, individuals are more likely to avoid situations that cause sadness. Perhaps this topic isn't disappointing as it shows how much good science there is left to be done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling in your chest has been studied in the context of heartbreak and getting dumped before, and it's likely a similar set of processes involved. The part of the brain that reacts in that case (heartache) is actually the same part of the brain responsible for physical pain, so it's interpreted as actual pain. Stress hormones also have a tightening effect on your muscles that contribute to the hollow chest feeling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not sure if this is related to the pain of &quot;regular&quot; heart ache or not, but it does sorta show how emotional responses can physically effect your body. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This tube is squeezed together the majority of the time but when you chew, yawn, swallow, etc. it opens in order to equalize the pressure in your ear with the surrounding air pressure.  This is why chewing gum on an airplane helps to make your ears feel better and avoid the painful negative or positive pressure build up.  You might have some excess mucus built up within the tube, some inflammation, or a normal anatomical variant that may be contributing to the sound you are hearing.  Many people experience this popping or clicking sound around the time they are sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have had this all my life from having had frequent ENT infections when I was a child. I can get temporary relief by getting them to drain sometimes.</p>
<p>I open my throat up as if to start a yawn deep down, and keep it open as I take multiple slow deep breaths. I open my jaw up and move it forward, and tilt my head back about 45 degrees and keep it tilted. After the first breath or two I keep my deeper throat as open as possible and close my mouth, breathing slowly in and out of my nose. It's okay to breathe through the mouth now and then too.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm making progress when the vibrating of my breathing jumps into my ears as well.</p>
<p>At some point at the end of an exhale I'll make a sharp inhaling breath through my nose which makes my ears feel really clogged up. (I don't recommend doing this if you have a head cold.) I leave my ears like that for a few seconds then make a full yawn with my throat as open as i can, and my head still tilted back, which makes my ears pop really good. As well flexing my jaw wide open and forward while deeply yawning can sometimes help with the drainage.</p>
<p>Other things I've tried sometimes is the yawning technique, then closing the nose while (not forcefully) trying to breathe out, which forces air out through the ears (but this seems to keep the fluid in place I guess); and pulling on my ear away from my head to flex the ear canal while I work my jaw open and shut, keeping it jutting out.</p>
<p>If your nose or throat feels like it's about to get runny or ticklish then you are definitely getting stuff moving around in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We also had some products that had two boards (a top and a bottom) so for a product like this the top board might be red and the bottom might be blue just to make it easier on the assembly line to tell a worker that red goes on top and blue goes on bottom.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are dozens of types of oranges: navels, tangelos, tangerines, temples, mercots, hamlins, valencias, parson brown, etc.</p>
<p>Just like apples, every different type of orange looks and tastes a bit different.   Some are better for eating fresh and some are better for juice.  Some are very popular, some are not as popular, and some are cheap since there is a huge supply and some are expensive.   Some are grown in Florida, some in California, and some in Brazil.    </p>
<p>So every manufacturer sources their oranges from a different place and of course that makes them taste a bit different.   And as other posters mentioned, December is the main time for oranges to be harvested, with some a bit before that to a bit after that.  </p>
<p>Freezes can damage or reduce the crop forcing juice manufacturers to change the mix of oranges they use.   Since we need orange juice year round, some manufactures put the juice in giant oxygen-free holding tanks at 33 degrees and keep it there for up to six months.  This damages the taste so they add in &quot;flavor packs&quot; which are also made from orange oils (which I think is somehow distilled out of the orange peels, but I'm not really sure).</p>
<p>So you can see, there are hundreds of variables which go into how orange juice tastes, and the big companies spend tons of money making sure that their juice tastes the same no matter what time of year it is, or what materials they have to make it with.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello I'm an advertising guy. Most of the replies in this thread are not incorrect, but seem to lack knowledge deeper than &quot;because of the brand&quot;.</p>
<p>Start by understanding that advertising is a huge, huge world. In that huge, huge world, you have lots of different 'methods' of advertising. Each type of advertisement will be seen by different people, at different times, will promote different products and will take different forms.</p>
<p>For instance, your advertisement can appear in a magazine, a newspaper, on a webpage, on a flyer, on the radio, on a billboard, or on the television.</p>
<p>Let's assume it's 7pm on a Monday, in a country with a population of 100. 2 of those people will be reading magazines. 3 will be reading newspapers. 10 will be on the internet. 8 will be outside. 1 is listening to the radio. 9 people are not exposed to any type of media. But a whopping 67 people are all watching television!</p>
<p>Your advert can appear in any of the media I just mentioned. But you need to consider the question, 'why am I advertising in this instance?' Are you trying to get people to buy direct from you, there and then? Or are you looking for exposure – for instance, because you're launching a new product?</p>
<p>In the first instance, your advert will be considered &quot;direct response&quot;. Think of an ad you see in the newspaper that has a coupon attached to it. &quot;20% off with this voucher!&quot; You take it to a store, buy a product, and now the store knows that you bought a product after seeing an ad in a magazine. It's instant feedback. Direct response isn't just print, mind you: ever see a TV ad that tells you to ring a phone number? How about an email that takes you straight to an online store? These are all forms of direct response marketing.</p>
<p>In the second instance, the ad is classified as &quot;ATL&quot;, which stands for above the line (direct response is sometimes called below the line; the two definitions are hard to stick to, however, because some ATL advertising can also be direct response, and some BTL may use ATL tactics). You're not looking for quick sales, probably because you're already an established and trusted brand, but you do want to uplift sales – perhaps you're approaching the end of this quarter and you need a sharp uplift in sales to meet your forecast. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Now, let's assume your product is what's classified as an FMCG, which stands for &quot;fast moving consumer goods&quot; – basically anything you buy off the supermarket shelves. Soft drinks, packets of crisps, fruit and vegetables, dairy and laundry detergents, as well as some pieces of hardware, furniture, and electronics.</p>
<p>You don't care who buys your stuff, because there isn't a specific audience. Everyone drinks soft drinks. Everyone sits on sofas. Everyone uses toothpaste. So, at 7pm on a Monday, when you can assume almost everyone in your country of 100 people will be at home, in front of the TV, after a long day's work, that's the best time for you to advertise.</p>
<p>You're just letting people know you're there. But in the week after you've played your TV advertisement, 99% of people in your country will have visited a supermarket or mini-mart. Some of them will want soft drinks. Some of them will want toothpaste. And when they stumble across your product on the shelves, the brand exposure they have already experienced is enough to increase their odds of purchasing your product – and that's a fact.</p>
<p>It's not guaranteed, of course. Your competitors might have run an ad campaign themselves. Or they may have a product next to yours on the shelves that is lower in price. They may even have advertising in the store, which we call POS (point of sale advertising). Such is the wonderful world of marketing.</p>
<p>So, I guess, TL:DR is: you may not pay attention to advertisements, but many other people do. And even if they're not asking you to buy there and then, TV advertising is proven to make you more likely to buy in the long-term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that you were shopping at the supermarket one day and you decided you were going to buy some laundry detergent.  For the sake of simplicity let's also say that in the laundry goods aisle there were only two product brands to choose from: Soapy Suds, and Sunshine detergent.</p>
<p>Now let's assume that at this point you had NEVER even heard of Soapy Suds before.  You know almost nothing about the product except that it's laundry detergent because it states so on the product label, and besides that it's in the laundry detergent section of the store.  However, while you also know little about Sunshine detergent let's assume that you have actually heard several commercials on the television talking about how great the product is.  So you've at least HEARD of that product before, if only in passing.</p>
<p>Faced between purchasing a product you had never heard of before, and purchasing a product that you had (even perhaps a semblance of a passing notion of) it would be human nature to choose the one you had heard of before over the one you knew nothing about.</p>
<p>This is the essence (highly oversimplified) of the power of brand recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Quick question: off the top of your head, when you think of NFL football, which beer comes to mind? If you live in the US, chances are you answered &quot;Bud Light&quot;. And that's because TV advertising works.</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily mean you are going to go out and buy a case of Bud Light right away, but next time you're in the liquor store staring a fridge full of cases of beers, you will &quot;know&quot; something about Bud Light, as opposed to the 30 other beer brands you've never heard of. And that &quot;knowledge&quot; might influence you to buy Bud Light, because hey, you like NFL football, and it's the official beer of NFL football.</p>
<p>TV ads work because we as human beings simply don't have the time or inclination to exhaustively research every single thing we spend money on every day. We make the vast majority of decisions based on what we &quot;know&quot;, not really caring how we got that information, or taking the time to judge its relevance or verify its accuracy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily about purchasing something &quot;different&quot; than you normally would. In some cases it's just providing a slight push. Restaurant/fast food ads are a big example here. Sure, if you absolutely never eat fast food or at chain restaurants then those ads mean nothing to you. But most people do have fast food or eat at chain restaurants, even if it's only occasionally. </p>
<p>We live in a age where, if you live in a decently sized town (in the US at least), you have a lot of options when it comes to eating out. There's local restaurants/diners, big chain restaurants like Olive Garden or Outback Steakhouse, and of course fast food. Some people develop habits and just go to the same few places over and over again, but most people want some variety. How do you choose where to eat/order from? Usually it's based on what you're &quot;in the mood for.&quot; Restaurant ads won't make you go anywhere that you'd never be willing to go without the ad, but they can provide a small nudge in one direction or another that could make you choose one place over another:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're hungry and are thinking about getting food. If you see ads for pizza, you might think &quot;hey, I haven't had pizza in a while.&quot; You might decide to get pizza instead of Mexican food or Chinese food or whatever, because why not? You like pizza and it's been a while. </li>
<li>You decide to get pizza. Your options are some local pizza places, or one of the big pizza chains. Maybe there's a local place you like, but it would cost more than you want to spend today, so you decide to go with one of the chains. You vaguely remember that Pizza Hut has some new garlic bread pizza thing, and that Domino's has a some sort of cheap carry-out deal, etc. Some of the things you know about these chains will be from personal experience, and some of the things you know will be from ads. You're not going to make a decision that you'd never be willing to make in the first place, like ordering from a place you hate, but the ads can nudge you into choosing one place over another, for reasons that are perfectly natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, ads can nudge &quot;getting food&quot; into &quot;getting pizza&quot;, or nudge &quot;getting pizza&quot; into &quot;getting Pizza Hut.&quot; It won't work all of the time, or even most of the time. But as long as it works on some people some of the time, it's going to have a sizable impact on a chain's business. Maybe they affect your pizza-buying decisions once a year. Even if ads only affect the pizza-buying decisions of every pizza consumer once a year on average, ads would still be responsible for millions of pizza purchases every year. Maybe most of those purchases would still happen without the ads, but the ads will affect which chains people purchase from, as well as whether or not they order from a chain or from a local place. </p>
<p>Now, it's possible that if all the pizza places just agreed to stop advertising, they could save money and people would still buy tons of pizza, because people love pizza. But there are a lot of reasons why that would never happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They're placed to make you aware that the Volkswagen Jetta is a thing. So that when you decide it is time for a new car, the Jetta might come to mind before the Chevrolet Malibu.</p>
<p>Some adverts are intended to induce rapid buying. Often these are placed by stores. An example would be a grocery store saying &quot;bananas just 39c a pound, fresh Illinois watermelon just $2.99 each, now through Sunday at Food Lion&quot;</p>
<p>I'd like to say it doesn't work, but I know I picked my plumber based on adverts. There's probably other things that don't immediately come to mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is wrong (except Mjolnir2000). Socialism doesn't mean state ownership. Communism doesn't mean totalitarianism where no one owns anything. Capitalism doesn't mean free-market economics.</p>
<p>Socialism is when workers democratically own productive property. Capitalism is when productive property is owned privately and those owners hire workers to operate the property to make commodities for sale. Communism is a stateless, classless, moneyless, society. Socialism is the transitionary stage between capitalism and communism. </p>
<p>Among socialists there are two basic divisions: democratic socialists and revolutionary socialists. There are also social democrats who are not socialists, but people mistakenly believe they are (such as Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>I like to explain it this way:</p>
<p>If democratic Capitalism is an ongoing game of Monopoly, then,</p>
<p>1) Socialists propose that we play Hungry Hungry Hippos instead.</p>
<p>2) Democratic Socialists say we keep playing Monopoly for now, and gradually convince the other players to change the rules to resemble Hungry Hungry Hippos until we are effectively playing Hungry Hungry Hippos.  </p>
<p>3) Revolutionary Socialists want to flip the table and force everyone to play Hungry Hungry Hippos immediately.  </p>
<p>4) Social Democrats don't actually want to play Hungry Hungry Hippos, they just want to make some rule changes to Monopoly so it doesn't suck as much for players who are losing (like the popular free parking rule).</p>
<p>Among pro-capitalist supporters (which leftists call liberals, an umbrella term that includes both American liberals, conservatives, libertarians, and social democrats), there are those who support free market economics and those who support state regulations and state-provided services such as public schooling and universal healthcare. The latter is NOT socialism. Both are forms of capitalism. Capitalism is not synonymous with free markets, it just means private ownership of property by some class of people. Scandinavian countries are capitalist. America is capitalist. India is capitalist. China is capitalist. Ethiopia is capitalist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the answers here already are wrong.</p>
<p>Capitalism means you have private ownership of capital. The factory is owned by one person, say, and they can earn money off the factory simply as a result of said ownership - they have other people to do the actual work. </p>
<p>Socialism means you have democratic ownership. The factory is jointly owned by the workers, and managers are elected. Alternatively, the factory is state owned, but the state is itself democratic. Socialism comes in many different varieties. </p>
<p>Communism is a stateless, post-scarcity society in which things like money are no longer relevant because everyone's wants and needs can be trivially provided as a result of advances in the means of production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So OP. Don't listen to those people, because they are wrong.</p>
<p>Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>Socialism is collective worker ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>Communism is the hypothesized next stage of society that is moneyless, classless, and stateless. Socialism is viewed as a stepping stone to communism itself.</p>
<p>Anarchists are also socialists and they've existed before Marxist-Leninism was a thing (the ideology of the USSR and most socialist states in the 20th century). Don't let anyone fool you into believing that socialist == state ownership.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A sine wave is a pure sound consisting of just one frequency at a constant volume.  This will sound louder than music, which is a complex combination of many different frequencies.  Plus with music, the dynamics change over time, so the perceived average sound volume will be less than the maximum level the device is capable of playing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you are dissolving a salt into water is the resulting solution still water? Or is it a new compound. H2O + NaCl = ? I'm mainly asking because we all know that adding salt changes some of waters properties such as the point at which is freezes.. so is it different?</p></div></div>

I don't think it would be fair to say that the solvent is not water any longer just because it's mixed with something else.  The properties of water do change when something is dissolved in it, but those changes are generally independent of what was dissolved in the water.  That implies that in an aqueous solution, you're still looking at water whose properties have changed in a manner that is specific to water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As stated by others, it is still just a solution with water being the solvent. There is a great deal of physical change but there is no chemical change, so no new molecules or bonds are formed. In regards to properties of the water, they can change a lot even though it's only a physical change. Think in terms of the density increasing if there is dissolved iron in the water because iron is really dense (and surprisingly able to be dissolved pretty easily). Any dissolved solids will increase the electrical conductivity in comparison to pure water too. Electricity travels super poorly through pure water but super well in salt water because electricity travels via ions and the salt provides those ions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now artificial wombs aren't anywhere close to being a reality. Organizations that do want to clone endangered or extinct animals at this point need to use closely related species as the artificial womb. For instance the people working to clone mammoths will use an Asian or African elephant as a surrogate mother, that is one of the reasons they are considered clone-able. But for other animals like the Steller's Sea Cow or the giant sloth cloning is not considered an option yet because there are no closely related species that are large enough to be the clone's surrogate.  You can read about specific criteria and species at this website. </p>

<p>EDIT- as far as the giant panda goes, you could hypothetically set up some IVF program with their closest relatives, the Spectacled Bear.  They could be birthed from Spectacled Bears and potentially nursed by them, or there may be some kind of hormone therapy you could give pandas that would cause them to lactate so the tiny pandas could be weened by their own kind/on their own milk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't understand enough of what happens during development to be anywhere close to making artificial wombs a reality. DNA isn't everything, and early development plays a huge role in determining how animals will turn out. Genes are turned on and off (and up and down), sometimes permanently, as a result of conditions in utero.</p>
<p>In humans, we know that conditions experienced by a grandparent can impact disease risk and mortality through a process known as transgenerational epigenetics. We also know that this process is really complicated.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Överkalix_study" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Överkalix_study</a></p>
<p>RadioLab did a nice treatment of this recently, discussing how human embryos will only develop in the laboratory up to a certain (early) stage, and then die. Scientists have recently been able to extend this period, but not by much, and we don't really know what the barrier is.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/primitive-streak/" target="_blank">http://www.radiolab.org/story/primitive-streak/</a>
<a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/251876-inheritance/" target="_blank">http://www.radiolab.org/story/251876-inheritance/</a>
(Bonus RadioLab including the grandparent story.)</p>
<p>So, a major part of why artificial wombs won't save endangered species is that they aren't likely to exist for a very long time, if ever. Turns out DNA sequence is only part of the picture - you need just the right developmental conditions to get that DNA to make that endangered individual, and right now, a real mother* is the only way to get that.</p>
<p>*Can possibly be a mother from a very closely related species, but still: you need the real deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leaving physiology aside because I know very little about it, artificial wombs may aid in stabilizing a small captive population but I feel wouldn't play a very large role is saving a species as a whole. I think that there are a couple of things that limit the success of a captive breeding program more so than just getting the numbers up but I am definitely not an expert and would love to talk more about them if someone disagrees.</p>
<p>First I think that creating more individuals without understanding the reasoning why the mating behavior isn't being expressed would be synonymous to treating a symptom of a symptom instead of working towards the actual cure. I don't know much about the panda example but I do know another one where numbers were low (can't remember the animal, I'll edit later) because female preference was low for males below a certain body-mass. which all of their males were. Understanding more about what these animals are all about is part of why we want to keep them around and so I think working with the animal's instincts should be a top priority. Not only preserving the physical animal but also that animal's behavioral culture.</p>
<p>The other issue I have is that I am picturing an animal raised in an artificial womb being raised either in non-ideal groupings or by humans. We already know the importance of avoiding human imprinting and the people running the best programs put a lot of work into doing that (see Whooping Crane). An artificial womb I feel would increase that risk and brings up more questions like: If the animal is raised in a lab environment will it be lacking in information that would be otherwise be passed down by herd-mates or parents? Can the animal survive as well once it is time to be released without that information. </p>
<p>I guess the key things that make me skeptical after all that rambling are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>could the effort be better spent on addressing the 'why' behind the lack of breeding success (or the 'why' of it's endangered status)</p>
</li>
<li>is the risk to the animal's social knowledge worth the increase in the animal's physical numbers</li>

<p>Keep in mind, from what I can gather, this scale simply is a measure of the degree to which respondents rate themselves as physically fit and &quot;attracted to&quot; physical fitness activities, so it's not surprising that this would be a fairly good predictor of getting through a physically tough challenge like Navy Special Operations training.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
