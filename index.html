		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answer about cost effective solutions to meet the current needs, where both the needs and costs change over time, but your point about discovering new techniques should be addressed. </p>
<p>New, better, coding techniques (for errors correction and recovery) allow you to send more bits in a given symbol. Essentially, if you and I are talking and we want to communicate the most complete sentences with the fewest words, we can agree on a code book.  Something like: heyu = how are you?, hiya = I am fine,  etc.  but in binary.   If I just send those four letters, but you only get h_y_ you cannot decode my message.  I can add extra letters to the message (redundancy) with some type of agreed coding so if you lose some of the letters you might be able to figure out which were missing, up to some point.  </p>
<p>In communication systems, this can extend to 256 bits or more in a single symbol (sent as a single transmission waveform), and with coding techniques available I will chose how to encode my data and what kind if symbols to use based on how likely it is that there will be errors (how much noise there is on the channel).  At the same time that processing power has gotten better and cheaper, so we can process long messages to decode them quickly, and we have moved from hardware processing to software, people have also discovered new codes which can give me as much or more ability to decode the original message with better chances of success.  In some cases the math was simple (turbo codes), it just took someone having an Aha! moment, in others (LDPC) the math gets pretty out there.  Also,  new codes are great on paper, but not always possible to process in the time required for real two way real-time communication. </p>
<p>Beyond an ELI5 post as well, new antenna designs, multiple input multiple output antenna arrays and cross antenna interference cancellation techniques, as well as new more efficient  multiple access strategies, have been developed that would not have been reasonable, or in some cases possible, with older systems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wireless N draft was 2007, released 2009. Since then, we haven't had any strictly better standards for 2.4 GHz. ac is an improvement over short distances, but not over longer distances. It is not strictly better.</p>
<p>ac wireless has several advantages:</p>
<p>1) Does not use 2.4 GHz. 2.4GHz spectrum is massively congested now, since wifi is everywhere. 5 GHz has more room, and less things on it. This is an advantage which in 2007 really wasn't all that big, because there were less wifi devices everywhere (the iphone only came out in 2007, no smart watches, etc.). Also, less interference from things like microwave ovens.</p>
<p>2) Higher frequency = more speed. ac starts at 450 Mbits per second. Not really much call for that in 2007.</p>
<p>3) Beamforming / MIMO. This uses processing power to increase the throughput by focusing the signal. Wireless n was already a significantly higher throughput than most people needed, and if you needed really high throughput you'd use ethernet.</p>
<p>4) Extended battery life. This advantage has improved over time, as the power drain of other items such as CPU has gone down, laptops have gotten thinner, and batteries smaller as a consequence.</p>
<p>However, there are downsides:</p>
<p>a) More processing power. Which means more expensive, a cost which goes down over time as chips get faster.</p>
<p>b) Using 5 GHz means you need antennae for two frequencies, since otherwise you would not be able to use 2.4 GHz networks. More cost.</p>
<p>c) Less range on the 5 GHz. With a higher frequencies, it does not go as far, and is stopped by walls, etc. more easily.</p>
<p>d) You need to upgrade everything to ac to get the benefits.</p>
<p>So, I'm seeing quite a few disadvantages, for advantages which are mostly increased throughput which no one needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The same is true of having wide hips, and having shiny hair indicates good health. Breast firmness indicate age, so having developed and firm breasts indicates you are still young so potentially able to have more children, and having larger breasts indicates you have access to a stable food source so are a good potential mate. </p>
<p>But these biological indicators are just starting points to things. Most of our infatuation is socially developed and due to a myriad of social factors including how taboo sex is or is not, and how taboo nudity is or is not. The more taboo something is, the more attractive we tend to find the things that skirt the limits of that taboo, or the violate it completely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Women with symmetrical breast are more fertile than those asymmetrical breasts. An evolutionary theory is that, since it's easier to tell symmetry from bigger breasts, men gravitated towards that.</p>
<p>As a side note, evolutionary psychology has found some pretty amazing things. For example, men are more attractive when they're surrounding by other women but women are more attractive when they're not with a man. (This applies to long-term heterosexual relationships)</p>

As I was rereading <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233285975_A_Brief_History_of_the_Theory_of_Evolution" target="_blank">the chapter</a>, I realised I misread a word: breast size is not associated to milk production but it is to fertility.

<p>To explain, the way your eyes see in dim light is for particles of light to enter the eye and strike the rods of the eye, specifically activating a protein called rhodopsin. This protein is extremely sensitive to light, which enables us to see in very dim light, but is also so sensitive that it can be activated by the heat of your body. Since, even in pitch black, some of this rhodopsin would be activated by the heat of your body, you see a dark grey when you close your eyes instead of pure black. When your eyes are open this dark grey is actually the darkest color you can see, your brain just  compares it to the other lighter objects around it and you interpret the object as a pure black.</p>
<p>True ELI5, your eyes can never see pure black because the chemical in your eyes that let you see in dim light is so sensitive they can activate from the heat of your body, making your brain interpret a dark grey instead of a pure black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably not visual snow, which should be visible at all times. The reason is because in darkness your eye and brain essentially turn up the volume on the signal from your eyes. It's like when speakers hiss if you turn the volume up to max without anything playing - tiny random fluctuations are amplified so that they are perceptible.</p>
<p>In normal conditions the sensitivity is turned down or other bright objects swamp the noise so you can't hear it, but this doesn't happen in the dark. The advantage is that you can find your way out of the bedroom for a slash without waking up your wife.</p>
<p>Fun fact: your brain also tries to maximise your ability to see in the dark by using several seconds worth of data from your eyes to form an image. This makes moving objects look blurry and hard to discern in the dark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light you see coming out of the sun was actually emitted within a very small distance from the surface of the sun. This is also why the sun mostly emits visible light, because near the surface, the sun is only a few thousand degrees. At that temperature, the blackbody radiation spectrum is peaked in the visible. The core of the sun is millions of degrees, which would emit a lot of UV light, but that light is absorbed before it can reach the surface.</p>
<p>When people say light takes a million years to go from the core of the sun to the surface, they are technically wrong. No light goes from the core to the surface. What this number refers to is the expected amount of time for a &quot;random walker&quot; to reach the surface, given the amount of time it takes on average to scatter or &quot;randomize&quot; the walker's path.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, the President is essentially given power to make any actions by Congress.  So congress will pass a law, let's say Congress passes the Build a Bridge Across the Potomac act (a river running near Washington DC), that authorizes the some agency to spend $1 billion dollars to build a new bridge and sets some rules for how the bridge should be built (it might specify how the contractor should be chosen and that the bridge should allow at least 3 lanes of traffic, or needs to facilitate river shipments below a certain height, etc).  </p>
<p>But that act won't include all the details of the project.  So when the act is vague or doesn't mention something.  The President has the authority to tell the agency that received the money how to do the details (if he doesn't tell them anything the agency head would have the authority within the law).  Remember agency heads all work for him, so he's their boss.  Maybe the president wants the bridge to be a suspension bridge, or to only consider contractors incorporated in the US, or the bridge to be painted blue.  </p>
<p>Many laws are relatively vague, Congress passes lots of laws with fairly general proposals, so the president can claim pretty considerable wiggle room, while still operating within the language of the law.  </p>
<p>As a real example, here's an exerpt from the executive order to put the Japanese into internment camps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the successful prosecution of the war requires every possible protection against espionage and against sabotage to national-defense material, national-defense premises, and national-defense utilities as defined in <strong>Section 4, Act of April 20, 1918, 40 Stat. 533</strong>, as amended by the <strong>Act of November 30, 1940, 54 Stat. 1220</strong>, and the <strong>Act of August 21, 1941, 55 Stat. 655 (U.S.C., Title 50, Sec. 104)</strong>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The executive order makes a case that the acts referenced (I've bolded them) give the President the authority to take the specific action of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of War, and the Military Commanders whom he may from time to time designate, whenever he or any designated Commander deems such action necessary or desirable, to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may impose in his discretion. The Secretary of War is hereby authorized to provide for residents of any such area who are excluded therefrom, such transportation, food, shelter, and other accommodations as may be necessary, in the judgment of the Secretary of War or the said Military Commander, and until other arrangements are made, to accomplish the purpose of this order. The designation of military areas in any region or locality shall supersede designations of prohibited and restricted areas by the Attorney General under the Proclamations of December 7 and 8, 1941, and shall supersede the responsibility and authority of the Attorney General under the said Proclamations in respect of such prohibited and restricted areas.</p>
<p>I hereby further authorize and direct the Secretary of War and the said Military Commanders to take such other steps as he or the appropriate Military Commander may deem advisable to enforce compliance with the restrictions applicable to each Military area herein above authorized to be designated, including the use of Federal troops and other Federal Agencies, with authority to accept assistance of state and local agencies.</p>
<p>I hereby further authorize and direct all Executive Departments, independent establishments and other Federal Agencies, to assist the Secretary of War or the said Military Commanders in carrying out this Executive Order, including the furnishing of medical aid, hospitalization, food, clothing, transportation, use of land, shelter, and other supplies, equipment, utilities, facilities, and services.</p>

He cannot collect or spend more money than congress allows him to. Congress can force him to use the money only for specific things or prevent him from using the money for specific things. He can only deploy troops for a maximum of 3 months before he needs approval from congress.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the subsidies for the fossil fuels industry in the US comes in the form of tax breaks. Some economists would be upset at using the term subsidy to mean tax break, but common usage of the word includes them.</p>
<p>Petroleum companies get tax breaks for doing specific things that the government wants to incentivize (or avoid punishing). For example, they get a foreign tax credit which allows them to deduct taxes paid in foreign countries from their profits that are returned to the US. The government allows that because it wants US companies to do business abroad while bringing money back into the US. Companies either wouldn't do business abroad or would keep their earnings outside of the US if they got double taxed on them. It's also worth noting that this tax break is available to pretty much all US businesses, not just the petroleum industry.</p>
<p>There are also subsidies promoting domestic manufacturing, exploration for new wells, etc. </p>
<p>There are a couple reasons you can't just trade these out for a tax on petroluem. First, the tax on gasoline is collected by both the stats and the federal government, which means the states also rely on the tax for money. However, the federal government is the one who gives the subsidies. So the people doing the taxing aren't always the same ones providing the subsidies. Additionally, people are the ones paying the tax and it's on gasoline. Petroleum companies are the ones getting the subsidies and it's on their businesses in general and drilling for oil; not just gasoline.</p>
<p>Second, if you remove the subsidies you lose your ability to influence the behavior of the subsidized industries. Without the subsidies companies could get the same savings without having to undertake specific tasks to claim the subsidy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I frequently see the same debate on reddit regarding subsidies  for fossil fuels. For the sake of clarity I've decided to compile all of the fossil fuel subsidies currently in use.  I'm tired of the top-line numbers that don't have much in the way of specifics.  Here is what was spent by the federal government from 2002-2008. The total amount of subsidies and direct payments over that period for the fossil fuel industry was $72,473 million.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Credits</strong></p>
<p><strong>Foreign Tax Credit ($15,300 million)</strong> - IRC Section 901. This is a generally applicable credit that is intended to enable taxpayers earning income or profits abroad to avoid double taxation. Special rules under this provision allow characterization of royalty payments to foreign governments as corporate income taxes, which have provided special benefits to oil and gas producers. IRC Section 907 imposes limitations on those benefits but does not eliminate them. </p>
<p><strong>Credit for Production of Nonconventional Fuels ($14,097 million)</strong>- IRC Section 45K. This provision provides a tax credit for the production of certain fuels. Qualifying fuels include: oil from shale, tar sands; gas from geopressurized brine, Devonian shale, coal seams, tight formations, biomass, and coal-based synthetic fuels. This credit has historically primarily benefited coal producers. </p>
<p><strong>Oil and Gas Exploration &amp; Development Expensing ($7,100 million)</strong>- IRC Section 617. Intangible Drilling Costs (IDC) (for example, wages, costs of machinery, or unsalvageable materials) may be deducted as business expenses rather than amortized. Integrated oil companies may deduct only 70 percent and must amortize the remainder. </p>
<p><strong>Oil and Gas Excess Percentage over Cost Depletion ($5,441 million)</strong>- IRC Section 613. Independent producers and royalty owners can deduct 15 percent of gross income earned from qualifying oil, gas, and oil shale deposits. </p>
<p><strong>Credit for Enhanced Oil Recovery Costs ($1,575 million)</strong> - IRC Section 43. This tax credit is available for hydrocarbon-based tertiary injectant methods defined by IRC Section 193. </p>
<p><strong>Characterizing Coal Royalty Payments as Capital Gains ($986 million)</strong> - IRC Section 631(c). Income from the sale of coal under royalty contract may be treated as a capital gain rather than ordinary income for qualifying individuals. </p>
<p><strong>Exclusion of Benefit Payments to Disabled Miners ($438 million)</strong> - 30 U.S.C. 922(c). Disability payments out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund are not treated as income to the recipients. </p>
<p><strong>Exclusion of Alternative Fuels from Fuel Excise Tax ($343 million)</strong> - IRC Section 6426(d). This section applies to liquified petroleum gas (LPG), P-series fuels (defined at 42 U.S.C. 13211(2)), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied hydrogen, liquid coal, and liquid hydrocarbon from biomass. </p>
<p><strong>Other-Fuel Exploration &amp; Development Expensing ($342 million)</strong> - IRC Section 617. Identical provisions as applied to oil and gas (above). Including, for example, the costs of surface stripping, and construction of shafts and tunnels. </p>
<p><strong>Other-Fuel Excess of Percentage over Cost Depletion ($323 million)</strong>- IRC Section 613. Taxpayers may deduct 10 percent of gross income from coal production. </p>
<p><strong>Deduction for Clean Fuel Vehicles and Refueling Property-Fossil Fuels ($209 million)</strong> - IRC Section 179A. This deduction is equal to the cost of property with certain limitations. Qualifying fuels: natural gas, LNG, LPG, hydrogen, electric, E85, methanol, and other alcohol fuels. Amounts were prorated between fossil fuels and renewables. </p>
<p><strong>Exception from Passive Loss Limitations for Oil and Gas ($190 million)</strong> - IRC Section 469(c)(3). Owners of working interests in oil and gas properties may aggregate negative taxable income from qualifying sources with all other income sources. </p>
<p><strong>Credit for Clean Coal Investment ($186 million)</strong>- IRC Sections 48A and 48B. Available for 20 percent of the basis of integrated gasification combined cycle property and 15 percent of the basis for other advanced coal-based generation technologies. </p>
<p><strong>Expensing Liquid Fuel Refineries ($164 million)</strong> - IRC Section 179C. This deduction is available to refiners of crude oil and other fuels defined at IRC Section 45K(c) (above). </p>
<p><strong>Special Rules for Mining Reclamation Reserves ($159 million)</strong> - IRC Section 468. This deduction is available for early payments into reserve trusts, with eligibility determined by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the Solid Waste Management Act. The amounts attributable to mines rather than solid-waste facilities are conservatively assumed to be one-half of the total. </p>
<p><strong>Natural Gas Distribution Lines Treated as Fifteen-Year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) Property ($138 million)</strong> - IRC Section 168(e)(3)(E)(viii). The normally applicable depreciation period is shortened for qualifying natural gas distribution lines. </p>
<p><strong>Sulfur Regulatory Compliance Incentives for Small Diesel Refiners (Combined) ($109 million)</strong>- IRC Sections 179B and 45H. This tax credit is available for fuel that complies with EPA Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements. Small refiners may claim a current-year deduction in lieu of depreciation for up to 75 percent of associated capital costs.</p>
<p><strong>84-month Amortization Period for Coal Pollution Control ($102 million)</strong> - IRC Section 169(d)(5). Extends the amortization period used in calculating the deduction from the generally applicable 60-month period available for other types of pollution control facilities. </p>
<p><strong>Expensing Advanced Mine Safety Equipment ($32 million)</strong> - IRC Section 179E. The costs of qualifying mine safety equipment may be expensed rather than recovered through depreciation. </p>
<p><strong>Credit for Clean Fuel Vehicles and Refueling Property-Fossil Fuels ($14 million)</strong>- IRC Section 30C. This tax credit is available for up to 30 percent of the cost of the property. Qualifying fuels include: E85, natural gas, LNG, CNG, LPG, hydrogen, and 20 percent biodiesel. Amounts were prorated between fossil fuels and biofuels. </p>
<p><strong>Natural Gas Gathering Lines Treated as Seven-year Property with Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Relief ($6 million)</strong> - IRC Section 168(e)(3)(C)(iv). Depreciation period shortened for qualifying natural gas gathering lines. </p>
<p><strong>Natural Gas Arbitrage Exemption ($6 million)</strong> - IRC Section 148(b)(4). This provision excludes prepayments under qualified natural gas supply contracts from the definition of “investment-type property,” creating an exception to the general rule that tax-exempt bonds do not include bond issues used to obtain higher-yielding investments. </p>
<p><strong>Amortization of Oil and Gas Geological and Geophysical Costs ($145 million)</strong> - IRC Section 167(h). This provision allows a shortened depreciation period of two years for non-integrated oil companies and seven years for integrated companies.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Payments</strong></p>
<p><strong>LIHEAP ($6,358 million)</strong> The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) allocates block grants to states so they can provide low-income households with energy assistance. In a typical year, over half of the funds are used to assist with heating costs, while remaining funds are used to assist with cooling costs, state leveraging and outreach programs, and weatherization efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Petroleum Reserve ($6,183 million)</strong> - The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in 1975 after multiple oil crises, in order to protect the American economy from severe oil supply disruptions. The SPR is funded through annual appropriations to the Department of Energy with special appropriations for oil purchases. Oil is also obtained through a “royalty-in-kind” program with the Minerals Management Service.</p>
<p><strong>Black Lung Disability Trust Fund ($1,035 million)</strong> - The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (BLDTF) pays health benefits to coal miners afflicted with pneumoconiosis or “black lung disease.” Created in 1978, it is funded through an excise tax of $1.10/ton on underground coal and $.55/ton on surface coal, exempting lignite coal, imports, and exports. As with other excise taxes (for example, those on crude petroleum or transportation fuels), these levies support a trust fund that accrues to the benefit of the fuel market itself (i.e., coal), by covering health costs incurred in the production of that fuel. Thus, the cost and benefit of the tax to the fuel should theoretically net to zero. However, as the excise tax payments did not sufficiently cover early benefits payments, the BLDTF was given “indefinite authority to borrow” from the U.S. General Fund.</p>
<p><strong>Highway Trust Fund ($500 million)</strong> - The Highway Trust Fund supports highway, road, and other transportation projects throughout the country.</p>
<p><strong>Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve ($50 million)</strong> - The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve is intended to compensate for supply interruptions to home heating oil supplies, without distorting heating oil prices enough to alter consumer behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves ($28 million)</strong> - The Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves once functioned as a Navy counterpart to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But that isn't the case, and opponents of the industry can intentionally use this misunderstanding to misrepresent the situation.</p>
<p>Here's some of the things that are included in that &quot;$4 billion&quot; figure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single largest expenditure is just over $1 billion for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is designed to protect the U.S. from oil shortages. The second largest category is just under $1 billion in tax exemptions for farm fuel. The justification for that tax exemption is that fuel taxes pay for roads, and the farm equipment that benefits from the tax exemption is technically not supposed to be using the roads. The third largest category? $570 million for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. (This program is classified as a petroleum subsidy because it artificially reduces the price of fuel, which helps oil companies sell more of it). Those three programs account for $2.5 billion a year in &quot;oil subsidies.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need to understand what a is a tax deduction, what is a tax credit, and why the government (ideally) would issue them.</p>
<p>A tax credit of $100 means that what you owe in taxes is lowered by $100.  So if your business owes $200 and you have a credit of $100 you now only owe $100.  Credits apply to what you owe.</p>
<p>Deductions work differently.  Say you earn $100,000 and you have a $10,000 tax deduction.  You now only owe taxes on $100,000 - $10,000 = $90,000 at whatever rate you are taxed at in that particular bracket.</p>
<p>The government  subsidize through tax credits and deductions things we want to see more of, especially if we would not see that activity normally.</p>
<p>For oil companies often we subsidize exploration for new reserves.  If you are a small company you need these credits to explore for new wells.  This injects competition into the industry and generally the big companies don't like these small guys running around, driving up the cost of leases, and having to pay these guys money for what the big companies were eventually going to get to anyway.</p>
<p>But of course the big companies benefit as well.  Importantly to us, how do we benefit?  The argument is we benefit by taxing all the other stuff that comes along with the oil industry.  All the work clothes, all the account services, all these industries pay their income taxes, their sales taxes, etc.  </p>
<p>States benefit from royalty payments as well.  That is not inconsiderable.  The Federal government benefits from royalty payments as well.  Quite frankly a lot of the oil guys hate paying twice (royalties and production taxes).</p>
<p>And when you speak of taxes increasing the cost you need to define where the tax is.  A tax at the gas pump is paid by the consumer and is for maintenance of all the road construction and maintenance.  It is just and fair that those that get the most use out of the roads pay a tax for using the roads.</p>
<p>A &quot;good&quot; tax is avoidable by those that don't use the service and is unavoidable by those that do use the service.  A gas tax is a &quot;good&quot; tax at the pump because it targets exactly who is using the roads.</p>
<p>Taxes on gas get incorporated into tax. Everything that is moved by ship or truck pays some form of gas tax and is incorporated into the price of what you buy.  These are good taxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are misleading or missing the major reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tax breaks (&quot;subsidies&quot;) are for American petroleum countries.</p>
</li>
<li>Taxes are on <em>any</em> oil sold in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>So by cutting taxes only on US companies, they are able to be more profitable in comparison to non-US companies. Oil has a price controlled by the market so everyone has to sell at that price (in general) so any way that their expenses can be reduced (expenses include taxes) will make the US companies more competitive.</p>
<p>Adding taxes on to oil later on (and in different amounts depending on the type/use) means that we're taxing all oil consumed in the US. This is not the same as oil made in the US. So we tilt the playing field in favor of the US companies and then tax them all evenly.</p>
<p>This gets way more complicated because other countries try to do the same thing, but this is the general idea of <em>why</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All chemical reactions are based on interactions between the electrons of atoms.  To understand rust and tarnish, you need to understand how metals react.  Rust and tarnish are generally made when a metal reacts with other compounds containing oxygen or sulfur in the surrounding environment (air/water/ground) and water. </p>
<p>Other commenters have talked about how stable gold is, but the chemical reason behind this stability is due to gold's &quot;valence&quot; electrons; the outermost electrons in a gold atom.  These electrons are the ones that are able to react.  These electrons are found in regions around the atom called orbitals which can only take a certain amount of electrons before they fill up.  What we see in gold (and other group 11 elements) is that the orbitals which contain the reactive electrons are actually at full capacity.  Atoms like it a lot when these orbitals are filled and it ends up taking too much energy to add or remove an electron from a gold atom for a reaction to happen with oxygen or sulfur.  This makes gold really resistant to oxidation (rusting/tarnishing).  </p>
<p>Iron, on the other hand, is very reactive with water/oxygen and forms rust (Iron Oxide) pretty quickly.  It gets oxidized by oxygen really quickly because that reaction allows Iron's orbitals to be filled in a more stable way.  It then forms the oxide after reacting with water giving us the red rust we see everywhere.</p>
<p>Side note, there's actually a difference between tarnish and rust.  Tarnish is a layer on top of the metal that insulates it and protects the deeper layers of the metal like the green tarnish on copper (statue of liberty) while rust generally flakes off and cannot protect the metal below (steel and iron rust).  This is why iron things left out will eventually rust completely through while the statue of liberty is still standing.</p>
<p>There are also quantum reasons for the increased stability of gold which explains why we see tarnish on silver but not gold, but that's a little beyond an ELI5. </p>
<p>tl;dr: gold doesn't tarnish because it's happy where it is and it would take too much energy for it to rust or tarnish.</p>
<p>P.S. looking up wikipedia's pages on rust, tarnish, oxidation states and electron filling of transition metals will explain everything a lot better than I can :)</p>
<p>Edit^2: Iron oxide not aluminum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the process of 'tarnishing', or corrosion, is a redox reaction between the metal and oxygen and water, an incredibly stable and unreactive element such as gold will not be affected.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As /u/nickbrisola pointed out, I should also say that gold is a 'passivating' metal. These types of metal react with oxygen to form an impervious oxide layer that prevents from any water or oxygen to be in contact with the metal, hence preventing corrosion. </p>
<p>Other examples of such metals include Aluminium and Chromium. The opposite of these metals are known as 'active' metals and include Iron and Magnesium - which can be easily corroded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Kind of like how orange rust forms on iron (Iron III Oxide)  or the bright green patina that forms on copper (copper carbonate).</p>
<p>Gold is extremely stable. It does not readily react with chemicals found in the environment normally. </p>
<p>So because there is nothing that can react with the surface of the gold, the surface stays exactly how it was at manufacture and does not develop a tarnish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really simple answer....&quot;tarnish&quot;...is a form of corrosion. Corrosion is when a material usually metal wants to break down to its original state when in the prescence of an electrolyte (water, dirt,) Think of an old metal car left outside for years. Corrosion will star at the weak point where the metal is not protected by paint(scratches ding etc) and spread to beneath the surface like an infection. Most metals corrode..iron,steel,brass, over time if not protected (painted or seald from the environment). There are metal that can resist this process..pure aluminum, and gold for example. Your soda cans are aluminum. In fact aluminum is often mixed with other metals to help stregthen its resistance to corrosion.  Gold is far superior than aluminum at resisting corrosion but aluminum is far cheaper an lighter. Fun fact: most planes have a thin layer of pure aluminum on the entire outside to protect the metal underneath from corrosion.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of laws that affect everyone can be used to specifically target groups that are disproportionately unlikely to be able to follow them. The more hoops that a person has to go through, the more that a lack of education or a lack of time could stop them. The lack of education thing is important because someone with some college or even just a high school diploma is far more likely to have the patience to deal with large volumes of paperwork.</p>
<p>I have a college education, which means I only have to work one job. I have the time and attention span to jump through lots of hoops to be able to vote. Others with less education or in worse financial situations are less likely to have the time or motivation to go through the long and arduous process that registering to vote could be.</p>
<p>As an anecdotal example, when my wife and I (white US citizens in our mid-20's) first moved to this state (Virginia), she wound up having to take 4 trips to the DMV to be fully registered to vote, which was incredibly tedious and discouraging. If she weren't so determined to exercise her rights, she would have stopped once she got her drivers license. This wasn't even due to excessive laws in the state, it was just the DMV. If she had to work 2 jobs (more likely for minorities) or if we had family relying on us (more likely for minorities) or if she had less education (more likely for minorities) then this process could have likely stopped her early.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it's all about the kinds of people more likely to be lost at every hurdle. A law doesn't need to directly target minorities to disproportionately hurt them. </p>
<p>EDIT: To clear up a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm not talking about total suppression of some minorities. Making some part of the process slightly more difficult will not block out an entire group. But if a law is put in place that stops 1% of the rich and 5% of the poor, then it is disproportionately hurting the poor. It doesn't take much to do this, and it often doesn't take much to tip the scales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My wife's situation was made worse by a fuck-up at the DMV. There were no extra laws getting in her way, but the process was made much more difficult regardless. This is an anecdotal point and only serves as an example of how simple little issues can prevent less motivated people from registering. I don't believe that her situation represents the majority of people in Virginia. </p>
</li>
<li>As a lot of people have brought up, I'm improperly using the term &quot;minorities&quot;. The group that I'm referring to is really anyone who is not part of the social or financial elite who may be disenfranchised by laws that make voting more difficult for everyone. Most of this group is poor, and is disproportionately non-white, hence my misusing the term. Plenty of white people are affected negatively by increased difficulty in voting, and plenty of racial minorities are not affected by it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Canada and I actually have experience working as a deputy returning officer for a provincial election a couple years ago. </p>
<p>When I was working, I required that people had at least one of three things in order for them to vote.</p>
<p>a) A voting card, the card had 5 or 6 digit numeric code on it, used for the purposes of identifying the voter. They were mailed out to addresses prior to the election based on census data and other info collected (for example, when you received an ID/Drivers license, you have to provide an address)</p>
<p>b) If they didn't have a voter card, they had to fill a one page form so that they could be entered into the system. I would enter this information in to ensure that they didn't vote twice and wouldn't have to deal with this during the next election.</p>
<p>c) If they had no form of ID, and no voter form, they also had to fill out a declaration stating that they are who they are, and if they lied about the information provided, they could be charged under the elections act.</p>
<p>Voter ID really wasn't that bad. It was the people, primarily older folks who were the pain. They would have no voter card, and did wish to provide any form of ID or sign any form to vote. Eventually when they realized that we were not going to allow them to vote if they did not comply, did they produce their driver's license.</p>
<p>In my experience, the DMV in Nova Scotia is normally open until 7pm and getting an ID costs max $15. As well we also took birth certificates, and even registered mail as proof. You don't actually need ID to vote here, but if you do, it makes the process significantly easier.</p>
<p>Voter turnout for that election I worked was 59% which was unchanged from the previous eleciton, in comparison, voter turnout in the last Presidential election was 55%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But make it super super simple to get one.  When a citizen turns 18, send them a free ID.  If they do not have a registered address, that's another issue obviously, but then they should send an official out to find the person to get them the ID.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start,  ID in the US isn't required for day to day life so not everyone has one. </p>
<p>ID cost money to obtain which means the poorest citizens often don't bother because they need that money for other things. </p>
<p>ID also has to be obtained at specific locations which means those who are not living near one of these locations must find a means of travel to go get an ID.  Again the poor often don't have access to the transportation needed to get the ID. Even those in cities who are poor,   often can't take the time or money to get an ID due to life situations. </p>
<p>Therefore those who are poor or in rural areas without transportation to where they can get ID are unable to vote as a result. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
