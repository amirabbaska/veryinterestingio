		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll do the math the other guy failed at doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO" target="_blank">An M16 fires a 5.7 mm diameter bullet.  The weight of the round is about 4 g.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient" target="_blank">The drag coefficient for a bullet is approximately 0.295.</a></p>
<p>The equation for terminal velocity is</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee680de6632767977a602cfbed943853e3854cdc" target="_blank">https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee680de6632767977a602cfbed943853e3854cdc</a></p>
<p>where</p>
<p>Vt is the terminal velocity</p>
<p>m is the mass of the bullet, 0.004 kg</p>
<p>g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^(2))</p>
<p>rho is the density of air (1 kg/m^(3))</p>
<p>A is the area of the bullet (pi/4*(5.7 mm)^2 = 25.5 mm^2)</p>
<p>Cd is the drag coefficient (0.295)</p>
<p>So the terminal velocity of a bullet fired straight up from an M16 is 102 m/s.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7175470" target="_blank">here</a>, the minimum velocity of a bullet to penetrate skin is 58 m/s.  This bullet well exceeds that.</p>
<p>Don't shoot guns in the air.</p>
<p>Edit: it's been suggested that I point out that the muzzle velocity is 960 m/s, so the bullet is far, far slower on the way down than if it were pointed at you.  Also, a gun shooting at 102 m/s wouldn't count as a firearm under Canadian law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the bullet. It will be coming down significantly slower than it goes up, especially if it is shot straight up, because if it is shot straight up, it is much more likely to tumble on its way down, drastically increasing drag. If it is shot at an angle, it is much more likely to maintain its spin and stability, so it will have a much faster terminal velocity, and therefore be much more dangerous.</p>
<p>With big bullets, even tumbling it can be lethal, but small bullets will likely be survivable if shot straight up.</p>
<p>Regardless, getting hit by a bullet that was shot straight up is never going to be better than not getting hit by a bullet it all, so don't be firing guns into the air. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are doing (kinda), but perhaps in a way that you might not expect.  </p>
<p>The only way to increase CO2 uptake really is to increase photosynthesis and growth rate. We don't want to do that too much to algae because that could choke the lakes and seas, killing fish and devastating the ecosystem. Similarly, we don't want to do it to bacteria because bacteria were brought up properly by their parents and always share- by which I mean that they can transfer their genes laterally to other species. Think C.Diff is bad? Imagine if it develops a growth rate that's twice as fast. Not good.  </p>
<p>What we <em>are</em> doing however, is looking into plants. Depending on when you last studied biology you may or may not know that there are many different types of photosynthesis. Most plants use C3 photosynthesis, which was a lot better back when there was more CO2 in the air and less oxygen, but is increasingly inefficient. Some plants use C4 photosynthesis, which works better in all sorts of ways. C4 plants use less water, grow faster, and generally need less fertiliser. Sugar cane is a crop that naturally uses C4. A lot of work is being done to engineer more plants to use C4 photosynthesis, which would have the benefits of more food for less water and fertiliser, but equally take more CO2 out of the air.  </p>
<p>TL;DR, we're trying to make plants grow faster and more efficiently as a way to give more food and take more CO2 out of the atmosphere </p>
<p>Edit: a few follow up questions have been quite common;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No this would not be a good solution to climate change, most of the CO2 taken up would be released by decomposition, however trees modified to C4 could help with reforestation efforts by growing quickly. C4 trees could possibly grow faster than C3 trees, and if the total amount of biomass increases as a result, then more CO2 will be sequestered.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many scenarios where C3 is better than C4; it tends to be better in cooler, wetter environments with lower oxygen levels. However as the climate warms up, C4 will be increasingly important. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, growing algae in vats would not be a good solution. Any fuel generated would release this CO2 back into the environment. Yes, this would possibly reduce the amount of new CO2 being added to the atmosphere by preventing fossil fuels being burnt, at best this is carbon neutral, it doesn't actively decrease the CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>A lot of people are upset by me using the figure of 25% more efficiency for C4 plants. The fact is that around 25% of all photosynthesis reactions in C3 plants go wrong, trying to fix O2 rather than CO2, in a process called photorespiration. If you want a source for this, see:</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR:it's not that simple to make plants consume more CO2, other needs(water, light, nutrients) can be limiting, CO2 has to be transported to the place where photosynthesis happens, and GMO isn't magic.</p>
<p>the plant also has to get the CO2 to where it needs to go, which is limited by the CO2 concentration in the air, how fast the air around the leaves is refreshed(wind, and if the leaf has hairs more air stays still around it), and how quick that air can enter the stomata(small holes in the leaves, basically a leaf's lungs). then how quickly the CO2 is transported from inside that buble of air into the plant's cells(to think of a rough comparison, think of how the oxygen you breathe has to get from the air in your lungs into your blood).</p>
<p>next, you need enough light to use that CO2. then you need enough nitrogen, to grow new plant-parts and intercept more light. and other nutrients that are needed in smaller amounts. reducing all those limiting factors is not easy to do for any poor farmer, and depends on the climate. farmers in rich countries can get very far, but greenhouses are best since you can also control CO2-levels and reduce waterloss to outside the greenhouse. but still sunlight has a limit.
so at each of those steps you need to find solutions(and then a way to actually get it, either with conventional breeding or gmo, or management practices).</p>
<p>you would need leaves with a lot of area and no hairs, which keep their stomata wide open. open stomata also leads to a lot of evaporation of water, so you need to provide plenty of water. you need some wind to refresh air around the leaves, and enough light and nutrients.</p>
<p>one big thing you could do is go for C4 plants. C4 plants have a clever adaptation to one big efficiency-loss. the chemical that binds CO2 in plants, so that it gets from the air into the plant cell, can also bind oxygen. you could increase CO2-concentration(that's done sometimes in greenhouses), so there's more CO2 vs. oxygen. C4 plants do something like that too, they use a different chemical, that only binds CO2, and then transport the CO2 into a kind of airducts in the leaf where the CO2 concentration becomes very high and the original chemical can do it's work with high efficiency.</p>
<p>however, it's not easy to turn a C3('normal' plant) into a C4, since it's not just that one chemical, but also the airducts in the leaf. (little sidenote, it's not like C4 is rare, maize is C4 for example) and C4 do better at higher temperatures, so in temperate regions there's not that much to gain from turning a C3 into a C4. and actually, the reason that there is interest in turning C3 into C4 is due to using less water, not more CO2. since they can deal with lower CO2 concentrations, they can keep their stomata closed more often, so they evaporate less water.</p>
<p>and last, I think you're thinking of gmo as magic a bit too much. gmo sounds like it can do everything, but there are actually still a lot of problems. if you know what you want(let's say plant without hairs on leaf, C4 photosynthesis including the leaf anatomy), you need to find all the genes that do those things first. that is possible, but it's still something that takes time, money  and researchers. then you need to find a way to paste those genes into an existing plant, and grow a healthy plant where the editing succeeded and that can reproduce. and then you need to do breeding to actually make that plant good. if you made a gmo supertomato that is resistent to any pest, but you get shitty tasteless, small, green tomatoes, it's still worthless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measuring sea level is actually tricky business and we're not really <em>that</em> good at it currently.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's global sea level and local sea level. Global sea level is mostly affected (at least on human time scales) by the volume and temperature of the ocean (which is mostly affected by melting of surface ice). But the land on Earth is not static, so local sea level ends up being even more complicated with a lot more factors going into it. A major factor around river mouths, for example, is subsidence. The land there is soft, and it settles over time (to simplify) so even if nothing about the ocean changed the water depth at a particular point in a river delta might get deeper over time. Similarly, material deposition can have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>An important factor today is that the Earth only recently, in geological terms, came out of an ice age. For a period of about a hundred thousand years vast ice sheets covered much of the northern land masses. The current location of Boston would have been under more than a kilometer of ice, for example. Those ice sheets were, of course, massive and the water that made them up came out of the oceans, which is why the sea levels were lower during that period. Additionally, the weight of those ice sheets pushed down the continents, which float on the solid but plastic mantle. When the ice sheets retreated with the end of the ice age about ten thousand years ago the water raised the global sea level significantly (flooding a lot of low lying areas) but it also reduced the force that was weighing down the areas of the continents where the ice sheets were. As a consequence many northern land masses have been experiencing a long period of &quot;post-glacial rebound&quot;, as slow geologic forces push them toward a different equilibrium elevation than when they were weighed down by glaciers.</p>
<p>This movement is actually large enough to be measurable, and it's highest in places like Norway and Northern Canada. And, of course, Alaska. Southern Alaska is rebounding at a rate of several millimeters per year. Global sea level rise is smaller than this movement so local sea level change in regions still experiencing post-glacial rebound is negative, the sea seems to be going down (though in fact the land is going up). You can see the same thing in <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.shtml?stnid=040-321" target="_blank">Oslo, Norway</a> for example.</p>
<p>But if you look at areas that never had local glaciation and aren't experiencing post-glacial rebound, like <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.htm?stnid=500-041" target="_blank">Mumbai, India</a>, you see a different trend, one of increasing sea level. However, if you look at the sea level trends for a lot of different port cities at low latitudes you'll find that the rates of sea level increase are all over the place, from just a single mm/year up to several mm/year. A lot of that is due to different rates of subsidence. The land moves (both up and down), so trying to measure one moving thing from another moving thing is a very challenging problem.</p>
<p>We've been measuring the sea level with satellites for decades, but even that is not without it's fair share of problems. The main one being that we can't seem to calibrate the measurements of the satellites sufficiently well to actually have much confidence in the exact values of the trend data. We can be fairly certain that there's a global sea level rise but it may be as low as 0.5 mm/year or as high as 2-3 mm/year, it's hard to be certain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A process called isostatic rebound causes land uplift resulting from the lack of ice that was once present which caused large depressions over an area. This uplift, or rebound, is greater then the rate of sea level rise. A classic example of this process can be observed in north eastern Europe, where historically the land was covered in ice kilometres in thickness, similar to present day Greenland. It is very important to note that sea level change is a very complex science with dozens of factors contributing to a net rise or fall for example, water temperature, air pressure, and water currents trends. All of which change on annual, decadal, centennial, and millennial scales. The max and min sea level difference globally is a much as 70m from what I remember, all due to local factors mentioned. </p>

This test shot only used a 3.1kT device. I'm not entirely sure what kind of cavity would be created by a megaton device. My guess is the cave would just be larger and take longer to cool.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart of your question is really 'How are social networks formed?&quot; The textbook answer is that you need a <strong>critical mass</strong> of users, so that when someone new signs up, there are other people to interact with. Otherwise no matter how many people download your app, the newcomers will just leave if people are just trickling in, which means the app will be perpetually unpopular. The key then is to get a large number of users <em>at once</em>, so that the network becomes sustainable.</p>
<p>However, this answer only leads to more questions because it creates a paradox that many people refer to as &quot;the chicken and the egg problem.&quot; How can you convince the first users to sign up when no one else is around? Unfortunately, there's no easy answer, which is why businesses are willing to pay an incredible amount of money just to buy an existing social network. If you've ever wondered why Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter are worth so much even though they have no clear business model, this is exactly why (social networks are valuable because they are very difficult to create).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here are a few guidelines that can help create a network. They don't always work (e.g. Google+ have tried and failed), but these are characteristics that successful social networks share:</p>
<p>1) Start with a small but concentrated population. For example, Facebook was initially only available to Harvard students. Once it reached a critical mass of users there, it then expanded to other ivies, and then to all colleges, and finally to everyone. The same can be seen for dating apps like Coffee Meets Bagel, which first started off in NYC, and then gradually expanded to other cities before opening up to everyone. </p>
<p>When you start off with a localized population, you lower your marketing costs and you get more mileage out of word of mouth. It's much easier to simultaneously sign up 1000 users in one city than it is to simultaneously sign up 1000 users in a thousand cities.</p>
<p>2) Rely on users to recruit other users. Social apps become more useful when more people sign up, which means the users themselves are interested in helping advertise the app. For example, Venmo isn't very useful if your friends don't use it, so there's already an incentive for you to get your friends to install it. This growth will happen slowly over time, but because a critical mass requires a lot of simultaneous new users, you can speed up the process by rewarding existing users who help you expand your network. Venmo did this with a $20 referral bonus to both the new user and the friend who referred them. Other apps reward in-app currencies or features, such as letting you message more people on dating apps.</p>
<p>3) Minimize sign up costs for users. If you've ever wondered why many computer games (e.g. League of Legends) and mobile games are free to play, it's because the very presence of a user is valuable. A multiplayer game would be unplayable if no one else is there. Thus, companies will literally pay new users (e.g. Venmo example above) to sign up. Of course, this is very costly, so the next best thing is to offer the app for free. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Social networks rely upon something called &quot;network effect&quot; to provide a benefit to the user.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a lot of users for the features in the application to work the way they are meant to</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Example:  Using a dating app with only 10 users.</p>
<ul>
<li>You log into the app and only see 10 people</li>
<li>You aren't likely to date any of those 10 people</li>
<li>You aren't likely to even connect with any of those 10 people because you don't match</li>
<li>None of the features like search, messaging, favoriting, etc provide any value because the isn't a network to interact with</li>
</ul>
<p>For many applications the network needs to be in a specific vicinity for those features or the key benefit of the application to be obtained.</p>
<p>Example:  A dating app with 10,000 users but, the users are spread across the world with only 10 users in any given city.</p>
<p>Even though you have many times more users you're still going to have the same shitty experience as if the entire application only had 10 users.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what do applications that rely upon the network effect to provide a benefit and value to their user?</p>
<ul>
<li>They can create many fake accounts to give the illusion of a big network which leads to actual users joining</li>
<li>They create alternative benefits for users that do not rely upon a network effect--like creating contests or giveaways in the application tied to using it, paying users to use the app, creating affiliate programs paying people to get their own network to join and use the app, specific features the aid in the experience (like personal matchmaking or dating consultation services), etc</li>
<li>They partner with a much larger network and offer incentives to the partner to on-board their users--like an affiliate program arrangement</li>
<li>They acquire an existing company with an establishing network</li>
</ul>
<p>If the application's network effect does require the users of that network to be within a close proximity of one another the strategy is focused on a single specific area at a time.</p>
<p>Dating apps and ride sharing apps are great examples of this. They start in hyper local areas (college campus) and slowly extend outward. Once they capture a large % of the market in that area they roll out to a new area and build further.</p>
<p>Definitely read up on Tinder, Bumble, Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Facebook, Snap, etc for interesting examples of how they each did it a little differently.</p>
<hr />
<p>Everything distills down to an experience.  </p>
<p>A user judges their experience not just upon using the application but, upon every instance of interacting with your company--directly or indirectly through word or mouth/reviews.</p>
<p>Whatever strategy is created and implemented usually supports the overall experiential goal that the social network represents...the key benefit of being a part of that network.</p>
<p>If you're trying to do this yourself, always be aware of this and always do what enhances the experience by having every strategy, decision, and action in alignment with each other and the overall goal.</p>
<p>If what you do does not support that goal, you're only creating confusion/discomfort for the user and taking away from that experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have noted, many of them start off with a small, easy to target niche. Facebook and Tinder started off with colleges because college students have a shared identity that their marketers could leverage, it's easy to test your messaging when you can actually watch people react, and young people tend to be early adopters of new technologies.</p>
<p>Some marketplace-type apps cannibalize their competitors. For instance, AirBnB started off putting listings on CraigsList pointing to their own platform, to get people to switch. I've also heard of companies selling things on eBay and including materials promoting their own apps. That way they're getting the best possible users, the ones who are already doing what they want them to do and just need a better way to do it. That minimizes the number of users they need to get in the door to get a useful amount of activity going through the product.</p>
<p>Some companies use a honeypot approach, where they launch a product that doesn't depend on network effects, then use that to build up their audience enough to later switch on the parts that are dependent on network effects. OkCupid started out as just a bunch of wacky, fun questions that you could share with your friends. Then once they had some number of people, they rolled out the ability to find other people based on how close their answers are to yours.</p>
<p>Some go for broke and just try to sprint past it. They build a product dependent on network effects, raise millions of dollars, and sink most of that money into marketing to almost immediately grow the userbase large enough for the product to be useful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's a few ways. You could look to how Reddit did it. Looking through the comments, surprised nobody saw it. Basically, they setup the site and then created a pile of alt accounts. As people would post, they'd patiently remind them of the rules and guide them into the behavior of the kind of user they wanted to attract. They also quite literally had conversations with themselves to give the appearance of a larger (and more cohesive) userbase than actually existed. It was basically a re-enactment of the monkey story -- and eventually it reached critical mass and started growing on its own and the alt accounts went defunct. The site you see today is the result of those early efforts. </p>
<p>Was it dishonest? Maybe. But that's how a lot of sites kick off. Slashdot did the same thing, before it rose to prominence in the IT world... and then they sold out and it all came crashing down. There's actually many, many forum-based sites where when they initially went live, it was mostly the author/owners going to other forums and canvasing to draw people to their site and giving the appearance of more activity to keep people around until that critical mass point tipped over and it became self-sustaining.</p>
<p>There's also examples where they didn't do this and trusted that the mere brand identity or whatever would carry the day: Google+ for example, also known as the Ghost Town of the social networking world, or Hangouts, which is yet another attempt by Google to shove something down people's throats that totally isn't working out. I'm sorry to say, but if you're the only one at a party, more people showing up isn't gonna happen. You need that core glob of people to start roping others in, and even if you have to fake it, it's better than just kicking off the site and then promoting it without that (even fake) activity to engage people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We are launching soon enter your email to be notified when we do</p>
<p>The peril there is your concept and marketing has to be strong enough to bring them back when you launch. You also need to be aware 1 email != 1 user</p>
<p>There are bots thy just fill in forms, users that don't bother returning, bounced and changed emails and so on. Rule of thumb tends to be around 10-30% usually come back to check it out</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, when you're inside a building/room for a long time, and there's little/no air circulation, the air can become a little 'stale', per se, with dust or other things getting into the air. Stepping outside allows you to breathe in some fresher air with less pollutants in it. (hopefully)</p>
<p>In terms of nausea, I've found that breathing in cold air tends to slightly alleviate nausea, and on top of that, if you take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, that also alleviates nausea, so both of those combined would certainly have a strong effect.</p>
<p>The placebo effect could also be working in there. You believe that the air outside is fresher, and that causes it to have a positive effect on you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a wide range of indoor air quality problems that could be causing your headaches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DO you have a sore throat, runny nose or watery, itchy eyes? Are you sneezing, coughing or wheezing? Does your head ache? Feeling tired and irritable? You may have picked up a bug from a friend, family member or co-worker. Or you may have gotten sick from your house.</p>
<p>''People usually attribute these symptoms to a cold or a flu,'' said Andrew Port, director of indoor air quality for Environmental Waste Management Associates, a consulting company in Parsippany, N.J. ''But in a significant number of cases, these symptoms are indicative of either a problem with their heating, ventilation or air-conditioning system, or the presence of elevated concentrations of indoor air pollutants.''</p>

<p>You may want to keep some windows open to air out your house. During the winter, I always open up doors and windows for about 20 minutes a few times a week. During the summer, I like to keep the air flowing throughout the house all day and night because I am also sensitive to mold, dust, and fumes from things like furniture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Work was divided by central planners. In Soviet Russia there was quite literally an office of several thousand people who planned out the economy.</p>
<p>Workers were given quotas to fulfill. For example, a car factory owner would be told to make X amount of cars. He and his workers would be reimbursed with rations and housing. Not only this, but the government officers who enforced quotas were themselves subject to quotas. Those who did not meet quotas were threatened with years of imprisonment. This applied to every single area of the economy, from farming to clothes making.</p>
<p>An economy requires many interactions between different enterprises. If factory A required materials from factory B, the owner of factory A would place an order with the central planning office who would issue quotas to factory B. Any distribution of resources required goverment approval.</p>
<p>This resulted in many inefficient situations, for example tonnes of food rotting away while people went hungry, simply due to the difficulty of managing an entire economy and distributing resources.</p>
<p>The theory of communism plays on quite subtle understandings of economics. If you read Marx's theories, it is not immediately obvious how flawed they are. Unfortunately it has taken practice and the suffering of millions to show the problems with communism. If you're interested in further reading on this topic, I recommend reading some of economist  Dr. Thomas Sowell's works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't work for reddit so I don't know how they have written their algorithm, but maybe I can explain a little about search algorithms in general. (CompSci bachelors here).</p>
<p>There are three major comoponents that go into how a search algorithm runs: how the algorithm is written, what systems the algorithm has to chug through, and how many resources are available for the algorithm to run.</p>
<p>About how algorithms are written. There are many different ways to write a search algorithm. If I put in &quot;water&quot; as a search term for example, I could match in many ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Match on terms that begin with &quot;water&quot; (&quot;water is great&quot; would match. &quot;I hate water&quot; would not.)</li>
<li>Match on terms that end with &quot;water&quot;. (the opposite result of number 1.)</li>
<li>Match on terms that have &quot;water&quot; in them. (&quot;I love water sometimes&quot; would match, and so would the two examples in 1.)</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, the first two methods of matching would run more quickly because terms can be eliminated much faster. But obviously it is much less accurate. The problem with the last method of searching is that the algorithm must go through almost every piece of data to find matches. </p>
<p>About the systems used in an algorithm. I have no idea what reddit uses specifically, but I will give an example of how something could be built. There are many layers to a website: front end, back end, and the database. The front end is things like javascript amd html, which format the page the user sees, and the results of a search must be loaded into. The back end is where the server doing computations lives, and this is where the server takes the user's search query and decides what to do with it. Usually, the backend will translate a simple search like &quot;water&quot; into something that the database can understand, and then asks the database for the info. Then the database receives the request for data, chugs along the query and looks for the results. Then the database sends the results back up the chain, eventually getting to the user. As you can see, even something as easy as &quot;water&quot; goes through multiple layers. The problem here is not necessarily how many components there are to the system, but rather the time it takes for one layer to talk to the next. The system usually has a built in timeout if a query takes too long, because nobody wants their server held up on a query for ages. It is possible reddit's timeout is 30 seconds for example, when the query actually needs 1 minute to run to completion.</p>
<p>Finally, the resources available for a query. This is not so much about the server's resources, but the database's. If the database does not have a lot of processing power, it will take a little longer to run, especially if the database has A LOT of data to go through. Some database systems are better designed for big data than others. It is possible reddit has chosen one type of database system that isn't suited for querying large amounts of data in a reasonable amount of time. But now they are &quot;stuck&quot; with the system because trying to move mountains of data to a new system would be tons of effort.</p>
<p>Sorry this was so long! Hope it helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Poor/rudimentary search algorithm. I'm not sure if it's open source, but you can tell that it tends to look for literal matches. It gets easily confused by partial terms. Search engines like google are high optimized to use things far beyond the literal words to rate how likely something is close enough to what you wanted</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the time it says &quot;search failed&quot; and it's always slow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a resource thing. They intentionally put the search on low priority. Reddit seems to run pretty close to the line on server power/capacity, and search is the first thing to die when things get busy. </p>
<p>It makes sense, from a limited resource perspective- you want the main site to work well, search is &quot;less important&quot; most of the time.</p>
<p>Speed is a mix of both of those things- lack of resources to crank through stuff, and inefficient algorithms to sort through junk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm a web developer, the fact is, site search is a solved problem. There are countless search libraries and services they could use, and they have all the talented engineering resources they could ever need to do it. There's no technical excuse for it being so bad.</p>
<p>The legit reason is because Reddit management has decide poor search is a feature and not a bug. They've decided that bad search functions indirectly spur new site activity. People post new things rather than simply digging up old threads. There are even full communities dedicated to fulfilling a search like function. In addition to this, there's no reason to believe that better site search will yield increased traffic, so it's probably difficult to justify expending resources on it anyway. Trust me, engineering issues are not causing a site of this scale to have bad search.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism#Explanation" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> has a decent (and much better than I could do in a reddit comment) explanation of how ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) work. To properly understand why in some atoms parings are made and others are not requires a decent amount of <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/JamesBinney/qb.pdf" target="_blank">quantum mechanics</a> at the 2nd/3rd year undergraduate level. The topic is actually hard to find a good book on online, the closest I could find were <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~pjh/teaching/phz7427/7427notes/ch3.pdf" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmjk/keeling/teaching/magnetism-notes.pdf" target="_blank">three</a> on <a href="https://www.upjs.sk/public/media/5596/Qauntum-Theory-of-Magnetism.pdf" target="_blank">quantum magnetism</a>.</p>
<p>To provide some quick hand-wavy answers:</p>
<p>Why do such pairings form in iron and not chromium?</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron valence electrons find it energetically favourable to align their spins rather than anti-align them (it's to do with an interaction between the pauli-exclusion principle [PEP], electromagnetic repulsion, and the exact arrangement of electrons).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do pairings cancel out the magnetic field?</p>
<ul>
<li>All electrons have a magnetic moment (this is what gives rise to the magnetic field), it's orientation is dependent upon the particles' spin (either up or down). Due to the PEP, electrons in a filled shell will always pair up (one up and one down) and their magnetic moments will cancel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is it sometimes more energetically favourable on an atomic scale to anti-align magnetic fields?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of antiferromagnets the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction (which will anti-align fields) is stronger than the combination of the PEP and electrostatic repulsion that causes ferromagnetism. The exact reason for this requires lots of maths. </li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gist: electrons define magnetism as a side effect of quantum spin. The more electrons with the same spin (up) and no countering spin (down), the more magnetic the atom can be. Each orbital has two electrons in it - one of each spin. A valence shell has X number of orbitals in it, and each shell has more orbitals than the one before it and a higher energy level, but the higher the shell is, the narrower the energy level difference is between them. Each shell fills each orbital with an up electron first until the shell is half full, then the lowest orbital gets a down electron, then the next, etc. When shells' energy are close enough, adjacent orbitals in the nearby shells will also fill with up electrons before the down ones come into play. </p>
<p>Iron is in this sweet spot where the electrons can fill out several orbitals with up electrons without being countered by down electrons, and, because of the properties of paramagnetism, these &quot;ups&quot; can be matched with the &quot;ups&quot; of surrounding atoms when a magnetic field aligns them. Basically this means that iron can be stably filled with electrons without filling any of the outer orbitals with two electrons, and interactions between these shells of ups induces the same direction of up in nearby atoms. When this happens, the magnetic field has multiple contributions from different atoms and forms a larger magnet, and can continue to align nearby atoms with the same properties. </p>
<p>Chromium and other metals don't have as many &quot;exposed&quot; or disparate valance orbitals. Other metals usually have fewer exposed orbitals and/or the spins of the up electrons are mitigated by the spins of the down electrons in the same orbitals. </p>
<p>Think of magnetism as a disparity caused by quantum spin. The field is created when the net quantum property of the sea of electrons in a magnetic chunk of metal is very up and wants some down. Non-ferrous metals don't have as much of an up/down disparity, so the sea of electrons have a balanced spin proportion and the field created by whatever imbalance is much weaker. All the electrons are paired and happy. </p>
<p>Quick edit: I'm operating off of memory of knowledge I don't really use often, so please correct any lapses in vocabulary or understanding! ✌️</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This may not provide all the information you want but this channel has a lot of magnetism related videos. This is the first in a series reguarding exotic metals and magnetism, each video has some broad information on why some metals are not magnetic and others may be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
