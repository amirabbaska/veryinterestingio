		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason phone calls don't have perfect audio has all to do with three things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
<li>Physical medium of the delivery technology</li>
<li>The codec used</li>
</ul>
<p>They are all closely related.</p>
<p>If you think of a data connection as a water pipe, there is only so much data that can be passed down the connection, just like a water pipe can only carry so many gallons of water a second.</p>
<p>If you make the water pipe bigger, the pipe can carry more gallons a second and deliver more water faster to its source. This is broadly comparable to using better connectivity for our data connections. For example fibre optic cable can carry much more data a lot faster than the copper cables that are used to connect most of our homes.</p>
<p>To that end, when a phone conversation is initiated between two people, the sound of the voices from each party is in fact, a data connection that gets converted into an analogue frequency. Now uncompressed audio takes up a lot of space and can be slow to transfer, so to reduce it down to something more manageable, phone systems use something called a CODEC (en<em>CO</em>de/<em>DEC</em>ode) that basically analyses the audio, and throws out the bits of data that it thinks is not relevant to the clarity of the conversation. The more data it throws out, the more &quot;AM Radio&quot; the conversation sounds.</p>
<p>The standard codec used by most public telephone systems (Generally known as the &quot;PSTN&quot; to phone engineers or &quot;Public Switched Telephone Network&quot;) is something called U-LAW. Europe uses a variation of it called A-LAW. It allows 64Kbp/s of data for each way of the conversation (So 128Kbp/s total). It's been around since the 70's and is fairly embedded into most phone systems. It also closely matched and fitted the best data rate offered by twisted copper connections that where used at the time (And predominantly still are).</p>
<p>The days of the &quot;AM radio&quot; phone call are coming to an end though, if quite slowly.</p>
<p>Many new codecs have been developed alongside newer communications technology since the 70's that allow for greater clarity in a phone conversation. They do this by improved methods of packing in the audio data and more sophisticated ways of deciding what parts of the audio need to be thrown away and what needs to be kept. Some are even able to do this using a smaller transfer speed than the U-LAW codec. Most of these improved quality codecs are referred to as wideband codecs or &quot;HD audio&quot;. This has come about with the rise of a technology called VOIP or &quot;Voice Over IP&quot; which is basically a phone system that utilizes the same technology that underpins the internet (TCP/IP) to deliver an all digital phone service.</p>
<p>One of the most popular codecs used by internal phone systems of companies/organizations (Which is sometimes referred to as a PBX or Private Branch Exchange) is a codec called G722. The difference in audio quality between G722 and U-LAW is like night and day.</p>
<p>Cellular technology is also catching up on the wideband conversation game. Indeed many mobile carriers are offering wideband calls between users on the same network. This uses a codec called AMR-WB. It's generally predicted within ten years or so wideband audio for mobile phone calls will become the norm <strong>where supported</strong>.</p>
<p>I emphasise that &quot;Where supported&quot; bit because like most communication methods, a phone call has to negotiate down to the level of the lowest offering. So if a phone conversation is initiated between two phone systems, one side tries to use a wideband codec like G722 and the other side only supports U-LAW, then both phones will use U-LAW and the conversation will return to the &quot;AM Radio&quot; quality for both callers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The history of the telephone began with Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) which simply refers to the old, analog phone system we used for the first 100 or so years. Although humans (young ones anyways) can hear a range of frequencies between 20hz and 20,000hz, the vast majority of human speech is well below 4,000hz. The original designers of the POTS system designed what became known as a standard Voice Grade Channel (VGC) with practical limits due to the way electronic circuits worked so a standard VGC was typically 300hz to 3,400hz. When we switched to digital telephones they simply continued that standard by digitally sampling voice and consuming that same amount of bandwidth.  Fun fact. I worked with digital, encrypted telephones when I was in the Air Force and depending on the quality of the phone line and the bandwidth available, the encrypted phone would start at 4,000hz bandwidth and throttle to a smaller bandwidth if it couldn't maintain synchronization. At half that standard bandwidth or 2,000hz the quality of the speech reduced so you wouldn't recognize your own mom. At half again of that or 1,000hz you could barely understand it and could not recognize male from female speakers on the other end</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To save on bandwidth, many of the audio codec compresses in a lossy format to squeeze more active calls simultaneously. There are lots of phone in a given region, and there's never enough capacity to carry all the phones calling at the same time. </p>
<p>There's also the problem that if you don't have at least a bit of noise on the phone, people think it is not working, so even if you are in a quiet room calling another phone in a quiet room, you're likely to hear some white noise to help you differentiate between an active call with silence on the line vs a phone without an active call. </p>
<p>Most carriers in North America should have HD voice, which should improve voice quality. But it's definitely possible that if you make a call through a network that doesn't support it, the call falls back to the older standards. </p>
<p>In Hong Kong a couple of years ago, any calls to CMHK number would sound worse than other carriers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you get way more bandwidth on a TV cable. The reason for this is because they only have to send out each channel once. So if there are 400 channels, the cable TV provider just sends out 400 channels of content which people who are subscribed can request. This means even if there are 2000 people connected to that provider, it still only sends out 400 channels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the internet is designed to be <em>dynamic</em>. Each person who wants a file - such as a bit of a video stream - requests it specifically and gets a specific response back. So if there are 2000 people asking for various parts of various videos, it uses bandwidth for all of them.</p>
<p>This is why you are getting much higher bandwidth via your cable tv line than your internet line. Coax cable I think with all channels combined can transfer about 4200 mbps? Though I might be misremembering. Still, the limit on your internet speed isn't in the cabling, usually, but instead on the fact that <em>somewhere</em> down the line there's just too many different things going on to get it all through at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Second, when you stream an on-demand program it has to go to you and only you. If too many people want to stream on-demand at once you could get a slowdown, because you share a &quot;last mile&quot; segment with neighbors.  </p>
<p>You may have another problem though. What is your advertised internet speed and are you getting it? Try using wired internet if possible. Many times people's slow speeds are due to wi-fi problems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The pipe going into your house is big enough to support 5 HD channels and whatever tier of internet you have but always has the bandwidth required for the TV reserved for TV. So if you are watching one TV show and not recording anything the bandwidth that can carry 4 HD streams just sits idle it doesn't get allocated to the internet.  This is done for two reasons.  People complain way more about bad TV service then they do about slower internet.  And this big IPTV company wants you watching their TV content which is way more profitable for them then Netflix which they don't make money from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Cable TV can be optimised for video broadcast from a central provider on a relatively fixed system, including the data format and compression.</p>
<p>Networks supporting IP (internet protocol) need more general-purpose data transmission, including variable addresses. Data is split into packets that are buffered, inspected for a destination, and forwarded at every router.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/bencbartlett has provided an excellent answer that touches on the quantum mechanical nature of light.</p>
<p>Let me answer from a more classical/continuum optics perspective. Light reflection occurs (like at the air/silicon interface) because the index of refraction between light and air is different. Light reflection ONLY occurs at interfaces where the index of refraction is different (which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index-matching_material" target="_blank">index-matching</a> is so useful).</p>
<p>So when a beam of light strikes an interface, the difference in the index of refraction between the two surfaces determines how much is reflected and how much is transmitted in accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations" target="_blank">Fresnel equations.</a> </p>
<p>So let's posit your scenario: A set of two interfaces between air and silicon, and then silicon and silicon. Maybe you get two wafers infinitely close to each other, or you can just draw an imaginary line between two layers of atoms. Because there's no index of refraction difference between the two layers, there's no reflection and 100% of light is transmitted.</p>
<p>I have the sense based on your question that you're thinking/learning about ellipsometry? Or maybe one of the associated techniques? I'm happy to answer follow-ups, my PhD used ellipsometry extensively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electric field of the incoming light doesn't stop at the surface - it penetrates the material and in the case of visible light on silicon attenuates rapidly.  The penetration depth where the light has fallen to 1/e is around lambda/(4<em>pi</em>K) where K is the complex index of refraction of the material.  For 532 nm  visible light (bright green laser diode) K is about 0.05.  Put the numbers in and you get about 850 nm - a hair less than a micron.  Green light penetrates roughly 1 micron into silicon - that is several thousands of atomic layers deep (lattice spacing is roughly 0.5 nm).    This is a real penetration - shine a beam of green light onto silicon and the beam shifts sideways as if the reflection point was not on the surface.    Make the silicon thinner than a micron and green light will come out the other face.   This is true for all real materials - the penetration depth is always greater than zero.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels 5x faster in water.</p>
<p>Above-ground noises are significantly attenuated when they cross the air-water barrier. So every sound originating above water is muted.  Underwater sources aren't affected by this.</p>
<p>However, making noise underwater requires more energy per dB, because water is 1000x as dense.   You need to vibrate 1000x the mass, which is <del>30dB</del> <em>60dB</em> (darn convention changes) of attenuation.  Our ears also judge sound logarithmically, where each 10dB sounds about 2x as loud.  So equal sound sources at equal distances underwater sound about <del>32x</del> <em>64x</em> as quiet.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll kind of feel muffled, not just from the drop in volume, but because the sound doesn't seem to come from any direction.   Our brains are very well trained to find the direction of a sound source by the difference in time of arrival between our ears. That tells us left, right, or center, and the shape of our ears and face blocking sound from certain directions helps us judge forward/backward and up/down by subtle differences in volume.</p>
<p>Sound traveling 5x as fast makes the time delay only 1/5 as long. And since the volume is already significantly attenuated, we have trouble judging forward/backward from the small difference in volume caused by the shape of our ears. So everything sounds like it's coming from right in front of us, or on top of us.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Sound under water is ~60x quieter, and it's really hard to tell where it's coming from. Hence the claustrophobic, near-deaf feeling you get like you're walking past one of those anti-echo fabric boards in an auditorium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Got a little background in underwater noise as I was a submarine Sonar Technician for 9 years.</p>
<p>First off my opinion is that it is a lot louder underwater than it is above, at least in oceans. Ships, Shrimp( they sound like popcorn popping, or mouse clicking), and dolphins are extremely noisy.</p>
<p>I am assuming your question is more to the point of why does it seem quieter when my head is below water that above. Like when you are at a  lake, pool,or even in the ocean.  Well first off your ears are designed to work out of the water.  They may work okay'ish underwater, but not to the same degree.  When your head is underwater, your inner ear typically maintain the little amount of air within them, as getting water to your middle ear can cause issues.  Anyone who  had tubes in their ears already know this. </p>
<p>So in order for you to hear anything underwater, sound has to transfer to air first.  When sound goes from one medium to another(water to air in this example) it loses energy depending on what the difference in density one is from the other(and it doesn't get much more different from air to water).  A good example of how sound loses energy when going through mediums would be ear buds.  A physical object that is much higher density prevents the vibrations from reaching the air drum because sound doesn't transition well from Air to solid objects. When your head is underwater its the same thing, but the densities are reversed, the sound never reaches your eardrum as most of it bounces off the air bubble retained in your ear.</p>
<p>Now if you got yourself an underwater microphone, you will notice a completely different amount of noise underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easier to imagine by putting your ear against, say, a table. If you then lightly (very lightly, as it gets quite loud) tap on the table, you will hear it incredibly clearly. Now, if you then block your other ear, so your only hearing is from the table, and then somebody speaks, you won't hear it very well, because even though the table is conducting the sound much, much better than the air, the air doesn't transfer the sound to the table.</p>
<p>When underwater, it's like a really, really big table. You can hear any sound that originates from inside the water or from a collision with the water, but, like with the table, sound from the air won't transfer. </p>
<p>So while water does conduct sound incredibly well, you still need something to introduce the sound into the water.</p>

If you ever go swimming/diving/etc in the ocean, you'll find it's quite loud, especially in areas with coral.  There, you can hear fish crunching away at it constantly, like pop rocks always by your ears.  That sound travels very well, so it's all-encompassing.  If you hear a whale or dolphin, even if it's fairly far away, you can usually hear the sound.  However, directionality of the source of the sound is nearly impossible to tell when underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sound propagates quite well underwater, what doesn't work well are human ears. Sound waves struggle to propagate between differing mediums, in this case from the water to the air in our ears.</p>
<p>In fact, very little of what you hear underwater is from sound waves entering your ear canal. The human body is mostly water, and as such an underwater sound wave passes quite nicely into our flesh. This results in the sound wave resonating through our bones themselves. Much of the sound you hear is bone conduction!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are 8-10 leaders who basically drive the company in the direction they believe is best, and those people are the leadership (for better and for worse, because it's a <em>very</em> cliquish company).</p>
<p>There is a lot of lip service to the idea that 'anyone can get their idea built' but the reality is that you have to build consensus first and then get resources to get your project done, and that means you're taking resources away from one of the culture captains to do it. This is a big no-no and is why some employees feel marginalized and leave.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I would argue that valve isn't a game company anymore, and hasn't been since ~HL2. They are a platform company, and despite their success (or because of it, when you're swimming in money there isn't a lot of impetus to change) their platform does a TERRIBLE job at developer experience. It's literally 5+ years behind the mobile platforms for usability. </p>
<p>As of today: you can't use digital marketing techniques to grow your game because they provide you no analytics so you don't know what is working, you can't use modern payment flows because steam wallet (which is a fucking shit-show... how many clicks to get to the center of the checkout experience??!?) you can't do paid user acquisition on steam because they want to control who grows and who doesn't. They don't detect fraud well, so when it happens you end up eating the cost because valve processes the transactions, you give the digital goodies away, and then a week later they say 'whoops! we're taking that money back because it was fraud' only you've already given away the stuff. </p>
<p>But you still <em>have</em> to be on steam, because it's where all the eyeballs are.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a big fan of Valve's structure and there's a few reasons why (I think) they can do what they do. Here's a bunch of factors to think about, in no order in particular: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If they make a bad move the company has a lot of treasure to sustain itself. The huge profit margin coming from Steam that would keep the company afloat for years even if they released nothing at all or a string of failures. That allows them to think (very) long term. In the beggining Gabe Newel's personal fortune filled that role. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newell's goal was to build a company that constantly delivered innovation. For reasons I have yet to hear explained he ended up figuring out that that a completely flat, bossless structure was the way to do it. Considering they have built a series of acclaimed games, one of the first online marketplaces, and that they are, by most reports, behind most of the tech in the current VR renaissance, I would say he has suceeded.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valve is also very, very careful about who they hire, and they are very swift in dealing with people who do not deliver value within their corporate structure. You can learn more about this from their corporate handbook. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the corporate handbook: You are supposed to listen carefully to your colleagues and Gabe Newell in particular. So it's boss-less until it's not, really. </p>
</li>
<li>From what I've heard (personal reports and Glassdoor) there's some question about how good of a corporate culture having no bosses actually creates. Some people describe the culture at Valve as close to a high school. Also the Oculus move - there's a comment at hacker news recently (would have to find it) about how the VR team basically moved itself into Oculus with all the tech and they were quickly acquihired by Facebook, turning themselves into millionaires. In a bossless structure, the decision was made, I suppose, by the team itself. A very curious turn of events that many people at Valve are bitter about (again, according to the commenter). </li>
</ol>
<p>Definitly read the handbook and Abrash's blog about Valve if you're interested, The history of how Gabe Newell arrived at that structure is interesting and while I respect his decision I'm not sure if any other company could work the way Valve works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in such an organization, and I answered a similar question two weeks ago. I'll copy it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It depends on company policies and the people you're working with. I work in a ~400-employee software development/digital design studio with a Valve-like flat structure, and it works really well. The most important difference between us and Valve is that we primarily do consulting for other companies instead of working on our own projects. You can hop teams, but it happens very rarely, because people don't actually want to move from a project to a project on a weekly basis; most people like stability. When you hop teams, you typically change places with someone else in an another team. We have an internal piece of software for tracking in which project everyone is, and who to contact in matters related to a project.</p>
<p>There aren't that many cases where you need someone to actually &quot;take the lead&quot;. Teams make technical decisions by discussing about them, and the business people handle the business stuff. While the hierarchy is truly flat, some structure will always emerge naturally. You trust and follow an another person because they're more knowledgeable than you in a certain area, not because they can get you fired.</p>
<p>Flat hierarchy is not for everyone, but you can definitely make it work with the right people and the right principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some additions:</p>
<p>Being flat doesn't mean there's no leadership. Social structures tend to form naturally; the most experienced/knowledgeable developer in the team with the best connections becomes a de facto team leader (without any <em>actual</em> power over others). All important decisions are made by teams, which are not just limited to development/design teams. The business people are their own team; they make decisions about customers, contracts etc. The &quot;leadership&quot; team handles large (= expensive) strategic decisions, like should we open an office in this country or should we acquire this startup. Same applies to marketing, recruiting, HR, internal development and so on.</p>
<p>The decision process varies from team to team, but from my experience it's not anything formal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dev 1: Hey, should we use this technology for this thing?</p>
<p>Dev 2: I used it in a previous project, didn't work at all, crashed all the time and was expensive to maintain.</p>
<p>Dev 1: What did you use instead?</p>
<p>Dev 2: We used this thing.</p>
<p>Dev 1: Ok, I think we should experiment with it.</p>
<p>Dev 3: I can try it out in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dev 2: I can help you with it if you need anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussions like this can happen as often as necessary; they're usually just 1-5 minute discussions in the team room or a dozen messages on a Slack channel.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, I'm happy to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One idea is to let the roll-1 be a digit in the base-6 expansion of a number. So if the roll is <em>n</em>, record the digit <em>n</em>-1. All integers from 1 to 100 can be expressed with 3 base-6 digits. So you need to roll the die 3 times.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it's possible to get numbers that are greater than 100. Indeed, there are 6^(3) = 216 numbers you can get by this process. If you get any number greater than 100 just try again. (Or you can have the numbers 101 through 200 correspond to 1 through 100, and then only try again if you get a number from 201 to 215 or 0.) Then all numbers from 1 to 100 have an equal chance of being rolled.</p>
<p>For example, if your three rolls are (3, 1, 6), you record the digits as 205<em><em>6</em></em>, which is equal to 77<em><em>10</em></em>. If your three rolls are (5, 2, 3), you record the digits as 412<em><em>6</em></em>, which is equal to 152<em><em>10</em></em> (which is 52<em><em>10</em></em> in our modified game). But if your three rolls are (6, 5, 5), you record the digits as 544<em><em>6</em></em>, which is equal to 208<em><em>10</em></em>, and so you try again. The chance of having to try again is 16/216 = 2/27, or about 7.4%. Thus the expected number of rolls is 3*(27/25) = 3.24. So you shouldn't expect to have try again too many times.</p>
<p>I'm sure there is probably some other very clever way, but that's the first that comes to mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another option is to divide the numbers 1-100 into 5 equal groups (1-20, 21-40, etc.). Roll the die once. If you get a 6, roll again. Otherwise, your roll puts you in one of the 5 groups (roll 1 for 1-20, roll 2 for 21-40, etc.). Then divide your group into 5 more groups (so 1-20 is now divided into 1-4, 5-8, etc.). Roll the die a second time. If you get a 6, roll again. Otherwise, your roll puts you in a new subgroup (roll 1 for 1-4, roll 2 for 5-8, etc.). Then roll the die a 3rd time, rolling again if you get 5 or 6. Your final roll gives you the number in the final group.</p>
<p>So if your rolls are (3, 5, 2), ignoring any rerolls, that gives you the subgroups 41-60, then 57-60, then finally 58. The expected number of rolls needed to get a result is (6/5) + (6/5) + (6/4) = 3.9. You can probably modify the scheme by keeping track of your rerolls to determine later rolls, or maybe just by being cleverer about the divisions, to get a smaller expected number of rolls.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> An interesting question is whether there is an optimal method (in the sense that it minimizes the expected number of rolls) and what that method is. Clearly any such method needs <em>at least</em> 3 rolls. Just 2 rolls gives you 36 possibilities, which is too few to distinguish between 100 numbers. But 3 rolls gives you 216 possibilities. My first method based on base-6 representations tries to &quot;waste&quot; as few of the 216 possibilities as possible by having each of the 100 numbers correspond to 2 possible roll configurations. But you have to waste 16 of them. So the question then becomes whether there is a method that utilizes those 16 wasted possibilities. I would not be surprised if 3.24 expected rolls really is the best you can do.</p>
<p>Generalize this method to the problem of using a <em>d</em>-sided die to get a uniformly distributed integer from 1 to <em>n</em>. With my method, you need at least <em>r</em> rolls, where <code>[; r = \left\lceil\log_d(n)\right\rceil ;]</code>, which is the smallest integer <em>r</em> such that <code>[; d^r \geq n ;]</code>. Then the expected number of rolls for my method is</p>
<p><code>[; E = r\cdot\frac{d^r/n}{\left\lfloor d^r/n \right\rfloor} ;]</code></p>
<p>(Note that for <em>n</em> = <em>d</em>^(<em>m</em>), we get <em>r</em> = <em>m</em>, and the whole thing simplifies to <em>E</em> = <em>m</em>, as expected.)</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Any method must have <code>[; E \geq r = \left\lceil\log_d(n)\right\rceil ;]</code>. But is the expression for <em>E</em> above optimal?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit2:</strong> The problem has been solved! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5qch8u/how_do_i_use_a_fair_6sided_die_to_generate_a/dczwsvz/" target="_blank">See this post</a> by /u/ericGraves and the follow-up comments.</p>
<p>(Note that the notation used in his post and below is slightly different from the notation I have used previously.)</p>
<p>If we want to use an <em>s</em>-sided die to generate uniformly distributed integers from 1 to <em>d</em>, then the optimal method (in the sense that it has the least expected number of rolls) is a minor modification of the first scheme I proposed based on base-6 expansions, and the optimum number of expected rolls is</p>
<p><code>[; E = d\left(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}{jx_js^{-j}}\right) ;]</code></p>
<p>where *x*<em><em>j</em></em> is the <em>j</em>th digit in the greedy base-<em>s</em> expansion of 1/<em>d</em>. In the case <em>d</em> = 100 and <em>s</em> = 6, we get an expected value of about 3.16, slightly better than my initial method that gives 3.24.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can make this simpler by asking how to use a 6 sided die to generate a number 1 through 10 (or 0 through 9).</p>
<p>Roll 2d6.  If the number on the first die is 6, re-roll until it is 1-5.  If the second die is even, add 5 to the first roll.  Now subtract 1 from the total.  This gives us a value between 0 and 9.  Do this twice.  Multiply the first value by 10 and add the two together.  This gives you a normally distributed random number from 0-99, or add 1 to the final total to get 1-100.</p>
<p>Ex: We roll 2d6, we get a 4 and 3.  3 is odd, so we ignore it.  Subtract 1, we get 3.  3 is our first number.  We roll 2d6 again and get a 6 and a 2.  We re-roll the 6 and get a 3.  Since the 2 is even, we add 5 to the 3, so we get 3+5 = 8.  Subtract 1, we get 7.  7 is our second number.  Multiply 3 by 10 and add the 7, we get 37 as our random number from 0-99, or 38 from 1-100.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps fastest nearly 100% efficiency:
Similar to midtech, roll 3 dice.
Use base 6 to generate a number 1-216
1-200, divide by 2 to get random number 1-100</p>
<p>201-212, subtract 200 then divide by 2 to get a number 1-6.
Use this number and 2 dice rolls as above. </p>
<p>213-216, subtract 212 to generate a base 4 number.
When thus happens twice, a number 1-16 is generated.
1-12 generate a die roll as above.
13-16 generates a base 4 number that can be recycled into this loop. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wall served two main purposes: stopping raids and providing warning of attacks. It wasn't really meant to hold back a large invading army.</p>
<p>It was pretty easy for nomads to raid Chinese farming villages in the north with just a few men. The wall was someone effective in deterring that because it's hard to destroy a wall with a very small force and it only takes a couple people on a wall to fight you off.</p>
<p>When it came to large invasions, the wall's main purpose was to provide warning and maybe slow invaders. In fact, the wall has signal towers all along it so that a warning could be sent to wherever it needed to go. The wall was too big to man with a large, permanent force that could repel an invading army, but an invading army would still either have to spend time getting through the wall or around the wall. While they were doing that, the warning signal would be making its way to the capital and/or army.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original wall wasn't built to keep the Mongolians out - they wouldn't be united until 1200AD by Ghengis Khan. It was built mainly around 200BC to keep the XiongNu out. The XiongNu were Asiatic Huns and consisted of small tribes of nomadic peoples. Not too much is known about them because they didn't leave much archaeological evidence and it was very early in China's history, so Chinese historical accounts weren't too reliable.</p>
<p>The Great Wall is actually relatively close to Beijing - about 100km away (the part designed to protect Beijing and vicinity). From the Great Wall, you can see the skyscrapers of Beijing on an unpolluted day, and you could probably see signal fires on the Great Wall before modern light pollution and tall buildings got in the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

We think that quantum fluctuations near the event horizons of black holes cause them to emit mass/energy in the form of Hawking Radiation. For big black holes, this happens really slowly, (many-times-the-age-of-the-universe-slowly) but the smaller they get, the faster they evaporate. Exponentially faster. Eventually, we think they explode, and people are looking for the energy released in such events. In the last second of their life they should emit 100000 times more energy than the largest bomb ever built. We don't, however, have a complete description of the end of a black hole's life, which would need a quantum theory of gravity, which still eludes us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>At a certain point, the centrifugal &quot;force&quot; will overcome the gravitational binding energy of the black hole.

<p>What happens from there is anyone's guess, but I imagine the end result would look something like <a href="http://www.dailygalaxy.com/.a/6a00d8341bf7f753ef01bb095f4eca970d-pi" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black holes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">gradually lose mass on their own</a> and eventually explode, leaving nothing behind. You can't really accelerate this process artificially, it's just something that happens on its own and will happen fastest if you just leave the black hole alone and allow nothing more to fall in. Anything you throw into the black hole just makes it bigger, and the bigger it is, the longer it takes to lose all its mass and disappear; the 'lifetime' of a large black hole into which no more material is falling is proportional to the <em>cube</em> of its initial mass, so for instance, if you merge two black holes of equal mass into one of twice that mass, the resulting black hole will take <em>eight times</em> as long to disappear as either of the two original ones.</p>
<p>However, in the real world, everything in the Universe is constantly bathed in the dim light left over from the Big Bang. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background.</a> This leftover light gets eaten by black holes, so if a black hole is sufficiently large that it emits less Hawking radiation than the equivalent of the CMB, it is actually <em>gaining</em> mass even if no normal atomic matter is falling in. Right now, any black hole with a mass greater than roughly that of the Moon is too large to be decaying yet- it swallows CMB radiation faster than its own mass evaporates from it. Typical black holes formed by supernovas have a minimum mass of about twice that of the Sun, so they are much too large to be decaying yet. However, as the Universe expands, the CMB gradually weakens, so eventually it will account for less than the radiation emerging from any black hole, allowing all black holes to eventually evaporate away. The decay of large black holes is thought to be the slowest process in the observable universe, with the largest ones finally disappearing somewhere around a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years from now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you know when the task needs to be done by for example a school assignment, you will work towards completing this task and once you realise you are mostly done you will think about the deadline. This may be a while away.</p>
<p>Therefore you will relax and take a breather when it comes to this task as you know you are close enough to being done that you can do something else for now and do this task at a later date. This procrastination then gets worse until you eventually have come close to the deadline and do it. </p>
<p>Basically you would rather have everything 80% done than one thing 100%. Just do things straight away in future to prevent this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
