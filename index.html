		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer requires accepting that according to quantum mechanics, atoms and molecules can only have specific energies, called energy levels. You can be in energy level 0, 1, 2, etc, but higher energy levels require the atom to take in energy from the surroundings such as from heat. At absolute zero there is no heat, so every atom or molecule will be in energy level 0 at absolute zero (we call this the ground state). But the funny thing about quantum mechanics is, it teaches us that everything has what is called &quot;zero-point energy&quot;. This is the energy of the ground state, and you can never have less energy than this. For a very light atom like helium, the small amount of zero-point energy is actually enough to make the atoms move around a lot. This is called zero-point motion. (All things experience zero-point motion, but for bigger atoms or molecules these motions may be too small to make any noticeable difference). For helium, these zero-point motions prevent the atoms from coming close enough together to solidify, so even at absolute zero it exists as a liquid. </p>
<p>However, if you compress the liquid helium enough, you can form a solid,  but only at pressures above about 25 atm (25x atmospheric pressure) for helium-4, the most common isotope. Even in the solid form there are still large zero-point motions, so it doesn't behave like a classical solid where every atom has an exact fixed location. Because of this, solid helium is referred to as a quantum solid.</p>

<p>What Absolute Zero is, is the <em>ground state</em> energy. You cannot go to a lower energy level than that. Bonds between atoms have what's called &quot;Zero-point energy&quot; which means the ground state isn't 0. This is why heavy water is toxic while supposedly isotopes have the same chemical properties. The zero-point energy depends on the mass, and as deuterium is twice the mass of hydrogen, it has very different zero-point energy. This means the bonds between deuterium and oxygen in water are harder to break than between hydrogen and oxygen, and that changes the rates of reaction for a whole host of biological processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

See when a two population of the same species become separated geographically, they won't exchange genetic material through breeding. If they are separated for long enough of put under enough pressure, they will genetically change enough that they will eventually become different species. But it's a long process so you have some population are that in between. Meaning they become different enough that they are clearly not the same species, but didn't change enough to be clearly two different species. But you probably don't talk about that, because there isn't that many subspecies. You probably talk about species that look similar, like how there is like 8 different species of bears.</p>
<p>Now it depend on what you consider human. Are human only homo sapiens or all Homo are humans? Because there was something like 16 different Homo Species. Some went extinct by their own, but other were assimilated or killed off by home sapiens. The difference between other animal and us is our intelligence. The intelligence that allowed us to spread to the whole globe very quickly. See usually animal don't spread as much and if they do, it take them a LOT of time. So by the time they reached another continent, they already became a new species. We spread so quickly, that by the time we covered all of the planet we were still the same species and competed with all the other Homo species for resources and we won all over the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your definition of &quot;human&quot;, but it is not unfair to say that neanderthals were human, or that homo floresiensis or rudolfensis should be considered human. Neanderthals died out 30,000 years ago, and floresiensis were around as recently as 12,000 years ago (with the very first cities being as much as 8-9000 years old, this is surprisingly recent). So you could say that up until very recent human history, there were human subspecies which we interacted with. We even mated with neanderthals.</p>
<p>Now, why humans currently are the only ones left is a matter of speculation. It could be that we simply killed off the others, or that we out-competed them in the struggle for resources and food. Or something else. We simply do not know.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this and don't want to dig into really hardcore anthropology, I can recommend the book &quot;Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There is an ancestral subspecies also defined, <em>Homo sapiens idaltu</em>, and some taxonomies propose classifying Neanderthals as a subspecies of <em>Homo sapiens</em> rather than a separate species.</p>
<p>A major objection to classifying human racial groups as subspecies is that the variation in smooth and different features vary in different ways. To identify subspecies it's usually expected that there is distinct uniformity within each subspecies and clear differences to the others and that's not the case for humans.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily, the ability and willingness of humans to cross all sorts of geographic barriers is probably what's prevented the races from becoming clearly distinct subspecies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It doesn't have to be resigned to landing in your sink, pouring a mug of cold water versus boiling hot water sounds remarkably different. In fact, I can tell my shower at home has heated up when the sound changes.</p>
<p>Despite how fascinating this is, the answer is unfortunately rather mundane. The viscosity of water changes as the temperature of the water changes, and this results in the change to the sound.</p>
<p>Viscosity is how thick or &quot;gloopy&quot; the water is, while water is not very viscous at all the viscosity still drops by a factor of 4 or 5 between 0C and 100C. This is because the van der waal's, intermolecular forces become comparatively weaker as the random thermal motion of the water becomes stronger.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of responses to this thread, but none particularly quantitative. I am a little bit disappointed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri_4dDvcZeM" target="_blank">in the YouTube video</a>, and in fact a lot of the responses which seem to say very little. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The speed of sound can be understood by looking at the equation that governs solid mechanics. Basically, if you take the governing equations (known as Navier equations), then look at a travelling wave solution, you find that the wave travels at a certain speed. These speeds depend on the type of wave sought, but they essentially depend on the material properties of the medium. They are <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/63b8a40f17d7b1d5ba69235f996ae2a09b253bf2" target="_blank">here</a>. They are divided into what are known as P-waves and S-waves. There is more reference <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now for a fluid, there is only one relevant speed, as S-waves are negligible. Thus the formula for the speed of sound (P-waves) reduces to <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9c618951d93fe1e71475ebb7abb24f0a925b2321" target="_blank">this</a>, and so it is inversely proportional to the root of the density of the medium and proportional to the root of the bulk modulus, K.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship between temperature and density is more complicated, and I am not sure of a back-of-the-envelope explanation. However it is typically the case that increasing temperature will decrease the density, at least above 4-5C for water. You can <a href="http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/GenChem1/L21/2.html" target="_blank">see the trend here</a>, and notice that the trend is not true from 0C to 4C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus we can conclude that increasing temperature leads to decreased density in the case of water above room temperature. Thus the speed of sound will increase. Assuming that the wavelength of the disturbance (which will be complex in general) is fixed, then frequency and speed are proportional (c = f*lambda), and thus higher speed leads to higher frequency. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The above assumption of a fixed wavelength can be thought of as tapping the bottom of a glass filled with water. In this case, the frequency you hear will largely correspond to the standing wave where a quarter of the wavelength is the distance between base and surface. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now there is a well known effect known as the Hot Chocolate Effect that was studied by <a href="http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.13080" target="_blank">Crawford in 1982</a>. The idea is that the pitch you hear when you tap a glass of liquid will first decrease, then increase as you add and stir hot chocolate powder. The point is that the addition of the powder and stirring will cause the formation of bubbles. The addition of bubbles serves to increase the compressibility of the medium, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_modulus" target="_blank">decreases the Bulk Modulus, K</a>. The effect is to decrease the speed of sound, hence decrease the frequency and the pitch.</p>
</li>
<li>In the above hot chocolate explanation, the point is that as the fluid and powder are stirred to equilibrium, the gas bubbles disappear, and hence the pitch should increase again. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now I want to point out some issues.</p>
<p>First, it has been pointed out by u/Robo-Connery that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5z4wer/why_does_the_sound_of_cold_water_hitting_steel/devbz9z/" target="_blank">it has to do with viscosity</a>, but I do not understand this. In fact, going online, this seems to be a common answer on forums. However, I don't understand why viscosity is seen as a direct mechanism when density and viscosity are generally two separate and independent characteristics. One can increase temperature and observe one property increase and the other decrease. <a href="http://www.flowcontrolnetwork.com/how-does-an-increase-in-temperature-affect-liquids/" target="_blank">Here is a source that indicates this</a>.</p>
<p>I don't understand why viscosity is being cited as an item of importance when the sound wave propagates through the fluid as a pressure wave, and so is independent of fluid viscosity.</p>
<p>Next, I am aware that my answer seems to indicate higher frequencies for hot water, but it's not clear to me that this is the case based on the YouTube videos. I think that the answer may be more complicated. Hot water, when agitated, leads to more bubbles. Hence there is a competition between the aforementioned bubble effect (so the bulk modulus K of the medium), and the natural changes in density due to increase temperature.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, the issue is that you may get a different answer between if you simply disturb a glass filled with hot water, or you disturb the glass filled with water while stirring. In this case, the change in the pitch may depend on the rate that you stir the water.</p>
<p>A lot of inaccuracies might be present in this post. They're just late-night thoughts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the beginning of the 20th century, it was usual to work 60 hours a week. Then, unions, labour strikes and movements changed that (thankfully) and went down to a 40 hour week. That's what we've been working for 100 years already. Now, with the automation it would be fair to think we're up for a new reduction of the week work.</p>
<p>Some countries such as France have gone down to 35 hours, without seeing much of a change (neither an improvement not a worsening of the work). In some countries they are trying the 6 hour day such as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34677949" target="_blank">Sweden</a>, it's going well for many of them, but nobody does these experiments long enough to actually see results.</p>
<p>3 days a week, 8 hours = 24 hours a week. That's almost the 30 hours a week that the Swedes are trying.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economics_Foundation" target="_blank">new economics foundation</a> actually suggests a 21 hour week.</p>
<p>In general, arguments in favour of reducing the time we work per week is more time for our families, more time for other activities, more time for consuming goods, better work life balance, happy employees, less unemployment. Not everything is producing things (aka working long hours), people need to have the money, the need, the willingness to buy them and the time to use them. That all makes economy boost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Several industrial companies in Germany (the Ziess optical factory in Jena and a couple of others) did experiments at the start of the 20th century.  The Ziess plant switched from a nine-hour work day to an eight hour workday, and found that the workers actually got more work done.  At the same, the workers were paying premiums to an insurance fund.  When Ziess had a twelve hour day, the company would have to pay money into the fund each year because medical costs for the workers were higher than their premiums.  After the switch to eight hour days, the fund started making money, because there were less worker injuries and thus less money had to be paid to doctors.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another reason the days/hours worked over time has declined that other commenters have not mentioned: technological progress. </p>
<p>Even in the most egalitarian, low inequality society imaginable, it takes a certain quantity of food, water, and shelter to keep one person alive each day. If the efficiency at which those things are produced is low, everyone has to work many hours every day. If efficiency improves greatly, say, by agriculture or mechanization, then the minimum required hours of work per day to keep each person alive decreases. </p>
<p>Now, it should be noted that what we consider &quot;basic requirements&quot; does increase over time. Today, we consider running water, sewage systems, electricity, TV,  radios, refrigerators etc.., as basic equipment everyone needs to have. </p>
<p>However, that said, production efficiency has eclipsed basic needs so massively that the hours an average person works per year has been slashed dramatically. How dramatically? In the 1830 US, the average worker worked over 70 hours a week and over 6 days a week. They generally had no paid vacation, few paid federal holidays, no personal days, no sick days, no paid family leave of any kind. Today, the average is ~34 hours a week and while those benefits aren't ubiquitous (except federal holidays), they're common. </p>
<p>In all, Americans work about 40% of the hours they did in 1830's.. while at the same time have vastly better lives (in general). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Debts were written in columned lines in ledgerbooks. The second column was the sum owed. The third column described the debtor and / or nature of debt.

Additional marks were added to the letter as additional payments were made. That's why both the Dollar and Pound symbols are an S and L respectively, with one or two hash marks on them. The symbols on the left hand side, the first column, made it easy to scan the page for paid or unpaid debts. The second most important information was the amount, so it came next.

MORE EDIT: I hope everyone who comments understands that this isn't a perfect answer, and no answer is. There are a billion ways to simplify talking about the same exact, specific thing, and not every single person will understand the way it is explained. I encourage all of you who say this is &quot;too complicated, I'm literally five years old and you suck&quot; to use Google... The brain is the most complex organ and computer in the universe we know of, practically. It DESERVES a high level conversation. It REQUIRES high level conversation, because using analogies and metaphors is an EXTREMELY POOR way to convey the information about what is actually happening, to develop a real understanding of this question. It would be depriving you of a beautiful, incredible thing that is our brains to just tell you &quot;drugs work like drugs because drugs are like keys and receptors in your brain are like locks, so they activate and you get high.&quot; That's dumb as shit, and it doesn't even BEGIN to express how fucking awesome our brains are.</p>

&quot;Yo man, stump me, talk about <strong>WEED!!</strong>&quot;...</a></p>
<p>There are multiple neurotransmitter systems which have high or low concentrations in certain brain circuits - parts of the brain that apparently have a specific function. The actions of drugs are directly related to their affinity for particular receptors (strong, moderate, weak) and their binding type (agonist/activator vs antagonist/deactivator, in basic terms... The following may not be entirely accurate, and shortcuts in language will be used to more easily express the idea. Still a good overview though!) </p>
<p>Hallucinogens, for example, mostly operate on 5HT, or serotonin receptors.(DA=dopamine, NE=norepinephrine, 5HT=serotonin, GABA=gamma aminobutyric acid, etc... DAT= dopamine transporter of the synapse, NET = NE transporter of the synapse, etc...)  There are many serotonin receptors in the gut, which is one reason why hallucinogenic substances can cause transient nausea, for a specific example. The 5HT subtype, 5HT-1A is most closely related the the &quot;psychedelic&quot; experience often described, and has a high density in the hippocampus (related to memory,) the amygdala (emotional response and emotional memory,) and the prefrontal cortex (decision making, thought processes, etc.) You can see, then, why a &quot;trip&quot; acts like a &quot;trip&quot; on a basic level. The actions of drugs is MUCH LESS about &quot;more dopamine here, less dopamine there,&quot; than it is, &quot;this drug tends to cause activation of this particular circuit which leads to this more complex behaviour with x many iterations and variations, and suppresses circuits here which reduces xyz behaviour.&quot; </p>
<p>Confused yet? Perfect!</p>
<p>All drugs have different, but interrelated effects. Some don't touch dopamine or serotonin at all, and some drugs actually reduce the actions of those, yet can remain recreational. The most common and most used recreational drugs almost invariably hit a dopamine target, but not all of them. A good rule of thumb is if it hits dopamine as an agonist directly or indirectly, it's abusable. Similarly, sex, food, and all the other lovely behaviours we enjoy? Probably have a basis in indirect dopamine agonism. </p>
<p>A &quot;downer,&quot; like benzodiazepines, doesnt actually DIRECTLY affect dopamine or serotonin. It does, indirectly, with what you might call &quot;downstream effects,&quot; but primarily, benzos operate on a specific site, which isn't the normal site that GABA binds to. GABARs, or GABA receptors, have MANY separate sites for drugs or other molecules to bind to. The benzodiazepine site is one of them. When bound, it tends to sensitize the GABAR to GABA, the neurotransmitter, which leads to a depressive action in MANY areas or circuits of the brain. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain. Benzos are highly specific. This inhibitory action prevents or reduces neuron activity and &quot;firing&quot; of electrical signals. This is why memory doesn't quite work, you dont have all gears engaged, etc... Not all your neurons are firing! </p>
<p>Alcohol, or ethanol, its a very peculiar molecule. It permeates nearly all membranes, and equally diffuse throughout cells (including neurons) in the body. It leads indirectly to dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and other limbic areas, which are associated with the feeling of reward and learning. It also operates on GABARs, and 5HTr's, and glycine receptors, and NMDA and AMPA receptors (sometimes associated with learning, tolerance to drugs, dissociation, anesthesia...) and quite literally almost anything we have knowledge of in neuroscience. It's also destructive and damaging to cells in any quantity to some degree.</p>
<p>Compare the following, which are all similar to dopamine, and bind to DARs in some form or another, as well as NE. receptors. The molecular and atomic nuances of drugs are extremely important in determining their effects: all receptors are slightly different, and subtypes are variant as well. This leads to your question - different drugs have different effects, because atomically, they are different, and bind differently to the variety of sites they can possibly attach to. </p>

<p>I'm sure you know the difference between methamphetamine and propylhexedrine, for example. The difference? A couple of carbons and aromaticity in the main phenyl ring. One is an extremely addictive drug which will destroy any congesting you may have from a cold, and the other is a piece of shit masquerading like it does anything in cough syrups because lawmakers are scared. The proof is in the molecular structures and our hardware, which has many many subtypes and main types of receptors! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Here's a real ELI5:</strong> </p>
<p>First thats not true. Some recreational drugs act on cannabinoids (uh, weed), enkephalin s (heroin, oxy, vicodin), or glutamate (PCP, ketamine, cough syrup) as well. second, you have to look at the receptors in the brain. That's where the magic is. </p>
<p>Receptors are the buttons which neurotransmitters push. For serotonin alone, we have something like 20 different buttons that all do different things. Some buttons make you hallucinate, some make you love everything on the face of the earth, and some will make you vomit and shit your pants. This is all from the same neurotransmitter. Different drugs that all act on serotonin press these buttons differently. LSD and molly are both serotonin drugs, but they feel way different because they push different buttons, and on different circuits. </p>
<p>But you're right, all recreational drug circuits lead back to dopamine. It just so happens that our pleasure and habit circuit seem to be one and the same, so take something pleasurable enough and it will turn into a habit. That's recreation. Take it too many times and it will become addiction. </p>
<p>TLDR Every drug pushes different buttons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your brain as a book, and neurotransmitters as letters or words. Although there are only a few letters, they can be put together in different ways to spell different words, which make sentences, etc. Sometimes altering a letter produces little change in meaning, sometimes it produces a massive change. Where this change occurs matters too; if it happens in the table of contents, it can reference chapters that aren't really there, or it could change how the story is interpreted completely. The neurotransmitters can be thought of as the letters, neural circuits as the words/sentences, and the different lobes and areas of the brain as the different chapters. An increase of dopamine in the orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia will have 2 different effects, just like the word change in the example.</p>
<p>As easy as it is, neurotransmitter functions can't be reduced to facilitating pleasure any more than you could say that the letter &quot;e&quot; is only used to spell nouns. It's also noteworthy that reuptake inhibition is only a part of most drugs pharmacology, so there may be more upstream effects that have not been studied as thoroughly. Some drugs also mimic neurotransmitters, which further complicates things, and some even have no apparent effect on neurotransmitters at all! Despite this, the book metaphor is useful in describing the brain in regards to how neurotransmitters effect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to give a simple answer. It's not JUST dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is implicated in reward and serotonin in mood. </p>
<p>Basically, there's a whole host of neurotransmitters in the brain. There is Glutamate (stimulation) and GABA (inhibition) - your stop and go signals. Then there's Noradrenaline/Norepinephrine which is involved in general alertness. There's also Acetylcholine, which is involved in movement and some autonomic functions (this one contributes to some drug side effects like dry mouth). There are other neurotransmitters such as Adenosine but that's less relevant.</p>
<p>ALSO, there isn't just re-uptake and release! There's also breakdown inhibitors and among those, there are different ways to prevent breakdown of neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Finally, each drug binds to different neurotransmitter receptors with different strengths (avidity), different proportions (affinity), for different lengths of time, are absorbed at different rates, cross the blood brain barrier at different rates, are broken down at different rates and cleared at different rates. Also, different parts of the brain have different densities of certain neurotransmitter receptors. Among each receptor class, there are variants. For example, there at least 5 main dopamine receptors. Different drugs bind differently to each of these subtypes of dopamine etc.
The combination of all of these factors (and probably more) all affect the drug experience. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the question concisely: that's not true, they don't all do the same thing. </p>
<p>The media loves to talk about dopamine release when talking about drug mechanisms of action but for most that release is only a secondary effect, not the primary source of the 'high'. </p>
<p>Strong stimulants like amphetamine and cocaine are the drugs that work primarily through increasing dopamine levels. But others do not. Alcohol, benzodiazepines and other sedatives work mainly through activating GABA receptors, cannabis through activating cannabinoid receptors, opioids through opioid receptors, dissociative through antagonising (reverse-activating of sorts) NMDA receptors, psychedelics through activating serotonin receptors. MDMA works through increasing serotonin levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

But a big part of the smell of our drinks is how they are made.  Wine is fermented from grapes, beer is fermented from grains and wheats, so a lot of the smell comes from those initial components.
Liquor can be made from wine(brandy),  potato/wheat(vodka), blue agave plant (tequila), sugarcane (rum),grain (whisky), or flavored with juniper berries (gin)- edited, thank you guys ;)
The container used for fermenting also affects the smell.  Often used is oak barrels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a chemistry definition, an alcohol is any similar group of atoms forming hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon bonds in an alcohol arrangement. There can be ethyl alcohol, which is ethanol found in gasoline and alcoholic beverages, and there can also be methyl alcohol which has a similar evaporation point and weight as ethyl alcohol, but it is poisonous to humans. </p>
<p>The alcohol in your first aid kit is usually ethyl alcohol with just a little bit of methyl alcohol added to make it un-drinkable. This is done in order to properly tax alcoholic beverages. If you sell alcohol for anything other than consumption, it's inexpensive and not taxed as drinking alcohol. However anyone could sell straight grain alcohol as 'medicine' and people could get drunk off it, bypassing the alcohol taxes. So the methyl alcohol is added to it to make it poisonous and unfit for drinking. Because the boiling temperatures are so similar, it's not viable to distill or separate the two alcohols. </p>
<p>Because there are different types of alcohol groups, not all alcohols look, smell, and taste, the same. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Stories need some kind of conflict to be interesting. That means a protagonist and an antagonist. In the case where the antagonist is a person, if that person is just a normal human with normal motivations, the conflict is uninteresting - no one wants to watch a Batman movie that features the dark knight tracking down and collaring petty criminals for two hours. </p>
<p>Characters like the Joker are both unpredictable and a genuine threat to the protagonist. Psychopathy is one way to make characters unpredictable - their motivations cannot necessarily be ascertained by the audience at the start of the presentation. </p>
<p>I don't subscribe to the theory that it's some kind of vicarious exploration of our &quot;dark side&quot;. Instead, I believe it's just classic themes reorganizing themselves for more sophisticated audiences. Audiences want the hero to win, but they don't want it to be easy (which would lead to a lack of drama) or predictable (which would make it boring). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also creating a far-fetched villain is safer and more cathartic than creating a character just like your average human because you can't easily hate those like you but if a character may be far removed from traits you and loved ones may have, it's easier to root for the &quot;good&quot; guy since you don't have to understand the complexities and nuances of the character. </p>
<p>Sometimes we also like to explore those nuances of the &quot;bad&quot; guy, how they tick, how they wound up that way and create a bit of sympathy because it's more drama that sells. But I'd go so far as to say that this drive to understand how humanity can drive itself and others to commit horrible acts even manifests in war history lovers as myself. We see this all throughout history, people who may exhibit some mental illness or another drive themselves and others to awful acts or heroic ones. To prevent or understand this, being fascinated is a prerequisite. We're fascinated by people who have some sort of power to sway others. And this fascination drives understanding, understanding gives us comfort in knowing how to quell or make use of these powers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because humans are fundamentally fascinated by power. Power is the underlying variable in almost all relationships, superordinate and subordinate characteristics are the core of most on screen dynamics. The way we establish heroism is by having an opposite foil. The hero becomes more. 'heroic' in relation to the extent of capability for villainy of the villain. The main constraining factor that limits one's capacity for evil is conscience. Most humans have built in limits based on characteristics like empathy. Sociopaths are defined by the inability to experience empathy. This means they lack conscience and therefore are incapable of feeling remorse. So in other words, the characteristic of 'sociopathy' gives a villain with exceptional capacity. A hero who can beat such an 'extreme' foe is leveraged into the position of being more exceptional than  one dealing with an enemy who has moral constraints. This is inherently a more powerful, and therefore more dramatic dynamic than  a normal, 'human' foe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For decades, the Russian-led Soviet Union was a huge threat to the US and the Western World. This belief is still strong.</p>
<p>Since Russia recovered from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia is actively working against the US-led World Order. The US and its allies believe in a unipolar world. The US as the strongest nation to lead the others and make everybody adopt representative liberal democracy, capitalism and free markets. For this, the US created and supported several international organisations like the UN, the IMF, etc.</p>
<p>Russia believes in a multi-polar world with several equal leaders. So they don't want the US to meddle in what Russia considers <em>her</em> corner of the world. Russia has little regard for Western rules like territorial integrity and has often acted militarily against its neighbours like Georgia or Ukraine. </p>
<p>This is the general animosity between them. Now for some current issues:</p>
<p>Some of Russia's neighbours are US allies (for example Estonia and Latvia), US politicians are concerned that Russia might act against them. This would either result in War with Russia, or the US abandoning its Allies which would seriously harm US influence in the World.</p>
<p>Also, Russia and the US have mutually exclusive aims in the Syrian Civil War. The US wants to remove Assad, Russia wants to keep him in power. The US accuses Russia of specifically bombing non-Islamist rebels and civilians, thus committing war crimes.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are current allegations and indications that Russia might have interfered in the last Presidential Election of the USA and might do the same in other Western elections.
There is also the whole mess of the ties to Russia of President Trump and members of his administration. Some US politicians are scared that Russia might have blackmailing material against President Trump, or even that he might be conspiring with them.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Russia is the main country defying the US right now and is alleged to have meddled in their elections.</p>

Putin wants to reunite the Soviet Union and because of economic sanctions, the economy is tanking and they fear the public will turn on them regardless of media control.  Thus it is critical that they have the sanctions lifted, especially because it affected the production of oil (their only real source of revenue) and consequently the ability to make sustained investments into the military.  To get the sanctions lifted they essentially started a cyber war involving groundbreaking use of misinformation, which affected the election in the US, UK, and now is being used in Germany and other places in western Europe.  Also very possibly they are working with US kleptocrats (rich people whose goal is to concentrate wealth into the hands of very few by pushing risk onto the public and rewards onto themselves) to entrench power through the use of controlled media and threats to democratic institutions - namely gerrymandering, voter suppression, and turning normal citizens against each other instead of the kleptocracy.  You will find that politicians who focus on wealth inequality are the ones most vocal about Russia and Trump, because in the end it is about cementing a world order where 1% of  people own 95% of the wealth, which is actually happening with the full support of the working poor thanks to Russia-like media manipulation and race-baiting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now, it's politically useful for Democrats to talk up Russia as a threat which is why we're hearing a lot about it right now.</p>
<p>More generally, Russia has historically been an adversary to US policy and the current administration wants to project their power in places like Ukraine and Syria.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in 2012, President Obama mocked Governor Romney for stating that Russia was a threat saying that, &quot;the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.&quot;  Four years later, talking about Russia as a threat is useful to Democrats given President Trump's positive comments on Russia and Putin and (alleged) Russian efforts against Clinton.  So, Russia is &quot;such a huge threat&quot; because it's politically useful.</p>
<p>I think that's why <strong>US politicians</strong> consider Russia such a huge threat right now.  Other people seem to have gone the route of answering &quot;Why is Russia such a huge threat&quot; which I think is a more interesting question than one where the answer is basically, &quot;politicians will always be doing things to advance themselves and attaching themselves to whatever is in the news now&quot;.</p>
<p>And there's plenty of good reading for that.  Russia is corrupt, it wants to be powerful even though the world has passed it by, it thinks the world should give it deference given its size and (former) military might, it has designs toward reclaiming some lost territory, and it wants to be a major player in the world that gets consulted on things.  But it's just not that important. . .unless it does something nutty.  So, it has the potential to go a bit nutty to try and regain some of its former glory.</p>
<p>I mean, the world has passed it by as China becomes important to the world, India becomes more important, Latin America gets better, the EU becomes important, etc.  What's Russia good for?  Oil and gas?  Only until greener energy starts replacing fossil fuels.  Russia's military might?  Waning.  The US, China, and Saudi Arabia outspend Russia and the UK, India, and France come close.</p>
<p>In some ways, Russia is this dying country that didn't change after the Cold War.  It's corrupt. Its exports are basically just raw materials like oil, gas, coal, aluminum, and iron.  It didn't invest in its future.  But it does have nukes, it does have oil and gas that the world is currently addicted to, and seemingly little to lose being a bit of a bully.</p>
<p>That's not a great, stable, happy mix.  Like, China isn't a threat because they like our money.  Yea, they can push a bit - especially over uninhabited islands where the death toll would be thousands of rocks!  More seriously, China certainly has ambitions and such, but they're growing nicely, benefiting a lot from trade, and see their economy strengthening by being part of the normal, stable world.  That makes a country only willing to go so far.  China has invested enough in its future that, ultimately, it isn't really threatening.  They'd rather invest in educating their citizens, buying US companies, selling Americans televisions and cell phones, etc.  China is <strong>way</strong> more likely to be threatening economically - like trying to keep Google below a certain marketshare in China or turning a blind eye to intellectual property infringement by their own firms.  And that can be a problem, but it doesn't really come with a huge body count.</p>
<p>Russia doesn't have that integration and path.  What's Russia's future?  Hoping that they can still sell oil and gas to the West in 2075?  A lack of a future combined with a feeling that the world should be giving you more isn't a stable mix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WALL OF TEXT INCOMING, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</p>
<p>First: Because the US doesn't know how powerful Russia is.</p>
<p>The &quot;election hack&quot; was just the newest in a long list of russian interference in international affairs in recent years. Russia seems to be VERY keen in its cyber warfare, and the US simply doesn't know HOW keen, but they are getting success after success while the NSA and CIA are repeatedly humiliated (Snowden, Wikileaks). Russia, by all means, doesn't come even near to the global superpower the USSR was in its prime, but the US doesn't know HOW powerful they are right now. Ukraine seems to indicate the Russian Army is experimenting with new strategies and heavy integration of drones and cyber attacks in warfare, even with their economy falling apart. Also, nukes. Loads of nukes.</p>
<p>Second: The cultural threat.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the USSR, the US worked to create an unipolar world where &quot;&quot;&quot;american values&quot;&quot;&quot; ruled international relations - representative democracy, arbitration of conflicts by international entities like the UN/EU, free trade, free movement of individuals, etc. Russia, for a lot of reasons (revanchism, nationalism) is throwing these rules to the wind. They just barreled into Georgia and Ukraine with little care for international law, and are repeteadly threatening Scandinavia and the Baltics. Russia is actively trying to convince the world the american model of international relations has failed, and it seems to be working. Trump, Le Pen, Erdogan, Farage... the populists are gaining power around the world, always with the same discourse: globalization has failed. Again, we don't know to wich extent Russia is behind this, but the damage is already showing with the cracks in the EU and OTAN. </p>
<p>Third: Russia is getting desperate.</p>
<p>The Russian economy is falling apart with the sanctions and collapsing prices of gas and oil. They are losing the little economical and political weight they had, and since russian government almost literally belongs to a circle of corrupt gas and oil magnates, this is reflecting directly in their pockets. So nationalism is on the rise, Putin is stepping up its anti-western rhetoric and they are pouring even more money on the military. When all you have is a hammer and all that. This could end VERY badly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russia is a threat in the sense that they can (and probably want to) challenge US hegemony in the world theater, and increasingly are able to. </p>
<p>They are a 'historical' enemy in that Russia is the main remnant of the USSR. </p>
<p>Nukes. </p>
<p>Due to the fact that they are they are still the 'de-facto' USSR they have the ability to reignite old ties and alliances they had before the collapse in terms of influence in certain parts of the world, which the US doesn't want. </p>
<p>They are still a major threat to Europe in the sense that they are not friendly with western Europe and are a huge military power that could potentially damage US allies in Western (and Eastern) Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
