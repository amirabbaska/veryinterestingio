		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is right, but nobody is giving you a particularly relatable answer.</p>
<p>Take 3 of the most common antiseptics, hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, and iodine. </p>
<p>On their own they work great.  But hydrogen peroxide is a strong &quot;oxidizer&quot;, a term in chemistry that means it has free oxygen that reacts with other chemicals.  (It's H2O2, meaning one oxygen splits off to create h2o and o and the o is reactive).</p>
<p>The Hydrogen peroxide will oxidize the alcohol, making it less effective, and it will oxidize the iodine and create a different chemical all together.</p>
<p>Edit:  just tried this so I wasn't a hypocrite in case it didn't work.  If you have dry hands, pour alcohol on them.  It will burn. Now pour peroxide on your hand, it will fizz. Now mix equal parts alcohol and peroxide in a bottle or cup and shake it vigorously for a few seconds, then let stand for a few seconds.  Now pour it on your hand.  It won't fizz, and it won't burn, and it won't smell that strongly of alcohol either.  And oddly enough, it'll feel a little slippery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, and I'll try to answer in a way suitable for your school project. </p>
<p>First look at your electrons. They &quot;orbit&quot; the nucleus, but not in the way that planets orbit a sun, but by filling quantum orbitals.  These have shapes, which can be seen <a href="http://timelineoftheatom.blogspot.co.uk/p/erwin-schrodinger-1926.html" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://cdn.comsol.com/wordpress/2015/05/orbitals-for-the-hydrogen-atom.png" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8aDOv.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. If you are trying to find an electron characterised by its specific quantum numbers, these shapes will tell you where you need to look to find such an electron with high probability. </p>
<p>These shapes can be found by solving the Schroedinger equation for a Coulomb potential generated by the tiny, yet massive and positively charged nucleus.</p>
<p>The nucleus itself is built up in the same way. The protons and neutrons also occupy such orbitals. So from the point of the atom you can indeed say that the protons and neutrons are just all lumped in together in the nucleus. Yes, they are highly ordered, but it will make little difference to the atom.</p>
<p>If you need more/different information ask again. It would help to know what year you are in, the most appropriate answer will be different for a senior year in high school or junior high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Nuclei have radii of about 10^-15 m while those of atoms about 10^-10 m. So if you draw a nucleus that is 1 mm wide, the width of the atom would be about 100 m!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is missing a lot of key points, and many are flat out wrong. It's not lobbying in a legal sense and it's not a campaign donation. </p>
<p>The money being pooled is almost exclusively to be used by 501(c)(4), which are &quot;social welfare organizations&quot;.  These organizations cannot donate directly to candidates for federal office.  </p>
<p>What these organizations do is make &quot;independent expenditures&quot; which benefit candidates. Legally these have to be done without coordination with the candidate or the campaign.  </p>
<p>What that means from a practical standpoint is that they run an ad that says something like </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Healthcare reform was a critical factor in making sure residents of Wisconsin.  Paul Ryan was a champion of smart, sensible health care reform.  Tell Paul Ryan 'thank you' for being a strong voice for Wisconsin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[note, I don't agree with that... just using it as an example]</p>
<p>The advertisement would clearly be in support of Paul Ryan, but Citizen's United v. FEC made it legal for social welfare organizations to participate in certain types of speech without falling under normal campaign limits.  Theoretically, these social welfare groups can spend unlimited money running those kinds of ads.  </p>
<p>So what the Koch brothers essentially did was say &quot;hey, we're going to spend a ton of money supporting Republicans through our network of 501(c)(4)'s.  If you vote no, we won't spend any of that money in your district&quot;.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The first mechanism, as others have mentioned, is due to the isotope being part of the decay chain of other, longer lived isotopes.</p>
<p>Another mechanism that can do this is cosmic rays. The Carbon 14 used in Carbon dating is produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen in the atmosphere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>&quot;The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.5 billion years, uranium-235 about 700 million years, and uranium-234 about 25 thousand years. Uranium atoms decay into other atoms, or radionuclides, that are also radioactive and commonly called &quot;decay products.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Basically you have a combination of factors. </p>
<p>-Really long half-lifes</p>
<p>-HUGE amounts of material</p>
<p>-Material then decays into other radioactive elements.  It takes a long time for a hunk of &quot;random radioactive material,&quot; to actually become stable.  This is called a decay chain:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is there still any naturally occurring isotopes left on Earth if they have short half lives?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't.  Most have really long half-lives.  </p>
<p>Also if you had 100 tons of a material w/ a half life of 100 years, after 1000 years you would still have nearly 1 ton of the original material, and also a bunch of other radioactive goop.  Hence our storage of spent radioactive fuel.  For example TC-99 has a half-life of 220,000 years. So all that spent fuel is in there for the long haul and will likely remain radioactive longer than humanity will exist.  (Unless we leave this planet.  Friendly reminder to support Mars research.)  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several different reasons. Consider a few examples:</p>
<p>Uranium-238, Uranium-235, and Potassium-40. All are radioactive enough to twig a geiger counter up a few notches, all are still naturally occurring in not insignificant quantities. But this is because they all have long half-lives, 4.5 billion years for U-238, 0.7 billion years for U-235, and 1.3 billion years for K-40. That means there's half as much U-238 on Earth now than there was when Earth was &quot;born&quot; along with 1.2% as much U-235 and 8.3% as much K-40. Billions of years is a large amount of time, but these are pretty long-lived isotopes.</p>
<p>Consider Carbon-14 however, with a half-life of only 5700 years. None of the Carbon-14 from the early days of Earth is still around, yet it continues to be present in small amounts even so. This is because high energy cosmic rays hitting the Earth's upper atmosphere produce a shower of particles which includes neutrons and these neutrons can hit Nitrogen-14 atoms, turning them into Carbon-14 atoms after the emission of a proton. So there's a natural process constantly producing Carbon-14 and creating an equilibrium abundance of it in trace quantities at a given level of background cosmic radiation.</p>
<p>Consider Radon-222, Radium-226, and Helium. Helium is stable, but it doesn't typically last very long in the Earth's atmosphere because it has a tendency to drift higher and higher into the upper atmosphere and then get lost to interplanetary space. However, there's still Helium in Earth's atmosphere and there are natural sources of Helium (underground). This is because an alpha particle is just a Helium-4 nucleus, so alpha emitting radioisotopes will produce Helium in their environment as the alpha particles eventually lose energy and mate up with electrons, if they end up in a location where they can't easily escape to the surface (such as a geological formation that would also trap natural gas) then they can remain there in reasonably high concentrations for many millions of years. This is indeed where Helium comes from industrially, as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. Radon also exists naturally and can be quite dangerous to humans in certain environments, and yet it has only a 3.8 day half-life. Radium-226 also exists naturally but it has a half-life of only 1600 years (shorter even than Carbon-14). But both exist in the &quot;decay chain&quot; of naturally occurring Uranium/Thorium isotopes. As long as there's still Uranium-238 around there will be some amount of Ra-226 and Rn-222. This is actually a big factor in the radioactivity of naturally occurring Uranium, because U-238 isn't that radioactive on its own, but as it decays it builds up amounts of faster decaying and more radioactive isotopes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Some halflives are so long that they're considered primordial.  Like that particular chunk of isotope was there for the creation of the galaxy/universe, and it's still here.  It could conceivably still be here at the end of the galaxy/universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In my experience, kitchen staff won't make an item with extra ingredients unless the proper charge is on the ticket. In general, if you ask for something to be withheld, you'll just get extra of everything else. But since I'm just wait staff and not a manager or owner, I can't really change the price of your meal. The only exceptions I've seen be made are for when people want a half portion or something made very plain for a child. I would normally have to get it OK'ed by management and then they would adjust the price accordingly. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, any alteration to how the menu is presented should cost the customer more, and never cost the customer less.  </p>
<p>The cost of assembling a menu item for the customer is already figured out.  The decor of the plate, the flavor combinations etc. have been planned out ahead of time, and you're asking to change that layout.  If you are altering the menu, you're creating a &quot;speed bump&quot; in the kitchen for the people who are preparing it.  </p>
<p>They will make it to your liking, however this will probably slow down the service for other customers.  If everyone changed the menu to their specific tastes, it would likely double the time it takes to prepare each meal, and it may alter the presentation and flavor profile that the chef had intended... and they risk making other patrons mad for slow service.  So naturally they're not going to encourage the practice by offering a discount for doing so.</p>
<p>If you're allergic or you generally don't like one aspect of a menu item, it doesn't hurt to ask for an alteration.  But don't expect them to say yes (so have an alternate item picked out), and don't expect to pay less... because you're wrecking the flow and order of the kitchen.  And you don't want to piss off the people who are making your food behind closed doors, nor make the waitress the target of an upset kitchen staff.  </p>

Modern day brushes focus more on being less invasive towards the periodontal tissue (mainly the gums) and being more reliable in consideration to the time and amount of force that the consumer applies during their brushing sessions.  Also back then when toothbrushes were not around, people often used alternative ways to brush their teeth (see miswak or teeth cleaning twigs).</p>
<p>In relation to toothpastes and saliva they help in regulating the pH of the mouth that occurs due to by products of carbohydrates fermintation by the bacteria in the mouth, acidic pH increases the rate of demineralization of the dental enamel and limits the mineralization of the dental enamel. Also toothpastes tend to have prophylactic components that aid in the exchange of minerals between the tooth and the oral cavity and some have anti-microbial and others with periodontal-friendly components, but mainly saliva plays an important role in maintaining the oral balance and dictating its hygiene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WOOOO finally a question I can somewhat answer.</p>
<p>Brushing your teeth removes the residue material left after eating. Even without eating food, your mouth accumulates a layer of film especially around the teeth called &quot;Bio-film&quot;.</p>
<p>This &quot;Bio-film&quot; is harmless by itself but as time goes by, the bacteria begin to reproduce and different kinds of bacteria colonize the mouth. Both quantitatively and qualitatively as the bacterial colonization continues the bio-film begins to harden and this is where the toothbrush comes into play.</p>
<p>This is called &quot;Plaque&quot;. You can dislodge plaque with your toothbrush. Bacteria does not &quot;evolve&quot; in the same way that we regularly use the word &quot;Evolution&quot;. That being said , the bacteria in our mouth is different than it was 1,000 years ago as oral care has improved. This is not because the bacteria have changed but because we have changed</p>
<p>Removal of plaque and/or the bio-film only causes for the process to repeat itself. This is why we need constant care. It is Streptococcus Sanguis that initially colonizes the mouth followed by mutans and a variety of others (Lactobacillius casei, Actinomices, etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3392035/" target="_blank">This article</a> has a nice compilation and summary of oral care research studies, especially the section &quot;Tooth Brushing as a Standard of Care.&quot; With regards to how brushing itself (i.e. without toothpaste) cleans your teeth and mouth, it removes plaque by mechanical methods. Toothpaste, in its usual forms, aids in the cleaning of your teeth by the addition of abrasives. This is why toothpaste feels gritty. The abrasives in the toothpaste help get rid of more plaque by acting like tiny sheets of sandpaper that the arms (bristles) of your toothbrush rub on your teeth. This makes taking off the plaque more easy and polishes your teeth at the same time, resulting in squeaky clean teeth. </p>
<p>Now, how does brushing actually affect your health? The fluoride in toothpaste makes it so that your teeth have less chance to corrode and fall out, thus making areas for bacterial populations to congregate. Brushing removes plaque. Plaque is a biofilm, which is just a big collection of bacteria swimming in their own vomit pool. Biofilms usually produce bad substances (toxins, inflammatory agents, etc.) Less plaque means less biofilm. Less biofilm means less inflammatory agents. Less inflammation means less chance for open wounds and bacterial infection. </p>
<p>I didn't really look into how it has affected bacterial evolution, but I assume that the action of brushing hasn't affected bacterial evolution. The incorporation of antibiotics such as triclosan into toothpaste has definitely produced antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. On the bright side, triclosan has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8997654" target="_blank">anti-inflammatory properties</a> and has been shown to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23518778" target="_blank">help prevent mouth diseases.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here.  There are several different reasons mouth breathing can be detrimental.  I'll just list a few, and then answer any specific questions in response.</p>
<p>When your mouth is constantly open and/or exposed to air flow, it dries out your saliva - which is the mouth's way of cleaning itself.  With poor salivary flow comes an increase in bacteria, which can cause significant damage to teeth and gums.  This damage can be seen as cavities, decalcified tooth enamel, brittle teeth, swollen or puffy gums, and bad breath just to name a few.  Dry mouth can also be caused by certain syndromes and medications.</p>
<p>Another concern for mouth breathers is the excessive eruption of back teeth.  Like many other animals, human teeth will erupt or grow outwards away from the bone until the teeth run into something else - usually another tooth, but sometimes soft tissue like gums.  As a mouth breather, your teeth spend less time touching, and more time erupting.  Normally, this slow but steady eruption would compensate for tooth wear and other changes in your bite, but as a mouth breather your teeth will erupt excessively.  This could cause an open bite (where the front teeth do not touch while the back teeth do), excessive vertical growth of the lower jaw, constriction of the nasal passage and sinuses, a longer face appearance, poorer breathing due to lateral constriction of the airway, and several other anatomical changes.  The worst part about these changes is that each one of them typically leads to poorer nasal breathing and more mouth breathing, which in turn leads to poorer nasal breathing and less mouth breathing.  It's a vicious cycle that can impede everyday life, lead to poorer sleep quality, sleep apnea, significant dental issues, and generally a poorer quality of life.</p>
<p>Some people are born with perfect dental and facial anatomy, and some are cursed with really bad anatomy.  Unfortunately, there are very few therapies besides surgery available at this time for those with less than ideal anatomy.  Orthodontics may help, some medications can dilate nasal passage ways and increase nasal breathing, and there is a growing field in myofacial therapy aimed at correcting these issues non-surgically.  </p>
<p>The good news is that the surgeries available are getting better and better, and the medical and dental fields are beginning to take these issues much more seriously.  It has led to some significant changes in the ways we view and treat compromised or less than ideal airways, and the factors that lead to them.</p>
<p>If you suffer from poor nasal breathing, research dentists or ENTs in your area, and find someone who specializes in sleep and airway disturbances.  It could literally be life changing.</p>
<p>Good luck OP!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The other side of things is that mouth-breathing is looked down upon socially. There are other phrases such as &quot;slack-jawed idiot&quot; or &quot;drooling moron&quot;. This likely stems from the practice of mentally handicapped people to leave their mouths to flop open, perhaps while staring blankly into the distance or when fully mentally occupied. Precisely why this control escapes them I am unsure; it might simply be that they don't recognize the social importance of such body language rather than because their mental resources are unable to keep up with such secondary concerns.</p>
<p>In any case the perception exists that those who do not control their mouths are simpletons, so if you breath through your mouth you run the risk of picking up such associations. Of course we can't speak about your particular medical situation but if you need your jaw to be broken it seems likely you already run the risk of abnormal physical appearance leading to assumptions about mental ability, so avoiding the commonly recognized signs is even more important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an orthodontist, so I can give some insight to the dentofacial orthopedic side of it.</p>
<p>Your maxilla (upper jaw) develops by equilibrium forces between the tongue and the cheeks. If there's an shift in that equilibrium the maxillary development suffers, and this imbalance can occur from mouth breathing and other oral habits (thumb/finger sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifiers, lip biting, low tongue posture, etc.).</p>
<p>When you mouth breath, you're taking the tongue from its normal superior (upper) posture and bringing it inferior (lower). Without the tongue helping to shape the maxilla the cheeks squeeze it inwards. Narrow maxillas usually result in posterior crossbites (back upper teeth sit towards the tongue side of the lower teeth). If it is asymmetric in constriction, the lower jaw gets forced to one side and that shift can alter your TMJ and mandibular (lower jaw) development. People with these crossbites are usually recommended palate expanders if they are age/development time appropriate. If you catch these crossbites too late in the game, surgical expansion is required to obtain a normal bite again. Also, keep in mind the asymmetric lower jaw development that would occur if a narrow maxilla forces a mandible to shift to one side as it's growing.</p>
<p>From the dental side of things, dry mouth will result in inflamed gums and reduced saliva. Saliva is a natural antibacterial that helps to reduce decay by diluting sugars and &quot;attacking&quot; cavity creating bacteria (IT ONLY HELPS AND PROPER ORAL HYGIENE IS STILL NECESSARY). Inflamed gums are bad, because it creates stress on the soft tissues. Recession and bone loss can result from significant or prolonged inflammation. </p>
<p>In your case, it sounds like it's too late to attempt simple Rapid Palatal Expansion. So, you need Surgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion. This is because your maxilla has fused at the maxillary midline suture (happens when we complete jaw growth).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't just our emotions we're not aware of.  There is very little of our mind, our motivations, or our decisions that we are able to know clearly real-time.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this, and depending on the context I chose, I could find different ways to answer.  One very interesting reason for our unawareness is the relationship between the hemispheres of our brain.</p>
<p>Our right brain works with pictures and is responsible for various ways of interaction in life.   The left brain however is a storyteller, explaining reality so quickly, we don't even notice it.  It is the maker of all meanings and it never shuts up.  It is incessantly trying to make sense of the world and is more concerned with instant explanation than with correct explanations. </p>
<p>Case in point:  In his book, The Language Instinct, Stephen Pinker talks about a famous study that worked with people who had specific split brain injuries that made it so their brains were separated into two distinct hemispheres;  This made it so that neither the left nor the right brain was aware of/able to interact with the other side.  </p>
<p>The researchers conducted an experiment where they would flash the person's right brain ( I don't know how exactly they did this) a signal to go get a Coke.   After the person had gone to get the Coke, they would flash a signal to the left brain that said, &quot;Why did you go get a Coke?&quot;  </p>
<p>The person would always respond with something like, &quot;I was thirsty&quot; or &quot;I love Coke.&quot;  The left brain didn't know about being told to go get the Coke, but it still, instantly, made up an explanation that seemed made sense.</p>
<p>Our brain makes up an instant explanation for our feelings and everything else.  When we question our feelings we are often attached to and at least partially blinded by our initial explanation.  </p>
<p>It is also the case that it is often this instant interpretation that triggers emotional states, as our brain is hardwired to respond to certain thoughts with certain emotions - like, [&quot;I'm in danger&quot;-Anger or Fear, &quot;I love her.&quot;  - Happiness, etc.].  This hardwiring is culturally influenced, but somewhat uniquely manufactured in people over time.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Your brain is a meaning making machine, and it moves so quick, that it's hard to notice what's actually happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meditation teaches us to increase awareness of emotion by consciously and openly identifying them. For instance learning to say &quot;I FEEL sad&quot; vs &quot;I AM sad&quot; or &quot;I FEEL angry&quot; vs &quot;I'm fucking pissed off&quot;. Creating the distinction between the self and the emotion allows us to evaluate our thoughts without judgment. There are no bad feelings. Emotions do not define us. (I am not an anxious person, but I do feel anxious sometimes.) It's subtle but huge. Once we accept this and begin to change our thought pattern, we can begin to search for why we are experiencing this emotion. What individual experiences have lead us to react to our current situation this way? Is this emotion beneficial or a hindrance to who we are and desire to be? </p>
<p>Negative emotions are our subconscious trying to communicate that something isn't aligning with our core values, beliefs and/or self vision. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I recently received a bad grade which could be detrimental a few years down the road (although that's the anxiety talking). After I received this grade I was very upset with that mark and so I couldn't even study at all. I simply had no will or motivation to study. The problem is that that was also the reason that I got a bad grade in the first place (that I didn't study the first time). I kept asking myself why I couldn't study, and I answered &quot;because I'm not in the mood to&quot;. Well why am I not in the mood to, I asked again &quot;because I just am&quot; Usually I am aware of my thoughts and emotions but the true reason for my feelings completely blindsided me and I figured it out by accident only through a fight with my mother; it was because I was afraid I wouldn't get good marks even if I did) Now this really shook me because I thought that I had lost all control of myself and am no longer &quot;aware&quot; of my values and purpose. Had I been aware of the true reason of my sadness (the fear of failure) I could've easily tackled it which was what inspired me to make this post. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why aren't we always aware of the reasons for our emotions?</p>
<p>I'm a Buddhist, this is how I think about it.</p>
<p><strong>We are born with a monkey mind. Without taming it, it will always run wild. To tame it, you have to first become aware of it at all times.</strong></p>
<p>Right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the monkey seeing?</li>
<li>What is the monkey hearing?</li>
<li>What is the monkey feeling?</li>
<li>What mental image does the monkey have?</li>
<li>What thoughts does the monkey have?</li>
<li>What emotions does the monkey have?</li>
</ul>
<p>With right concentration, you can answer these questions at a rate of about <strong>ten times per second</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't believe me?</p>
<p>Try this (1 min):</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Sit down and place one index finger firmly on each knee. </li>
<li>Step 2: Concentrate the feeling of each finger contacting your knee.</li>
<li>Step 3: Try to concentrate on both feelings at the same time</li>
<li>Step 4: You will notice your mind bouncing between feeling the right knee, or the left knee, but not both at the same time</li>
<li>Step 5: Measure the speed your mind bounces between feeling each knee</li>
<li>Step 6: Concentrate and try to increase the speed</li>
</ul>
<p>Now expand this idea of feeling your body, to feeling your emotions, to hearing your thoughts, to seeing outwards, and also to seeing inwards.</p>
<p>Understand that the mind bounces between these senses like a rude monkey. Until the monkey is trained you will be at its will. And this fate is horrible because I can't think of anything more important than being aware of your own mind. </p>
<p>Now with a firm insight into how your thoughts and emotions work, let's get back to the original question.</p>
<p>Why aren't we always aware of the reasons for our emotions?</p>
<p>Answer: <strong>Because your monkey is dominating you</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's different ways that our brains control what we do, very roughly we could break them up as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instincts - stuff we're born knowing how to do</li>
<li>Learning - stuff we figure out through repeated exposure</li>
<li>Conscious control - we can choose to override some actions</li>
</ul>
<p>So for example pulling your hand back from a hot stove is instinct, walking is learned, and you can choose to walk backwards (which requires thinking about to happen).</p>
<p>Breathing is something that can and does fall in to any of the categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone's born knowing how to breath</li>
<li>If we practice breathing (say for swimming or yoga) we can learn to do it differently sometimes</li>
<li>We can choose to stop breathing, for example if we smell something bad</li>
</ul>
<p>In stressful situations, especially ones we haven't practiced alot, we're paying a lot of attention to everything we do and consciously trying to avoid doing anything incorrectly. We can go overboard trying to control everything and control our breathing by just holding it during tense moments. If it's a situation we've practiced then our breathing will probably be fine, and even if we hold our breath a long time our instincts will eventually kick in.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> our brains aren't a single unified system always working in a rational way, a lot of behavior is a bunch of <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2016/11/learning-and-intelligence-typical.html" target="_blank">different systems trying to figure out what's best.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This intrigues me. I've been married for 18 years. My husband has a CPAP (EDIT: a C-flex CPAP) machine to sleep, and has had one for about 17 of those years. He's done sleep studies and been to doctors, and apparently it's his brain. When he sleeps, it just forgets to breathe. As a result, he would stop breathing for up to a minute at night and semi-wake up (not fully, as he wasn't aware he was doing it) with a gasp, breathe a few times, rinse and repeat. When he got his CPAP, he woke the next morning absolutely amazed, as he had no idea how badly he'd been sleeping. </p>
<p>Recently, I noticed he does this during the day too. It's always been there, but I'd become so used to it, I stopped noticing. When he's semi or fully reclined AND distracted (playing on the computer, reading, watching tv) his breathing gets really weird, just like before he had his machine. He'll stop breathing a few seconds; inhale....hold breath.... exhale long. It's almost maddening when I start noticing it. I asked him why that happens and he said, &quot;I don't know. It's just hard to breath in that position.&quot;  </p>
<p>I only just now realized, writing this, that it's the distraction in common. If he's laying in bed and we're talking, I don't seem to notice the weird breathing. HOWEVER, at the same time, I don't seem to recall the weird breathing when he's sitting upright at the table and reading either. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how this helps OP, but it does seem to go along with the idea that when distracted (or asleep), it's possible the brain just forgets in some people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've ADD and growing up in the 80s, there was a lot of concern among parents at the time about the drugs used to treat ADD. My parents refused to treat me and I was a very early adopter of computers (I got my first at the age of 5) and we lived in the country away from anyone to play with. So I was likely one of the pioneers when it comes to reinforcing my ADD with technology. </p>
<p>According to my shrink it's common to learn coping mechanisms for ADD that are a bit counter intuitive. Because I have trouble focusing and I'm easily distracted, I learned to be able to &quot;hyper focus&quot; on tasks. Meaning, I kind of go into a zen-like state where I literally ignore all outside stimuli. This results in situations where I'll be doing something (like typing this message) and if my wife is asking me what I want for dinner I'll not hear her. She'll eventually come up to me, tap me on the shoulder and the shock of getting yanked back to reality is so jarring I'll jump &quot;WHAT?!?!&quot; etc... Now that I'm older I can decide to take my own medication, learn to deal with my focus issues but 40 years of coping mechanisms are hard to unlearn.</p>
<p>But, getting back to your question, this focus issue includes breathing. When I hyper focus like this, I often start breathing <em>very</em> shallowly, sometimes stopping all together. I'm doing it somewhat unconsciously. For example, while I'm typing this I have to remember to breath when I get to a period. (breath) I recently had some fairly major surgery and they had me hooked up to all the monitoring equipment... every time they brought in some paperwork for me to sign, while reading it I'd set off all their alarms because it wouldn't register me breathing anymore. If I did not slow down like that, I would have had trouble reading the document. The ADD just wont let me concentrate that long on something. </p>
<p>TL;DR: It's like a meditation I do when concentrating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In military Chem warfare training you're taught that when you hear &quot;gas gas gas&quot; you stop breathing (not hold your breath because people tend to take a deep inhale before holding, and if there's gas around, that's bad) and get your mask out. Except I was getting my mask out for a yearly fit check. For no reason I stopped breathing as I pulled it from the carrier and fumbled with the straps (it is stowed different for long term storage vs. an imminent chemical death situation) and by the time I got it on I was lightheaded and couldn't catch my breath through the restriction of the filter.

I have catathrenia, which is a form of sleep apnea where I hold my breath for long durations during sleep and then when I can't any more I let it out in a slow groan. As it gets further on in my life I find this reaching into my waking hours. When working out, staring into space, or concentrating on something, I sometimes realize i've been holding my breath for a minute or more. If I try, however, I can never hold my breath for as long as I do when catathrenia kicks in. Outside a CPAP machine that basically breathes for you, they have no cure for these sorts of apneas. Marijuana has been shown to relax the body and lessen the frequency and severity of apneas, but otherwise they just can't figure it out as far as I know.</p>
