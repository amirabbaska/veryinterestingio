		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, there is a difference between alcoholism and heavy drinking.  Alcoholism is a psychological dependency on alcohol, where the individual cannot or will not stop drinking despite whatever bad effects it is having on his life, health, job, and family.  Alcoholism and heavy drinking typically go hand in hand, in that most alcoholics are heavy drinkers, but not all heavy drinkers are alcoholics.  In my medical practice I have encountered plenty of people who drank a lot, but as soon as they were told that it was harming their health they just stopped.  Many of us have known (or in some cases been) the heavy college partier who consumed completely unhealthy amounts while in school but gave it up as soon as they hit the &quot;real world&quot;.  There is at least some genetic component to becoming alcoholic.</p>
<p>The average adult can handle about two drinks per day/14 per week without any major long term problem.  Any more than that, and there is increasing risk of liver damage.  The liver is a remarkable organ with a high capacity to regenerate itself.  Most people who shows sings of alcoholic liver damage are able to reverse it if they quit drinking.</p>
<p>The healing potential of the liver does have a breaking point however, and severe long term damage may be permanent, usually called cirrhosis of the liver.  Enough liver damage can ultimately be fatal.</p>
<p>Note that the above is for the average person.  Some people can consume more without a problem.  Some (including some particular ethnic groups) will do damage with less.  A blood test can usually spot early signs of liver damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three to five drinks a week would likely do nothing unless you have a preexisting condition, or are predisposed to liver cancer or cirrhosis. Heavy drinking will damage the liver over time. The liver can regenerate, so it is a pretty slow process, but over time, more and more of the liver will basically die, until that persons liver fails completely, at which point they have to be hooked up to a machine until they can get a new one, or die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll explain this from a simple physiology perspective of the liver.</p>
<p>With a few drinks a week, your liver successfully detoxifies your body because it makes extra metabolizing (detoxifying) enzymes to compensate for the alcohol. Because you have additional enzymes, you actually have a higher metabolism than you otherwise would, benefiting your health. This is of course assuming that your liver AND body has everything under control and completely balanced. If you binge drink or consume too many calories from alcohol, your liver/body will not be able to keep up and you'll get things like beer bellies.</p>
<p>Also because your liver is technically in 'overdrive' as a casual drinker, you might gain weight if you stop drinking because those additional enzymes are no long produced. This is the same reason (one of the reasons) why people trying to quit smoking often gain weight (the other being food tastes better.)</p>
<p>As for heavy drinking, the liver's enzymes cannot keep up and will be damaged in the long run. The reason is that alcohol (ethanol) metabolizes into acetaldehyde, which is toxic is large quantities. The liver can recover for the most part however after if you give it rest.</p>
<p>Like most have mentioned, alcoholism is a psychological issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recovering alcoholic here.  Alcoholism is a disease so how much or how often you drink is certainly going to impact your health but not the entire story of whether you are an alcoholic.<br />
Alcohol is essentially a poison, albeit one that will only kill you with a pretty large dose.  It is pretty darn difficult to drink enough to kill you without your body rejecting the booze in some way.  The damage done though is pretty significant.  Obesity, and the associated issues with that such as heart disease, and liver damage are probably the two most obvious.  The mental heath ramifications will be all over the place.  I self medicated to overcome social anxiety and it worked for a bit but because of my alcoholism eventually turned on me.  Some people get aggressive, others lose inhibitions to the point of engaging in risky behavior, while others will never have any issue and might even a better life because of alcohol.  It is a roll of the dice.
I would say the real kicker is that an alcoholic really struggle to maintain as your proposed casual drinker.  Hard to really say as many people stay casual for years until some event changes their usage pattern or triggers something.  You would also want to look at family history since genetics appear to play a key role.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we're interested in the long-term effects on the brain, it entirely matters what the pattern of drinking is. 5 drinks in one night, by most criteria, would be classified as an extreme pattern of binge drinking. Binge drinking has been shown to be the most damaging pattern of drinking to the brain. Having one drink five days a week would be classifiable as moderate drinking, which has been shown by many studies to confer health benefits both to the brain and the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>It's intuitive that overall volume and duration of drinking would correlate best with the extent of injury to the brain. However, this proposition was tested and it turned out that when alcoholics were studied, <strong>how long</strong> <em>they had been alcoholics correlated relatively poorly with the extent of alcohol-related brain injury</em>. <em>The factor that best correlated with alcohol-related brain injury was</em> <strong>how many alcohol withdrawals were had</strong>. </p>
<p>This is because alcohol withdrawal induces state of toxicity to which the brain is very sensitive. This toxic state is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity" target="_blank">excitotoxicity</a> and it's a result of how the brain compensates for the inhibitory effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>Alcohol makes neurons less likely to fire an impulse to neighboring neurons. This is inhibition. The brain responds  by modifying neurons so that they are more likely to fire. This is excitation. The brain also responds to the presence of alcohol by increasing the levels of the main brain chemical (neurotransmitter) which tells neurons to fire, glutamate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter</a>)). </p>
<p>When the alcohol-adapted brain becomes unexposed to alcohol, neurons become too excitable. Neurons are extremely sensitive to excitotoxicity caused by excessive glutamate and, interestingly, this is the underlying mechanisms behind most types of brain injury. This excitotoxicity is why alcohol withdrawal can be fatal.</p>
<p>Although some recent evidence suggests otherwise, one theory behind the cognitive impairment associated with binge drinking is that it induces a state of acute alcohol tolerance.</p>
<p>TLDR; It entirely depends what the pattern is. 5 drinks a week is probably bad for you brain, one drink five days a week might be good for you brain and cardiovascular system. Alcoholism injures the brain in great part be inducing a state of tolerance where the brain can no longer handle the absence of alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Feeding that intelligence requires upwards of 20 percent of the total energy used by our bodies per day. As you can imagine, some other mammals do not feed this same requirement. It's best to imagine your brain as a raging campfire, and as soon as you toss a log on the fire, you get more heat, but it burns quickly due to the amount of heat it's producing.....so you toss another log on the fire. You could have a small smoldering fire of only coals that would last you days, but it wouldn't provide you with very much warmth.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit complicated.  The easiest answer is that the music industry &quot;allowed&quot; it to happen.  When music was getting restricted, there was a backlash.</p>
<p>However, music remains profitable because the artist in question plays live, and tours, and music is a medium where people want to see live performances.  Hence, the act of giving away recordings (with some advertising) doesn't usually hurt the artist.  It hurt the record companies.</p>
<p>With movies, we're not looking for the actors to tour the country re-enacting Jurassic Park live.  Most films couldn't be done live due to visual effects and realistic sets.  So you have this industry that has no artist equivalent to &quot;touring.&quot;  A theatrical production isn't really the equivalent to a live music concert when we're talking about most films.</p>
<p>So the movie studios of the world defend themselves from markets offering free movies.  If movies were free, we'd stop getting movies.  You don't need a record company to make music, but you do need a movie studio to make most of the popular types of movies.  You can't make Guardians of the Galaxy on an iPhone and Adobe Premiere.  You could make Stairway to Heaven in a modified garage with microphones and pro tools.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, its important to remember that you do &quot;pay&quot; for your time spent of YouTube or Spotify, either through ads that you have to watch, or through a subscription fee. </p>
<p>Second, its not &quot;any song, any time.&quot; There's more than a little wheeling a dealing behind the scenes just to get permission to put these songs onto these services legally. Ultimately, if the record label doesn't want it on those services, they have plenty of resources, like take down notices, to get that song removed.</p>
<p>Third, consider the price difference between the two options. The average consumer will pay $5-$15 to watch a movie, but hesitates to pay $0.99 for a song. If you put all of your movies up for &quot;free&quot; on a streaming service, then you're leaving a bunch of money on the table. It works for some studios, or for older movies, but new movies rarely want to lose that money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a long story behind services like Spotify but the biggest reason that music became 'free' before movies is that music is cheaper, shorter and more disposable than a movie.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The average movie is around 200x to 400x bigger than the average song in the size of the file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People listen to more individual songs than they watch individual movies</p>
</li>
<li>Back in the early 2000's it was possible to download a 3 minute song  over the average internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>Music was therefore destined to be the commercialised on the internet before movies. It started with piracy and music sharing services, the average person could download a song in a few minutes, which is enough to build up a collection. Music labels refused to sell their music online and if they did it was only their own music and only through their software which made their services pointless. Then Steve Jobs convinced enough major record labels to allow their music to be sold for 99c and suddenly iTunes was the first real commercial internet music service.</p>
<p>After that, it was inevitable that 99c would become 'unlimited, flat fee' and finally 'advertising supported'.</p>
<p>Today we've reached the point where the average internet connection is easily fast enough to stream a high quality movie. I still remember when that fact alone was just a dream. However, the Prophet Steve Jobs (P.B.U.H.) is not here to tell the movie execs to get their shit together. Movies still need to make a load of money in the box office and then they try to stagger their release around the world by selling them on these shitty disks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haematology scientist here. Your body responds to growth hormones which are produced in response to a lack of something. For example with your red blood cells, your kidneys realise &quot;oh man we don't have enough RBCs here and we are hypoxic, I'm going to make some erythropoietin (growth hormone to stimulate RBC generation)&quot;.
So it's not like training biceps for a bench press. This is simple provision and providing, replacing what was taken. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried searching for proof and articles in various databases but it's very hard to find. Very interesting question. From what I know from basic anatomy/physiology ( Im going to source wiki ) I'm going to give you my hypothesis. </p>
<p>We first have to understand what triggers RBC creation; The body doesnt really sense that we have less RBC, the body senses that our body is hypoxic due to a lower amount of RBC carrying around oxygen. This happens most frequently in the kidneys. When the body sensis this hypoxia it will reactively stimulate EPO production which signals the bone marrow to heighten the production of RBC.</p>
<p>So to summarize; our body makes just enough blood so we don't go into hypoxia.</p>
<p>So when you intermittently lose blood the body will just react with an increase EPO production.
Theoretically it is possible to speed up the process of making blood by having more red bone marrow. ( obese people have more red bone marrow cause they need more RBC to supply all their cells, fat cells, with oxygen. ). However I'm not sure if regularly donating blood will increase your red bone marrow because you are only intermittently going into hypoxia, if you were permanently attached to a device that leaches blood I do hypothesize that you will increase your red bone marrow and thus increase maximum output capacity of red bone marrow at specific epo levels ( we dont actually know the maximum red bone marrow production rate of RBC ) . So basicly you speed up the process by increasing quantity. </p>
<p>Increase of quality/efficiency of production is not attainable. Your body wont be able to more efficiently make blood cells because that would require some special pathway to be enabled. Atleast not during a long period of time. When you have acute bloodloss you will &quot;more efficiently&quot; ( not sure if this is the right phrasing ), produce RBC during a short period of time. RBC have to mature in the bone marrow, but in acute traumatic cases with heavy blood loss the body can trigger the bone marrow to release young blood cells thus increasing the efficiency of the proces, more RBC in the same timespan.</p>

<p>happy to answer any questions you guys might have</p>
<p>edit: OP talks about blood components but I only talk about RBC because I think that's the most interesting/important part. WBC could be debated too but thats even more complex. The other blood components are only limited by bodily intake and reserves -&gt; electrolytes, water, proteins etc etc</p>
<p>edit 2: interesting fact. Athletes sometimes go to train at high altitudes, with lox oxygen concentrattion, to induce heightened RBC production so they can perform better when they get back to low altitudes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_training" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_training</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oohh! I did this for a living!</p>
<p>I did background checks on chemists, armored car drivers, etc.</p>
<p>You fill out your application including work history or include your resume.  Your prospective employer then sends it to me.  They can get everything including credit check, criminal background, past employment history (most common), and education (also most common).</p>
<p>I then call your previous employers and ask them about you.  Some tell me you were great, some call you an asshole, some require your signature to speak about you (which you signed on your application), others transfer you to HR where they have 2-3 generic responses:  terminated, not eligible/eligible for rehire, gave notice, etc.  Typically not eligible/eligible for rehire is legal HR code for if you were a good employee.  Sometimes I had to verify responsibilities, hours, and pay.  If you're not confident that your boss was tell people you were an assistant manager, don't put it on your resume.  It makes you look terrible when your previous boss says, &quot;no. He was just a janitor.&quot;</p>
<p>If the company closed you're still not safe.  I'll call the business next door and ask if they remember you, know anyone who used to work next door, etc.  the Chmaber of Commerce will remember all small business owners in a little town and give me their contact info.  I will look up who owned the McDonalds franchise that closed, cross check the property address, use the white pages to find the previous owner, and call them at home and ask about you.</p>
<p>I do the same for your education.  I can call your HS or check a school's registrar database for your degree.  If you put HS diploma and you got a GED I had to mark &quot;No high school diploma.&quot;  This one always killed me because one particular application just had a check box for &quot;graduated from HS?&quot;  If it's a diploma mill or you never graduated I make a note of that.</p>
<p>For scientists/chemists (pharma company) I would have to call references.  I would speak to a grad student's professors.  They were the meanest most brutal people.  &quot;Student doesn't really stand out. Average.&quot; &quot;No personality, wouldn't let them work for me.&quot;  Just brutal personal attacks.  All other references were obviously the persons friends and they gave the answers you'd expect. </p>
<p>Background checks are automatic along with credit history.  If you turn out to be a child molester we research that to confirm it's you because the system is fairly flawed.</p>
<p>Some companies/people would put through &quot;rush&quot; requests which was basically just a note to gather all the info you can and send it within 24 hours.  Most times we would have 3-5 days. </p>
<p>It was an interesting job and I have a compulsive need to pursue things to the very end so it was good for that.  However I don't like &quot;gotcha moments.&quot;  They don't bring me the joy they bring others.  </p>
<p>Ironically the company realized I had IT experience so they switched me over to IT work but wouldn't promote me officially (read: pay me appropriately) because I didn't have a degree.  </p>
<p>Edit:  This was years ago that I did this job.  Social media was a thing but we didn't really check it and submit anything from it.  I do know of several hospital systems that do and will check for anyone getting privileges.  Keep your stuff private.  It's just good common sense.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I didn't hire anyone.  I just collected the data. I don't know what the end user did with the data or what specific criteria they cared most about.</p>
<p>Edit 3:  I'm going to bed.  I'm sorry if I didn't answer your question. I tried but my email doesn't show all reply's on mobile.  I'm done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said it all starts with basic record checks to verify the information you're asked to provide (degrees, criminal history, possibly finances, residences, and employments). Each state either has a statewide law check they can run or individual counties are checked instead where there are no statewide agencies (CA for example). If they get a &quot;hit&quot; on a routine law check they'll follow up with the PD or Court in question for the details and disposition. If you've ever seen a person at the traffic court window with a laptop and stack of files and they're not at the Attorney window then chances are they're record searchers for these routine background check places.</p>
<p>Now Federal Investigations are a little more complex. They'll still do all of the above however will also check DOD and other Federal Law Enforcement Agencies for record &quot;hits&quot;. If you were ever fingerprinted in connection to a crime they will have a record of that, even if you were never convicted and/or told the record would be expunged (so don't lie). They will find it, and then you'll have to sit down with an Investigator that is going to confront you with this derogatory information and ask you why you lied about it on your form. Super awkward conversation and you'll feel like an idiot.<br />
Depending on the clearance level (Public Trust to TS/SCI) they'll either send out letters of inquiry to your prior residences/education/employers for confirmation or send actual Investigators in person to interview anyone and everyone possible to corroborate your information, all while attempting to unearth derogatory information you may be hiding. Never lie. The whole point is to identify potential sources of coercion for you, and by lying about it you're essentially saying &quot;I'm super not okay with anyone knowing this about me&quot; to an adjudicator.</p>
<p><strong>AND A MESSAGE TO ALL MILITARY RECRUITS: DON'T LET YOUR RECRUITER FUCK UP YOUR SF-86</strong> Make sure you answer the questions fully and with full honesty, and don't listen to them tell you something doesn't apply or convince you to leave that time you smoked pot off your security questionnaire. Spoiler alert: they have a quota and just want you in as fast as possible. Double spoiler alert: <em>it doesn't matter</em>. If I had a nickel for every recruit I've interviewed that had either smoked pot or <em>wasn't even a citizen of the United States yet and their parents were illegal residents</em> that was still able to get into the military and still able to get a clearance then I'd have, like... well probably only $5 but still.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When most people think of a background check they think of a simple criminal history check. In reality, a background check is much more than that. It’s the process by which you find your best candidate by looking at, yes, criminal records, but also education and employment history, civil records, references, etc. Each is a very important piece of the puzzle. What does a background check look for? </p>
<p>A background check helps your company stay safe through the criminal history check. It helps ensure that applicants can do what they claim they can through employment and education verification. It verifies that applicants are who they claim to be and aren’t wanted internationally. Background screenings, background checks, pre-employment screenings – call them what you will, they help protect your company, your employees, and your clients. </p>
<p>There is no standard background check package because different industries, and even different companies within the same industry, will have different criteria regarding what constitutes an eligible candidate. Your company should have packages set up based on business necessity, packages that should be different for different types of jobs. Any executive position should be subject to more stringent testing than a basic minimum-wage employee. </p>
<p>The depth of your screening should reflect the risks arising from criminal misconduct in each specific position. When creating the packages, remember that if screening guidelines are too lenient you may hire criminals and welcoming unnecessary risks to your business, but if screenings are too stringent you may miss opportunities to hire well-qualified applicants who pose no threat – and you may even run afoul of the EEOC.</p>
<p><em>How long do screenings typically take and how are they done?</em></p>
<p>As with anything, how long the screenings take depends on which specific service you choose and how that service is done. Many searches simply require the company to enter the relevant information into a database, yielding instant results. However, most services take longer due to the need for a live record search. A few services require a combination of database and live searches and some take a more unique approach.</p>
<p>Instant, database-driven searches include criminal history searches, credit history, name and address history, national security lists, sex offender registry and SSN verification/trace searches, while live searches include county, state and federal criminal history.</p>
<p>Some services require phone interviews. Those include education and employment verification as well as reference checks. How long each of these services takes also depends on a few other factors.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is which company you choose. A company that has an interface with a county will take less time to search that court than a company that has to send someone to the physical courthouse. Then you have to consider where you are requesting the information from. Records from a Department of Motor Vehicles can be accessed instantly in many states, but can take three days in others.</p>
<p>The most important contributing factor (aside from how information is gathered) is the difference between hits and clears. For instance, many companies, that run a criminal database check, will know instantly if there is no record. However, depending on the type of search ordered, if the database returns a hit, the information may need to be verified before it can be passed on.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I got my job with the feds with a very low level security clearance, I had federal officer come to my home and interview me, come to my new place of work to interview me, visit my neighbors and interview them about me, and visit my former employers to, you guessed it, interview them about me.</p>
<p>This agent was very personable and did a excellent job of making me feel comfortable.  Which is a tactic to get people under investigation to open up.  When getting a security clearance, it's like /u/NinjaJediSmurf said, it doesn't matter if you've done illegal things in the past.  What matters is that you aren't doing them now, and you aren't lying about your past history.  Don't lie.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I've got a buddy that has a high level security clearance and works for the DoD.  When he got his job, he had two days on the polygraph.  His description of the event sounds very stressful.  He was locked in a white room with sensors strapped to his body facing a white wall.  His interviewer was behind asking a series of question.  It sounded unfun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Like person, decide to hire person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months later after person turns out to be crap, have HR ask if I checked references... did not. </p>

<p>Interview person referred by HR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like person, decide to hire person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months later, person is still good, still forgot to check reference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive smack down by HR</p>
</li>
<li>Rinse, repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>HR usually has fairly good policies regarding reference checks... but... as the hiring manager it is up to me to ensure I follow HR's guidelines provided they are not doing the reference checks themselves. Because we know the details of the job best, we usually check references.</p>
<p>Trouble with references is, it's hard to get useful information from them. If you sucked it doesn't mean your reference will say bad things about you. That being said, if you were awesome, that also doesn't mean references will say nice things about you. In fact, they may say nice things about you to help get you a job because they don't want you knocking on their door again. They may also say bad things about you because when I called, I got the one person in the office that actually hates you. </p>
<p>Hiring good people is really challenging. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg" target="_blank">phase diagram of water</a>, my best guess is that ice VI would form.  However, <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_vi.html" target="_blank">ice VI has a higher density than water</a> at the pressure at which it forms, so it would not actually generate any pressure by forming in the first place.</p>
<p>Perhaps what would actually happen in this thought experiment is that some amount of &quot;normal&quot; ice Ih would form, generating pressure in doing so, until the pressure generated was high enough that ice VI would form, which has the effect of relieving some of the pressure.  In the end a mixture of ice Ih and ice VI is formed with the same density as water at that temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freezing and melting are both very dependent on temperature and pressure. Water can configure itself into around 17 different ways.* The ice we see is Ice I, and there's 2 forms of it. The type of ice will change with changes in pressure. So if you increase the pressure, you might get Ice II. The way we classify ice is in the order that we discovered it. Ice I was the first type we discovered, Ice II is the second and so on. </p>
<p>*I say around 17 because there are some forms of ice that aren't considered &quot;real&quot; Ice, like amorphous ice, which is the most plentiful kind of ice(in the universe). This is because it doesn't have an orderly crystalline structure like the types of ice using the Roman numerals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water has a number of solid phases. The phase that we're used to is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ih" target="_blank">Ice Ih</a> (pronounced &quot;ice one h&quot;). It has a lower density than liquid water - it must expand to freeze. However, at different temperatures and pressures there are different phases of ice. At higher pressures, the water can freeze into a different arrangement that does not need expansion.</p>
<p>You can check out water's full phase diagram here - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(data_page)#Phase_diagram" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(data_page)#Phase_diagram</a> </p>
<p><em>Assuming you put water into a steel cube that could not expand when the water freezes, what would happen?</em></p>
<p>It should also be noted that if the pressure gets high enough, your assumption of &quot;a steel cube that could not expand&quot; falls apart. Steel is deformable. With a high enough internal pressure, a hollow cube of steel will expand or rupture, allowing the water inside to expand into Ice Ih.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://www.usflag.org/uscode36.html#175" target="_blank">Flag code</a> dictates that the blue field should be upper left.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>§175. (i) When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.army.mil/e2/rv5_downloads/symbols/r670_1.pdf" target="_blank">Army Regulations</a> say it should be reversed, to &quot;give the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the
wearer moves  forward.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AR 670–1, 28018 c (2): The full-color U.S. flag cloth replica is worn so that the star field faces forward, or to the flag’s own right. When worn in this manner, the flag is facing to the observer’s right, and gives the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer  moves  forward.  The  appropriate  replica  for  the  right  shoulder  sleeve  is  identified  as  the  reverse  side  flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: to look like you're carrying a real flag as you move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The reason has to do with proper display of the flag.</p>
<p>The blue field of stars should always be in the highest position of honor. When viewing the flag on a wall, the highest position of honor is the upper left when displayed horizontally, and at the top (upper left) when displayed vertically. When displayed on a &quot;moving object&quot; like a person or vehicle, the highest position of honor is the front, and not the rear; so the field of blue should be displayed to the front.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not. US flags don't have a front and back, rather we are accustomed (by heraldry tradition) to viewing them as though the pole is on the left. The flag is always worn so as to be advancing, or carried forward, on modern uniforms. Hence the blue field is toward the wearer's front. On certain uniforms, like USAF flight suits, the flag is worn on the left sleeve and thus is sewn as you're used to seeing. </p>
<p>It was not always this way. On D-Day, the flag on the right shoulder sleeve of US Army uniforms was depicted &quot;normally.&quot; This was reprised in the 2016 Army uniform for the Army-Navy game, which featured such a flag (complete with 48 stars as I recall) on the right shoulder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you pay the same price for a car somebody just bought put 100 miles on it and then turned back in?</p>
<p>What what you're speaking about refers to a time decades ago when the profit margin on cars was up to an average of 17%.</p>
<p>Today most cars are sold at a loss brand new. Most dealerships do not make money on the cae,  they make money financing and fixing them. The average profit on a new car was actually negative from 2004 until 2012. Under Bush,  consumers were being squeezed and car sales slunk..plus there was a lot of shifts within the industry and competitive practices were ramping up. Then Along Comes Google and it's game over for profits in the new car business</p>
<p>In 2012 the average profit on a new car finally turned positive and it was a whopping 120 bucks.</p>
<p>From time to time you'll see people complaining about dealerships and saying if we got rid of them average car prices would drop by $2,000 this is based on that time. Decades ago. The internet has changed everything, leveling the playing field to the Buyers Advantage except when it comes to your trade-in but even then just be smart. Hate to say this but if you want a good deal on a car you got to go to a big city and you got to find the guy that sells the most cars he's the one who gets the best deals from the manufacturer and is willing to lose the most upfront. At the dealership I worked at for about 6 months, they had brand new focuses with an effective price cheaper than used ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if somebody just bought a new computer and within a few days tried to pawn it off on you. Would you take this as a generous offer, or would you assume there's something wrong with it? </p>
<p>Cars might be made in factories, but there are a number of moving parts that can go wrong, or worse, it could be a lemon. Within those first moments of going off the lot, you can only have things go wrong. If you want to resell it, why? You obviously aren't going to get the same price you bought it for, so you aren't trying to flip it for profit. Statistically speaking, there is something wrong with that car. </p>
<p>Now lets say you waited a year. The new models of cars have come out and there could be dozens of reason one wants to sell last years car. Even if it was a lemon, the resale value is much higher than it was right off the lot if only because it's more reasonable for somebody to get rid of such a &quot;fine&quot; products. Unless the model in question had several recalls and/or a particularly bad reputation, you can expect a higher resale value than you would get had you sold it right out of the lot.</p>
<p>One last thing of note is, practically everything about selling cars is a headache of many people in the know selling to a customer they hope is ignorant. Sales people will try to mark up everything where they can, well past the actual value of the car, and sometimes up-sell things that are assumed standard in a resell market as &quot;features&quot; to wriggle even more money from customers. It is fairly rare that cars are actually sold at their proper value as even people who are good at negotiating a fair price get fatigued by tenacious sales practices. One of the reasons cars depreciate so quickly, is because they were never actually as valuable as the price they were bought for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The answer to this question is simple. </p>
<p>It was new, it is now used. Simple as that.
Would you pay more or less for a used car that has two owners as compared to one? No. Your previously brand new car has its warranty started, it has guarantee of the condition, nor is there a guarantee of the upkeep of a vehicle, and the carFax no has it listed as a one owner used car. A brand new car has no title issued to it, never sat under that tree dripping sap onto it. Never had a 16 year old kid bang it into the parking barrier at the mall. </p>
<p>You pay a premium to know this car is brand new and that no one has been stuffing their farts into the driver's seat for the time that they owned it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The depreciation is very simple.  Dealers sell cars with a margin to make a profit.  Let's say a dealer buys a new car from The factory for $20k.  They then sell it for $23k, netting a $3k profit.  Now, if the owner comes back the next week to sell it back to the dealer, the dealer might only offer them $19k for it.  Why?  Well it's intrinsic value was only $20k new and it now has to be sold as a used car, so they discount it $1k.  The dealer is no going to pay retail for the car because they need to make a profit on it.  So the buyer decides to sell it privately, but consumers don't want to pay retail prices for a used car.  Even if you mark it down to $22k, a private buyer says &quot;well, for only $1k more I can have a brand new car and know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  So you may get more than the intrinsic value of $19k, but it will never be what you paid for it new.  You might only sell it for $20k.</p>
<p>Of course, the markup is different on different vehicles.  High end, low production, exclusive cars like a Ferrari have a much higher markup when sold, so the depreciation is much higher.  The markup is higher because fewer cars of that model will be sold, so the margins have to be higher to actually make a profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is much more simple than folks realize and no one I've seen has touched on it yet.<br />
Some of the largest volume purchasers of cars are rental companies (Enterprise/National, Hertz, Budget, U-Haul).  Enterprise alone maintains a fleet of over 1-million vehicles which cycles regularly.  </p>
<p>All of these companies have business models that involve buying new cars at an extreme discount renting them out for 1-2 years (sometimes more, sometimes less) than reselling.  The resale happens sometimes through their own lots, but more often through wholesale options auctions.<br />
Wholesale auctions like <a href="www.manheim.com" target="_blank">Manheim</a> are the primary source of inventory for both used car lots and used cars new car dealerships (no dealer likes to admit this).<br />
So basically at any given time there is a flood of 1-2 year old cars available for resale at all time over-supplying and lowering price.  </p>
<p>You'll notice cars that don't often get used by rental industries (Exotics, High-option package vehicles, cars with manual transmissions, etc...)  tend to hold resale values better than say a Chevy Impala or Chrysler Sebring.       </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the fact that humans are predisposed to feel more affectionate towards &quot;cute&quot; animals, and feel disgust for those that look alien. <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cuteness" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cuteness</a></p>
<p>Not only have scientists identified the specific facial traits that trigger &quot;caretaking behavior&quot;--big eyes, bulging craniums, retreating chins--dogs and cats have evolved to elicit it. For example, cats purposefully utilize the frequency range of a baby's cry when attempting to solicit care. <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)01168-3" target="_blank">http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)01168-3</a> And over time dogs have evolved to appear more like human babies over years of humans preferring dogs with paedomorphic facial expressions. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082686" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082686</a></p>
<p>The examples of preferential treatment by humans for &quot;cute&quot; animals is extensive. You can simply look at the types of animals on the endangered creature list, or which animals get funding for research.  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/trends-and-biases-in-the-listing-and-recovery-planning-for-threatened-species-an-australian-case-study/DC0D198D842AE8963787297094B8C263" target="_blank">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/trends-and-biases-in-the-listing-and-recovery-planning-for-threatened-species-an-australian-case-study/DC0D198D842AE8963787297094B8C263</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been shown that this bias isn't learned, but is hard-wired into our brains. The following study found that kids ages 3-6 showed the same preference for animals with infantile features, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019884/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019884/</a></p>
<p>At the same time that dogs and cats have evolved to ingratiate themselves to humans, humans have evolved to utilize dogs and cats to fulfill social and psychological needs. This study of the human-animal bond focuses on neuroendocrine regulation--primarily oxytocin secretions--and the considerable health benefits that result. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4782005/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4782005/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I remember a study which ranked self reported fear of a load of animals and it found those with different eyes to us, more legs or different body shape, fur, slime, speed of movement, unexpected movements and fast movements evoked more fear. </p>
<p>Various combinations came out as scarier or more frightening and I believe spiders, having many more eyes, many more legs, quick and unexpected movements results in significant difference to us, therefore evoked a greater fear reaction in those polled.   </p>
<p>Edit :This got more attention than I expected, the study is by Bennett levy and marteau if I remember correctly, I'll try and find a link to some details about it.  </p>
<p>Edit 2 : lots of good questions for a good discussion but sadly I'm not a psychologist! However we have to remember that multiple other factors will factor into phobias and fear responses, including past experience and learned behaviour, as well as cultural factors too. This studies results are by no means the sole answer to this question!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It would be interesting to see the results of the same experiment with very young children. </p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>....<em>Peterson and colleagues examined the degree to which specific areas of the brain involved in fear processing and deciding how to respond to a phobic image were activated when someone was consciously aware or unaware of the spider image. Interestingly, they found that even though non-conscious awareness didn't register in a way that could be brought to mind or was cognizant, this type of exposure caused subliminal fear responses to skyrocket.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few Reasons - </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your body produces the hormones that signal that &quot;full&quot; feeling when you're asleep. If you don't get enough sleep, your body can't regulate your metabolism as well as it would on a sufficient night's rest. </p>
</li>
<li>You didn't sleep enough last night.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's because too little sleep has been linked to higher levels of the hormone ghrelin, which is responsible for triggering hunger.</p>
<p>And to make matters worse, when you're sleep deprived, you'll usually crave carb-y, calorie-laden foods, as your body searches for alternate sources of energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Food During the Day</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't eat enough during the day, or if you eat at the wrong times, you might not have enough calories to sustain your body while you sleep. For example, if you eat dinner early, you're more likely to wake up hungry before breakfast, according to Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian, writing for NBC Today. Eating dinner later can help you make it all night without a growling stomach. Including fiber in your evening meal or nighttime snacks can also help, Bauer notes. Fiber fills your stomach and digests more slowly, so you feel full longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're actually just thirsty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A little mild dehydration can give you a sluggish, fatigued feeling -- and, just like when you're sleep deprived, the body often turns to calories for fuel. That means, then, that you may experience what you think is hunger, when it's really thirst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
