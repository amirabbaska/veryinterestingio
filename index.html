		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) the singularity is not a 0-dimensional point. That's true of non-rotating black holes. Rotating black holes probably don't even have a singularity (aka as ringularity since it would be a ring) even at a semi-classical level: the singularity lies in an interior region of the solution which we know cannot be trusted to model actual rotating black holes.</p>
<p>2) the singularity does not &quot;carry&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; the properties of the black hole such as the mass, the linear and angular momentum, the charge... it will just lead to confusion to think in these terms. How/where exactly a black hole &quot;keeps&quot; these things is a subtle and counterintuitive matter. </p>
<p>The technical answer is these properties are sort of &quot;delocalized&quot; in the case of a black hole and the black hole itself is essentially a type of topological defect. That would be a very agnostic, strictly classical answer. But that's close to impossible to explain for me.</p>
<p>A simple, bizzarre and not really that wrong at all way to imagine a black hole is as a very thin 2-dimensional membrane lying above the horizon. This membrane is hot and has energy, so mass; when stuff falls in it gets burnt by the membrane and adds to its energy/mass. When charges fall onto the membrane, the membrane (which has a sort of electrical conductivity) absorbs and dissolves charges and become charged itself. And finally, it can acquire linear or angular momentum when it's provided by falling objects, and can start moving, or rotating (and become flattened). This is a quantum-gravity- (and string-theory-) inspired picture, but for what regards classical gravitation it gives the same answers as the &quot;standard&quot; one, and might help clarify a lot of the trickiness of black holes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are infinitely displaced from the singularity in terms of how much our space/time is warped. </p>
<p>Meaning if something falls into the event horizon, if we could see inside, from our point of view theoretically it should never reach the singularity. </p>
<p>Imagine the ship in interstellar that goes to the planet where 1 hour there is 7 years on Earth. </p>
<p>Ok, imagine it goes a bunch closer to the black hole. So 1 hour = 70 years on earth. </p>
<p>Now, imagine it keeps going closer, </p>
<p>it will hit 1 hour on the ship = 700 years
1 hour on the ship = 7000 years
1 hour on the ship = 70000 years</p>
<p>up and up and up forever before reaching the singularity.....</p>
<p>From the point of view of an observer outside of the event horizon the behavior can be totally different from the point of view from inside the event horizon. The black hole may have a singularity by it's own internal math and view point - but from our point of view outside it doesn't seem to me like it can have a singularity. </p>
<p>It's called a dual nature. Anything infinitely displaced by relativity aught to have a dual nature. Light is another example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black Holes are not necessarily singularities. We know that an event horizon is where the escape velocity reaches the speed of light. That's pretty much it. The rest is theory, some of it very well reasoned, but we can't really verify any of it experimentally (although we can verify other parts of those theories in certain ways, such as at the LHC). That does not necessarily mean there is no internal structure.</p>
<p>For one, spacetime itself could retain some sort of structure as we do not know what happens to it in such a situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more interesting, is that if matter has structure below the quark, or perhaps at a scale below the Planck length, then it's possible there are iterations of black holes. Let me elaborate:</p>
<p>Neutron stars are extremely dense objects made when the &quot;pressure&quot; becomes enough to crush electrons and protons together. Then they are held apart by neutron degeneracy pressure (again, not really pressure but an outward force resisting gravity). When/if the gravity becomes strong enough the neutron star can then collapse further.</p>
<p>The main idea seems to be that neutron stars collapse into black holes. Pulsars (a type of neutron star) can occasionally spin so fast they resist collapse until their spin slows down enough, we think. This does not mean they collapse into a singularity; there is no complete explanation for exactly what happens at this point.</p>
<p>Another thought is that the step beyond neutron stars is a quark star, which would be incredibly dense (10cm across or so).</p>
<p>I wonder if maybe quark stars aren't a type of black hole, or perhaps matter has structure more fundamental than quarks and will resist being crushed at a certain point. We simply do not know so it's all speculation.</p>
<p>I do find it interesting, however, that the external effects of a stellar-mass black hole and a supermassive black hole are generally the same if radically different in scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I am an anaesthetist. I am very happy to see a question I am qualified to answer.
The principles behind pulse oximetry are some of the required knowledge for basic anaesthetic trainees.
As has been outlined, the pulse oximeter uses two wavelengths of light: 660nm (red light) and 940nm (infrared light). These lights correspond to the maximum absorption by deoxygenated haemoglobin and oxygenated haemoglobin respectively. This light shines through a finger, toe, lip, ear (and sometimes hands and feet for neonates) and is picked up by a detector on the contralateral side of the probe. The ratio between the two wavelengths that is transmitted gives an R value (Red/Infared) which corresponds to an oxygen saturation. An R value of 1 is equal to roughly 80% SpO2. Oxygenated blood absorbs more infrared light and deoxygenated blood absorbs more red light.
I hope that explanation helps a bit. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095461111300053X" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=332" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple of articles that explains the science and limitations of oximetry in more detail. Thanks for letting me answer.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The instrument that reads the oxygen levels of your blood (referred to as SpO2) is called a pulse oximeter. It shines different wavelengths of light (usually IR and red) through your finger to find how oxygenated your blood is. How does it do this? Hemaglobin, which is the protein in your red blood cells that binds oxygen and takes it to your cells, can absorb light (like most materials). How much light it can absorb depends on the wavelength of light shining on it and whether the hemaglobin is holding oxygen or not. A sensor on the other side of your finger (a fancy lil thing called a photodiode) will detect how much light makes it through your finger. Plug these absorption values into an equation and you can figure out how much of your hemaglobin has oxygen in it. Hopefully if you're healthy it will be between 95-100%, although 100% SpO2 is not that common. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biomedical engineer. Everyone correctly describes that light of 2 specific wavelengths is shone through the finger. The amount of light absorbed by deoxy and oxygenated blood is different. The relationship between the amount of absorbance is measured and this provides the oxygen saturation levels.</p>
<p>However, the amount of light absorbance isn't directly related to the O2 level. Instead, there have been data tables created that relate the O2 levels to the light absorbance... this was done EMPIRICALLY, i.e. by experiment, and not by theory. So the device is just correlating the light information to pre-programmed data table relationships. The relationship breaks down somewhere around 80% and below, and thus the pulse oximeter can no longer properly measure oxygen levels below this percentage. Regardless, the device would have started beeping an alert by then anyway. </p>

As meat ages it turns brown from oxidation. The oxidation process is a result of the bound iron molecule in myoglobin going from the ferrous to ferric form. This produces what is called metmyoglobin. Metmyoglobin is the cause of the characteristic brown coloration of meat that occurs as it ages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Breathing has 2 components: autonomic control and plain physics. The autonomic control center regulates your breathing frequency/intensity depending on CO2 levels in your blood by stimulating your breathing muscles in a very efficient way, taking maximum advantage of the physics of airflow. When you're breathing manually, you interrupt the respiratory center and you have to force the breathing muscles to contract by yourself</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;The definition of masculinity and femininity is inherited by the generation of that time and is manifested by the attire of infants (Maglaty, 2011). In a June 1918 article of the trade publication Earnshaw’s Infants Department it dictated that the “generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls.&quot; The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” In the current 21rst century Infants whose sex is ambiguous are identified by the colors of their attire it is common knowledge that pink is for girls and blue is for boys (Ben, 2007).&quot;</p>

I have only just recently began to wonder what a sense of smell actually feels like. Is it like taste, but instead of &quot;feeling&quot; it in your mouth, it's in your nose? How far away can you smell things?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much impossible to explain what it feels like, but the basic idea is that you have receptors that respond to the presence of various chemicals, more strongly to some of them than to others. Things have a smell because of trace amounts of chemicals circulating in the air, and getting picked up by these receptors. You could say it works like a combination of hearing (transmission via air) and tasting (biochemical receptors). The way the sensation works is closer to tasting, I guess, but there are way more smells than tastes.</p>
<p>Because air carries these chemicals around, how far away you can smell things depends on airflow/wind, the concentration of the chemical at the source, and how easily your receptors can detect the chemical in question. For instance, smell receptors are <em>extremely</em> sensitive to the stuff they mix into domestic gas, ethyl mercaptan, basically one milligram per tonne of air can be smelled. Spill a barrel of that stuff somewhere and chances are people will notice tens of kilometers away (subject to wind direction). Many everyday things carry just a few meters or less, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was once reading a forum post for the game Mass Effect, in which someone was discussing a quote from the game, talking about biotic powers: <em>&quot;it would be like explaining colour to a creature without eyes&quot;.</em></p>
<p>And the forum poster was saying that it's completely possible to do that, by just explaining that certain objects can be differentiated from each other by the visible light they reflect in their environment. And that over the course of your life, you become familiar with the amount of light each item gives off and how it should behave. And can even feel uneasy when you detect a type of light that isn't expected for the object, or that possibility indicates danger.</p>
<p>It is similarly the case with smell. </p>
<p>Just as objects reflect visible light, they also give off a detectable scent into the air. Some objects more then others. And over the course of your life, you become familiar to how things should smell. And can immediately tell when something isn't right (food not smelling the way it should because it was turned), or that possibility indicates danger (the smell of natural gas or other flammable material).</p>
<p>To smell is almost like detecting a different type of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taste is akin to touch; it happens in a very specific location, and only in direct contact. You 'feel taste' with the specific part of your tongue that the thing is touching. </p>
<p>But smell is more like hearing; you don't really 'feel sound' with your ears, it's just something happening outside you. In the same way you don't really 'feel smell' in your nose - your brain maps the sensation to the outside world. </p>
<p>The quality of the sensation itself is perhaps closest to taste; we use it as a much more detailed sense of taste, in fact. When people get a cold and temporarily can't smell much, they complain that they can't taste anything. Which they can, it's just they've lost a good 80% of the bandwidth they're used to. </p>
<p>So yeah... taste-hearing is probably the best analogy I can give you.</p>
<p>As for how far away... it depends on the smell. Again like hearing, some things carry more than others.</p>
<p>A cardboard box has a distinct smell, ferinstance, but unless you're in a room full of them, you have to stick your nose right in it and sniff to pick it up. </p>
<p>On the other hand, some smells you can pick up from across the room or across a whole building, even if they're quite faint. If someone's reheating a dried-fish curry in the common-room microwave in my building, the whole floor will know about it, at the very least. </p>
<p>The scent of wattle (acacia) blossom is famous for its ability to carry; despite being only slightly noticeable even close up... on a warm summer night, you can sometimes still notice it half a mile away. </p>
<p>Also, we adapt to constant smells quite rapidly; we can sit at home all day and not notice anything, go out to the shops and when we come back realize that ew, the garbage needs taking out; the smell built up slowly from a low level, so we adapted without even noticing. Coming in from outside, however... ewww!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not easy to explain. I'd say the closest thing to it is taste. It's like tasting something in your nose, and it can actually affect how you taste food. As for range, it really depends. If you're outside with a breeze, you can smell something pretty far away (like a fire a few miles off) but if you're inside, it's usually just the immediate vicinity</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully you'll find it reassuring that smell is probably the least important sense in day to day life. I like the comparison others have made to it feeling like something between tasting and hearing -- it serves a similar function of detecting chemicals like with taste, but those chemicals are in the environment around you, like sound.</p>
<p>Smell and taste aren't really that strongly correlated. For example, a toasted asiago cheese bagel can have a powerful, repulsive smell, but taste mild in comparison. On the other hand, salty foods don't really have a &quot;salty smell&quot; but can have a strong taste. The big thing here is that we learn to associate smells with tastes. You can learn to like a bad smell if you know what is causing it.</p>
<p>Strong smells can have other effects too. Bad smelling food can make you feel nauseous, strong-smelling volatile chemicals (like gasoline) can make you feel light-headed. Good food smells can make you feel hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
