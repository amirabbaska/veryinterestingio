		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some ways, this is a meaningless question.</p>
<p>The term &quot;noble gas&quot; refers to chemical properties, and element 118 doesn't exist long enough to really do chemistry (in a real, macroscopic sense). Secondly, as you go down the periodic table to heavier atoms, all of the &quot;rules&quot; that terms like &quot;noble gas&quot; and &quot;halogen&quot; are based off of become a lot less fixed. For example, the noble gasses go from &quot;doesn't react&quot; to &quot;yeah, you can make stable compounds of this and put it in a bottle&quot;. By that point, the term itself doesn't mean a heck of a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other commenters have said, it is too unstable to really have chemical properties. Another issue is that with these very large electron clouds, the highest energy electrons begin to behave differently due to relativistic effects and instability. If you have a rock on a hill, it is in a high energy state and &quot;wants&quot; to go to a low energy state, and will do this by rolling down the hill of possible. A small force on the rock causes its position to become unstable and the rock falls down the hill. The taller and steeper the hill, the smaller the force required to destabilize the rock. </p>
<p>The same thing happens (kind of. Quantum effects make it a bit harder to explain) with electron clouds. High energy electrons want to go to a low energy state. However, the lower energy states are already filled in a big atom, so the electrons tend to transfer to other atoms instead. Because of this, it is very possible that oganesson would actually be reactive if it were not so radioactive. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that even with more familiar so-called noble gasses, the distinction is more of a suggestion than a rule. Xenon can be made to react with fluorine, for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by noble gas. If you mean that it's p-orbital is completely filled with electrons, then yes, it would be. The reason most noble gases are not as reactive as the elements near to them is because they are electronically &quot;comfortable&quot; because their p-orbital orbital is completely filled. Conversely, that is why halogens are so reactive. They only need to take one electron away from some other element to become &quot;comfortable&quot; and they really really really wanna become comfortable.</p>
<p>Despite this, as you move down the periodic table, the characteristics that define groups of elements become less concrete. This is because electronic orbitals form father and father away from atomic nuclei as the elements get heavier and heavier. Because of this, the electrons are more able to interact with, and be taken away by, other reactive elements. This is why noble gases like xenon can form compounds with some very reactive elements like flouride.</p>
<p>Due to the reasons stated above, whole element 118 will technically be a noble gas because it's p-orbital orbital will probably be filled, it will be most likely be pretty highly reactive, giving it's classification as a noble gas very little meaning. </p>
<p>Also as some others have pointed out, there's some speculation that it might not even be a gas at STP, so I guess you could call it a noble metal at that point?</p>
<p>P.S. I typed this on mobile, so excuse typos.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: heavy element chemistry is weird and doesn't follow periodic trends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Curious why my answer rec'd 3 negative votes given that it is correct. Note that I do not  assume that the &quot;last&quot; p orbital is filled, or even, crucially, that it makes any sense to put them in order; and am saying that the system that we've arranged the periodic table makes assumptions based on observations that we've made of existing elements of low atomic number. There could be an extension to atomic numbers of any integer, including atoms that have not been observed,  it wouldl be interesting to do this, but it is not likely that the 'aufbau' extends in the combinatorial way it is now sometimes understood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if we compare  the artifically excited states 5g186f147d108p59s versus 5g186f147d108p6  of of Cadmium (or more correctly actual excited states of Cadmium 71) we see that the one with the filled p orbital has higher energy, not lower, than if a 9s  electron is allowed <a href="http://spectrograph.uk/index.html?domults.checked=true&dofine.checked=true&autocorrect.checked=false&finecorrect.checked=false&doConfig("5g186f147d108p59s;5g186f147d108p6",1,0" target="_blank">http://spectrograph.uk/index.html?domults.checked=true&dofine.checked=true&autocorrect.checked=false&finecorrect.checked=false&doConfig("5g186f147d108p59s;5g186f147d108p6",1,0</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Unbilinium has atomic number 120= 8 choose 3 so would be an alkaline earth metal, and atomic number 118 being two less would be a noble gas if the periodic table continued its system...
It also is true, however, that this structure in the periodic table depends on not only Schroedinger's equation (which implies the Hund rule), but also the Aufbau including some aspects of it which are unproven/unexplained. That is, the order in which orbitals tend to be filled as far as we can observe follows a pattern consistent with Schroedinger's equation, but not logically deducible from it, nor are the precise solutions of the equation known.  One can also try Hartree-Fock, but the ground state configuration of atomic number 118 is likely unknown still.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>But seriously, there's a lot less CG in Jurassic Park than most people think.  Today, it's quite common for the only live action element in many shots to be the actors.  If JJ Abrams (hardly the most CG reliant director currently working) were to remake Jurassic Park today, he'd probably feel forced to engage in a full-on CG fuckathon for sequences where Spielberg simply did not have that option.  Spielberg was, instead, forced to use every cinematic trick in the book to hide the short-comings of the comparatively awful CG elements he had available to him.  Dark lighting, practical effects (models and animatronics), clever cutting...  Jurassic Park is a tour de force in all of these things because the CG was still quite primitive.  There are only a couple of full-CG shots that take place in brightly-lit daylight (e.g. the Brontosauraus reveal) and these are probably the weakest shots in the film.  </p>
<p>People today watch Jurassic Park and think they're seeing flawless, state-of-the-art CG, but what they're really seeing is mostly models and animatronics with only flashes of CG to tie the shots together.  The CG was weak, but Spielberg hid it's weaknesses like the master he is.  </p>
<p>Bonus example:  Consider the cup of water in the Jeep when the T-Rex is first approaching. </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One other issue that was initially seen as very small turned into a big puzzling problem. As the T-Rex approaches our main characters, we hear it before we see it. In particular, we see a cup of water start to form “rings” from the T-Rex’s approaching footsteps. Spielberg got the idea after listening to loud music in his car and seeing his rear-view mirror vibrate from the heavy bass. He quotes, “I was on my way to do storyboards for Jurassic Park and I never forgot what it looked like when the bass rhythm went off. I thought in the middle of storyboarding ‘hey wouldn’t it be cool if, when the T-Rex began to approach, the low-end vibration of all that tonnage hitting the ground was causing these little concentric circles.’” The crew thought the gag would be really simple to pull off. As it turned out, however, forming these “concentric circles” proved to be much more arduous than anticipated. Everyone on the production team was puzzled. Sound engineers, physics specialists, and wave tank generators were called in and used to try to achieve the circles, but to no avail. Finally, a solution was found. Michael Lantieri, who was part of the special effects team, quotes, “The night before the shot, I’m at home and I’m still playing around and I took a guitar that I had at home and set a glass of water on the guitar and plucked the string, and it vibrated and did it.” So in the end, the gag was achieved by feeding a guitar string from the cup through the tour car down to the ground, where a guy laying under the vehicle plucked the guitar string (Jurassic Park DVD).</p>

<p>Directors often have a vision and go to great lengths to see it realized.  However, I guarantee you that Michael Bay isn't going to call in physicists to help him make concentric rings in a cup of water (or to make realistic action scenes, apparently).  He's just going to CG that shit and, most of the time, people won't even notice.  CG has gotten really good at fixing seemingly small things that cause great pain for the production crew.  I don't point this out to denigrate CG or directors today (except maybe Michael Bay), but rather, to illustrate how impressive it was for a director like Spielberg to pull off a film like Jurassic Park that still holds up so well, in spite of the technical limitations of his day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of a number of factors. For starters, there was a great lack of faith in CGI's ability to produce realistic creature effects. CGI had been used in movies since at least the 70s but never to create convincing lifelike creatures. As a result an extraordinary amount of care was taken to hide the imperfections in the CGI.</p>
<p>Secondly, Jurassic Park had a big name director and a big budget. It could afford to take the best from both worlds. It used physical effects for the shots where those would work best. In a lot of the close ups where you can't see the entire animal but just snapping jaws, lunging claws and stomping legs, animatronics were used. They have a real world presence which means they reflect real light, have real texture, real fluids and give the actors and environment something real to interact with.</p>
<p>Vice versa, animatronics tend to be bad at convincing and lifelike motion. So for the full body shots where dinosaurs are walking, jumping and running in full view, CGI animation is used where the animator has much more control than someone using a mechanical puppet.</p>
<p>And because the effects team was very concerned about making sure neither type of effect didn't stuck out like a sore thumb, a lot of care was taken to try and mask the way the effects blended with the environment. That's why the T-rex escapes it's paddock at night in the pouring rain for instance. Rain, fog, refracted light, shadows, lots of stuff to help hide any imperfection in the effects.</p>
<p>But more than anything, what helps sell the effects is 'movie magic', nothing more than basic psychology. Jurassic Park went to incredible lengths to convince you that the dinosaurs are real animals both before the fx works starts and during. Let's look at the T-rex for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your first introduction to the T-rex is... nothing. The characters sitting bored in the car while the rex hides in the jungle. A very recognisable feeling for anyone who has visited the zoo.</li>
<li>There's a lot of minor interaction between the dinosaurs and their environment that isn't relevant to the story but extremely relevant in convincing the viewer that they're real. For example...</li>
<li>The T-rex eats, like any other animal. It eats a goat and just for good measure it drops a goat leg on the car. Physical interaction between the rex and it's environment.</li>
<li>You see the rex's little forearms testing the fence, pulling on the wires before you see the wires snap one by one as he pushes his body against it out of view. Again physical interaction with it's environment.</li>
<li>And they do this over and over. The vibration of it's step makes the glass of water ripple. It's feet sink into the soaked mud when it walks, leaving footprints that fill with water. It's pupils dilate when Timmy shines the flashlight into it's eyes. It's breath blows off Grant's hat.</li>
<li>The rex acts like an animal too. It get's distracted by the tire on the wrecked car. It follows the dominant motion of Ian's flare. It's not a monster, it's an animal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over and over Jurassic Park reinforces the appearance that these animals are having a real physical impact on the world around them. It makes the viewer want to believe. Looking at monster movies in the decades after, most movies simply don't take this much work to establish their creatures are real. Occasionally monsters fight the protagonists and that's it, none of the build up.</p>
<p>And part of movie magic is also that if you convince the viewer once, he'll want to believe later. Stan Winston once pointed out that in the gallimimus scene in broad daylight, the rex looks like a rubber toy. But after the amount of work put into the rain storm escape scene of the rex, the viewers already believed it was real and they didn't notice it looks a lot worse in the daylight scenes later in the movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the big primary factors that makes a CGI effect look real to the human eye is the way that light reflects off the generated object. The human eye is really good at noticing when an object is CGI when there is a lot of light illuminating it. </p>
<p>The visual effects team working on Jurassic Park understood this, so to compensate for the issue they tried to put their CGI characters in the dark. </p>
<p>Additionally, many of the scenes switch between puppet and CGI. For example, the T Rex scene switches between a giant T Rex puppet and a CGI object.  The Raptors in the Kitchen scene is the best example. It's harder to notice the raptors are CGI because the room is dimly lit. And the character switches between CGI and puppet at different camera angles. </p>
<p>The fast switching between the puppet raptors and the CGI raptors in the kitchen is very deliberate. Because it tricks your brain into not noticing the CGI character as much. </p>
<p>The visual effects team was so cautious with CGI at the time that they avoided using it only in cases where a puppet character would be impossible. The hydraulic T Rex they built was supposed to be impossible to make, as no one had made hydraulics that could respond as quickly as they needed the character to move. </p>
<p>But they were able to overcome some engineering hurdles by using a special fluid in the hydraulics. </p>
<p>So that should be some indication of just how much effort went into producing puppet characters, before resorting to CGI. </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>Woke up this morning and found my top comment of all time is about Jurassic Park. I'm really super ok with this. Apparently some people think I sounded smart. </p>
<p>I've never worked in the film or visual effects industry. I'm just a nerd with a huge love for Jurassic Park. And I've watched a LOT of behind the scenes for the movie.  </p>
<p>Many people have pointed out that there are obviously scenes where dinosaurs are in the broad day light. I didn't mention these because I don't feel like they hold up nearly as well. And I hadn't given those scenes as much thought. </p>
<p>But as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rlr3Lzvqog" target="_blank">Kaptain Kristian</a> points out in his nice little video, Spielberg had a lot of other ways to hide the weaknesses in Jurassic Park. He used cinematography to give the dinosaurs perspective and dimension so that they would seem believable. Not to mention that seeing the actors on screen react to seeing the dinosaurs makes us see them as more believable creatures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the computer graphics, Spielberg originally wanted to avoid them and use stop motion and puppetry instead.  It took a lot to convince him.</p>
<p>Even so, most of the dinos you see are puppetry, models, and robotics. Most of the CG dinos were intentionally kept in conditions that were difficult to see. Dinos in the rain, dinos in the distance, dinos running quickly or jumping out.  </p>
<p>There were very few scenes where the CG dinos were up close and personal.  Thanks to that, those few scenes had the dedication of the entire crew.  Modern movies have an enormous budget for computer graphics, but the cost per second is rather low because they are everywhere in the movie.  Jurassic Park spent a fortune on computer graphics, but because they had so few scenes of them the investment per second is quite high.  Each brief scene was meticulously reviewed and brought to exacting standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You only notice CGI when it's bad. Or when it's the focus. </p>
<p>Take a look here: <a href="https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/movies-before-after-green-screen-cgi/" target="_blank">https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/movies-before-after-green-screen-cgi/</a></p>
<p>The Boardwalk Empire one with the boats, looks really well done. But it still seems a bit off. Because it's a major focal point. </p>
<p>Take a look at the Life of Pi set. The one where he's standing on the boat seems a bit off, but that's from the tiger. The sky and sea look well done. That's because they're not the focus of the shot.</p>
<p>Now, for Jurassic Park. There's some scenes where the cgi does fall flat. And falls just to the bad side of the uncanny valley. The brontosaurus in particular. But, the night scene with the trex looks great. But, if you look close there's not too much separating the quality of the cgi. What separates the two scenes is the intent behind the use of the cg. With the bronto meaning to wow the audience and the TRex showing us the fear of the characters. Also, the dim lighting helps.</p>
<p>Another things Jurassic Park has going for it is the uncanny valley point is so shallow. We've never seen (at least most of us, looking at you roswell) a dinosaur in real life. So we can accept it more readily. However, faces, tigers, boats, water, etc. we've all seen at least video of. So the valley is set much deeper. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole of mass less than around .02 milligrams or so would have a Schwarzschild radius of around a Planck length or less.  At this scale, general relativity cannot be trusted; we need a theory that incorporates general relativity and quantum field theory.  Thus, at the very least, we can say that such a black hole could not be described by general relativity.  </p>
<p>But we can go further.  Quantum mechanics tells us that an object with such a mass would have a Compton wavelength greater than its Schwarzschild radius, which would make it not possible to constrain this mass to be in a small enough region to form a black hole.  It is reasonable to expect this to hold even in the eventual quantum theory that incorporates gravity, and if so, that would preclude the formation of a black hole with such a mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/ramblingnonsense has a good ELI5 explinaton <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5289p0/time_crystals_objects_whose_structure_would/" target="_blank">HERE</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is about what happens to things when you take all their energy away. Think of it like dropping something on floor.</p>
<p>Many things fall down on one side or the other when you drop them. The way that the thing falls is called its resting or ground state. Figuring out what makes these things fall on one side or the other can help you learn about the object as well as the floor.
Sometimes things don't literally fall, but still have ground states. Magnets sort of pick one side to be north and the other side to be south. That's their ground state. Learning why they do this is hard and has taken a long time. Because magnets always have a north and a south pole, they are called asymmetrical, which just means they don't look the same on both sides.</p>
<p>Crystals also have asymmetrical ground states. As a crystal reaches its ground state it always has some bits that are pointy and some bits that are smooth. It's not the same on all sides, so it's asymmetrical, just like the magnets.</p>
<p>Lots of things in nature have asymmetrical ground states, but they all have one thing in common: they don't move. You have to give them some energy to make them move or to change their ground state.</p>
<p>Now some people think that there might be some weird objects that have asymmetrical ground states across time rather than space. That's what they mean by time crystals. An object like that would be interesting because, to us, they would look like they are moving in their ground state without any extra energy! Imagine if you dropped a die on the ground but instead of landing on a side, it landed on one corner and just spun forever. That's how weird these things are!</p>
<p>Because this is so hard to explain, these scientists spent most of their time just trying to define what such a weird object would look like and how you would know it when you found one. Once they did that, they used supercomputers to predict where you might find them, if they exist.</p>
<p>So far, no one has actually seen one and a lot of people think they can't exist. But now we might know where to look to see who is right!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Had I realized how fast this was going to blow up I'd chosen my words a bit more carefully! The bit about the die landing on its corner and spinning isn't meant to be a literal representation of what a time &quot;crystal&quot; would do. The article states that the ground state of such an object might be something that moves in a circle rather than sitting still. The other example they give is of a particle that oscillates despite not receiving any additional energy. I suspect (although I don't know) that classical physics probably prevents &quot;broken time-translation symmetry&quot; from working at scales big enough to see and interact with; we're talking about quantum properties here. The example with the die was merely to demonstrate the counter-intuitive nature of the phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I see a lot of people are confused about the ramifications of this concept. <strong>This is not a perpetual motion machine.</strong> This is a ground state; by definition, <strong>there is no energy in the system to extract.</strong> You couldn't get energy out of it any more than you could get energy out of a rock sitting on the floor.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a mechanism for holding on to the conversation ball. By using discourse markers and vocalised pauses ('like' and 'y'know' vs 'er' etc) we indicate that we're still speaking and please would the other person wait until we're done. Essentially it's a way to indicate whose turn it is to talk, without losing our place.</p>
<p>It's noticeable that if we intentionally don't use them, unless our conversation partners are good at reading nonverbal cues we'll probably be interrupted more often in pauses.</p>
<p>One of the reasons people who don't use discourse markers sound 'smart' is because the only way to achieve that without constantly being interrupted is to think fast and keep talking. Refer to the BBC programme 'Just A Minute' for examples of that skill being demonstrated with punishment for failure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Knowing a system is democratic doesn't tell you much about its morals. That comes from the voters in the democracy.</p>
<p>And if you think it's horrible that a majority in a democracy can do immoral things, consider that other systems don't even need to get the majority on board for that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Your first thought is correct, a constitution will typically establish basic rights that a mere majority can overrule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But leaders elected by the majority can amend the constitution and make new laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It typically takes a lot more than a majority to amend a constitution.  In the US, the primary amendment process requires a 2/3rd majority in both houses, and then 3/4 of the state legislatures.  If the 13 smallest states (less than 10% of the population) opposed an amendment, it wouldn't pass.</p>
<p>But yes, at the end of the day, a democracy would allow a very large majority to murder off a small minority.  This is known as the <em>tyranny of the majority</em>.  This is a key concern in political science, finding a government that minimizes both the tyranny of the majority and the tyranny of the minority.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concentrations found in the current era are largely due to industrial pollution. Burning coal, without adequate scrubbers and controls, releases large quantities of heavy metals into the atmosphere, which in turn falls on the ocean, and works its way up the food chain.</p>
<p>The other issue is that most of the fish that we eat are the predators of the sea (Tuna, Salmon, etc...) so the metals that were initially consumed/absorbed by the plankton work their way up the food chain and concentrate in the local alpha predator.</p>
<p>However, even without the industrial pollution, it's likely that there would be detectable levels of heavy metals in these predator fish. Mostly for two reasons, the first is that the detection equipment is extremely sensitive, so it can detect things well below dangerous levels.</p>
<p>Secondly, it isn't uncommon to find heavy metals and other toxic materials, leaching into the water system naturally. I have been peripherally involved in a mine site remediation project, and one of the interesting side-notes of the project is what was in the river water upstream of the mine vs down stream. For example, there are detectable amounts of Arsenic in the water, but the levels are the same up and downstream. Somewhere, in the valley, there is an orebody exposed to a creek that contains Arsenic. It makes sense, as the valley is likely heavily mineralized to begin with, otherwise there wouldn't have been the orebody that was mined out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>I assume that the reader is familiar with the idea of extrasensory perception, and the meaning of the four items of it, viz., telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and psychokinesis. These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual scientific ideas. How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very difficult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these new facts in.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to /u/gammbus's comment:</p>
<p>Rhine's work on ESP was very high profile at the time, at a respected university (Duke), and was supposedly done by careful scientific method with good statistical analysis -- the methodology was in fact deeply flawed in many ways, but that wasn't obvious at the time.</p>
<p>(After years of thorough critique, much more careful later experiments and analysis were unable to statistically replicate Rhine's positive results.)</p>
<p>Because of this, a lot of scientifically-minded people at the time were at least open minded about Rhine's work, who otherwise would have dismissed the subject out of hand.</p>
<p>A minor example of this is in Robert Heinlein's works; he mostly did very hard science fiction (adhering carefully to known science and engineering), but some of his stories take Rhine's work at face value -- that's not an indication of Heinlein's beliefs, just an example of Rhine being part of the zeitgeist of the time.</p>
<p>Anyway considering how high profile Rhine was back then, I agree that it is extremely likely that this is what Turing had in mind.</p>
<p>And the above context perhaps explains why someone like Turing would be influenced by &quot;obvious pseudo-science&quot;.</p>

<p>Using the standards applied to any other area of science, it is concluded that psychic functioning has been well established.
The statistical results of the studies examined are far beyond what is expected by chance.  Arguments that these results could be due to methodological flaws in the experiments are soundly refuted.  Effects of similar magnitude to those found in government-sponsored research at SRI and SAIC have been replicated at a number of laboratories across the world.  Such consistency cannot be readily explained by claims of flaws or fraud.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The President is the head of the Executive branch of the US government and is in charge of executing the laws through enforcement (the police are an example of the executive branch acting to enforce laws on the state level, the national guard being sent into an area to enforce laws such as the desegregation in Little Rock at the national level). One way the President can enforce/execute the laws is through an executive order. However, because the President is only in charge of executing the laws and not making the the laws (which is left up to Congress), the President needs an actual law (let's call it a &quot;base law&quot;) to attach an executive order to. The President cannot (or should not) just make things up and sign executive orders that mandate things Congress has not contemplated. </p>
<p>In the scenario of the Muslim Ban, President Trump's executive order probably falls under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which is the immigration policy of the US. Section 212 of the INA deals with &quot;Inadmissible Aliens.&quot; That chapter basically lists the situations in which an immigrant will be considered &quot;inadmissible,&quot;- not allowed entrance into the country. </p>
<p>So, it is not completely true that the other two branches of government do not approve of the President's executive orders. The base law must still be passed by Congress, following all of the bicameral steps to become an actual law. The Judicial branch sort of stays out of everything until it is called upon through a lawsuit. In fact, it is a practice of the Supreme Court not to even entertain questions of Constitutionality before a law is passed or has been challenged in a lower court. Neither Congress nor the President can ask the Supreme Court whether a law (and probably an executive order by extension) is constitutional before it has been challenged. In other words, the Supreme Court does not approve or disapprove of laws until it is asked to do so. </p>
<p>In addition, as other posters have pointed out, Trump's order was done under the color of national security. In general, when a law or order has been passed through the proper steps, the Supreme Court will usually defer to the other two branches. For example, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order mandating the detainment of Japanese citizens on the west coast during WWII. When this order was challenged in Court (See &quot;Korematsu&quot;), the Court held that the interment was not a violation of the Constitution because national security is regarded as a higher priority. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It falls under the purview of the President, as it is considered a case of immediate national security.  The precedent was set by John Adams in 1798 as a result of our relations with France.  The Alien &amp; Sedition act gave the president the right to imprison, deport, or refuse immigrants from a nation considered hostile to the US. </p>
<p>First, it is not a &quot;Muslim ban.&quot;  No one is barred entry due to their religious beliefs.  It is a temporary suspension of immigration from countries with a high rate of radicalization into ISIS, which has used the immigration process in the past to get onto US soil.  Immigration from these countries is only expected to last as long as it takes to come up with a thorough and effective vetting process, to determine no ill intent or ISIS affiliation of the person entering the US. </p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this is not the first time the President has suspended immigration from certain countries due to high risk of people immigrating from those countries.  </p>
<p>In 1882, President Chester Arthur suspended immigration from China, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1889 as constitutional.  Justice Stephen Johnson Field wrote, &quot;The power of the government to exclude foreigners from the country whenever, in its judgment, the public interests require such exclusion, has been asserted in repeated instances, and never denied by the executive or legislative departments.&quot;</p>
<p>The immigration act of 1917 was passed by congress which barred immigration from Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>And in response to Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt suspended immigration from Japan, Germany, and Italy with Presidential Proclamations 2525, 2526, and 2527. </p>
<p>This current temporary suspension is due to the same sort of risks FDR was responding to.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So an executive order can say how a particular administration will handle that. </p>
<p>Of course the other two branches can step in. A judge may say that the EO doesn't follow the law like it should and the legislature could pass a law against what the EO does. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The President as head of the executive branch has always had the task of implementing laws passed by Congress. There is never enough detail in a law to put it into practice. The President issues and executive order with sufficient detail that a government department can implement the law. Exactly how much detail is done at what level is negotiable and variable.</p>
<p>President Bush began issuing broader executive orders. The practice continued under more Presidents. conservatives grumbled that Obama was issuing executive orders violating the Constitution. But these orders were carefully researched. None were successfully challenged in a court of law.</p>
<p>As President Trump has shown, executive orders can be issued immediately. The other two branches of government operate much more slowly. Congress can pass more specific laws. Lawsuits can be filed challenging the executive orders. This seems much more likely because Trump's executive orders do not seem to be well researched or even well thought out.</p>
<p>Bur lawsuits take time to file and appeals take a long time to move through the system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
