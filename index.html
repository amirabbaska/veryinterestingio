The bond between the magnet simply is removed. That is essentially what happens with cutting a material. </p>
<p>Edit: Wow guys, thanks for the upvotes! As for people questioning about why paper therefore doesn't bond back together, that is because many other particles get in between the paper pieces, preventing them from completely bonding back together. There are ways to bond materials back together, but those involve energy being used, and vary depending on material. Also, definitely check out the other results that explain much more in depth how this works, this is just a quick analogy for those who want a simple example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a lot of questions. Let's do them one by one.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes. I know it's &quot;intermolecular&quot; not &quot;intramolecular&quot; I messed it up and you're right if you corrected me.</p>
<p><strong>How does cutting something work?</strong></p>
<p>Individual molecules are connected by bonds called <del><em>intramolecular</em></del> <em>intermolecular bonds</em>. These come in a wide variety of types, some more permanent than others. In the case of something like a metal (or any single element bonded to itself many times over) this means there shared electrons forming a permanent bond between any two atoms of the material. In the case of more complex molecules, this means there are weaker bonds holding the material together, either through polymerization, hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, or London Forces (although the last three happen most often in liquids and are fairly temporary bonds comparatively). </p>
<p>Paper is a polymer. You can see the general structure of the main component, cellulose, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Cellulose_Sessel.svg" target="_blank">here</a>. The structures shown in brackets in the previous diagram repeat throughout the material, and connect to a structure of the same type at the ends that cross the brackets. If you expand the idea of what a polymer is to be anything with a repeating unit, then most things can fall into that category (metals are a repeat of the metal atom unit; glass is the repeat of the Silicon Oxide unit). You might notice on the cellulose that it only had connections at either end of the molecule (where it crossed the brackets); other materials can have many more connections between their repeating units (for example, glass can form more <a href="http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/images/glass01.gif" target="_blank">3-dimensional structures</a> that loop back onto themselves, and iron forms a fairly regular <a href="http://previews.123rf.com/images/molekuul/molekuul1301/molekuul130100056/17236567-Iron-Fe-ferrite-metal-crystal-structure-Unit-cell--Stock-Photo.jpg" target="_blank">metallic structure</a>). However, when the material is forming, different <em>grains</em> can form. In polymers like paper and plastics, this means that there are distinct layers and &quot;strings&quot; of polymer can form. In materials like metals or glass this means that several different areas will crystallize independently forming areas that are uniform but which run into areas that are different yet uniform with themselves (you can see the idea of &quot;grains&quot; <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uG35D_euM-0/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> where each area that's shaded uniformly is uniform with itself, but not necessarily oriented the same as the areas directly next to it). </p>
<p><strong>What causes the separation?</strong></p>
<p>Either way, when you cut a material, you're exploiting the fact that there are imperfections in it. In the case of paper this means that you're cutting &quot;between strings&quot; of polymer and occasionally breaking a bond between two pieces of a single polymer string. Picture a big plate of spaghetti, if you push a knife down the middle of the plate, some of the noodles are going to move out of the way and some of them are going to get cut. That's what's going on when you cut paper, except imagine that your paper is about 400,000 noodles wide.</p>
<p>Metals will tend to break along grain boundaries. It's possible to break it where you want instead of the grain boundary, but if you were to just chisel at a metal you'd tend to break along the grain boundaries. When you cut it with a more precise tool (such as a saw) you're relying on the fact that the connections holding any single atom that you're not directly influencing are stronger than the connections holding onto the atoms you are directly influencing. If you extend the Iron structure I linked to earlier further out and imagine you're cutting a swath out of the middle of it, it's easy to see how there are more connections holding the rest of the atoms together than are holding the atoms you're cutting away.</p>
<p><strong>Why are some materials sharper than others?</strong></p>
<p>The issue here isn't <em>sharpness</em> so much as <em>hardness</em>. Hardness isn't particularly well-defined scientifically, although we know it depends on bond strength and geometry. </p>
<p>Bond Strength: </p>
<p>This is the cumulative force holding together the material. It includes all the <del>intramolecular</del> intermolecular forces we discussed earlier. Iron is stronger than paper in part because iron bonds many more times to itself than paper bonds to itself. The energy it takes to remove a single iron atom is much larger than the energy it takes to remove a single cellulose repeating unit because the iron is better held in place. Bond strength also involves the chemistry of the molecules that are bonding.</p>
<p>Geometry:</p>
<p>Triangles are strong. That's why we use them in <a href="https://mathspace-production-media.mathspace.co/media/upload/images/8-Geometrie/8th-geometry-warren-truss-bridge.jpg" target="_blank">bridges</a> so often. A force on any point distributes the force to the two adjacent sides. Thus, if a grain boundary ends in an edge similar to a triangle, it's going to be able to withstand much more force than a grain boundary that doesn't. It's very hard to get a paper polymer boundary that is triangle-shaped, but it's pretty easy to get an iron boundary that is.</p>
<p>If material A has better bond strength and geometry than material B, then material A is harder and will cut through material B. How much harder A is than B determines how many times you can cut through B before your chunk of A is useless as a cutting tool. (When your A and B come together, A does cut B, but B does some damage to A as well, this is why knives dull with use).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Paper (and other materials) are made of small chains called molecules. They are bound very closely together with electrical forces. These forces can give up and those molecules separate from each other when you apply some force like with a scissors. </p>
<p>You cannot simply &quot;glue&quot; the pieces together by touching sides because you need them to be incredibly close together so the electrical force is strong enough to hold them together again. You you could, it would work.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light: Nobody knows. Its a fundamental limit of the universe. When we say &quot;the speed of light&quot; we're referencing light moving through free space or a &quot;vacuum.&quot;</p>
<p>As for sound: The speed of sound has to do with the material that sound is moving through. Sound is made up of waves that propagate (move) through a medium (material). Basically the waves are areas of high energy and low energy, like the crest and trough of an ocean wave. In free space, sound can't exist. The speed of sound in a material is determined by how heavy the the particles of the material are and how dense or closely packed those particles are. For the fastest speed of sound you'd want a really dense material with low particle mass. For the slowest speed of sound you'd want a material with very heavy particles that are not closely packed.</p>
<p>This pattern is because the energy of the particles has to be transmitted through physical contact between the particles. They &quot;push&quot; eachother in the direction the sound is traveling. A heavy particle is hard to push because of inertia so it moves slower, a light particle moves easily. Highly packed particles transfer energy faster because there's less space between them to travel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for any wave to propagate through a medium, that medium has to have some relaxed position, that it wants to return to (equilibrium). </p>
<p>How much the medium wants to return to equilibrium, and how fast it wants to return to equilibrium are what determine wave speed. </p>
<p>For sound, as it is a physical wave, the speed is determined by spring and damping attributes of a material. A soft sponge will have sound traverse slower than a hard steel cube. </p>
<p>It has been observed that in a vacuum, there is a resistance to a change in magnetic field. It was also observed that in a vacuum there is a resistance to changes in the electric field. It was originally believed that these resistances were associated with a medium known as the 'ether', but none has been discovered so far. However, combining the two resistances with induction formulas (also derived from observation), it was determined the speed of the wave solution is c (speed of light). Initially the hypothesis made was that light was this exact wave solution. I don't know off hand, but I'm sure very many experiments have attempted to test this hypothesis, and so far everything agrees. </p>
<p>So at the end of the day, the speeds are what they are based on the nature of the medium (it's just that it appears that light can travel through a vacuum...and that the vacuum possesses certain properties). </p>
<p>Of course, in the light situation, it is not known if the resistances are the cause or the effect of the speed of light... It was observed that the speed of light stays constant regardless of reference frame. The only mathematical solution to keep physics consistent for all observers (since everyone has to agree on exact events), are the Special and General Theories of Relativity. </p>
<p>If you lay out the math for the special theory of relativity, which describes exactly how certain aspects of our local space dilate (time/length/mass), it becomes evident that some aspect of reality scales down actual speed (0-&gt;infinity) to observed speed (0-&gt;c). In that respect, c isn't just the speed of light that everything is clamped to...it's more that c is the upper scale limit, and anything without inertia (such as a photon), will instantly 'accelerate' to 'infinity' (observed to be c). </p>

<p>For there to be a set of laws for electromagnetism that can work in all inertial frames of reference (which it would be since magnets don't change by simply being thrown), there needs to be a finite and specific speed limit. That limit describes the speed at which electromagnetic waves propagate through the universe which includes light. Gravitational waves and other massless particles also travel at the speed of light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is more or less the speed of causality in the universe, and the rate at which it can understand, decode, and change due to spreading of information. </p>
<p>It's not that light only &quot;travels&quot; at the &quot;speed&quot; (in MPH) of light, but, more so that light is limited by the universes fundamental understanding of itself, for lack of a better synopsis. Photons are a timeless particles, they do not experience time in the conventional sense that we do. When a photon is emitted, from it's frame of reference, the distance it is travelling, be it 2 feet or 2 billion light years, is done instantaneously. There is no time between being at point A and point B when measured from the photons reference frame. However, as an outside observer we measure this speed at 299,792,458 meters per second (in a vacuum). </p>
<p>Due to special relativity and time dilation, the closer you travel to the speed of light the slower your reference frame clock ticks. It's a  bit of a pickle to try and explain without using all sort of weird words and quoting theorem and formulae. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light moves at the speed it does because it is the rate at which changing electric and magnetic fields induce magnetic and electric fields, respectively. What's really interesting about light is that, since it's based on fields and doesn't have to move through a medium, like other waves, it's speed is constant for everyone. This means that, if you watch someone riding by in a relativistic train (with a laser pointer), their clock must be moving slower. This leads to all sorts of strange effects and means that the speed of light is the maximum speed at which a causal connection can be possible. We can say now that light can't be faster because relativity demands it.</p>
<p>Light is massless. It carries energy, but it doesn't have mass in the classical sense of the word (Perhaps it's a little more exact to say it has no REST mass). The only way light can have momentum or energy, while still being massless, is if it moves at this maximum speed of causal relationships, or causality (physicists just call this &quot;c&quot;). This arises out of the relativistic definition of energy- a body's energy approaches an infinite scale of its mass as its relative speed approaches c. For a massless body, this energy is zero unless the speed IS c.</p>
<p>As for why the speed of light is the actual NUMBER it is... That's simply because of the values of  fundamental constants of the universe. These are arbitrary (in a sense), so c too is essentially arbitrary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the lights at the beginning were clearly drones and can be individually addressed, I'm going to cover those handheld lights for the people dancing around on the field instead.</p>
<p>There's a number of ways this could be done. Most likely, they set up an array of low power transmitters which send out a unique identifier or broadcasts a carrier on a unique frequency, something like that. The position of these transmitters are all known by each handheld light. The controller inside each handheld light knows, through radio triangulation, where it's own approximate location is, relative to the transmitters.</p>
<p>Next, there's a second transmitter which sends out commands which look like this: &quot;If you are within 3 feet of [x,y], set rgb color to [#ff0000]. If not, disregard.&quot;</p>
<p>I'd love to see a project like this on hackaday. It seems like something they could cobble together out of a bunch of Philips Hue bulbs, a Raspberry Pi, a 3d printer, and a bunch of Arduinos.</p>
<p>tl;dr: It's done with radio and magic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Everytime they take a gulp, they look like they are <strong>rinsing the sample</strong> through their teeth, before spitting it out and rinsing a &quot;reset&quot; cup of water/solution.</p>
<p>The fact is they are swishing and aerating the sample by bobbing the back of their tongue up and down, <em>at the same time</em>, the action <strong>forces some air from the throat into the back of their nose</strong> to taste-smell the sample.</p>
<p>(They aren't gargling/rinsing through their teeth like how you would after brushing your teeth. That rinsing action requires you to block off your throat, which wouldn't help very much in trying to test aroma of beverages. Imagine trying to rinse, but you tense your cheeks and also allow the air to move in and out of your throat instead of blocking it off. That is kind of what they do.)</p>
<p>When your nose is congested, the fragrant air from the throat(which came from the mouth) <strong>cannot reach the smelling parts of the nose</strong>, so much of the aroma and fragrance from your food is lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's bribery when there's a direct quid-pro-quo (exchange of one thing for another thing) and where the causation is such that the payment triggered the official action.</p>
<p>That's what makes regulation difficult, conceptually and practically. If the Koch Brothers donate millions of dollars to the Tea Party, is that bribery because the politicians will, if elected, enact pro-coal and pro-business laws, or did the Koch Brothers simply donate to those politicians who, as a &quot;pure,&quot; unadulterated policy matter favor pro-coal and pro-business law independent of the donations? How do we know that the donations cause the action and the donaters aren't just choosing to donate only to those who agree with them?</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to prove bribery when you're talking about non-policy, ministerial actions, like approving building permits and granting contracts, than it is when you're talking about broad political actions that favor any one group. If Bernie Sanders were elected through the donations of $20 he received from tens of thousands of people, would those people have been &quot;bribing&quot; him when he lowered their relative tax burden by more heavily taxing the 1%?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: A surprisingly wide variety of things done for a politician could count as a &quot;bribe,&quot; but <em>only</em> if done with the intention for the politician to perform a surprisingly narrow set of acts. </p>
<p>According to recent Supreme Court precedent, to be a &quot;bribe&quot;, there <em>must</em> be what's called a &quot;quid pro quo&quot;, i.e., something done for a politician (doesn't have to be a payment directly to him!) to induce him to take some kind of <em>official</em> act. </p>
<p>Let's unpack that a bit, starting with the &quot;something done for a politician&quot; bit. The stereotypical bribe involves handing a politician an envelope full of cash. While that still <a href="http://www.phillymag.com/citified/2016/01/24/maria-quinones-sanchez-profile/" target="_blank">definitely happens</a>, particularly on the state and local level, it's so obvious as to be kind of, well. . . tacky, I guess. In the US anyway, a lot of what goes down in terms of bribery isn't direct payments to the politician as such, but nonetheless involves some kind of favor done for or on behalf of the politician. Possible examples: donations to a favored charity, pulling strings for the politician's kid, getting his wife a seat on some local non-profit board, etc. </p>
<p>What makes the above a <em>bribe</em>, instead of just a friendly favor (&quot;elite&quot; social circles involve <em>tons</em> of mutual back-scratching), is when it's done to induce the politician to take some specific &quot;official act,&quot; i.e., exercise some power specific to their office that only they can exercise. Could be almost anything, depending on the office in question, e.g., voting a certain way on a particular issue, approving an application, awarding a government contract, etc. </p>
<p>But it does have to be an <em>official</em> act. Just because something is a manifest conflict of interest, in an ethical sense, does not make it a &quot;bribe&quot;. There's a whole lot of what could fairly be described as &quot;influence peddling,&quot; corrupt as the day is long, which is still not technically &quot;bribery,&quot; pr even necessarily illegal, as it doesn't involve the official actually doing anything <em>as a function of their office</em>. Making introductions and endorsements? Making &quot;friendly&quot; phone calls to other officials over whom the subject official has no actual authority? Probably doesn't count. Certainly didn't for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/27/politics/bob-mcdonnell-supreme-court/" target="_blank">Bob McDonnell</a>, anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Donations are made to the candidates campaign or a supporting institution (their party, or a PAC or some other independent expenditure). A donation will never legally see a candidates bank account. Donations are regulated heavily and usually publicly disclosed (super PACs don't need to make disclosures). </p>
<p>Most donations are made because the donor agrees with the candidate politically or has a personal relationship with them. Rarely they are made in the hopes of influencing the candidate, but there's no quid pro quo so politicians can ignore or return the donation.</p>
<p>A bribe is given to a candidate or incumbent politician directly in return for some service or action they take while in office. They're illegal, so usually not disclosed.</p>
<p>Edit to further clarify: most states have restrictions on lobbyists making donations to candidates. In my state, they can't make donations to candidates who don't appear on their ballot on Election Day. I assume there are similar provisions made by the FEC for national and congressional candidates but I am not 100 percent sure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bribes are illegal, and campaign contributions are legal.  No, seriously, that's it.  In most countries what US calls &quot;campaign contributions&quot; would be called bribes and be illegal.  The only distinction is an arbitrary line.  In the US, that arbitrary line is that you can give someone money, you just can't tell them what it is you want them to do directly.  That's it.  If Exxon hands a Congressman a pile of cash and says, &quot;open up offshore drilling and we will give you more&quot;, that is bribery and illegal in the US.  If Exxon hands a Congressman a pile of cash and then 5 minutes an Exxon lobbyist walks in and says &quot;open up offshore drilling and we will be grateful&quot;, that is legal.</p>
<p>The simple fact of the matter is that in the US, bribery is legal.  There are limits on how you can bribe.  You have to be coy and not pretend like it is an exchange.  We have a bunch of dumb rituals you need to follow, and sometimes you need to document the bribe.  At the end of the day though, it's a bribe, and it's just how business is conducted in the US.  If you want your congress critter to do something for you, <del>bribe them</del> give them legal campaign contributions and then tell them what you want.</p>
<p>Seriously, there is no difference.  We just don't call campaign contributions bribery by custom.  Lots of other nations just call it bribery.  We could change the law and also call it bribery too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different policies for the usage of nuclear weapons, and most countries have numerous different attack plans within those policies, so there's a lot of possible variation. It's very difficult to say how any war would go without actually having it happen.</p>
<p>The best way a nuclear war could go, and arguably the only way one could possibly be won, would be if somehow you could use your bombs but the enemies couldn't use their bombs. </p>
<p>There's a lot of ways to go about this, but the simplest is to just blow up your enemy's missiles and bombers while they are still on the ground. Once they get in the air they're a lot more difficult to destroy. Because of this, in a nuclear war, the side that shoots first has a big advantage- they start with all their bombs in the air, while the enemy's would all be on the ground scrambling to launch before they're destroyed. This was a big headache during the cold war- there was a lot of speculation that whoever shot first would 'win', insomuch as the war could be won, but nobody wanted to be the one to start it.</p>
<p>That's also the major reason why the US has been hesitant to go to a no first use policy. Think of nukes like guns- you have a big advantage if you can shoot the other guy first.</p>
<p>Another type of Preemptive Strike is a Decapitation strike- basically trying to kill everybody who has the authorization to launch a nuke before they get a chance to launch said nukes. </p>
<p>The counterpoint to this is Launch On Warning. Basically, when you see a bunch of nukes in the air coming towards you, you go ahead and launch everything you have before it gets destroyed on the ground. This has a lot of safety issues- there have been tons of false alarms where we thought attacks were incoming when they weren't. </p>
<p>The backup is a second strike, using hardened assets to retaliate against the enemy. While a lot of missiles and bombs are not able to withstand a nuclear strike, some silos are hardened enough, and there's still the third arm of the nuclear triad- submarines. Even with our technology today, nuclear submarines are very difficult to track and destroy. Even if a nation is turned to ash, their submarines can emerge days or weeks later to retaliate.</p>
<p>Today, if two nuclear powers went to war, there are many ways it could go. It could have a bit of a leadup with conventional warfare followed by the usage of a tactical nuke or two on the battlefield. But eventually one side would launch the first strike.</p>
<p>The first strike would probably be a wave of ground-launched missiles, aimed at enemy missile silos, airbases, centers of government and military control, and anti-aircraft installations, with the principal aim of blunting the enemy's ability to retaliate and block the second wave, made of bombers.</p>
<p>From that point on the targets depend on what the aggressor nation is targeting. Many plans only list military installations, but if a longer conflict is presumed other targets would also be included. First Industrial targets, then population centers.</p>
<p>Important targets would be struck multiple times. I believe Moscow in the cold war was the target of as many as 60 bombs.</p>
<p>If the enemy possesses nuclear submarines, what would follow would be a period of high alert as they are hunted down. It's not impossible that a small number of sub-based missiles could be dealt with through missile defense systems, assuming that the enemy didn't get their ground based missiles into the air to destroy those defense systems.</p>
<p>The initial exchange would take less than an hour. The whole thing would be over in a day or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But the common theory is they really couldn't go to war.  Not conflict,  trade wars and proxxy wars would go up, international sanctions or resolutions to apply pressure and public image.  But as far as rallying the troops. This is why the bigger nations have avoided major conflict with each other since ww2, the nuclear endgame is basically garenteed, especially since most of them are allied in such a fashion that the majority of the world's troops will be involved anyway. </p>
<p>Now a smaller country like north Korea launching a nuke will not likely end the same way. A large country like usa or Russia could respond with enough conventional power to end it just as quickly with less danger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most countries have a No First Use policy. </p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No first use (NFU) refers to a pledge or a policy by a nuclear power not to use nuclear weapons as a means of warfare unless first attacked by an adversary using nuclear weapons. Earlier, the concept had also been applied to chemical and biological warfare.</p>
<p>China declared its NFU policy in 1964, and has since maintained this policy. India articulated its policy of no first use of nuclear weapons in 2003.</p>
<p>NATO has repeatedly rejected calls for adopting NFU policy, arguing that pre-emptive nuclear strike is a key option, in order to have a credible deterrent that could compensate for the overwhelming conventional weapon superiority enjoyed by the Soviet Army in the Eurasian land mass. In 1993, Russia dropped a pledge against first use of nuclear weapons made in 1982 by Leonid Brezhnev. In 2000, a Russian military doctrine stated that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons &quot;in response to a large-scale conventional aggression&quot;.This is because the balance of forces was reversed — NATO is now enjoying a clear superiority in conventional weapons.</p>

<p>That is exactly the point of having what is known as a nuclear deterrent - that is to say the fact that you have a nuclear arsenal basically means that another side who also has a nuclear arsenal will not use them on you because if they do, they will also be annihilated by yous in exchange. This is a doctrine called mutually assured destruction or mad for short. </p>

<p>One side wants to win the war.  </p>
<p>Nukes assure that doesnt happen, so nukes wont be used the way everyone imagines.  </p>
<p>Nukes would be used when one side is so desperate that they dont care if they die too.  By that point there is a huge chance that most of the nuclear capability of a country would already be removed.  </p>
<p>Also, it may not seem like it, but for places like the USA most nukes shot at it wouldnt make it to their target (Which is one of the reasons why countries like the USA and Russia have so many nukes).</p>
<p>It wouldnt be like boom everyone dead.  It would take hundreds of nukes to hit their target to bring something like the US military to its knees.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, your brain works best when it isn't always bombarded with stressors. If you are taking in a lot of constant new information you don't really digest it always, and the very incentive to acquire &quot;new&quot; information and constant stimulation is surrounded by stressors. What is the motivation to live &quot;fast-paced&quot; to begin with?
Which is why there are so many psychological defects in our modern rat-race age... the human brain evolved in an environment where life was very hard but not necessarily &quot;fast-paced&quot;. Many hunter-gatherer tribes don't wake up early and the majority of them take naps throughout the day, now these people may be &quot;pre-logical&quot; but they are walking encyclopedias who know everything there is to know about surviving in their world without reading about it. Furthermore, the human brain has actually shrunk as well. A constant barrage of internal and external stimulation will flood your brain with dopamine and other neurotransmitters but it will also increase your cortisol levels... by racing through life to acquire some invisible goal one realizes that we forget to actually enjoy that life.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What is actually happening there is fundamentally similar to the &quot;after-image&quot; effect.  Your sensory systems are extremely sensitive to <em>change</em>, rather than the actual level of something.  So when you stare fixedly at a blue shape, when you look away, everything will look less blue (and thus more yellow) on that part of your eye for a little while.</p>
<p>There is another illusion in which you stare at a gif in which everything is in constant motion, like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LtUHXpb.gif" target="_blank">this</a>.  (WARNING, probably not something you want to look at it you have photosensitive epilepsy.)</p>
<p>After you stare at the dot in the middle for a while, and then look elsewhere, you will perceive motion where there isn't any, <em>in the opposite direction</em> of the motion you saw in the gif.  </p>
<p>The effect you describe is somewhat similar.  You perceived something moving faster than normal, and afterwards, everything seems slower than normal.  It hasn't actually affected your brain's 'speed of processing', just your brain's <em>perception of how fast things are happening.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you put a cover on the pot you prevent the water vapor that is more hot from leaving the immediate area. Doing this increases the pressure of the air and by extension the water in the pot. This is why if you have stuff in a pot with a cover and you take the cover off a lot of extra steam comes out right away. The water also boils a lot faster for a moment.
The 100 degrees is the average temperature because each water molecule that begins to vibrate at a rate where its temperature is higher than that will evaporate leaving the pot in the form of steam. That is what the bubbles are. They are the overheated water vapor coming out of the pot. Not actually air pockets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>To make things worse, when the whole &quot;fake news&quot; thing got out, it quickly transitioned from a criticism of this blatantly false reporting to an insult lobbed at any news source that disagrees with your preconceptions.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To think rationally you always should assume that you can be wrong, your previous knowledge can be wrong, people giving you information can be mislead themselves or actively trying to mislead you. That's pretty damn hard.</p>
<p>Moreover, all too often there aren't enough facts available to prove any side of the story. Rational thing to do here would be to accept that <em>you just don't know</em> (yet) who's really right, to take note of both opposing views and stay alert for new evidence. But <strong>people are afraid of not knowing things</strong> and therefore often choose the side that looks <em>more probable</em>. Now if there isn't enough evidence then you can't really assign any percentage to probabilities of different scenarios, so instead of being critical people just choose the side they have more interaction with.</p>
<p>Once you have (subconsciously) chosen the side, you don't really examine it critically any more. When some new information comes in you just examine whether it undermines integrity of your previous beliefs. If it does - the rational thing to do would be to <em>rethink your position</em>, but much easier (and much more common) thing to do is to look for ways to dismiss/undermine the new evidence.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> it is hard and time-consuming to evaluate everything critically, often you'll have to admit you just don't know stuff (whether because there are not enough facts available or because you didn't spend enough time researching the problem) and sometimes you'll need to reevaluate everything you know and to change your position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you propose stopping it?</p>
<p>Take, for example, the situation Germany is in at the moment. It's election year in Germany, and the authorities have observed with growing concern the way the Brexit referundum and the US presidential election have unfolded, and have identified as a major problem &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; is fictitious news stories, or at least wildly distorted and exaggerated news stories, which circulates primarily via social media and has a political objective. Some of that comes from obvious sources of propaganda, like the blatantly white supremecist Breitbart News; some of it comes from sources like Russia Today, a TV network that is funded by the Russian government itself.</p>
<p>Their stories, along with stories from more obscure sources, are spread partly by ordinary people on social media reading them, believing them to be true, and sharing or liking them, and partly by bots. In an era when more than half the people in the western world say they get their news from Facebook, this is very troubling.</p>
<p>In view of this, the German authorities are looking into ways of preventing the spread of &quot;fake news&quot; on social media, and have got agreements from the likes of Facebook and Twitter to help them. But how are they supposed to do that?</p>
<p>Do you fine people for failing to fact-check stories they &quot;like&quot; on Facebook? Do you outlaw memes? Do you write algorithms to detect the Russia Today logo in videos so they can be blocked?</p>
<p>In some cases the truth can be hard to ascertain: who is the final authority on what is true and what isn't? In many cases, the truth is misrepresented: it's still true, but taken out of context it's misleading. For example, it is entirely true that birth rates among certain immigrant populations are higher than the average German birth rate, and if you do the calculations on that basis you conclude that within a decade ethnic Germans will be outnumbered by other ethnicities. But that omits a lot of important information (the average age of immigrants, the lack of birth control in their home countries, that kind of thing), and in reality immigrant birth rates drop to the same level as native birth rates within one generation. So, should it be made law that you're not allowed to mention immigrant birth rates unless you cite <em>all</em> of the information? Does this mean that you shouldn't be allowed to make any kind of assertion unless you also present all of the counter-arguments? If you want to say, &quot;Angela Merkel's policies will lead to economic ruin within ten years&quot; you must, by law, add, &quot;according to some leading experts, while other experts say that her policies can only make Germany's economy stronger&quot;?</p>
<p>The more you delve into the complexities of this issue, the worse it gets -- and I haven't even started to mention the obvious pitfalls of government censorship.</p>
<p>At a basic level, you have millions of well-meaning people who don't all have a college education, who aren't experts in economics, politics, statistical analysis, science or journalism, and who therefore just share stuff they feel is important and which seems credible to them because they have no way of judging its authenticity. If you know of a way of putting a stop to that before the German elections this autumn without violating anyone's human rights, the German government would love to hear from you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is...in some small way to become evil oneself. One's standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.</strong></p>
