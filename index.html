<p>None of this, though, changes the NOTES you produce. It changes the character of the sound, but not the actual frequencies comprising the sounds. It's like if you were to put a blanket over a stereo - it sounds different, but everything would still be in the same key. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really simple question which requires a lot of background knowledge in the physics of waves to totally understand, so here's a comprehensive wall of text with everything that you need to know, probably 2 or 3 college courses consolidated into 4 paragraphs or so.</p>
<p>One very important thing to consider when you're determining what something sounds like is its timbre and its pitch. A lot of people have mentioned that timbre is important but what's integral to understanding this question is knowing the difference between timbre and pitch, and also how these are effected by the traveling of sound.</p>
<p>A pitch is determined by the frequency of what we call the &quot;fundamental&quot;. For example, a 440 Hz sin wave creates  A4, or concert pitch. Now if you look at any instrument playing A4, you'll notice that its waveform is much different from a sin wave, and that's where timbre comes in.</p>
<p>Timbre is determined by the ratio of the different harmonics in the sound. A harmonic is the fundamental frequency multiplied by a whole number. We can also call the fundamental the &quot;first harmonic.&quot; Looking at the concert A4 again, the first harmonic is 440 Hz (fundamental X 1), the second is 880 Hz (X2), the third is 1320 Hz (X3), so on and so forth. </p>
<p>Now lets finally take a look at your question specifically. Sound waves have two important measurable properties; frequency and power. Frequency in this case is synonymous with pitch, and power determines how loud the sound is. In terms of the individual harmonics, what we observe when listening to a recording is that the power of the different harmonics has changed, but the frequency has not (or at least not enough to notice, funny enough the human brain interprets 2 frequencies very close together 1 frequency with varying power, called a beat frequency). This is caused by the environment in which the observer observes the sound, as well as the distance from the sounds origin. </p>
<p>We can assume that because your ears are inside your body, and that is where your sound resonates first, that you hear a much different ratio of harmonics than a recording or any other observer outside your body, which can contribute to part of how the sound differs. Also, the time it takes for sound to bounce off of walls and structures creates whats known as constructive and destructive interference, which is a fancy way of saying it makes certain harmonics more or less powerful, changing the timbre of the sound.</p>
<p>None of this, however, effects the frequency in any way. frequency of a sound can only be changed acoustically by changing the speed at which sound travels, which can only be done by changing the medium the sound is traveling in. practically, this could be by changing the content of the air or the temperature of the air. impractically, if you made the sound by vibrating water instead of air (which is bad, it requires breathing in water) then the pitch would be very different to anyone hearing the medium in air.</p>
<p>To recap, The timbre of your voice is different to you than it is to an outside observer because of the time the sound and its reverberations hit your ear as opposed to the observer's ear, but the pitch is not changed because you and the observer are both listening to the sound within the same medium. Quite a bit longer than I was anticipating but here it is, the complete answer to your question!</p>

<p>Edit: Completely forgot about the doppler effect, props to u/pdlourenco for bringing that up on a different thread. If you're moving or the observer is moving it changes the frequency of the wave, which would change the pitch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yesterday I bought some generic sleeping meds from Wal-Mart with my debit card, and now when I'm on YouTube, I'm getting a ton of ads for ZzzQuil. It can't be a coincidence. Only thing I can think of is my debit card is linked to my Amazon account. Amazon is linked to my Google account. Google account is linked to my Youtube account.
I haven't searched for sleeping meds on the internet or anything related to sleeping pills. I'm convinced that Amazon has access to see ANY purchase I make with my debit card and it's sharing it with other companies.</p>
<p>To clarify, I've certainly googled NOTHING related to sleep, and I'm not a member of any kind of store rewards, other than Amazon Prime I guess.</p>
<p>EDIT: Likely solution found -- some users have suggested my sleeping patterns changed. I'm a teacher who usually goes to sleep at 8:00 p.m. because I wake up at 3:30 a.m.  Right now, I'm on Christmas break and have been going to sleep between 1:00 a.m. - 4:00 a.m.  That seems like it must be the reason.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Google has a ton of data on you, and they are constantly gathering more.</p>
<p>Do you own an Android based smart phone that you carry around with you? The amount of information Google can (but not necessarily does) gather about you is astounding. </p>
<p>For starters, the phone knows where you go, how you get there, and even who you are with if they also have a device with them. It can hear everything you say and pick out important words to target advertising. Even without this, Google still knows an awful lot about you by your browsing habits, search queries, and even what times you are browsing the net. </p>
<p>The key to running a successful company is having a deep understanding of the product you are selling. In Google's case, you are that product. Google knows me better than any living person, including myself. They know what type of food I like to eat, where and when I work, what my hobbies are, and even my favorite types of porn. Google can quite accurately deduce what I'm searching for within a handful of keystrokes. It is borderline frightening how much information we freely hand over in exchange for access to their services. </p>
<p>This stuff is only going to get more sophisticated and accurate as time progresses. It is a side effect of the digital era we are living in. </p>
<p>It's also possible that it was just a coincidence. Those things are sure to happen from time to time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I'm lucky enough to be under the president of the company who not only works from home himself 90% of the time but also only scores me on my goals we set out quarterly/annually.  I have a couple guys who work for me who are more task/coverage oriented and I treat them the same. Only difference is I ask them to make sure others whom they work with know they'll be out of office and that there is sufficient coverage (that could be somebody else covering for unexpected work or they take a workstation with them).  There are other managers who give the gears to employees who come in 20 minutes late regularly.  I tell them it's not a production line we are operating. </p>
<p>Most managers think employees will take advantage of the situation. In my experience the employees with the most freedom end up bending over backwards the most for the company. The employees who are on a tight leash put the company on a tight leash.  They'll never become a &quot;company man&quot;.  Manager looks over their shoulder, they pretend to work, manager looks away, they play.  They become disgruntled and are toxic to others around them.  Give an employee crap about coming in late 15 minutes and I guarantee you get no more than two solid hours out of the employee that day.  The first couple hours will be spent sitting at his desk staring at his screen wondering what wrong turn in life he made to end up dealing with your shit. Then he might try to start working but lunch will interfere. After lunch he feels less stressed and gets to work but nearing the end of the day can't help but think about it again and socialize with others about the situation and cause others to be disgruntled temporarily because that means they are subject to the same rules. He then finishes off the day updating his LinkedIn page on his phone while running possible career alternative he has through his head. </p>
<p>In the end great workers will continue to be promoted as shitty managers and hire shitty people who they'll blame is the reason employees can't have freedom. If it's not part of the culture now, it won't change. You'll have to find an employee that suits your needs.  I can tell you I've never been happier to work for somebody since my role went in this direction and I've never been so dedicated and motivated as an employee.  I don't even think about working elsewhere as I'm scared to lose this aspect of my day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional sprinters can hold their top speed for about 10 strides. Usain Bolt achieved and maintained his top speed for 8 strides during his 9.58s record 100m run. He covered that 100m in ~40 strides, so his top speed lasted only ~20m, between ~50-70m marks.</p>
<p>Carl Lewis used to have slightly better speed endurance than Bolt, his top speed lasted 10-12 strides, and his slowing down later in the race was less than typical, so it looked like he accelerated toward the finish line relative to the others.</p>
<p>Slow twitch muscles, where endurance is built in, are required even for 100m. The opposite is true for fast twitch muscles, one needs a speed to run a marathon. There is no clear physical boundary between a sprint and endurance runs. The difference between a sprint and endurance runs is in contribution of each muscle type. Sprint events &quot;end&quot; at 400m, and endurance events &quot;begin&quot; at 1500m, 800m is a like a 50-50 combo of the two, meaning 50% of work(=power*time) comes from each muscle type.</p>
<p>You can try to &quot;sprint&quot; a mile mentally, like go a full force from the start and try to hold for as long as possible. But physically it would be something like 95% of power by the fast muscles and 5% of power by the slow muscles from the start. Then the ratio changes as the run progresses, and in the end your power ratio is something like 20% and 80%. I'm making these numbers up, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Such attempted &quot;sprint&quot; would be extremely exhausting and maybe dangerous. I don't think even animals running for their lives from a predator can pull this off. They still tactically pace themselves and conserve strength even when a certain death is right behind them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some have mentioned, the limiting factor is <strong>energy</strong>.</p>
<p>Your body uses food to make chemicals and store them. When breaking these chemicals, energy is released. These fuels come in many types and include fat, glycogen (a storage form of glucose), and ATP. Additionally, you always have some of these chemicals floating in your blood in a ready-to-use form (glucose and free fatty acids).</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: (/u/Bearblasphemy helped me clarify this part) ATP is your fuel, and each cell only has a minimum ammount. After that, your body uses a molecule called creatine-phosphate to regenerate some ATP, but this, too, is very limited. Once they are used, you simple won't have enough energy contract in multiple muscle fibers at the same time and at a fast rate. Since those are the factors that determine the force of muscular contraction, you will feel as if you were out of strength.</p>
<p>The muscle can use some of the free glucose and some of the glycogen (stored in the muscle and in the liver), but to regenerate ATP. They are used mainly during low-intensity exercises for a prolonged period. Fat is also used in longer exercises, during rest, and between meals. All of these are used to restore your intracellular ATP, but it takes some time. They are not as fast as creatine. ATP is your main source of energy, and although all of these others can become ATP, they need some time to do it.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd just like to point out that high-intensity exercise is mainly anaerobic. You don't use much oxygen for that, but the consequence is that you accumulate lactic acid. The limit of high-intensity exercise is around 1 minute, and I don't know what would happen if you kept it going for much longer. You would probably enter in a dangerous state of acidosis.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong> The limit of your sprinting isn't just a matter of muscle strength or willpower. Your muscle cells need a fast source of fuel and those are limited and take time to regenerate. You also acumulate lactic acid from the anaerobic metabolism, and prolonging high-intensity exercise could increase its levels to dangerous ammounts.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: /u/frontsquats is an expert and he showed articles which state that you reach your limit even before wasting 50% of your ATP. This is mainly due accumulation of H+ and a subsequent response from your central nervous system. /u/Chad_Worthington_3rd suggested your muscle loses the capabaility to use ATP in the rate necessary for vigorous movment, and that this would be the main mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is simplified, ELI5 version:</p>
<p>Lets assume that by sprinting you mean running as fast as you can, and after your speed drops you are no longer sprinting.</p>
<p>Your muscles convert compound called ATP to energy, which in turn moves your muscles.</p>
<p>Using ATP for energy doesn't require oxygen. Creating more ATP with creatine doesn't require oxygen either. Making more ATP after you have used all your ATP and creatine requires oxygen.</p>
<p>When well rested, you have enough ATP in your muscles for 4-10 seconds (depends on the person and training) of maximum intensity work (sprinting)</p>
<p>With creatine (there´s creatine in your muscles, in the form of creatine phosphate) you can basically double this time. This also depends on training and nutrition (creatine supplements increase the amount)</p>
<p>So basically a well trained and nutritioned athlete can keep up maximum intensity work without oxygen for a about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>After this time, your body starts using oxygen and at the same time the production rate of ATP slows down and your speed also slows down.</p>
<p>So the answer is no you cant sprint a mile and yes there is a limit. With normal genes even with all the training in the world you are not able to keep your maximal speed up for more than 10-20 seconds.</p>
<p>TLDR; You can't sprint a mile and there is a limit (10-20 seconds of work).</p>
<p>Edit: Of course well trained athletes can run a mile so fast that normal people consider it sprinting. But if we consider sprinting as &quot;running as fast you possibly can&quot;, then they are actually not sprinting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Sprints are an anaerobic exercise which is when your body goes into an oxygen/energy deficit and repairs it afterward. When you train for this you're increasing the amount of energy you can put out and your ability to recouperate post exercising. </p>
<p>Running is aerobic thus you train for it by raising your VO2 max which is your bodies ability to oxygenate the blood during the exercise. Training for distance runs is quite different.</p>
<p>These exercises and the way your body responds is quite different. That said someone starting from scratch(a couch potato) will increase their ability in both when practicing either while a trained athlete will diminish their ability in their primary exercise if they try the opposite one. You can see the difference in the type of runners physiques easily but some noteworthy differences are that distance runners need looser(more flexible) muscles and as little body weight as possible while sprinters need larger muscles that can fire and contract rapidly.</p>
<p>ELI5 TLDR- While your bodies movements are virtually identical aside from the speed, your respiratory and circulatory systems respond to the two exercises radically differently. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current world record for 1 mile is 3 minutes and 43 seconds. That's 14 seconds per 100 meters, or 56 seconds per 400m. That's a big difference compared to the sub 10 second 100m world record. </p>
<p>The reason is due to different energy systems our bodies use in running. We have a sprinting mode which uses little to no oxygen typically in 60/100m races. An endurance system that is in marathons. And a system that uses oxygen and reuses the lactic created whilst running, this is used in mile races. Athletes who train for the mile focus on making their bodies as strong as efficient as possible, but they're not sprinting. </p>
<p>For context I am a coach and a very average runner and I can sprint 100m on its own in 15 seconds, 400m in 60 seconds and a mile in 5:30. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Mariana trench is about 11,000 meters below sea level. If you built a cofferdam down to that depth, as u/SirHerald suggests, the pressure would be about 3.2 atm. Divers experience a similar pressure at a depth of around 22 meters, so humans can survive these pressures in the short term. In the long term, I found <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/conghand/fig15d3.gif" target="_blank">this chart</a> from NASA suggesting you would have to worry about mild <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis" target="_blank">nitrogen narcosis</a>, making you feel slightly drunk, and mild <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity" target="_blank">oxygen toxicity</a>. So you probably wouldn't want to live at that pressure, but a short trip down wouldn't be any worse than diving.</p>
<p>But, your question was about draining the oceans. The oceans cover 72% of the surface of the earth, and the average depth of the ocean is about 3700 meters. That means a large portion of the atmosphere will sink into the ocean, resetting 1 atm of pressure to a depth of something like 2600 meters below sea level. So that would make the Mariana trench a bit more tolerable at around 2.5 atm, but it would also mean some high altitude cities would become nearly uninhabitable. </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> Fixed the bracket on the link. Wish I had caught it before I left this morning - wasn't expecting this to blow up so much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oxygen would re-distribute, and as such some of the higher elevation places would see a dramatic decrease in air thickness. Think akin to how on higher elevation mountain the air is thinner which affects blood flow and your brain. Hypoxia occurs when not enough oxygen is distributed among the body, it can be general (throughout) or localized to a specific part. Since the Oxygen re-distribution would re-scale altitude, people would suffer Altitude Sickness. We know the extreme baseline for this is 6000m, at which and beyond, human sustained life is not possible. Essentially those effects would now be on higher elevated cities. So anything currently exceeding 1000m would, under the new distribution be at the threshold where our current 6000m altitude sickness baseline is. BASICALLY we'd just have to move to more coastal situated cities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What they discovered is that there is an optimum amount of sleep where too little is suboptimal, and too much is also suboptimal and this is in regardless of the sleep debt. When a person sleeps longer than about 9 - 10 hours they can become very groggy and feel ill when waking up. They call this sleep drunkeness or confusional arousal because the physical symptoms are similar to being hungover. It is still being studied so the exact mechanism is unknown. It is believed that excessive sleep causes the body to enter a lower energy consumption state and it slows breathing, respiration, and causes vasodilation. This could be very handy if you were injured as the excess sleep would keep you from moving and re-injuring yourself, while also allowing your body to rapidly repair the damage. </p>

<p>One, the stages of your sleep happen in cycles. When you oversleep and go past that &quot;happy point&quot;, it may mean that you're entering another version of deep sleep. If you wake up during this, you're more groggy because you've interrupted a primary &quot;rehabilitation&quot; phase.</p>
<p>Two, the longer you sleep, the less time you're awake, which means less water and food/calories. The calories usually aren't a big deal since you burn little while sleeping, but the dehydration can really sting.</p>
<p>Way more to it than that, but that's a basic gist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Essentially the only sleep that &quot;counts&quot; is REM sleep (dreams) and if you're out of rhythm so are your dreams. </p>
<p>Another thing is that you've now slept too long and your body needs sustenance because although you've been asleep your body has still been performing other processes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens because of the way that cell phone signals are sent.</p>
<p>The radio channels used to communicate between the handsets and the cell tower are shared among a bunch of different handsets, so they need some way to make it so that all of them can cooperate to not get all the signals mixed up.  In some cell phone protocols, the channels are split up in time, so each handset gets a small chunk of time to transmit and then has to be silent until its turn comes around again.</p>
<p>In GSM, these time slices are 4.615 milliseconds long and come in groups of 8, which they transmit a little over 27 times per second.  When they transmit, they generate a little bit of current in any unshielded wires that are nearby, like speaker wire.  While the handset is transmitting, then, it's generating a current in the speaker wire a little over 27 times per second, which ends up making the speaker produce a 27Hz buzz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your cell phone is just &quot;listening&quot; to the cell network signals when it's in idle mode.</p>
<p>When someone will send you a text or calls you, the cellular network &quot;pages&quot; your phone, and your phone has to answer &quot;yup, I'm here, wassup?&quot; before the actual text is sent or call is established.</p>
<p>At this point, the phone transmits a radio signal back to the tower.</p>
<p>The first transmission is made with a relatively high power, because the system must be sure the phone signal can get to the tower. Once this first signal is received by the tower, the network measures how strong it is, and may tell the phone &quot;whoa! too loud, tone it down&quot;.</p>
<p>So it's generally at the first stage of the connection that you hear the interference; it's a higher power radio signal being tranmitted by your phone, which creates noise (not directly by the rf signal, but the switching on/off of the radio power which may happen several times a second, depending on the technology used - 2G/3G).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The noise is coming from your cell phone, rather than from the cell tower. Your phone maintains a link to the cell tower constantly but in a low power mode. When you receive a phone call or text, your mobile is polled by the tower which wakes it up to a higher power mode in order to receive and acknowledge the incoming data. It is this burst of transmission from your phone which is being picked up by speakers and other audio near the phone. </p>
<p>While the phone operates at a much higher frequency than the audio amplifier of your speakers, there are harmonics that extend far below and far above the carrier frequency, and the internal cabling in your speaker acts like an antenna and the lower frequency harmonics can become amplified, causing the chirping you hear. </p>
<p>There is enough radiative power around your cell phone to light up an LED much like Nikola Tesla's wireless power with a light bulb. If you take a diode and twist it's legs together with an LED you can hold it close to phones, microwave ovens, and wifi and the LED will light up as it acts like an antenna. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>every phone is basically a radio transmitter, and it transmits pulses of digital sound and data files to the base station (the tower) so that communication can occur. The wiring inside most speakers are not protected or shielded from this sort of frequency, and there is typically a non-linear circuit element (transistor) within a speaker that detects these high-pulse radio signals. The element in the speaker then rectifies (translates) those radio signals into audio signals, which are in turn heard in such an unpleasant way through the speaker, in addition to a lower level of the audio that had previously been playing through the speakers. For non-active speakers, this does not always occur, although there are certain types of phones that will activated unpowered speaker circuits </p>

More than likely it'd have been some kind of failure on one of the crafts but knowing it had crashed into something would be pretty difficult to figure out. Perhaps if part of a spaceship was hit and the trajectory changed or it went into some kind of tumble then we might be able to deduce that it was hit.</p>
<p>In the long term though, space is pretty empty of large things that it could crash into. Or rather, space is so large that the chances of hitting those few things are incredibly slim, which has been discussed in previous questions before. So could it crash into something in the distant future way out there? Sure, it could. However, shutdown of the instruments will be on the timescale of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#Future_of_the_probe" target="_blank">decade</a>, so we wouldn't be able to tell after that anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>All 5 probes that leave the solar system (2*Pioneer, 2*Voyager, New Horizons) will need hundreds of thousands of years to get close to other stars.

If you were to enter an asteroid belt, you would most likely never know it, and would probably never see an asteroid the whole time. Similarly, asteroids within the belt are unlikely to collide except on a very large time scale (every few millions of years).

<p>A lens can't focus light into a point hotter/brighter than the object generating the light.</p>
<p>There are a variety of interesting ways to prove that, but the one that makes the most intuitive sense IMO is that lenses aren't one-way magic, they work in <em>both</em> directions.  If you could focus the Sun (for example) in to a point hotter/brighter than the surface of the Sun, you would effectively be using your lens to heat up the Sun at that point instead of the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's worth noting that there is a limit to this process.  Conservation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue" target="_blank">étendue</a> means that when an optical system concentrates light into a smaller area it must also spread out over a larger angle.  As a result, no optical system, no matter how large and complex, can use the sun to heat something to a temperature hotter than the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Even with an infinite size laser beam (source) and infinitely strong lens (see other comments), and even with a infinitely weak source such that the electron-position-processes are not a problem (see other comments), then still you can not focus light into a focus smaller than the wavelength of the light.</p>
<p>This is a very real limiting factor for computer chip producers. Computer chips are 'written' with light. To make the 20 nm chip structures in your processor (or however small they are now), you need light with a wavelength shorter than 20 nm, i.e., extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Producing and processing (focusing and such) this EUV is very difficult, and is an important limiting factor for reducing computer chips.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
