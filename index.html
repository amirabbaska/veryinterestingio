		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, that third of your life is spent sleeping, which you would very quickly die without. I'd say that means lying down is <em>definitely</em> healthier than <em>not</em> doing it.</p>
<p>As for sitting down, it's unhealthy because it's not a natural position to be in for extended periods. We're supposed to be moving around a lot. You know how blood circulates around your body? Well, your heart is great at pushing it <em>down</em>, but not pulling it back <em>up</em>. Walking helps your blood circulate - we've evolved so that the muscles we use for walking help push the blood back up our bodies. </p>
<p>When you're lying down, gravity isn't that big of a problem. </p>
<p>That's just <em>one</em> reason. We're also not supposed to have a sedentary lifestyle. We're supposed to get a decent amount of sleep (as discussed earlier, lack of it <em>will</em> be detrimental to the point of lethality) but other than that we're built to be active and we've not evolved out of that. So sitting around all day means we're conserving way too much energy that our body doesn't have anything to do with, so it stores it was fat, which makes our body <em>less</em> efficient and means we need even <em>more</em> exercise. </p>
<p>Again - we've evolved to sleep for ~8 hours, and then be active most of the rest. Not doing either of those is not healthy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what was added by others sitting is bad for the muscles in your hips. Your hip flexors get shortened and tigtened because your body now thinks that sitting is your natural position and will actuslly begin to remove sarcomeres from the muscle fibers. Your hip extenders (ie. Glutes)  become stretched out and lengthened as well causing them to become weaker. Now you have created a muscle imbalance in some of the primary muscles involved in your gait cycle. </p>
<p>The forces on the vertrbral discs in your spine also change as you lay stand and sit. Laying down puts no pressure on your spine, standing puts 100% more pressure on the spine , sitting increases this force to 150%. Sitting down and bending over is even worse clocking in at 200% of the normal force on your spine. </p>
<p>There are also some numbers dealing with calories burnt while sleeping standing and sitting , i couldnt tell you the exact numbers off the top of my head but sitting burns the least per hour. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wood houses are built using wood skeletal frames,  the &quot;bones&quot; of these houses are studs.  They provide sufficient structural support to keep the building standing and intact for decades, even centuries. You dont need to build housed out of solid wood, as it would just be unnecessarily expensive.</p>
<p>Drywall replaced <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lath_and_plaster" target="_blank">lath and plaster</a>. lath are thin wood planks that would be nailed to the studs in ceilings and interior walls.   They don't provide structural support, they just create a flat surface between the studs, which would then be plastered.   This was a multistep process that took several days to complete a room.  Drywall, on the other hand, prefabricates the walls, ready to install.  Just nail the sheet to the wall and you're basically done.  Experienced drywallers can do i ln a day what lath and plaster-ers could do in a week, while offering a comparable result. This dramatically cut down construction time, required less labor, and thus saved money, so it was widely adopted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drywall engineer here! (yes we exist) </p>
<p>Many of the answers in the thread are correct, but one of the big reasons everyone is missing is the fire rating of drywall. Drywall is made of gypsum, a hydrated form of calcium sulfate. When the gypsum is exposed to heat, the crystalline water begins to calcine off. This reaction consumes a TON of energy, and prevents fire from spreading across the sheet for considerable time. You can aim a flamethrower at one side of a typical 1/2&quot; sheet of drywall, and the opposite side of the sheet won't rise above 220F for about 30 mins. Hopefully the fire department has arrived by then. </p>
<p>Feel free to ask more questions, I find pleasure in explaining this kind of stuff!</p>
<p>Edit-to kill some misconceptions, I work in capital projects engineering for a drywall manufacturer. &quot;Drywall engineer&quot; doesn't exist, and would be way too general of a field!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buildings began as solid wall construction using logs or stone to as the structure, and a bonding agent to fill the gaps and add structure.  But solid walls require a lot of heavy material and they don't insulate temperature or sound well, and it takes a tremendous effort.  Also, every house was constructed individually so logs were hand shaped on site, and stone was assembled based on the available materials.  </p>
<p>When the hollow wall came into practice, precut (milled) lumber could be used as the 'bones' of a home dramatically reducing the work time,  weight, and variations due to materials.  With just the bones in place, the walls needed to be covered. </p>
<p>For a long time, small, rough thin boards were used (lathe) to cover the walls, then a layer of plaster was applied to make it smooth, attractive, and air tight.  But cutting/buying thousands of boards, nailing them up, and artfully spreading plaster is time (and money) consuming.</p>
<p>Using large, premade sheets to cover the walls would make installation easier and cheaper.  When drywall offered all of these benefits, it became to predominant material.  However, other materials have come &amp; gone with trends.... real wood (knotty pine is in my house), manufactured (fake) wood paneling, etc.</p>
<p>Thoguh I didn't mention it above, the advent of electricity, indoor plumbing, and insulation all contributed to the development of these materials &amp; styles.  Likewise the scale that was needed to serve the growing population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone seems to be ignoring your other questions.</p>
<p>Walls have a surprising amount of stuff in them. Ductwork, wiring, plumbing, and insulation.  If you made walls thinner it can be difficult to run all of this stuff. Also if you used less wood inside the wall it would be more flexible and wobbly.  Some walls are actually framed thicker to accommodate for larger pipes. The wall behind a toilet is typically framed with 2x6s rather than 2x4s because the main plumbing stack is very large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting that we in the Nordic countries have pretty much the same tradition of building single family homes as in the US (and Canada?), but our friends farther down in Europe (Denmark and south) prefer stone.</p>
<p>I guess it is mostly relying on tradition, sparsely populated countries with lots of forest had easy access to, and the tradition of using,  lumber. Also, it wood might be better suited when the winters are long and cold.</p>
<p>Out homes evolved from log houses  with external wood panel and interior clay/paint to studded frame(?) with interior cladding with either lath+drywall or OSB+drywall or drywall+drywall. Single drywall sucks. Outer wall have room for 30cm insulation (one feet for the metrically challenged). To remove problems with condensation in the wall, a plastic foil is needed behind the drywall on the inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you worked out on some level every day versus the same version of you sitting and reading reddit all day were to get an IQ test, you might score the same for different reasons. Due to other factors you might score different. There are a lot of variables to your question. Your age/experience would definitely be a factor, what if you were born in a cave but aced at cave-paintings? I would love for someone who is more qualified than me to chime in.</p>
<p>I will bet money that a current version of you will do better than you if you were to do things that helped brain development and neuroplasticity. Whether is was taking vitamins, working out, taking drugs or just connecting your brain to the internet in the next ~50 years. I wonder if an individual who has an IQ of 120 can get 180 just because he designs the IQ tests.</p>
<p>There are DEFINITELY physical differences in the brain, whether its nature or nurture. Neural pathways are always changing so yesterdays &quot;you&quot; is different from today's &quot;you&quot;. </p>

So <em>if</em> reaction time is determined mostly by bulk properties of neurons, or something similarly &quot;physical&quot; (as opposed to, I don't know, conscious decisions or something), then yes, that's a difference.</p>
<p>Regarding genetic contribution, Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ" target="_blank">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The general figure for the heritability of IQ, according to an authoritative American Psychological Association report, is 0.45 for children, and rises to around 0.75 for late teens and adults.[5][6] The heritability of IQ increases with age and reaches an asymptote at 18–20 years of age and continues at that level well into adulthood.[7] Recent studies suggest that family and parenting characteristics are not significant contributors to variation in IQ scores;[8] however, poor prenatal environment, malnutrition and disease can have deleterious effects.[9][10]</p>

However, in the mid 1980's after a scientist studied Einstein's brain. What he found was different than what was expected. Instead of Einstein having more neurons or synapses than the average brain, he had nearly twice as many glial cells. What is known about glial cells is that they provide support and nourishment for neurons, and they play an important role in synapse formation. While the meaning of this difference is still unclear it seems that Einstein's brain had much more neural support than many others, which could have assisted in his higher learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

This would kind of be like a concave lens, leading to the bending of light in a vertical direction around where your eyelids touch your eye.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A washer on permanent press will wash clothes in warm water and rinse them in cool water, maintaining a mild agitation and spin. The warm water helps relax creases while the slow spin prevents new wrinkles from forming. A permanent press cycle is gentler than a regular cycle, making it good for synthetic fibers like polyester, rayon and knits. Because it does not use hot water, a permanent press cycle will also reduce shrinking and color fading.</p>
<p>A dryer on permanent press uses medium heat to smooth out wrinkles as it dries, while avoiding the high heat that can shrink clothes and fade colors.</p>

<p>I think the best way to get a feel for it is to consider a gun. When you fire it you feel a recoil force from the bullet being shot out. If you fired a gun in a vacuum chamber (or in space) you would still expect to feel the recoil, right? A rocket engine works the same way. Instead of firing bullets it fires hot gas. The recoil from the gas fired pushes the spacecraft around.</p>
<p>Another way to interpret it is to imagine that the rocket engines push against their own exhaust. </p>
<p>Of course if you want to formally derive it you need to look at the law of conservation of momentum. But usually people can't get rid of the intuition that you need something to push against just by looking at an equation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Electrons can also absorb photons to jump up energy levels - but only if there's the right amount of energy in the photon to do a complete jump. Electrons won't jump up anything but whole energy levels.</p>
<p>This means that there has to be the right amount of energy in the light in order for it to be absorbed. With light, energy is proportional to the frequency, which is inversely proportional to the wavelength. This means there's a direct relationship between wavelength and energy.</p>
<p>This is why glass, for example, is transparent. The amount of energy necessary to excite electrons in glass doesn't match the amount of energy that photons have when they're in the visible part of the spectrum, so the photons go whizzing on through without being absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons carry the electromagnetic force. Electrons interact with the electromagnetic force, however, electrons can only interact with photons of certain energies, depending on a few factors that are too complex for an ELI5. Basically, electrons can only absorb or emit photons of discrete energies (think whole numbers, 1,2,3, etc. You can't have a .5, for example)</p>
<p>This means that any photons that aren't at those specific energies don't interact with electrons, so they fly right through the material.</p>
<p>Pure metals, for example, are opaque because their electrons can occupy a huge number of possible states, and visible light happens to have the right energy to interact with the electrons in the metal (electrons moving freely through a metal aren't under the same restrictions and can interact with any photons IIRC).</p>
<p>Glass, however, has electrons in a tightly bound state that can only interact with photons in certain bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, few of which fall within visible light. Most materials have specific energies at which photons can pass through them, and other energies at which photons can't pass through. Glass is right in the visible spectrum, as is water (which is probably why our visual range is what it is, all the frequencies of light we can detect travel through water easily, I cannot explain the mantis shrimp, sorry).</p>

In pure silicon, there is a very strong absorptive process at work: the incident visible light is absorbed by electrons that then move from one electron energy state to another (an occurrence technically known as a band-to-band transition). Glass, being silicon dioxide--not pure silicon--does not have this band structure, so it cannot absorb light as pure silicon does. Sand, on the other hand, is also silicon dioxide, but it is so filled with impurities that light simply scatters outward incoherently and does not pass through to a noticeable extent</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason phone calls don't have perfect audio has all to do with three things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth</li>
<li>Physical medium of the delivery technology</li>
<li>The codec used</li>
</ul>
<p>They are all closely related.</p>
<p>If you think of a data connection as a water pipe, there is only so much data that can be passed down the connection, just like a water pipe can only carry so many gallons of water a second.</p>
<p>If you make the water pipe bigger, the pipe can carry more gallons a second and deliver more water faster to its source. This is broadly comparable to using better connectivity for our data connections. For example fibre optic cable can carry much more data a lot faster than the copper cables that are used to connect most of our homes.</p>
<p>To that end, when a phone conversation is initiated between two people, the sound of the voices from each party is in fact, a data connection that gets converted into an analogue frequency. Now uncompressed audio takes up a lot of space and can be slow to transfer, so to reduce it down to something more manageable, phone systems use something called a CODEC (en<em>CO</em>de/<em>DEC</em>ode) that basically analyses the audio, and throws out the bits of data that it thinks is not relevant to the clarity of the conversation. The more data it throws out, the more &quot;AM Radio&quot; the conversation sounds.</p>
<p>The standard codec used by most public telephone systems (Generally known as the &quot;PSTN&quot; to phone engineers or &quot;Public Switched Telephone Network&quot;) is something called U-LAW. Europe uses a variation of it called A-LAW. It allows 64Kbp/s of data for each way of the conversation (So 128Kbp/s total). It's been around since the 70's and is fairly embedded into most phone systems. It also closely matched and fitted the best data rate offered by twisted copper connections that where used at the time (And predominantly still are).</p>
<p>The days of the &quot;AM radio&quot; phone call are coming to an end though, if quite slowly.</p>
<p>Many new codecs have been developed alongside newer communications technology since the 70's that allow for greater clarity in a phone conversation. They do this by improved methods of packing in the audio data and more sophisticated ways of deciding what parts of the audio need to be thrown away and what needs to be kept. Some are even able to do this using a smaller transfer speed than the U-LAW codec. Most of these improved quality codecs are referred to as wideband codecs or &quot;HD audio&quot;. This has come about with the rise of a technology called VOIP or &quot;Voice Over IP&quot; which is basically a phone system that utilizes the same technology that underpins the internet (TCP/IP) to deliver an all digital phone service.</p>
<p>One of the most popular codecs used by internal phone systems of companies/organizations (Which is sometimes referred to as a PBX or Private Branch Exchange) is a codec called G722. The difference in audio quality between G722 and U-LAW is like night and day.</p>
<p>Cellular technology is also catching up on the wideband conversation game. Indeed many mobile carriers are offering wideband calls between users on the same network. This uses a codec called AMR-WB. It's generally predicted within ten years or so wideband audio for mobile phone calls will become the norm <strong>where supported</strong>.</p>
<p>I emphasise that &quot;Where supported&quot; bit because like most communication methods, a phone call has to negotiate down to the level of the lowest offering. So if a phone conversation is initiated between two phone systems, one side tries to use a wideband codec like G722 and the other side only supports U-LAW, then both phones will use U-LAW and the conversation will return to the &quot;AM Radio&quot; quality for both callers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The history of the telephone began with Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) which simply refers to the old, analog phone system we used for the first 100 or so years. Although humans (young ones anyways) can hear a range of frequencies between 20hz and 20,000hz, the vast majority of human speech is well below 4,000hz. The original designers of the POTS system designed what became known as a standard Voice Grade Channel (VGC) with practical limits due to the way electronic circuits worked so a standard VGC was typically 300hz to 3,400hz. When we switched to digital telephones they simply continued that standard by digitally sampling voice and consuming that same amount of bandwidth.  Fun fact. I worked with digital, encrypted telephones when I was in the Air Force and depending on the quality of the phone line and the bandwidth available, the encrypted phone would start at 4,000hz bandwidth and throttle to a smaller bandwidth if it couldn't maintain synchronization. At half that standard bandwidth or 2,000hz the quality of the speech reduced so you wouldn't recognize your own mom. At half again of that or 1,000hz you could barely understand it and could not recognize male from female speakers on the other end</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's also the problem that if you don't have at least a bit of noise on the phone, people think it is not working, so even if you are in a quiet room calling another phone in a quiet room, you're likely to hear some white noise to help you differentiate between an active call with silence on the line vs a phone without an active call. </p>
<p>Most carriers in North America should have HD voice, which should improve voice quality. But it's definitely possible that if you make a call through a network that doesn't support it, the call falls back to the older standards. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you get way more bandwidth on a TV cable. The reason for this is because they only have to send out each channel once. So if there are 400 channels, the cable TV provider just sends out 400 channels of content which people who are subscribed can request. This means even if there are 2000 people connected to that provider, it still only sends out 400 channels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the internet is designed to be <em>dynamic</em>. Each person who wants a file - such as a bit of a video stream - requests it specifically and gets a specific response back. So if there are 2000 people asking for various parts of various videos, it uses bandwidth for all of them.</p>
<p>This is why you are getting much higher bandwidth via your cable tv line than your internet line. Coax cable I think with all channels combined can transfer about 4200 mbps? Though I might be misremembering. Still, the limit on your internet speed isn't in the cabling, usually, but instead on the fact that <em>somewhere</em> down the line there's just too many different things going on to get it all through at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Second, when you stream an on-demand program it has to go to you and only you. If too many people want to stream on-demand at once you could get a slowdown, because you share a &quot;last mile&quot; segment with neighbors.  </p>
<p>You may have another problem though. What is your advertised internet speed and are you getting it? Try using wired internet if possible. Many times people's slow speeds are due to wi-fi problems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The pipe going into your house is big enough to support 5 HD channels and whatever tier of internet you have but always has the bandwidth required for the TV reserved for TV. So if you are watching one TV show and not recording anything the bandwidth that can carry 4 HD streams just sits idle it doesn't get allocated to the internet.  This is done for two reasons.  People complain way more about bad TV service then they do about slower internet.  And this big IPTV company wants you watching their TV content which is way more profitable for them then Netflix which they don't make money from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Cable TV can be optimised for video broadcast from a central provider on a relatively fixed system, including the data format and compression.</p>
<p>Networks supporting IP (internet protocol) need more general-purpose data transmission, including variable addresses. Data is split into packets that are buffered, inspected for a destination, and forwarded at every router. This significantly increases the cost of Mbps, but also gives the internet the flexibility to get data from YouTube, Hulu, Steam, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/bencbartlett has provided an excellent answer that touches on the quantum mechanical nature of light.</p>
<p>Let me answer from a more classical/continuum optics perspective. Light reflection occurs (like at the air/silicon interface) because the index of refraction between light and air is different. Light reflection ONLY occurs at interfaces where the index of refraction is different (which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index-matching_material" target="_blank">index-matching</a> is so useful).</p>
<p>So when a beam of light strikes an interface, the difference in the index of refraction between the two surfaces determines how much is reflected and how much is transmitted in accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations" target="_blank">Fresnel equations.</a> </p>
<p>So let's posit your scenario: A set of two interfaces between air and silicon, and then silicon and silicon. Maybe you get two wafers infinitely close to each other, or you can just draw an imaginary line between two layers of atoms. Because there's no index of refraction difference between the two layers, there's no reflection and 100% of light is transmitted.</p>
<p>I have the sense based on your question that you're thinking/learning about ellipsometry? Or maybe one of the associated techniques? I'm happy to answer follow-ups, my PhD used ellipsometry extensively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electric field of the incoming light doesn't stop at the surface - it penetrates the material and in the case of visible light on silicon attenuates rapidly.  The penetration depth where the light has fallen to 1/e is around lambda/(4<em>pi</em>K) where K is the complex index of refraction of the material.  For 532 nm  visible light (bright green laser diode) K is about 0.05.  Put the numbers in and you get about 850 nm - a hair less than a micron.  Green light penetrates roughly 1 micron into silicon - that is several thousands of atomic layers deep (lattice spacing is roughly 0.5 nm).    This is a real penetration - shine a beam of green light onto silicon and the beam shifts sideways as if the reflection point was not on the surface.    Make the silicon thinner than a micron and green light will come out the other face.   This is true for all real materials - the penetration depth is always greater than zero.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
