		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, when a wound heals, it scabs over the top and heals from the bottom up. It fills in. Unfortunately the tissue it uses to fill in this deficit is fibrous and not very attractive. The larger the deficit, the more likely it will be to scar visibly. A scar IS a wound which has healed &quot;correctly&quot; and &quot;properly&quot;.</p>
<p>If you mean to ask why we can't allow scars to heal more attractively, the answer is...we can. It is absolutely possible to surgically remove scar tissue from smaller wounds and align the now perfectly incised cuts up to allow them to heal with less of a visible scar. </p>
<p>If it's a larger scar, this isn't possible because human skin is held to muscle by connective tissue, so it only has so much immediate give in it and larger wounds would not be able to be fully closed, leaving a deficit and leading to scarring again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From memory, scar tissue isnt made up of, like, skin cells. It's actually made up of collagen fibers.</p>
<p>When you give yourself a small, shallow cut, the surrounding tissue can regenerate quickly enough that no collagen gets deposited at the site of the cut, but if the cut is deep enough and requires a bit more time to fix, collagen fibers get deposited to sort of stitch it together a bit faster. </p>
<p>The scab doesn't really have much to do with it - it's just a plug that your blood forms to cover up the site until either the skin regenerates or scar tissue is formed. If you pick it off early, it reopens the wound and forces the healing process to start all over again. The longer this healing process takes, the more collagen is deposited; and the more collagen, the more likely it'll scar.</p>
<p>That's my understanding of it anyway - hope it helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Scar tissue forms when there is a loss of tissue, or the tissue is simply to damaged. Even in a perfect situation  there's always some damage so you're always going to have some scaring to an extent however the better and faster the wound is closed the less that will be.Which means after a wound has healed and scared, you can surgically remove the scar tissue and stitch the wound, and end up with far less visible scar tissue.</p>
<p>Doesn't happen as part of routine treatment because it's painful, carries a risk of infection and involves surgery, but you can do it. You'd need to seek out a surgeon who does cosmetic stuff basically. </p>
<p>There are a few other surgical techniques as well. Subcision is often used to lessen the appearance of acne scars for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did my PhD in the neurodevelopment of sexual orientation. </p>
<p>I think there have been a lot of answers here that do a good job explaining it.  Here's my attempt at an ELI5:</p>
<p>As has been mentioned, genetics does seem to play a large role in sexual orientation, but it isn't a complete explanation. When one twin is gay, there is less than a 50% chance of the other one also being gay. Studies investigating &quot;gay genes&quot; have been inconsistent in their findings, so while there have been studies suggesting certain genes may be involved, next time a study is done, they don't find those genes to play any role. A particular region in the X-chromosome does seem promising though.</p>
<p>So, if genes don't tell the whole story, what else is there? Well, in my own research, I tested the role of the environment in the womb. We found some effects that may point to factors such as immune system of the mother or exposure to hormones influencing sexual orientation.</p>
<p>But if there is ANY role in genetics, why wouldn't it be selected out? Many people have mentioned the gay uncle hypothesis. This theory was popular for a while but has since fallen out favour since research has shown that gay men are no more involved as uncles as straight men. The other hypothesis is that the genes for male homosexuality is a gene for attraction to men, designed to get women to have more babies.  There is evidence that female relatives of gay men tend to have more babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's not something that you inherit. Straight people can have gay kids. Gay people (at least those who do have kids), can have straight children. </p>
<p>Human genetics are FAR more complicated than most people think, and being gay seems to involve more than just genetics. The fact that identical twins, who have the same genetics, can have different sexualities seems to prove that. There's some evidence that while some people may be genetically more disposed towards homosexual or bisexual activity, some of that may also be determined through epigenetics, from conditions during development as a fetus that affect brain growth. (Basically, imagine that quirks and oddities while a fetus could impact the brain in a way that makes someone gay.)</p>
<p>There continues to be a lot of investigation into this, but it's also worth noting that exclusive homosexual behavior is relatively rare in the animal kingdom. Plenty of animals are gay, and some animals have homosexual behavior being more common than heterosexual, but as long as some animals procreate, the species is able to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gay uncle theory says that homosexual men could have increased the reproductive fitness of their close family members by contributing manpower and resources to raising children. You share an average of 25% of your genes with your gay uncle. It's the same principle as many theories of familial altruism whereby helping individuals that share some of your genes might help those genes get passed along.</p>
<p>EDIT: Studies on modern gay uncles do not show that they are better uncles than straight men. This says very little about the role of gay men in prehistoric, tribal societies and how they may have contributed to the survival and reproduction of their kin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the five-year-old that asked, the men in the family are not working at being daddies, but it's ok since the women can work harder at being mommies to make up for it and the men can help them take care of their kids by doing things like sending them to school or making dinner. That's enough weird questions for today, go to bed.</p>
<p>Now that the kids are all gone to bed, we can have the non-ELI5 answer to this non-ELI5 question. </p>
<p>First, we need to understand that the contemporary understanding of evolution has moved from the survival of the species to the survival of the gene. Everything living thing on this good Earth is a mere vehicle for their genes and these genes are constantly fighting to propagate themselves at the expense of other genes. When you have children you and your partner's genes have succeeded in propagating themselves at the expense of other genes in the gene pool. What does this have to do with homosexuality? Hamer et al (1993) and Hamer and Copeland (1995) analysed the families of homosexuals and found that homosexuality seems to be more common along the maternal line allowing them to conclude that homosexuality is passed down via the X chromosome. This suggests that there is a genetic component to homosexuality, but it is not the complete picture. As other redditors have pointed out there are other factors involved too and homosexuality is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Now comes the important part - the Darwinian paradox of it. One theory called Kin Selection tries to explain it by saying that the homosexual males have more time and resources to take care of their cousins, who also carry their genes. This theory, however, has very little empirical support.</p>
<p>The theory that has the most empirical support is known as Sexually Antagonistic Selection. This theory says that the same genes that make the males homosexual are also the same genes that make females more fertile (or fecund, if you like the technical term). Camperio-Ciani et al (2004) compared the families of both heterosexual males and homosexual males and found that while the fecundity of both males and females were roughly the same in families of heterosexual males, the females in families of homosexuals were significantly more fecund than their counterparts in families of heterosexual males. This lends support to the Sexually Antagonistic Selection theory and postulates a possible resolution to this Darwinian paradox</p>
<p>However, this is still not the whole picture. Camperio-Ciani et al (2004) acknowledges that 79% of the variation in their results cannot be explained, meaning that there is still much that we don't know about human sexual orientation. Also, a lot of research has been done on male homosexuality but very little on female homosexuality. This is particularly important because female and male sexuality is very different from each other with female sexuality being more fluid than male sexuality through the life course (Mustanski, Chivers, &amp; Bailey, 2002). In fact, in Mangaia society (Mangaia is an island in the South Pacific Ocean) a female homosexual relationship is used as a form of sex education with an older female teaching a younger female about sex through a homosexual relationship before she has a heterosexual relationship (Marshall, 1971). </p>
<p>Tl;dr, there is much we do not know, and far more that we do not know that we do not know about human sexuality</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many reasons.</p>
<p>Natural selection is when animals with traits that make it harder to survive (slower, weaker, bad at hunting etc) don't survive long enough to reproduce and pass on their poor genes. But: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Being homosexual does not make it harder to survive (in most countries, anyway) and does not stop you from reproducing. Even in animals those who display mostly homosexual behaviour often still reproduce, since most animals mate only for this purpose and not for pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homosexuality is not simply a gene that it passed on. I don't pretend to understand exactly how and why some people are gay, but it is obviously not simply inherited from your parents since most gay people have heterosexual parents and will have heterosexual children.</p>
</li>
<li>Natural selection largely doesn't even apply to humans anymore. You can be born with any number of unfortunate medical conditions or disabilities and thanks to modern medicine, still both survive and reproduce. You can even reproduce if you are naturally infertile, which is probably why levels of infertility have actually been increasing in recent decades (I think).</li>

<li>Newly invented safety measures are implemented on the paid road system first, and will not be fully implemented (if at all) on the normal road network because the budget doesn't allow for it.</li>
<li>Car manufacturers start improving their cars in ways that adhere to paid road standards and become less applicable on the normal road. E.g. would you pay more for a car which has bluetooth connectivity to switch road lights on (paid roads feature) if you do not have a road subscription and there is no bluetooth system on norma roads? No? So that means that a notable subset of new cars that are released are irrelevant for you (or at least unjustifiably expensive). Unless you buy a subscription...</li>
<li>The company you want to find a job at needs someone who starts early, and quickly loses interest in those who do not have the paid road subscription. It's never said explicitly, but it's painfully obvious in the interviewer's posture and interest in the interview.</li>
<li>There is a new company that builds a road that is much safer to drive at high speeds and cheaper to build. However, because this new company is not yet a big player, they might never get picked up because the old road company only just reaches the government's minimum standards for road safety (but, by definition, just over the minimum quality is allowed)</li>
<li>The police is seemingly more helpful to catch reckless drivers on the paid roads. Speed camera's, however, are vastly more frequent on the unpaid roads. Again, this is never explicitly stated as a rule, but rather implied through the results of police actions.</li>
<li>During a particularly brutal election year, the current Rep/Dem government adjust the roads. Lanes are closed, speed limits are lowered, and it will take you hours to get to your destination. &quot;Coincidentally&quot;, the roads that are affected are the roads that lead towards the Dem/Rep conventions (the opposite party).</li>
<li>(edit: added by /u/FrogLeatherShoes, elaborated by me) Car manufacturers have to pay licensing fees to the road people to make the car compliant, preventing any new car manufacturers from entering the market. BMW can pay the $10,000 licensing fee per car easily. But a new startup will not be able to, because they can't run their business when everything they sell will have to be $10,000 more expensive to cover the licensing cost <em>that nets their own company not a single benefit</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways in which this system can be manipulated into urging people to pay for the subscription. Doesn't matter whether it's through making the unsubscribed version more shit (or improving it less than the paid version), preventing previously unknown companies from making the next breakthrough, or causing a divide between the subscribed and unsubscribed people (economically, employment, ...).</p>
<p>And once we get to a point where practically everyone has the road subscription, then <em>no one</em> gets the benefit from having a subscription anymore (since the paid roads are just as congested because everyone can drive anywhere again) <strong>but we are all still paying for the subscription nonetheless</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>This problem, and many like it, can be summed up like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We make a separate option that's better, but more expensive. The main argument for having it is exclusivity (e.g. uncongested roads) which makes things nicer for those who can afford it.</li>
<li>Big business, however, is in it for the money. They are constantly trying to get more people to partake in the system, because more customers means more money.</li>
<li>As the percentage of people paying the extra increases, the company's profits increase. However, the original benefit (exclusivity and separation) moves out of sight because the majority of people are now all exclusive.</li>
<li>Once big business has completed its goal and convinced everyone to pay the extra, the exclusivity is completely gone. People have paid for years for something that has slowly slipped from them, and they didn't even realize it. Worse still, they can't even opt out of paying extra now, because everyone is doing it and it is now expected of you. Not paying the extra makes you the poor outcast.</li>
<li>Suddenly, everyone is locked in a system where they are all paying more, no one is getting any benefit from it anymore, but no one wants to leave out of fear for being ostracized or simply getting the short end of the stick at a point where they need it most.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all big corporations that sell internet connectivity also sell cable tv. They also have their own streaming services that are not as good as netflix, primevideo or hbo. And by law these corporations must treat all traffic equally. In contrast cable tv is a huge dated mess with total lack of innovation and rising costs and amount of commercials. These big players want you to use cable. They want you to think cable is what you want. By adding bandwidth caps and making online video services worse they artificially make cable look better.</p>
<p>The thing is that when the equal traffic limitation is changed it allows the big corporations to fully control the internet as a market. They can choose who gets in and who gets out. And I'm not talking about people who use the internet. I'm talking about big and small businesses that use internet.</p>
<p>This means the internet  selling corporations can double dip. Or actually tripple dip. They can ask &quot;connection money&quot; from other businesses who use the internet. Amazon, google, hbo, netflix, reddit, foxnews, nascar... If you have a website you need to pay for it to be available to people. Then they can ask you to pay twice. First for your internet connection and then to get access to some other sites.</p>
<p>You may be thinking this sounds right? Surely they should not be forced to offer that service for the other corporations for free, right? The thing is it is not free. YOU pay for it. You pay for your access to google, netflix or whatever when you pay for your monthly fees. You pay it through the taxes because these companies have been given billions of money to build and update the infrastructure. Which they have not done. But they want more.</p>
<p>So those other businesses? Google and netflix buy their own server hardware so they can be connected by people like us who buy internet connections from the big internet providers like comcast, att, timewarner, verizon and such. It is not that netflix or such are being unreasonable by just trying to force comcast to play along. Netflix have even offered to pay and install their servers in comcast's server locations but comcast will not allow it. They want netflix to give them money while accepting worse terms.</p>
<p>So what happens is that tripple dipping I mentioned earlier. What it does it stagnates the market. Because the only way to compete is to own the network and essentially own the customers. Being a newcomer like netflix is literally impossible. Not only do you need to take a gigantic financial risk to pay for the connection fees, server hardware and content creation costs but you need to compete with one hand tied behind your back. Your customers get slower speeds, worse connectivity and have to worry about datacaps. All the while the comcast's own service can utilize the full bandwitdth and users don't need to worry about datacaps. At least in the beginning. It is impossible to compete against that. </p>
<p>And it is a huge untapped goldpot for the comcasts. How much can you ask from google, microsoft, sony, facebook etc for them to be accessible through internet? They can not afford to not pay! The profits are rediculous. All the same time you as a customer can be asked to pay more.</p>
<p>And it doesn't even end there. These comcasts want to be the big players. They don't like facebook and google selling ads. They want to track you and be the ad server facebook and google can only dream of being. You can try to avoid services like google and facebook if you don't like being tracked. But when it is your internet connection that is tracking you then the only way to opt out is to not use internet at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In short, net neutrality <del>combats</del>  protects &quot;free trade&quot; of an open internet. We choose the service we like / are better, not the one with enough money to ensure they're fastest.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the many implications is the possible appearance of so called 'fast lanes'. Without net neutrality, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) could start prioritizing traffic however they desire.</p>
<p>They could slow down traffic to website they do not like while providing fast traffic to their 'partners'. This would like lead to deals where website providers would have to pay the ISPs for them to provide fast access to the site. While this would not be much of an issue for large companies like Google or Facebook, it would essentially shut out new competition as they might not be able to afford what is essentially extortion money.</p>
<p>And you as a consumer would only get fast access to websites that your ISP want you to go to, essentially leading into corporate censorship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't necessarily true... permanent disease and the notion of &quot;dry drunks&quot; is more of an AA philosophy, although I absolutely believe the more strongly addicted people will have permanent problems and might not be able to drink at all.  This is true of almost any addiction like gambling and sex addiction too (CP perhaps being a prominent example).  I can vouch for four people in my family who drank heavily 10-20 years ago and got help a long time ago, and avoid alcohol now but can still drink several beers socially with no problem.</p>
<p>AA is not the only answer, unfortunately this is exclusively what is embraced by the US legal and psychiatric system. There are alternative recovery programs for alcohol.  Moderation is a possibility, though the tragic story of Audrey Kishline needs to be read as a cautionary tale.  I personally don't think it's possible to go from alcohol abuse to moderation without a long period of sobriety, and even then it's risky. </p>
<p>Alcohol is extremely addictive and it does bring the danger of a permanent ruinous relationship, but for those who haven't been burned too bad by the addiction I am 100% sure it is possible to regain a normal relationship with it, but only after a couple of years of sobriety and after a lot of your Maslows Pyramid stuff is fixed.  You simply can't go back into social drinking when you've got relationship problems, no job, and without interests that fulfill you.</p>
<p>I'm not advising anyone to start drinking, but if all that stuff is addressed then your life is in a very secure place and alcohol is not that much of a risk. But if you had previously been drinking for 10 years and had failed marriages, DUIs, and rehab as a result of drinking, then you're a lot further along on the addiction spectrum and it's probably better to stay away regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recovered sex addict here. Just wanted to add that while it is true that sex addicts learn to a way to have sex, then it's much more complicated than that. There are in many cases things that we stay away from forever just like alcohol. What these things are differ from person to person but the main idea is that some things will for a fact get a sex addict back into an addictive pattern while healthy and natural sex won't. Also it's not just something that comes easy so it requires continuing work to stay on the right path. Sex addicts have to rediscover a way to have healthy sex.
Since alcohol is not similarly complex then it's hard to say that some parts are healthy and some are not.
Completely removing yourself from anything sexual is not healthy. Just like food addicts can't just quit food but needs to figure out what works and what triggers binging. Alcohol is not a necessity and therefor it's easier to just cut it out. I do however believe that it is possible but since it's not easy then people just tend to not take the risk. Cause even recovered sex addicts have relapses and it's just easier to avoid relapses with alcohol by staying away completely. There is not really a good reason to drink so they don't. Long story short - it can be done if you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certified addiction treatment counselor here. Alcohol and other drugs are chemical addictions. Acts like sex, gambling, stealing are called process addictions. Chemical addictions and process addictions both change the way your brain is wired in similar ways and both cause your brain to release various chemical messengers that makes you feel good. However, chemical addictions have a far more severe and widespread effect on how your brain functions and cause much much higher levels of these chemical messengers than process addictions do.  The less severe impact process addictions have on the brain allows someone to continue doing something they were addicted to without it getting back to the place where it was so out of control or causing severe problems. With chemical addictions, the severity of the effects on the brain makes casual drug use almost not possible, which is why statistically speaking, abstinence based programs are the most effective in treating addiction/alcoholism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As wages stagnate and prices continue to grow, eventually people can't afford to pay for everything they need, such as rent/mortgages, food, gas, cloths, etc. Constant economic growth makes businesses more money, which results in them paying their employees more. (In before some socialist comes and rants at me about growing wage gaps or whatever. This is an economic principle, and yelling at me won't change that)</p>
<p>3) If the economy isn't growing, then it's shrinking. This translates to businesses shutting down, people losing their jobs, and less tax revenue for the government. Each of these things results in, in order; fewer goods for sale, resulting in higher prices; fewer people with money to spend, resulting in even more businesses closing; and the reduction of government programs, which means more people without jobs. Combine these problems with either of the previous examples and you have a recipe for massive unemployment, exorbitant prices, and a bankrupt government that continues to spiral downwards until the country collapses. </p>
<p>TL;DR, An economy that isn't growing is like a body that can't make new cells. You'll be dead in a week. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These people are literally all wrong.  The real answer depends what level you're referring to.  If you're talking a global scale, it's because of the increase in technology and the decrease of inefficiency in the market. Tech increase means any advancement that increases real output, such as a better way to farm or a way to make better houses. Decrease in market inefficiency are things such as removing minimum wages, tariffs, etc. Note, these things may lead to a worse economy in one country, but the global economy as a whole will constantly grow.  People saying bullshit about capitalism and unsustainable growth are completely misinterpreting Marx.</p>
<p>If you're referring to an individual country level, then growth occurs due to the things mentioned above, but also at the expense of other countries. This much is self explanatory.</p>
<p>The reason the economy shrinking is bad is because technology is always increasing such that real output of the entire global system is always increasing. If one country is sitting there and staying flat or shrinking, that means it is losing relative economic strength compared to other countries. </p>
<p>This tends to have a compounding effect as the country is forced to do things that cause the economy to become even weaker. An example is minimum wage. If the US wasn't hemorrhaging high skilled labor (such as techs at a chip fabrication plant) then the US may not need to have to increase its minimum wage to bring the lowest standard deviation of the population to livable wages. But alas the US is shitting jobs like mad and Walmart workers get paid scraps so the US has to introduce heavy inefficiency to the system by raising the minimum wage.  </p>
<p>Edit: Please note I'm being 100% serious about everyone else saying a load of bullshit. Money doesn't inflate for fun. It can deflate just as easily if you feel like making it that way, a la bitcoin. Saying money magically decreases in value just for the sake of it is not real economics. There has to be some kind of underlying reason, as money is not some kind of natural force of the physical world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>An economy has only so much wealth in it, and that wealth is distributed amongst everyone in it.  If you have new people, you need more stuff, or everyone has to do with less.</p>
<p>In addition, we are always coming up with new ways to make life better.  Those things aren't free.  If everyone wants a car and air conditioning and internet and smartphones and MRI machines, we need economic growth to pay for those things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The underlying thing people are worried about is: &quot;How much stuff can the average person buy?&quot; This goes down if the economy has negative growth (recession) assuming population has stayed the same/increased. Population usually grows, so a stagnating economy usually means that the average person can't buy as much stuff because there are more people who have to share the same sized pie as before. Growth is good provided it out paces population, and inflation. But even when it doesn't, it is still better than a stagnant or shrinking economy. </p>
<p>Is it sustainable? Yes and no. The factors that affect economic growth form an extensive list. Some big ones are: Population, availability of resources, technology, and availability of captial (sort of a resource). Population tends to go up, more people means more workers, so more work tends to get done. Population also increased demand which drives growth as well. Availability of resources is a funny one, because we use the resources over time, but technology can make resources like deep sea oil available when they previously weren't. Theoretically technology always goes forward unless something catastrophic happens so that is one factor that drives growth continuously by improving out productivity. Availability of capital (Savings) determines whether businesses can start or grow to replace those that shrink and fail, lots of capital allows you to replace shrinking/dead businesses and expand. So yes, it is sustainable if technology can keep improving fast enough to make additional resources available as we consume the ones we already have. That is a big if though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>But, economic growth is literally the process of life getting better.  It's a measurement of the value of everything created and every service performed.  If the economy is growing, then more of people's needs, wants, and desires are being met than before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once a region of spacetime has entered our particle horizon, it's there to stay. It cannot go back behind it. (However, objects that enter the particle horizon later are increasingly redshifted.)</p>
<p>This is not like a black hole because the particle horizon is different for each point of space. There are objects that will never enter our particle horizon, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. Similarly, an object can be and are in multiple particle horizons at once. In particular, because our universe is expanding more or less exponentially, it turns out that the radius of the particle horizon around any point will asymptote to some finite limit. This means that is possible for an object to be causally influenced both by events in some region <em>S</em> and by events in some region <em>R</em>, but <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> themselves cannot causally influence each other.</p>
<p>A black hole event horizon, on the other hand, is much more absolute. <em>All</em> observers agree on which points of spacetime consist of the event horizon. Events behind the horizon are not in the causal past of any event outside the horizon. The only real similarity between the two types of horizons is just some general notion of causal disconnection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Our Universe is exponentially expanding (actually, it has just started to, but it's a minor point) and thus is approaching what is known as a de Sitter spacetime, due to the effect of dark energy. Distances grow exponentially:</p>
<p>(distance after time t) = e^(Ht) (distance now)</p>
<p>(some rough approximations here) where H is called the Hubble constant.</p>
<p>A de Sitter spacetime can host black holes, but only up to a certain size. At this maximum size, the black hole's event horizon and the cosmological horizon become indistinguishable, and one obtains a spacetime known as the Nariai solution. This maximum mass for the black hole is</p>
<p>M = 3^(-3/2) * 2 * c^(3)/(GH)</p>
<p>the funny factor 3^(-3/2) comes from a funny calculation, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0205177v1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> if you're curious. Now, if I didn't get anything wrong that's about</p>
<p>M ~ 7 * 10^(52) kg</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>current mass limit = maximum growth rate * age of universe</p>
<p>As growth rate increases, so does radiation pressure pushing away the mass surrounding the black hole.  If the growth rate gets high enough, the cloud of gas the black hole is consuming will be blown out of reach, meaning there is a maximum rate of sustainable intake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
