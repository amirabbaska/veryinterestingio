<p>These oxygen surface-species are used in <a href="http://www.silverinstitute.org/site/silver-in-industry/catalysts/" target="_blank">oxidation catalysts</a>  that are used to either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_oxide" target="_blank">make chemicals</a>, or <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:8922/FULLTEXT01.pdf" target="_blank">decompose chemicals (pdf warning)</a>.  </p>
<p>A catalyst is something that speeds up a chemical reaction, or enables a chemical reaction to occur at lower temperature than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>Since both metals form oxides naturally, and the oxygen can participate in chemical reactions, on a small (bacterial) scale there can be similar oxidation reactivity going on that just so happens to kill bacteria.  </p>
<p>In other metals, the oxygen atoms are more tightly bound to the metal atoms, so they are not as reactive.  </p>

<p>You're a little bacteria crawling along a copper door handle. The copper handle has ridges and grooves, mountains and valleys that are all too tiny to see but they exist. Some copper atoms on the surface are not as held on as the rest, and as the bacteria crawls over it it can act like a bear trap and hurt a small chunk of the bacteria. Over the course of the whole handle, all these bear traps slowly hurt all the bacteria until they (mostly all) die. RIP little bacterium. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

How does water get this clear without filtration and sterilization in the wild? Why doesn't algae and other life and biological residues fill it up and make it cloudy? In the case of the Maldives, aren't there plankton in the water? In the case of the stream in Sweden linked above, you can see dead grass in the water; if it flowed there across any sort of land and if the stream or pond has dead plant matter in it, why hasn't it carried suspended biological residues into the water?
(And lastly, is it possible to simulate those processes for man-made ponds?)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the water is completely lacking nutrients then nothing will grow in it and it'll stay clear. Tropical ocean water is nutrient poor, and the Swedish mountains (the Scandes) are composed mostly of limestone. Lime is used to reduce acidity in fertilizer polluted lakes, so I'm assuming it causes the water to become nutrient poor somehow, although I don't know the exact process.</p>
<p>From an ecological point of view, algae might be suppressed by a herbivore under no predation pressure.</p>
<p>Oh and the picture is most probably real. Streams this clear are not at all rare in the Scandes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

So in this case the really cold water from a limestone area was freshly flushed through the lake. If this came from snow melt, or subterranean sources, then there is no place to pick up the detritus in the water. It would be interesting to see the water temp. </p>
<p>Temperate waters typically have lots of phytoplankton in it, whereas warmer coral seas are filtered by the coral, increasing the visibility such as seen in the Maldives photo. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crystal clear water is water that has very low nutrient content. Water near stream headlands has not picked up the nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients. The ocean in the tropics is also very nutrient poor because the warm waters do not mix with the deeper more nutrient rich waters. The water simply cannot support the growth of much life. </p>
<p>You mention the grass, but if the source of the grass is close to where the picture was taken there is not time for the nutrients to become available this will be influenced by a lot of factors stream speed, temperature, or specific nutrient limitations. </p>
<p>Water in just about every habitat is filtered somehow. Rivers are filtered by wetlands and saltmarshes (which is why they are so important don't drain the actual swamp), in the tropics mangroves filter runoff from the land, and on small scales oysters, tunicates, clams, mussels, corals and sponges filter water removing organic material. </p>
<p>To replicate that in a pond generally requires mechanical filtration and chemicals.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of different answers with different aspects of this but none that really line up to the perspective that I read about when I studied historical fashion!</p>
<p>The suit became fashionable at the fall of the aristocracy and the rise of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>When people, men, started gaining power and influence because of their accomplishments, which is tied to the industrial revolution, and it was no longer something that was strictly inherited the philosophy and society changed and the view of the nobility was that they were lazy, gaudish, extravagant, decadent, wasteful and just terrible overall.</p>
<p>So the old power fashion with extravagant and overdone clothing became the symbol for something bad. Like this: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/raFyUij.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/raFyUij.jpg</a></p>
<p>Also, look at the legs, and heels on the shoes. Those kind of things became very feminine and the anti-thesis of men. Men where supposed to be rational and strict and those kind of expressions where for women who are more emotional etc. The view on sexuality also changed a lot at the same time, especially female sexuality. Sexuality was seen as something irrational and the purity of women and romance of love became more prevalent as well.</p>
<p>So the suit became the fashion for men with power. But how do you differentiate a bad suit from a good suit from a great suit? You really need to understand the details to actually tell the difference and that played into the idea of your own accomplishments etc. In many ways the fashion became so much more elitist. With the old fashion it was pretty much bigger was better, the one with the biggest and most extravagant clothing had the most power. Everyone could tell, from the poorest farmer to the king himself. But with the new fashion of the suit only the people in the know could tell. A poor farmer could impossibly tell the difference from what was considered a great suit from a simply good suit. So by simply knowing that it gave someone power.</p>
<p>My favorite example of this is the male fashion of watches that is still big today, unless you actually know you can't tell the difference from a superexpensive watch and a regular watch. Most of what makes the expensive watch so expensive is on the inside, it is the engineering and craftmanship that makes the watch special more than its gold and diamonds etc.</p>
<p>This also plays into the ideal of men as being rational and logical, there is a certain worth in craftmanship, jewelery is just pretty and doesn't have an inherent worth. Things that are just pretty are for women to appreciate, men appreciate things with absolute worth, or that is the idea anyway. </p>
<p>And you can see this ideal and philosophy in a lot of things, it plays into why men care so much about sports, because it is seen as having an absolute worth, it is something you can measure. So it is seen as more important than other things.</p>
<p>And of course, Europe where this all started have been the powercenter of the world and been seen as the ideal for most of the world in many ways so other cultures adopted this as they were dealing with Europe in different ways. Or you know, the whole imperialism as well where we pushed our ideals on other cultures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is grouping up China and Japan into the same &quot;Eastern wears Western&quot; status, but the way western suits are worn in Japan and China are entirely different. In Japan it is a very formal symbol of being a Business person. But in China only businesses which are partly foreign owned and make most of their money dealing with foreign clients require this. Most regular business (at least in Beijing) dress smart casual to the office and the formal places would just require a dress shirt and dress pants. Actually it is a joke in China that if you wear a suit, people will think you are an apartment rental agent (real estate) because that is the only job that really requires all their workers to wear suits.
You will be surprised to know that Chinese people don't wear suits to formal occasions - if you go watch an opera or to an orchestra performance or go to a nice club you will rarely see any guy in a western suit. Most regular middle class Chinese men don't have a formal suit in their closet.</p>
<p>Edit: Also why is no one talking about Thailand. They have their own business suit that is pretty common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The findings in the study linked show that the particular kind of fatty chains stored in big booties are particularly nourishing to neonatal brains, and that woman with an ideal WHR (waist-hip ratio; basically that hourglass figure that women strive to have) has more neuro-developmental resources to offer her infant. </p>
<p>Breasts do grow in size somewhat during pregnancy because the milk ducts are filling with colostrum, the &quot;first milk&quot; that women produce. It's incredibly calorie, fat, and nutrient dense, and a middling yellow in colour, as opposed to the more traditional whitish milk needed by more mature infants (past the first week or so). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many people have already pointed out, breast size does not correlate to milk production.  A woman's breasts (non-pregnant, non-nursing) are basically entirely fat tissue.  The actual glandular tissue doesn't start to hypertrophy until prolactin levels rise during pregnancy.  That is why they grow, but the size prior to prolactin has nothing to do with milk production.  Interestingly, humans are some of the only mammals that develop and maintain breast tissue in the absence of lactation. Breasts form initially in response to the elevating estrogen levels of puberty and are considered a secondary sex characteristic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>That's why they come in little <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/experiment/lab/expt6/oa.gif" target="_blank">integrated circuits</a>.</p>
<p>So to understand the inner workings of the device all the way from the fundamental motion of charge carriers, there are sort of two steps: you have to understand how transistors work on a microscopic level, and then at the circuit level you have to understand how all these transistors combine in the schematic above in order to achieve the function of an operational amplifier.</p>
<p>I'm assuming since you're asking the question, you are studying (or at least interested in studying) electronics. So are you familiar with how transistors work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OPAMPS are first of all designed based on a schematic. So at first we choose a specific circuit of either BJTs or MOSFETs that will behave the way we would want them to. In case of MOSFETs for example, we'll decide what kind of gate length and widths we need. Then depending on the performance requirements we decide if we need specific materials or other designs. Some OPAMPs are there to push the limits of what is possible and others are just supposed to be cheap.
Finally, when we know the schematic, the people of Integrated Circuit Design will figure out a layout on a chip but the layout doesn't only look at what doped regions, doping levels and transistor designs etc. They also look at whether it is possible to construct cheaply or efficiently with the production steps they have available in their factory. </p>
<p>I don't think it will be possible to provide you with an entire design of P and N regions but at the operational level, OPAMPs are designed on a lumbed element level first where the insight on their inner functioning is much more insightful then when you would try to understand it at a doping level completely. </p>
<p>If you need more information on the inner mechanics it would be easier to first know if you know how transistors work in P and N regions and if you know how an OPAMP works in a circuit schematic design. </p>
<p>Could you elaborate on your understanding on those fronts before I'll go in depth on concepts like current mirrors, current sources, differential pair gain stages, Miller capacitors etc? You might already know that. But that is unclear in  the way you phrase your question. </p>
<p>If you understand what you see in the images below (or not), we could help better. Maybe not me but others. </p>

<p>Governments in more than 70 countries have launched over 150 investigations, inquiries, audits and probes into the affairs of thousands of people and corporations linked to Panama Papers. Just last month, Malta’s tax office announced it had recovered more than $10 million as a result of investigations sparked by the Panama Papers and another ICIJ project, Swiss Leaks.</p>
<p>One year after the Panama Papers first became an international catchphrase, here’s a globe-hopping update on the people and institutions caught up in the scandal:</p>
<p><strong>The law firm and the eponymous jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>In March, Mossack Fonseca, the Panama-headquartered law firm at the center of the Panama Papers affair, announced that it had been forced to dismiss 250 employees from its offices worldwide due to the “current media, political and economic environment.”</p>
<p>Authorities in Panama have detained Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca, the firm’s founders, since Feb. 9 on money laundering charges.</p>
<p>The men’s lawyer, Guillermina McDonald, denies her clients are guilty of wrongdoing and has accused Panama’s government of “selective justice” in its investigation of Mossack and Fonseca.</p>
<p>Last month, a Panamanian prosecutor held a press conference to update the public on the investigation into Mossack Fonseca, and claimed to have a “solid case” against the firm. Mossack Fonseca’s lawyers denied the government’s accusations and called for the men’s release.</p>
<p><strong>Iceland votes, but what has changed?</strong></p>
<p>Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, who resigned as prime minister two days after the Panama Papers story first broke, remains a member of parliament.</p>
<p>Gunnlaugsson, who was forced to step down because of reports linking him and his wife to an offshore company, maintains an active Facebook profile, posting about Icelandic banking, new hospitals and the delights of raw meat on crackers.</p>
<p>When his replacement, Bjarni Benediktsson, took over as Iceland’s new prime minister in January 2017, critics noted that his name, too, had been included in the Panama Papers. Benediktsson used an offshore company to hold four apartments in Dubai, he said in response to the Panama Papers revelations.</p>
<p><strong>Can’t stop the music in Russia</strong></p>
<p>Sergei Roldugin, a classical musician and close friend of President Vladimir Putin, has played on even in the wake of Panama Papers documents that place him inside a circle of Putin friends who used offshore companies and bank account to secretly move some $2 billion around the world. Roldugin played the cello at a concert in Palmyra, Syria, in May 2016, one month after Panama Papers reports about him made global headlines.</p>
<p>Later in 2016, Putin gave the cellist and conductor a national award to recognize his contribution as an “outstanding citizen.” In February 2017, Russian media reported that the government had granted a tax exemption to an education foundation established by Roldugin in the city of Sochi.</p>
<p><strong>Fallout differs in Pakistan and India</strong></p>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been under pressure for a year in the face the Panama Papers’ revelations that his children owned shell companies that held homes in London.</p>
<p>In September, thousands of protesters swelled Islamabad’s streets to call for Sharif’s resignation. Opposition parties have been attacking him in court, alleging that Sharif failed to declare his family’s offshore connections. Sharif and members of his family deny wrongdoing. A decision in the case by Pakistan’s Supreme Court is expected any day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the border in India, focus has been fixed on the efforts of the multi-agency taskforce created to investigate India’s black cash scandals: just last month, regulators announced that their probe has expanded to 424 Indian clients of Mossack Fonseca.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainty reigns in U.S. political upheavals</strong></p>
<p>With Donald Trump in the White House, it’s unclear what will happen with Panama Papers-related investigations started during the Obama administration by the Senate Finance Committee and by the office the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan.</p>
<p>In March, Trump fired Preet Bharara, long-time U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, raising concerns about whether aggressive investigations by the office would be stymied. The Senate committee did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for information on the status of the investigations while the Department of Justice refused to comment.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr - Still a lot of investigation is going on even though the process is slow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>People checking on the bad people win a prize for their hard work.</p>
<p>The bad people's company fired a lot of their people because everyone was looking at them and doing bad things that make money became hard to do.</p>
<p>The most important person, like the president, in a country called Iceland lost his job, but was given another big important job anyway. The person who got his job was also doing bad things, so many people wonder if more change should happen.</p>
<p>A big musician in Russia who is friends with the president-guy of Russia was caught with lots and lots and lots of bad money he probably shouldn't have. The president forgave his friend, which makes people look at the Russia president guy and wonder why.</p>
<p>Other countries, called Pakistan and India, have a lot of people running around and shouting for people to lose their jobs, because they also had bad money. Also, in our own country, the USA, a lot of changes (like the new president) have been going on, so no one really knows what is going on just yet. But some people who are supposed to look into the bad money were fired, so it's a good guess that less people will get in trouble.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an attorney in Banking, I've done a lot of work on this. There were some stark revelations ( Iceland, Russia, Messi, Cameron) but mostly it just released a lot of private people's information (Emma Watson) and the vast majority of that isn't connected to illegal activity. </p>
<p>Mossack Fonseca wasn't some tiny firm hideaway. They were a global player with a decent reputation. So showing up their radar isn't the smoke people think it is. </p>
<p>A lot of people don't know what money laundering or tax evasion actually entails, so there's assumptions that a foreign holding corp must be illegal. They're typically not. </p>
<p>The most useful aspect of it is verifying client information since a lot of bank due diligence relies on the customer. You can see connections you wouldn't have otherwise been aware of and can follow up to measure your risk. </p>
<p>Considering the massive scope of the leak, it's surprising there isn't more out there. It doesn't really fit the narrative the icij puts out there. </p>
<p>Edit: don't get me wrong. This exposed a lot of actual mechanisms for how peps and individuals hide their wealth for various means, but nothing here is really new except for the few headlines and specific people involved A lot of people doing things legally have a lot of their private info out there now. Being rich isn't a crime yet, and I think people forget that. </p>
<p>Edit2: Some people seem to think that there's one guy in a room somewhere going through all of these docs and hasn't found the big prize yet. A lot of thy data can be checked with analytics and cross referenced. Not to mention anyone can and likely has searched all know PEPS celebrities and powerful names. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The UK had an independent Press Complaints Commission which does try to keep the news sane, even if that means censuring the government. If you wanted to try that in the USA, it would probably require an Act of Congress, and it wouldn't get past your current highly-partisan Congress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't. Publications that lie or spread information are generally sued for defamation, slander or libel. It happens all the time. </p>
<p>As far as professional associations go, There is the society of professional journalists, which most reputable journalists belong to. However, it would arguably be unconstitutional to require licensing to report news, at least in the US (freedom of speech and all). </p>
<p>Anyone can write an article, blog, or tweet these days. It's ultimately your responsibility as the consumer to evaluate the sources from which you gather your news. Research publications before giving them your trust. Do your homework. Don't believe everything you read. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see you talk about engineers in ontario and so I am going to go ahead and assume you are an engineer.  This means certain things that we should understand.  First it means that in a professional capacity you are not a gambler.  You want things to tick along with mechanical precision, regularity and reliability.</p>
<p>You need to appreciate however that this is a bias on your part and is just one option among many.  You like things to be orderly, but they don't necessarily have to be.  </p>
<p>Which brings us to freedom of expression.  There is not some kind of formulaic rule that says &quot;Free Expression + regulation that is equal to or less than X = Good social outcome&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead freedom of expression is a gamble.  At the time of its founding america was called &quot;the grand experiment&quot;.  This was specifically because of things like free expression being a wager.</p>
<p>So, what's the bet?  The bet is that if we get a large group of people together, let them say whatever the hell they want to (including lie and deliberately try to trick each other), that good information will tend to rise above the lies and society will tend to operate more efficiently than if expression is restricted.</p>
<p>And it turns out we won that bet big time.  It turns out (luckily) that generally speaking people prefer the truth and smart people make better arguments when supported by the truth than they make when trying to lie to the degree that it is in fact very difficult to get away with a lie in an open debate (you ever see people being called out brutally on reddit for lying?).</p>
<p>Now, like anything else we did discover that there were some... exceptions... that needed to be made.  It turns out letting people threaten to murder other people isn't good.  it turns out letting people incite violence isn't good.  It turns out allowing people to commit fraud isn't good.  But just because there are some exceptions doesn't mean we can get away from the fundamental wager and try to simply prohibit &quot;bad&quot; expression.</p>
<p>It isn't neat.  It isn't formulaic.  It isn't guaranteed and reliable.  But not only does it tend to work out, we see again and again that the alternative universally results in societies jumping off a cliff straight to hell (look at Russia).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reputation of the publication is all that's really needed. Think about the publication you trust; how did they get that way? They print factual, well reported, unbiased (as possible) news, and have done so for decades if not more than a century. </p>
<p>Honestly, if you're getting your news from Facebook and disreputable places, that's your own fault. As a citizen it's your responsibility to get accurate news. And most newspapers have STRICT, STRICT guidelines on what can be published. If you can't get corroboration on a piece of information, generally it won't be used. Even confidential sources need corroboration. </p>
<p>Journalism is an occupation of idealists. You don't become a reporter for the money. There isn't much in it. It's very good at self regulating if it's an actual newspaper and not a mouth piece for political or religious organizations. </p>
<p>Reliable news requires a little work on your part. Do your research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
