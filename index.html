		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what &quot;everything else&quot; you're thinking of here, if &quot;we understand their effect on matter&quot; is something you take as given.</p>
<p>We have observed stars orbiting seemingly empty space as if there were a massive object there, and we don't have candidates for dark objects of the necessary mass apart from black holes. We have observed systems where gas is heated to extreme temperatures as it spirals into an otherwise invisible massive object, which again we have not been able to explain except as a black hole accretion disk. We have direct observations of stellar orbits around our galaxy's central mass, consistent with a supermassive black hole and pretty much nothing else (given the necessary density of the central object for the closest stellar orbits to avoid hitting it).</p>
<p>We have gravitational wave observations from LIGO that quite precisely match theoretical and computational models of black holes spinning together to merge into a single larger (rotating) black hole; the fact that those observations are such a close match to the theory and its consequences is strong evidence that the details of our theories are quite accurate.</p>
<p>So while I'd love to be able to take a spaceship out to a black hole and perform experiments right there in person, I feel like our understanding of black holes at this point has (very) roughly the same level of experimental evidence that our understanding of, say, neutron stars or red supergiant stars has. What else do you want to know about them that <em>isn't</em> covered by that?</p>
<p>(One immediate possibility: &quot;What happens when you cross the event horizon and head inside?&quot; But I might claim that in that case, we don't &quot;know&quot; the answer theoretically/hypothetically, either. There's a guess, based on the equivalence principle, that for a big enough black hole you wouldn't even notice that you'd crossed that line, at least not until you discovered that you could no longer escape the central singularity. But 1) it's well-established theoretically that you wouldn't be able to report back on your experience anyway, so this is essentially impossible to check as far as we know, and 2) as far as I know, there's still active debate among quantum gravity/string theory researchers about whether there's some sort of &quot;firewall&quot; that would inevitably annihilate you the moment you reached the event horizon, due to quantum requirements that kinda seem to contradict the equivalence principle in this situation. So I don't think this question really fits what you're asking about, either.)</p>
<p>Edit: A couple of people have pointed out that Hawking radiation counts quite nicely as something hypothetical/purely theoretical that we haven't been able to measure yet. That's a great point!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your phrasing is still incorrect. Scientists will say that black holes exist because there is no better explanation for observations. &quot;Everything else&quot; we know about black holes is also determined in the same way. There aren't two categories of knowledge on black holes. It is a sliding scale of uncertainty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: The scientific community does not enjoy the use of the word theory. I can't change the title but it should say hypothetical rather than theoretical </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, theoretical is a better term than hypothetical, scientifically, for this. The reason is that there is theory to explain things about a black hole other than that it exists. The problem is that your question implies that theory is the same as guessing. If you want to irritate a scientist, tell him that scientific theory is &quot;just a theory&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between direct and indirect evidence. In science, the former is valued more than the latter.</p>
<p>This is why the Higgs boson announcement in 2012 was received so well (and also why Messieurs Higgs and Englert got the Nobel Prize for it only after this confirmation), even though we were relatively confident, on theoretical grounds, in the existence of the bosons.</p>
<p>We don't &quot;know&quot; that black holes exist. This is not a claim I have ever heard anyone in the science community make.</p>
<p>What we do know is the following: general relativity is remarkable well-tested (and has that quality of mathematical elegance and &quot;beauty&quot; that has been correlated with truth in the history of science) and admits as one possible solution to its equations remarkably simple objects (&quot;simple&quot; in the sense that they can be described with remarkably few parameters -- for a Schwarzchild black hole, in fact, only one number, the mass). The prediction of the theory is that such objects must be extremely massive to remain stable, and have a strong enough gravitational pull that light cannot escape from them. However, just because these mathematical solutions are compatible with general relativity does not mean that they are realized in nature. With that said, we are fairly confident that there are conditions created during the natural evolution of the universe for which no known force is able to stop objects in those conditions from collapsing in on themselves. Two well-known examples are very heavy neutron stars (for which we can calculate a semi-precise number for &quot;how heavy&quot;) and the centers of large galaxies such as our own. In such conditions, one solution we know compatible with general relativity is a black hole. There are also other solutions compatible with general relativity -- quark stars being an example. But we don't have well-established theories for such objects, and in any case even quark stars will eventually form a black hole at large enough mass.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a continuum in the &quot;directness&quot; of measurements. The better grip we have on the observations, the more fundamental they are, the more the sources of background are understood -- the more we can be confident in ruling out causes other than black holes for those observations.</p>
<p>Direct observations of black holes (i.e. pointing a telescope at them and looking for a gap in the sky) are quite challenging, but are being attempted at this moment. I believe there is a telescope pointed at the center of our galaxy where we do expect a black hole to be present, looking for obstructions in front of background stars. I don't know how likely it is that they will find anything.</p>
<p>But indirect observations, such as the recent LIGO discovery of a gravitational wave pattern that fits quite well the expected profile from the merger of two black holes, and the speeds of stars orbiting the putative black hole at the center of our galaxy, point to it being very likely that black holes exist.</p>
<p>Whether or not these indirect observations warrant a rethinking of the label &quot;theoretical&quot; as applied to the current state of our knowledge, is a question best left to lexicographers and not to physicists. Certainly I find such discussions about labels a complete waste of time. No physicist stays up at night worrying about whether some other person calls their knowledge &quot;theoretical&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't <em>know</em> they exist and we understand even less about what happens to matter inside a black hole.</p>
<p>Black holes are <em>not</em> guaranteed to exist.  I would say healthy skepticism about them is good.</p>
<p>We think that they may exist, and our current understanding of physics says they should exist.  There is also some circumstantial evidence supporting their existence (inferred from observations).  </p>
<p>But I cannot stress this enough: We don't really know.  Lots of astronomers and cosmologists are on the black hole bandwagon but the fact of the matter is that the physics describing them ends up producing lots of divide by 0 errors and infinities, which is at least a tad uncomfortable (usually it's a sign your theories are incomplete).  Then there is that whole debacle about information being destroyed that plagued theoreticians for decades until they did lots of mental gymnastics to work around the problem.  But singularities themselves are bizarre and our understanding of physics breaks down.  What happens to matter inside a black hole?  We have no way of knowing.  And we may never be able to know.  To me explanations that are untestable are more like religion than actual physics. Basically, it sounds a lot like we don't know what we are talking about, when you look at black holes very closely.</p>
<p>They are attractive though -- they are the natural conclusion if you take our understanding of gravity to the extreme.</p>
<p>However, until there is direct observational and/or experimental evidence confirming their existence, it's entirely possible they <em>don't</em> really exist except as solutions to our equations that as it turns out don't describe reality accurately.</p>
<p>There are objects we have observed that look like black holes (in that they are very massive and emit almost no light).  One such object is Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.  We have observed stars orbiting it at relativistic speeds.  It must be ginormous -- on the order of millions of suns.  And yet it gives off no radiation.  We think that's a black hole.</p>
<p>It could very well be that it's something else entirely.  Some exotic matter we are unaware of that has physics we don't know about.</p>
<p>Or it could be a black hole.</p>
<p>But the existence of black holes is by no means 100% a certainty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have lots of evidence due to the motion of the stars very close to them. (Source: I work on exactly that) And a combination of how much mass in a small space is required for the stars to move that fast, do not leave any other possibility than a black hole. Have a look at this video for example. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gggKHvfGw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gggKHvfGw</a></p>
<p>We measure the tracks of each star very accurately. Basically you see a sudden acceleration of the stars when they get close to a certain spot. One can use basic dynamics to figure out how much mass is necessary in order for stars to move this fast. These are not crazy claculations, its basically the same thing used for when predicting how the earth moves around the sun. And then you cannot see a star or any light from that spot where the stars all circle around. So the only explanation for having so much mass in such a tiny space is a black-hole.</p>
<p>In addition to stellar dynamics going around a BH we also observe its X-ray signature. Because contrary to what it sounds like a black hole is often not dark but quite active due to accreting surrounding gas. We call them AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei). And signatures from such accretion evens are regularly observed in the X-rays.</p>
<p>There is also an extremely exciting campaign going on with GRAVITY an instrument that can resolve extremely small spatial scales (<a href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de/372679/Science" target="_blank">http://www.mpe.mpg.de/372679/Science</a>) to look  as close as we can get towards the event horizon of a black hole. </p>
<p>So no, black holes are not just &quot;theoretical&quot;. They are a astrophysical necessity and their properties like their mass, and accretion are quite well studied. However, obviously due to their &quot;dark&quot; nature if they are not accreting of course one cannot just take a picture of them as of normal stars and galaxies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a considerable amount of compelling evidence, which happens to be intimately bound to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics#Development_of_the_theory" target="_blank">development of the notion of continental drift and then of plate tectonics back</a> in Wegener's days, so let's start there.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=xogEaAfvsnsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=wegener+continent&amp;ots=i5snRzmv8h&amp;sig=O1l4HwS214ZrW50tWUxRxwqqw8I#v=onepage&amp;q=wegener%20continent&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Wegener suggested that continents had drifted over time</a>. He had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift#Evidence_of_continental_drift" target="_blank">evidence to support this</a>, but no mechanism to explain it, this came about 50 years later (we'll get back to that). What Wegener noted was that the coastlines on either side of the Atlantic fit a lot better than any random process could account for, pretty much like jigsaw pieces. He also noted that if one brought back N &amp; S America against western Europe and Africa, several geological units would be in continuity one with the other and that this also extended to the distribution of the fossil fauna and flora. This made for a pretty compelling case that those 4 major continents once were united as one, but at that time nobody knew how this could have come about with a mechanism which could account for this motion.</p>
<p>Exploration of the ocean in the 50's and 60's brought forth some new and unsuspected data which allowed to flesh out a mechanism which might account for the movement of continents (see: <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZlQABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Hsü, K. J. (2014). Challenger at sea: a ship that revolutionized earth science. Princeton University Press.</a>). It was noted that the middle of the Atlantic was the site of a massive chain of volcanos and of seismic activity which followed the jigsaw outline of the coasts on either side, and that rocks on both sides of this volcanic ridge showed a symmetrical pattern of progressively increasing ages and magnetic polarity patterns as one moved from the ridge to the coasts. It was also noted that continental margins bordered by mountain chains were often the location of exceptionally deep trenches (e.g. the Marianas), volcanism (ring of fire) and seismicity. What was puzzled out was that new material was constantly being injected between the separating continents from the volcanic ridge (divergent margins), moving them progressively apart over time. And that at the same time, older material was being reintroduced into the mantle to melt and be recycled along convergent margins. This was revolutionary, and completely transformed our understanding of geology. </p>
<p>Since then, a lot of effort has been expended in generating <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/ess403/ESS_403/Lectures_files/ThirdWeekLectures.pdf" target="_blank">paleomagnetic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronology" target="_blank">geochronologic</a> data to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_polar_wander" target="_blank">pole wandering path</a> trajectories for each given site and backtrack from the current position to the original one for any give time. On the basis of the pole wander paths, we can produce <a href="http://www.scotese.com/" target="_blank">paleogeographic maps</a> which show the position of given continental blocks for a given time. It is in a large part of the basis of these maps and the underlying data that our understanding of Pangaea is built. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is definetely <em>not</em> better to entirely relax on impact. This is a myth and I have no idea where it actually comes from.</p>
<p>For example in a car crash where you drive straight into something (the most common one), if you relax entirely your head will be whipping forward and back again really fast like a whiplash (you can probably guess where this is going...) and this may cause severe whiplash damage <em>to your spine</em> in the neck. This may cause all kinds of aches (if you are lucky) or partial paralysis if you are less lucky. By tensing you neck really hard (best thing to do is to push it back against the head rest or whatever it is, I think) in order to counteract the whipping motion of your head. Sure, you may sprain your muscles and what not, but that is <em>always</em> preferable to spine damage and will probably automatically get well after some time.</p>
<p>I am definitely no expert in the area and I hope that someone who is comes here and gives a better answer, but I do know that you should definitely not relax on impact.</p>
<p>EDIT: I removed the last edot because I learned chiropractics is not real science. English is not my main language so I originally thpugh it meant some legit thing. We don't have chiropractics in my country...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is so much bad speculation in this thread. I'm going to answer the question from my area of expertise, which is impact biomechanics, most specifically with respect to car crashes.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to remember is that in all reality, you wont be able to brace. A slow car crash of 35mph (~56 KPH) is over in roughly 150ms, which is faster than an average humans reaction time. Bracing only rarely can come into play like if you were run off the road or something and were going to crash into a tree.</p>
<p>The next most important thing is that biomechanics like me use 3 main things to design the safety systems (seat belts, air bags, etc) of cars: dummies, cadavers, and finite element models. None of these things have working muscles. The seat belt pretensioners and airbags are carefully timed to fire at the right time to cushion the crash of these effectively complicated ragdolls. There is a possibility that if we knew how bracing effected the impact, we could design cars to accommodate that, but we cant test volunteers at levels that would be useful.</p>
<p>Final point. Lets say you brace. That low impact of 35mph could easily have your body accelerating relative to the car by 30 g's. For reference, a g is the strength of the gravity on earth. The sun has gravity of 28 g's, so unless you are strong enough to do a pushup on the sun, your arms could still snap like spaghetti if you are braced with your arms locked. If you dont have your arms locked (but are still using them to brace), you just delay your body moving, and you can actually increase the accelerations your brain (and the rest of your body) is exposed to. This is supported by research showing that with volunteer impacts, some of the accelerations/forces are increased when the volunteers are given a countdown prior to the impact so they can brace.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your statement about being relaxed in impact is way too general. Like in many things in life it depends on the situation. </p>
<p>But before going into it, the first thing to note is one of Newton's laws, from which the equation F = ma comes from. It means force = mass * acceleration. </p>
<p>So in the case of falls which you specified in one of your comments, if you were to remain rigid - locking your knees for example - when you hit the ground you would almost instantly decelerate to a stop. This would mean the force acting on you would be immense, which would cause injury. </p>
<p>Rather than staying relaxed, it would be more accurate to say that prolonging the time in which you decelerate would lessen injury. Just like how people who do free running roll after a big jump. </p>
<p>As an example, let's say you take 0.1s to completely decelerate to a stop when rigid and 0.4s to stop if you roll. You would reduce the amount of force acting on you to a quarter of its original value. Of course this is a very simplified version but this is more or less the point. </p>
<p>In the case of things like punches and such, it is better to tense up like other redditors have mentioned. This is because even if you reduced the force by relaxing and allowing the punch to create an impact over a larger time, the force would be distributed over your internal organs which would cause injury. </p>
<p>By tensing up your muscles, even though the force is much higher it is almost fully absorbed by your muscles as they now act as a hardened barrier - akin to armor - protecting your more squishy parts. And muscles can take a lot more than punishment your squishy parts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medic here. It is NOT good to completely relax and it is indeed dangerous. Let me give a example in what we call whiplash. In a whiplash incident we have your head going forward then aggressively back again. The problem is your brain is still going with the momentum cause what is called a cou / contra-cou injury. Your brain smashes against the front of your skull then the back of your skull. If you were to tense up in say a forward collision putting your weight into the seat. You will probably have a sprain but will most likely avoid the whiplash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A 10% loss rate was seen as tolerable back then. NASA was ok with losing every tenth mission. The Apollo Astronauts could not get life insurance because they were operating under such high risks (cool snippet: Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins signed a bunch of commemorative postcards before the Apollo 11 launch, as a kind of alternative life insurance. If they didn't come back, the postcards would be worth a ton of money, and their families could sell them).</p>
<p>Also, space flight isn't particularly hard, but it is very expensive. We know how to do it, we could put together a Mars mission tomorrow if we had to, but it's not cheap. It wasn't cheap back inthe 60's and 70's either, but it was considered a good investment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons, one of which is that the TI84, the standard high school calculator, probably has more computing power than the Apollo 11 space craft did. That is a fact that is pretty much set in stone. However, the Apollo 11 space craft had a specially designed computer that was made to only calculate orbital mechanics and such. This allowed for the Apollo 11 computer to have a far superior ability to calculate the needed numbers and adjustments. An example of this optimization used in everyday life is finding the area under the parabola. Draw a rectangle where one corner is on the highest or lowest point of the curve, and the opposite corner is somewhere on the curve; the area of the parabola in the rectangle will always be 2/3 the area of the rectangle created (people still in high school, don't cheat by using this fact, learn your integrals). It is because that the computer is specifically designed and programed to only deal with orbital mechanics and space ship stuff is why it was so underpowered. However, an everyday calculator's &gt;general&lt; computing power is too inferior to even point the rocket in the correct direction.</p>
<p>Fun fact, to get to the moon by eyeball, get into low earth orbit, then look for the moon rise, when you see it, fly towards it for a bit and u will intercept it.</p>
<p>On another note, getting into space is not hard, what's difficult is getting into space without using up the entirety of the worlds GDP. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT for clarity:  The proposal under consideration is about changing how we interpret p-values.  So I need to go through what p-values are, then we can talk about the proposed change to a threshold called alpha that is used when we interpret p-values.  </p>
<p>The p-value is the likelihood of getting data at least as unlikely as the data you actually got, <em>given that the null hypothesis is true</em>.  If you leave out any part of that definition, you are not talking about p-values and you will mess up in your reasoning (and I would ding you points on your exam, I used to teach intro statistics).</p>
<p>Null hypothesis testing is a probabilistic version of proof by counterexample.  You assume something, you show that your data is very unlikely given that assumption, and that provides evidence that your assumption is false.</p>
<p>For example, you might assume that your drug is no better than placebo (is equally likely to cure patients).  Then you administer the drug to a bunch of patients, and the placebo to a bunch more patients, and you compare how many patients were cured. </p>
<p>If more of the patients who got the drug get better, then you have evidence against the null hypothesis that they're the same. </p>
<p>But, if roughly similar numbers of patients were cured, then you haven't shown anything at all; maybe your drug isn't better, or maybe you just didn't have enough patients to prove anything.</p>
<p>The bigger the difference between the two, the smaller the p-value, because it's less likely the drug and placebo are the same if they cure different numbers of people.</p>
<p>The more people you have in the study, the smaller the p-value, because who gets better has an element of chance, and you might randomly have some placebo people get better on their own. </p>
<p>If there's no element of chance, you don't really need p-values; it'll just be really obvious, since one thing is always better.  P-values are for when you cannot tell by eye because there's too much data and the difference is too small, or when you want to prove the difference to someone.</p>
<p>In practice, we want to make up our minds at some point, even though this whole thing is probabilistic.  To do that, we say that if the p-value is below a certain threshold (EDIT for clarity: this threshold is called alpha; the proposal under consideration is lowering alpha from 0.05 to 0.005), we reject the null hypothesis.  If you designed your experiment right, if the null hypothesis is false, then some other hypothesis of interest must be true, and then your experiment will show support for that other hypothesis.  </p>
<p>Lowering that threshold is demanding more evidence before we are willing to reject the null hypothesis.  It basically says how often we are willing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true.  Going back to the drug example, if we insist on a p of 0.05, that means that out of every 20 drug trials <del>where we showed the drug is better than placebo, we will be wrong one time and the study didn't really show them to be different</del> EDIT where the drug isn't better than placebo, we'll average one study that incorrectly finds that the drug is better (a false positive). If we ask for a p-value of 0.005, then we'll only be wrong 1 in 200 drug trials.  The threshold is essentially arbitrary; the 2 standard deviations thing is probably why that particular threshold was picked, yes, it makes it really easy to calculate since we can almost always assume an approximately normal distribution when doing these tests.</p>
<p>Given just how many drug trials are performed, that might be a good thing to do; we don't want to approve a drug that doesn't actually do anything!  All drugs have side effects, and all drugs cost money, so drugs that don't do anything are bad.</p>
<p>Now, if you've been paying attention, you might note that the p-value just talks about the likelihood of the null hypothesis.  And we don't actually care about the null hypothesis at all! We want to know if our hypothesis is correct, not if our null hypothesis is wrong.  </p>
<p>This is a fundamental limitation of p-values and the philosophy of statistics that spawned them, because that philosophy does not really believe in probabilities, only proportions.  So it isn't about the probability of a study being wrong, it's about the proportion of studies that we're willing to accept being wrong in a certain way.  Asking about the probability of a hypothesis is a nonsense question; hypotheses must be either true or false.</p>
<p>The other philosophy of statistics is perfectly happy to assign probabilities to hypotheses, with the probability representing our own uncertainty about whether the hypothesis is true or false.  In reality, it's one or the other, but since we don't know, probabilities are a great way to measure our uncertainty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the other philosophy of statistics often involves math that was untractable before computers, and the p-value philosophy had a very aggressive advocate, and so p-values became extremely popular, even though 99% of the people using them are using them incorrectly because they forget that the p-value is the probability of the data GIVEN THAT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS CORRECT.  They leave off that part and just treat the p-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is correct.  </p>
<p>This ignores the probability of the null hypothesis given everything else you know, which is what you need to transform from what the p-value actually is to what people think it is.  And if the hypothesis your testing is deeply unlikely to be true, which is extremely common since there are many, many possible hypotheses, then you need WAY more evidence before you decide to assign high probability to it, and just taking the p-value will mess you up rather badly.  </p>
<p>This is all also ignoring the fact that if you really want to reject the null hypothesis, you can just run 20 studies and one of them will come up rejecting just by chance (at a p-value of 0.05).  Going to 0.005 would require 200 studies to get one to come up by chance.  </p>
<p>And there are many, many, <em>many</em> ways to fiddle with your data to turn one dataset into 20 datasets, find one that rejects, and then not really talk about the other 19.  Or to otherwise get a low p-value when you shouldn't.  I've seen analyses where the math in a paper would reject the null hypothesis something like 60% of the time for totally random data.  </p>
<p>So, if we lower to 0.005, it will be harder to publish papers, because papers only get accepted if they say &quot;we rejected the null hypothesis (which is taken to mean 'my hypothesis was right')&quot;; saying 'we failed to reject the null' is taken as 'my study didn't show anything and was a giant waste of time'.   Whether this would be catastrophic, I couldn't tell you; it will certainly be bad for labs publishing papers about results that aren't real.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The comments in here so far are stating that a p-value is the probability that the results observed in a study were due to random chance. This is an oft-quoted statement of the definition of p-values, and I always find it vague enough to be both right and wrong. If you understand p-values correctly you will likely understand it the correct way, and if you do not already understand p-values then you may understand the statement incorrectly. </p>
<p>A better statement of the meaning of p-values is: &quot;a p-value is the probability that you would observe what you observed, or more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is actually true.&quot;
This definition requires you to understand the more general framework of hypothesis testing, including the null and alternative hypothesis. Often the null hypothesis is a kind of straw-man hypothesis; something you set up to provide evidence against. A common null hypothesis (for example for one sample t-tests) is that the true population mean of the population you are measuring is exactly zero.  The alternative hypothesis is also involved in the hypothesis test and provides meaning to the &quot;more extreme&quot; part of the p-value definition. If the alternative hypothesis was &quot;the true population mean is not equal to zero&quot;, then obtaining a value more extreme than what you observed would mean obtaining a sample mean that's absolute value is greater than the absolute value of the sample mean you actually observed. If the alternative hypothesis was &quot;the true population mean is greater than zero&quot;, then more extreme would mean obtaining a sample mean that is strictly greater than the sample mean you observed. </p>
<p>Changing the significance level from 0.05 to 0.005 would have a few effects. It would decrease the chance of getting positive scientific results when there's actually no effect. Remember, no means absolutely no effect, strictly 0. It does not mean an effect that is small enough to be unimportant. On the other end, decreasing the significance level decreases power, that is it decreases the chance that you correctly detect an effect when one actually exists. In the social sciences measured p-values are often relatively large compared to the physical sciences, so this would make publication in the social sciences more difficult.</p>
<p>This slate article has a decent and brief discussion on the impact of changing the significance cutoff.

<p>As for the particular choice of 0.05, this came about as a completely arbitrary choice of a reasonably smallish number that roughly coincided with 2 standard deviations of a normal distribution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Before you conduct your study you have to settle on a cut-off for your future p-value. This is called the alpha value.</p>
<p>Technically and pedantically speaking you change your alpha value from 0.05 to 0.005, not the p-value.<br />
You can't change your p-value, since it's just a calculation from your dataset. (Well you can, by changing your dataset, but that's not what you mean) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A p-value is the probability that the results achieved in the study were due to random chance. Usually p&lt;0.05 is used as a threshold to determine if the study has significant results. This means practically that if the results the study showed have a higher than 5% chance of occurring randomly the study hasn't given any evidence that changes the current theory (which is why these studies aren't published which could also be a problem). </p>
<p>5% was chosen because it's low but not unreasonably so. (And also because we seem to like 5 in our base 10 number system).</p>
<p>Changing it from 0.05 to 0.005 would be good in that results would almost certainly disprove currently held theories but the problem would be that such results (in some disciplines) might be quite difficult to get. For example, psychology research has almost a 0% chance of ever getting a study to have that low a p-value. Human bodies just can't be controlled as much as say a physics experiment which get up to 6 sigma (p&lt;0.0001).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A p-value is the probability that a random process would give you the data you observed. So if you flip 10 coins and get 9 tails, there's about a 1% chance of having that happen randomly with a 50-50 coin. So if you were testing the hypothesis that the coin is rigged, you could say the coin appears to deviate from fairness with p=0.01 significance.</p>
<p>However, it's still possible that you just got weirdly lucky with tails and that the coin is fair. So to test this further, you could do 1000 flips, which if they continued to be strongly biased to tails, would further strengthen the significance of your coin study. However, if you initially flipped 9 heads and then you end up with like 495/1000 heads, you probably just had weird luck on the first ten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, why are your teeth non-white? That's because they have colored organic molecules in them (seems that there are different ways of how they get in there, from natural development of your teeth to smoking, not really important here). Organic molecules colors can be explained in terms of MO theory by saying that it's because they have HOMO-LUMO excitations that lie in the visible spectrum. Those tend to be due to extended p-systems (can't type letter pi from the ipad, sorry), because visible light is quite low-energy, compared to a typical organic chemical bond. So basically, you need a series of conjugated p-bonds. </p>
<p>Now, we want to whiten your teeth. Chemically speaking, we need to break those colored molecules into parts, or otherwise break the conjugated p-system by reacting with it. And we're in luck, p-systems tend to be relatively reactive. Hardly surprising, since relatively low MO excitation energy was a prerequisite! The reagent of choice is hydrogen peroxide. It is delivered by diffusion into/through the enamel (either applied directly, or made in situ from carbamide peroxide). Peroxide dissociates into free radicals, which are highly reactive, and break chromogens in the teeth. Voila, your teeth are somewhat whiter. Sometimes, light is used to induce those reactions (generally speaking, light tends to stimulate reactions that involve free radicals). </p>
<p>This descriptions is rather generic, but keep in mind that this question is not all that well researched yet. You can easily google some papers on the subject for more details. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. But the habitable zone probably won't be very habitable.</p>
<p>By blue star, I assume you mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-type_main-sequence_star" target="_blank">O</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-type_main-sequence_star" target="_blank">B</a>-type main-sequence stars, which are basically heavier versions of our Sun that are hot enough to shine blue. The habitable zone is simply the range of distances from the star where the light is just intense enough to keep water liquid on the surface of a planet, and for a brighter star, the zone will just be wider and further away. However, there are issues with such heavy stars: firstly, as /u/FatLenny- noted, they don't live very long, so life only has a few million years to develop before the star swells to a super/hypergiant and then goes supernova; and secondly, blue stars emit a <em>lot</em> of ultraviolet light, which isn't exactly healthy for organic compounds. There may also be issues with planet formation, but that is beyond my knowledge.</p>
<p>But you asked about other things as well, so let's estimate some numbers!  Let's say we live on a planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a blue star of mass <em>M</em>, and let's say <em>M</em>=16 solar masses, giving us a really massive and solidly blue star. Assuming the planet can support an atmosphere, the sky will be blue for the same reasons as on Earth, but will have a deeper, more violet tone as the starlight contains more of those wavelengths.</p>
<p>How long can you stay? In the main sequence, the luminosity <em>L</em> goes approximately as <em>M</em>^4 , so the star is about 66000 times brighter as the sun. Its lifetime is very roughly proportional to the amount of fuel it has (i.e. <em>M</em>) divided by how quickly it converts it to light (i.e. <em>L</em>), so the lifetime goes as <em>M</em>/<em>L</em> ~ <em>M</em>/<em>M</em>^4 ~ 1/<em>M</em>^3 , 1/4000 of the Sun's. You have to get off the planet in a few million years, or things will get bad.</p>
<p>How far away are you? Well, the habitable zone exists around a fixed light intensity, which goes as <em>L</em>/<em>R</em>^2 , where <em>R</em> is the distance to the star. Therefore, the habitable-zone distance goes as <em>L</em>^1/2 ~ <em>M</em>^2, so you are about 250 times further from the star than Earth is from the Sun. That's far beyond the orbital radius of Pluto. </p>
<p>How long is your year? From Kepler's laws, we know that the orbital period of a planet goes like (<em>R</em>^3 /<em>M</em>)^1/2 , which for the habitable zone reduces to <em>M</em>^5/2 , or about 1000 times an Earth year. Your planet will only survive a few thousand turns before it is blasted out of the sky by the supernova! (It won't be engulfed by the star in the giant stage, since it is so far away.)</p>
<p>What about day and night? How fast the planet spins is less related to the size of the star, so the length of a day I can't give you. Since you are so far away, the star looks about as bright as the Sun to you, which is really a requirement for the habitable zone, so you'll probably have a pretty normal day-night cycle. (Or maybe the star actually looks dimmer -- a lot of the light is UV, which you can't see!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It sounds like you are picturing that there is something that gets dense and then it is so dense that it's surface is below the radius and that's how it looks like a black hole. This is fundamentally not the proper picture. The black hole does not just contain its mass below the S. radius, it contains all of the mass at a single point at the absolute center, referred to as the singularity. The Schwarzschild radius is not actually a physical thing, it's a point in space at which the escape velocity from the object reaches the speed of light. As the black hole loses mass, this radius simply moves in. </p>
<p>Some other people have talked about the theory for what happens when it gets extremely small, but until you hit Quantum levels, it never loses the property of trapping anything that passes the horizon. </p>
<p>Also, fun fact. No one has ever detected Hawking radiation, and there isn't really a way to actually detect it as far as we know. I've heard suggestions that a nearby primordial black hole could be used to do it, but it remains nearly impossible to verify generally, making this theory pretty unhelpful as far as science goes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
