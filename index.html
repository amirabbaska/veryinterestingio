<p>In the first part of the decay a neutron is fired into a nucleus the decays and produces 2 daughter nuclei and some other emitted neutrons.
We include these in the binding energy calculations. </p>
<p>After this the two daughter nuclei decay via beta emission.  Producing emitted electrons.
We don't include these in the calculations</p>
<p>When I say calculations mean using binding energies and mass difference.</p>
<p>In both cases the particles are emitted and not part of a nucleus.
Is it because the neutrons have nuclear forces between the quarks inside them?</p>
<p>Is it because the neutrons were initially a part of the nucleus? But then what about neutrons that are fired into the nucleus?</p>
<p>Do they count as being a part of the nucleus too?</p></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>We <strong>do</strong> include the beta particle masses in calculating beta decay Q-values. The convention in nuclear physics to use <em>atomic</em> masses (meaning the mass of the nucleus, plus masses of all electrons, minus the very small electronic binding energy). If you work out beta decay Q-values in terms of atomic masses, you find that actually the beta particle mass cancels in the beta^(-) Q-value, because the atomic mass of the daughter includes an extra electron. In the case of beta^(+), the effect is opposite, and you find that there's actually a threshold for beta^(+) decay of 2m<em><em>e</em></em>c^(2) because not only do you have to produce a positron, but the atomic mass of the daughter is short one electron.</p>
<p>Electronic binding energies are very small on nuclear physics scales, so they're often neglected when they show up explicitly in calculations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're doing nuclear binding energies, the mass of the electron and the binding energy of the electron are insignificant. An electron has a mass of about 500 keV while the binding energy is on the order of eV. Meanwhile, nuclear binding energies are on the order of MeV to 100 MeV and nucleon masses are on the order of 900 MeV.</p>
<p>Now, often the masses and binding energies may cancel out enough for the electron masses to matter, but the electron binding energy will almost never matter to these calculations. But, if your calculations use atomic masses instead of nuclear masses, then the electron mass and electron binding energy has already been taken into account.</p>
<p>Also, in the specific problem you're talking about, it seems like the beta emission is secondary to the reaction you're calculating, so you don't have to worry about it anyway. You do the calculations with the emitted neutrons and don't worry about what those neutrons do later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tickling that causes laughter can be caused by touching several sensitive spots, such as armpits or the neck, which are &quot;hidden&quot; or otherwise vulnerable parts of us. The somatosensory cortex of the brain is responsible for picking up these touch signals, and sending them to the cingulate cortex, which makes sense of them. Laughter is genetically meant to be some sort of a defense mechanism; we're programmed to think that when someone touches these sensitive spots on our body, that it will cause some sort of harm to us. Keep in mind, our body systems still function in a primitive manner: to ensure survival. When the touch signal is basically harmless, signals are sent back to the sensory cortex, to evoke laughter, which is practically a &quot;false alarm&quot; sign that nothing was wrong, to decrease any form of stress. The old, primitive reason of laughter is to provide a relieving sense. Which is why comedy, involving unexpected jokes and one liners, makes people laugh. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is believed that touching the body in that way is inappropriate. Because beliefs are not only believed in the brain, but in the entire body (a belief is a certain uptightness).</p>
<p>Doing/saying anything that is believed, MIGHT trigger laughter, which is basically the relief of the belief: in that moment is realised it is just a belief and is not believed in that moment.</p>
<p>Now with tickling, if you are ticklish (meaning you believe it's inapropriate to touch a body in that way), that belief is instantly challenged, so you can do two things: either continue to believe the belief and thus get VERY scared and as a result aggressive and violent (run away/defend yourself), or relieve the belief, which is laughter.</p>
<p>You can pretend like you don't believe it (pretend you are loose and not uptight), which may go unnoticed from afar. But when the entire body is challenged, it is impossible to hide a belief/uptightness.</p>
<p>example: you might tell me that you're a very loose, confident, live in the moment kinda guy, but if I tickle you and you laugh, I know you're faking it. (which I'll know anyway because it's so easy to see through bullshit if you're not pretending yourself: I am aware that I'm very uptight and I don't hide it when it matters/is confronted).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When we are tickled the unpleasant sensation makes us try to defend these spots on our body, but usually tickling takes place in a rather playful setting. So one theory is that we actually laugh to encourage others to tickle us, so we learn how to defend these areas better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert on the industry, but I do work in materials for one of the name brand companies you listed, so here goes:</p>
<p>In short: yes, generally speaking the material (and therefore quality) is different. Of course different doesn't have to mean better.</p>
<p>Brands have material palettes developed specifically for their product lines, either in-house or in partnership with material suppliers. This could be as simple as a new color for their basic tee shirt material, or as complicated as a new-to-the-world fabric made from unicorn hair (fictitious example, obviously). In apparel, this is accomplished through vertically integrated textile mills (company X owns the mill, which only makes textiles for X) or through exclusive supplier relationships (the mill is independent, but agrees to only make textiles for X, or at least not for X's direct competitors, etc). The further &quot;down&quot; the chain you go towards cheaper textiles, the more likely it is that a mill is making materials for many different companies - perhaps Forever 21, Target, and Walmart are all buying their basic tee shirt material from the same mill, and may even be using the same garment manufacturer and pattern too. </p>
<p>So yes, the materials are different. And yet you are also &quot;paying for the branding&quot; as well. The margins on finished garments from name brands are reasonably healthy for sure, but the price difference also needs to cover the additional cost of designing, developing, marketing, etc, which is generally borne by a name brand but not off-brands. A name brand may have a dedicated group of people coming up with new (unicorn hair) materials and generating the next trendy design, whereas an off-brand just buys off-the-shelf fabric and mimics the same style that came out of the name brand (some garment manufacturers will show all of their off-brand buyers the new hot shirt for the season, and multiple buyers will add it to their collection, resulting in literally identical garments at multiple retailers under different brands). </p>
<p>All that said, these are general truths, but there are always exceptions - a name brand may be using the same &quot;cheap&quot; material as a Walmart shirt, and a Target house brand could have a robust design team coming up with their own unique designs. </p>
<p>Edit to add: another big factor in the price difference is volume. The overhead costs of designing / developing a shirt are the same whether you make one shirt or one million shirts. Name brands produce fewer units (all the way down to just one unit in high end couture), so fewer opportunities to recoup that cost leads to higher price. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked with designer brands for a few years and can tell you that when you see clothing in Burlington Coat Factory &amp; TJ Maxx (or other Factory stores), what you're actually buying is clothing that was made for those stores. Cheaper materials and manufacturing is being used so they can sell at &quot;60% off retail&quot;, but they were built to be sold at that price and they're still making roughly the same margin. They are used to sell off mainline brand past season clothes also, but it will be mixed in and hard to tell a lot of the time (until 1 year of wear).</p>
<p>There is a big difference in the quality of materials and design of designer brands (Michael Kors and Tory Burch) compared to mass market &quot;fast fashion&quot; (stores like Wet Seal, Forever 21, H&amp;M).</p>
<p>If you go to the very high end of the market (Fashion Houses / Haute Couture, such are Chanel and Hermes), the product will all be made from the most sturdy materials, using the best equipment, and certain elements hand-sewn, this is where you get a coat at $3,000. This coat will have a massive difference in end product and durability to a coat bought at H&amp;M for $50. The difference though is not scalable at all, but this is where the marketing budget steps in.</p>
<p>The famous Burberry trench coats costs around £40 to make, and they sell at around £1K (for simplicity,
It actually varies by style) in their own stores. Fashion retail generally aims for a 60% retail margin, after tax, its £833 and with margin it's £333, so you have a difference of let's say £300 (after import and shipping). Burberry puts most of this into marketing. They are one of the big brands that takes out TV time during Christmas around the world... these are multi-million campaigns (anything on TV during Christmas is).
A brand of exact same quality, but none of the marketing presence would sell this product for about £300 (or $400). So with this in mind, a $400 trench coat is much better quality than a $100 trench coat (who are also making the same margin), but a $400 trench coat is the same quality as a $1000 trench coat.</p>
<p>TL;DR - clothing in cheap stores (Target and Walmart) is probably the same quality as clothing in the &quot;fast-fashion&quot; stores (H&amp;M, Wet Seal)... meaning it is bad quality built with cheap materials and meant to last only a season.
In fashion you don't really get into good quality until a dress/pants/shoes are $100+. Anything less is made using cheap labor and bad materials. If you buy at this range, you will need to buy less over the years (if you manage to stay the same size). But STILL BEWARE. Some brands label themselves &quot;designer&quot; and manufacture in the same factory as H&amp;M! If you're making an investment, look up the quality of the brand online first. </p>
<p>EDIT - I didn't think this would get so many questions/comments so I cleaned up my wording a bit (I wrote it originally absent minded) and made the english less British and more American (to please the masses). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's a great documentary on Netflix called &quot;Dior and I&quot; (translated from &quot;Dior et Moi&quot;). It examines the design of one line of Dior haute couture. It's a French language film. Haute Couture is the most expensive fashion on the market and the right to be called haute couture is regulated with strict rules.</p>
<p>The world of ready-to-wear uses patterns based on average bodies to create garments. Ultra high end ready to wear (most of the stuff you see at fashion week) is meticulously constructed with premium materials and highly skilled techniques.</p>
<p>Haute couture is designed specifically for the body of the client, with design elements scaled up and down to flatter the client's figure and maintain the integrity of the design.  A mock up garment is painstakingly created by draping it on a dress form to create the sewing pattern. This garment is tried on by the client and taken apart to trace for the final garment.  The garment is hand stitched for a fitting, then hand stitched (often from the front side of the garment..  which is very very skilled and time consuming labor) only the finest materials are used, and the dress is often made with &quot;features&quot; that only the most skilled sewers can accomplish.  Dresses have intense structure to best hold and display the drapes and folds. Necklines are painstakingly shaped to ensure that there is no gaping. The most skilled levels of ironing and pressing are used (I'm not kidding here) to shrink and stretch fabric. Similar techniques of pressing and shaping fabric are really only used on the sleeves of fine suit jackets outside of this world. Expensive fabric is used with great care to match design elements across the seam lines, which means that the fabric is not used in a conservative manner.  The most labor intensive and technically challenging techniques are used to create a masterpiece. </p>
<p>[Edit] if you're interested in learning about the techniques used in couture sewing, I highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L2223DM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">&quot;couture sewing techniques.&quot;</a>  It gives very practical information on the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to break clothing &quot;quality&quot; into three main components: materials, construction, and design (some people might consider durability as another important point, but when you're getting into some higher-end stuff, garments can be delicate yet well constructed. I'd lump that in with construction). Depending on the target market, the mix or emphasis on one or more of these components differs.</p>
<p>For example, a typical brand aimed at young adults like Forever 21 will focus most on design because that age group tends to be more fast-fashion. They generally like to follow trends and move on from styles that are no longer trendy. Spending extra money on a durable garment is thus unnecessary.</p>
<p>Contrast that with a company like L.L. Bean which focuses on materials and construction rather than design. They are aimed at a more middle-aged group that wants to buy something only once and doesn't care too much for the style. These kinds of brands have very basic no-nonsense designs that don't change much over the years.</p>
<p>Luxury brands try to hit all three, but can still be split into Big and Small. Big brands are ones like Chanel, Dior, Burberry, LV, etc. They're the ones that have the most markup for brand prestige, much of which goes to marketing. Small brands like Lemaire, MMZ, The Row, etc. have smaller supply chains and also try to build an artistic vision rather than a moneymaking business (not that Big brands aren't artful; they're often owned by a huge conglomerate that cares strongly about bottom lines though).</p>
<p>In short, as many people have mentioned already, brand sometimes plays a role. In terms of materials, construction, and design, however, these will differ from brand to brand depending on their target. An L.L. Bean sweater might last longer than a Ralph Lauren one, but there are a lot of factors at play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A friend of mine has a small textile factory in a town near Bari, southern Italy.<br />
He manufactures shirts and sweaters, and those without flaws (bad seam, rougher texture, unaligned buttons) are sent to Valentino, where they get the brand patch attached and are sold for way more than they cost in manufacturing.<br />
The flawed ones end up on the local markets, with unknown brand labels, and cost less than one tenth.  </p>
<p>In the past he worked also with Armani, though he dropped it because they paid less.  </p>
<p>I cannot talk in regards to &quot;store chain&quot; clothing, though, as he didn't deal with those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food is fairly cheap to produce and the markup is pretty huge depending on the food. A bag of chips that costs 50 cents to make will sell for 2 bucks. That's a sweet margin. And it gives room for discount stores to cut prices and have sales, etc. </p>
<p>Additionally the price of food often fluctuates. The 2 dollar price is a good average that covers increases and decreases in potato costs if there's a bumper crop or famine. There is a theory for example that McDonald's times the return of the McRib with the ebb and flow of pork futures on the commodities market.</p>
<p>Video game consoles have much thinner margins. And the margins are consistent. Aluminum, plastic, and Lithium don't have bumper crops. Microsoft actually sold the first XBox at a loss because they had a longer term strategy of getting into the console market and putting an XBox in your living room as a sort of entertainment hub. Sony is the same way. Their goal isn't for you to buy their console, their goal is to get you to buy into their system. Sony has a stake in BluRay licensing which is why the PS3 was so gung ho on introducing BR discs.</p>
<p>Because these consoles use cutting edge tech, the process required to make them is slow and laborious and specialized. Over time it gets easier and faster and more automated which is why price drops occur later on.</p>
<p>Nintendo is not in the same game, they want their consoles to make profit. So that's why their consoles are cheaper and that's why their tech is a generation behind, because it's easier to make older tech.</p>
<p>In any case, the costs of making a PS4 don't fluctuate the way that potato chips do, and even then, there's not much room for sales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has worked at a grocery store and an electronics store in the past, I'll take a crack at an answer. Prices for food are set by the actual seller of the product, in other words the grocery store itself. If you notice commercials for these products never list a price, just that you should totally buy their awesome product at your local grocery store.</p>
<p>Food products are purchased by grocery stores in varying quantities at varying prices. One grocery store may purchase 3 pallets of a specific cereal brand and as a result pay a certain price per unit, where another grocery store may actually buy in bulk and purchase a full truck, 26 pallets of just that one cereal brand for a discount and then use their own distribution center to deliver the goods to each of their locations. From that point, market value is different based on each neighborhood. A richer neighborhood is likely willing to pay a higher price, so the store will set a higher price where a poorer neighborhood is obviously not going to, and so the price will be lower. Competing stores are also taken into consideration and weekly price changes are made in order to try to be only a few cents lower on the product where they can still make a profit.</p>
<p>For video games consoles specifically this is entirely different. The console manufacturer sets the price of the console. You'll notice that advertisements for consoles always list the price. This is the advertised price they want the console to be regardless of which distributor you buy it from. Additionally, no distributor makes any profit off selling the console. Even the manufacturer (sony, microsoft, nintendo) usually does not make a profit on the console. In the above example about groceries, a store may buy cereal at $3 dollars a box, and sell it at $3.25 a box, but when it comes to consoles, The store buy's it at $399 and sells it at $399. Stores make zero profit off sales of consoles. Instead, they make quite a bit of profit off peripherals and the actual games. This is why you can sometimes find a deal on a specific game title at one store over another because it went on sale faster, or why there are so many competing 3rd party peripherals sitting right next to the first party peripherals. They make the store a profit and they want you to consider purchasing them. However, what good is purchasing peripherals if you don't have a console? This is why they agree to sell at the exact price they purchase them.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's long winded and I don't usually answer ELI5's but I thought &quot;hey I know this. why not give it a shot?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Therefore, it does seem like there are different neural signatures for the different emotions that can be derived from fMRI data.</p>
<p>That said, application to animals could be harder. Firstly, there are controversies regarding the universality of emotions, and it is unclear if we can actually generalize human emotions to animals.
Secondly, to utilize a similar technique used in the paper, we would need some form of 'label' to indicate (or induce) what emotion a specific brain state corresponds to. As the animal would not be able to provide some form of subjective report, this could also be a challenge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That said, a couple of excerpts from above that are particularly relevant; it's likely there's at least some effect from radio transmission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given ambient terrestrial ionosphere and magnetosphere magnetic field and electron density values, VLF fixed frequency transmissions can not only pass through the medium but can under certain conditions trigger a variety of natural stimulated wave emissions, often interacting with existing particle populations in these regions. Observations exploring these physical mechanisms have been and continue to be conducted both from the ground and in-situ within the ionosphere and magnetosphere. Sect. 3 of Parrot and Zaslavski (1996) provides a mid 1990s snapshot review of observations and mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, from the above ref, there's debate over the specific contribution from the use of electronics not intended for EMF radiation emssion;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The possible effects on the space environment of human activities via use of electrical power sources in industrial activities have also been reported from statistical analyses of weekly variations in geomagnetic activity (e.g. Park and Miller 1979; Fraser-Smith 1979), and refuted from other analyses (e.g. Karinen et al. 2002).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other responses have mentioned, the fact that man-made electronics point in essentially random directions means that they have very little cumulative effect at all.</p>
<p>To satisfy some more curiosity, it may be illustrative to look at the question: could man-made electronics affect it at all? </p>
<p>Let's do a basic ballpark estimation. Human electric power consumption is around 25000 TWh a year, or about 3 trillion watts on average. That corresponds to a regular 230 kV power line (or more realistically, many parallel ones) pulling 12 million amps. If we loop that power line around the equator, we turn the Earth into a giant electromagnet generating one microtesla - about 30 times less than Earth's natural magnetic field. So no, even if all the man-made electricity on Earth were to collaborate, we still couldn't beat Mother Nature magnetically.</p>
<p>(Of course, lower voltages generate more magnetism for a given amount of power, so if we instead managed to run our big magnet on regular mains voltage (1000 times lower than the transmission lines) we could create a 1000 times stronger field, beating Earth but requiring one hell of a thick cable.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I recently learnt about superconductors and how they can essentially keep current running in a loop forever without losing energy. Random idea just popped into my mind - since we've developed fibre optics - a way of transmitting data by sending light patterns with energy loss close to 0 - why can't we use principles such as TIR (total internal reflection) to collect large amounts of light (sunlight) and then store it similar to how the superconductor bank works? </p>
<p>If we could be able to store light as a form of energy - could be collected, amplified by using mirrors and be a source of sustainable energy much alike solar panels (quite inefficient). </p>
<p>So to all the scientists out there, is this concept plausible? and if it is, what could we do with such a concept?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is basically an optical cavity. The most simple variation of cavity is just mirrors facing each other, but there are also ring resonators that basically do exactly what you are suggesting, which is keeping light on a circular trajectory by total internal reflection.</p>
<p>Even the best cavities have a maximum lifetime of less than milliseconds (in vacuum). In order to get such lifetimes you need incredibly stable configurations and high finesse cavities are definitively delicate instruments that are susceptible to even small fluctuations in temperature and the like and need to be constantly locked to references and only very narrow-band light can be coupled inside.</p>
<p>Fibers would be even worse for the task. Attenuation in silica fibers is at least 0.5 dB/km, meaning after 20km there is only 10% of your initial power. Light will travel this distance in 0.0000001s in fiber.</p>
<p>So no, using them for energy storage is not reasonable. There are still tasks were we need to store light coherently (or more precisely store the information that is encoded in the light) as in my field which is quantum information. There we use effects as slow/stopped light or absorption by single atoms or collective excitation of several atoms. Just using fiber delays is not satisfying option for the reason that I mentioned above. Research on such so called quantum memories is a considerable field in experimental quantum info currently and I might even join a research group doing exactly this in autumn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are no superconductors for light yet. And fibres absorb quite a bit of light. So for now, not so much chance of getting there. </p>
<p>Typical fibre loss rates are in the order of 1dB/km. Let's be generous and assume a super low loss of 0.01dB/km.</p>
<p>Per second light travels 300000 km. This means that after a tenth of a second in a fibre loop the loss would already be 300dB which corresponds to an energy by a factor of 10^30 less than what was there in the beginning. </p>
<p>To put that into perspective, if you were to come the entire output of the sun into the fibre, after a tenth of a second you'd hardly be able to detect a signal.</p>
<p>Basically, any interaction with light causes losses so for now the better option is to store other forms of energy using light as an input, such as solar panels. </p>
<p>Tiny edit: light is actually slower in fibres, but just by a factor of 1.5. It takes slightly longer to run through my fictional fibre but the rest of the math still stands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's what plants do with photosynthesis. They take light, they use its energy to excite electrons in the photosystems (the bits where chlorophyl is) and then they use those electrons to pump protons (H^+ ) through a membrane. The protons then want to move back to the side of the membrane with the least concentration, and they deposit the energy that was transferred to them by the excited electrons, into a protein that acts like a pipe. Then that protein converts the energy into chemical energy (ATP). Throughout this process other chemicals are produced that pass through another big process (Calvin cycle) to produce even more energy stored in glucose (sugar).</p>
<p>There are many projects around that try to take advantage of photosynthesis. The problem is:</p>
<p>a) to create machinery that can convert efficiently the chemical energy we have produced to store energy, into a more usable form of energy, like electricity or heat. Plants (and all other organisms) don't do this very efficiently at all. 70% of that energy is dissipated as heat.</p>
<p>b) To make artificial photosynthesis be fast enough, so that it can create a bulk of solar fuel. To do that we need to make it capture way more energy from sunlight than what plants achieve.</p>
<p>Artificial photosynthesis has been a thing since the very early 20th century (1910-1920), but only recently did we make it industrially feasible by creating artificial leaves that capture 10% of sunlight when using pure CO2 or 3-4% when they use atmospheric CO2. In comparison, plants have a 0.3-0.6% efficiency (When I say efficiency here I mean how much energy from the total sunlight radiation that hits them gets captured to be used in photosynthesis).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As everyone else says it is not possible in any real useful way, at least with current technology, to store light as you suggest. That said, it is very easy to store <em>the energy</em> from light. There are many ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.solarreserve.com/en" target="_blank">Hot salt storage</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tesla.com/commercial" target="_blank">Batteries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://energystorage.org/compressed-air-energy-storage-caes" target="_blank">Compressed Air</a></li>
<li><a href="http://interestingengineering.com/energy-storage-trains-work-power-gravity/" target="_blank">Trains</a> (Really!)</li>
</ul>
<p>That last is just one example of using gravity as an energy storage device. There are lots of variants. Basically you use solar power during the day to move something heavy up a hill, then at night the heavy thing moves down to generate electricity. Another way to use this is with hydro-electric. Pump water up to a basin during the day, let it flow down at night to generate electricity.</p>
<p>That list is by no means exhaustive, just a few methods that come immediately to mind.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had a ping pong ball, and you filled it with cool whip. Now shrink that whole thing down to the size of a fly. Now imagine you threw that tiny little shell full of goop at the wall. Even if you threw it as hard as you could, it's still soooo tiny and soooo tough and bouncy on the outside that it'll just bounce off. </p>
<p>Flies are super tiny, and have a shell just like that ping pong ball, but with little flexible, foldable wings. And just like a fly, if you use a slingshot instead of your hand (a moving car instead of a window) you might just get it to pop. </p>
<p><strong>Edit for a bit more actual explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Flies have an exoskeleton that's incredibly tough and hard in some spots, and just flexible enough to be springy and bouncy in others. Just like that ping pong ball, they've got a shell that's good at taking a bit of a hit and bouncing off instead of just squishing like a worm (which doesn't have that tough shell).</p>
<p>The fact that they're so small helps in a couple different ways as well. For one, we <em>think</em> they're flying super fast, but it's really just because they're tiny. If you look at a massive airplane, it might be moving at 500 miles per hour but still looks like it's just crawling along across the sky. Houseflies look fast, but <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+fast+are+houseflies" target="_blank">I asked Google</a> and they only go about 5 miles per hour. That means a baseball pitcher can throw a fastball <strong>20 times as fast as a housefly flies</strong>.</p>
<p>Not only are they actually super slow (if you don't let the size trick you), they also weigh almost nothing. Like, it would take about 200 flies to add up to the weight of a single ping pong ball, according to some quick Googling/converting.</p>
<p>So your ping pong ball full of cool whip is actually super tough, reaaally slow, and unbelievably lightweight, meaning that dumb little fly was <em>designed</em> to fly into the window several thousand times before it finds the opening. Evolution at work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's partly low mass and their exoskeleton, but that isn't the entire reason.</p>
<p>It's because of the square - cube law. </p>
<p>This principle states that, as a shape (or creature) grows in size, its volume (and weight) grows faster than its surface area. So when the fly hits the wall, there is less weight dispersed over a larger surface area (relatively) than a larger creature.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law</a></p>
<p>This is also why children can comfortably sit on their knees,  but adults can't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short and sweet answer is that they have such a small mass and move so slowly.</p>
<p>Let's say you have an average housefly named Luke Flywalker. Luke has a mass of 12mg (0.000012kg) and has a max flying speed of 5mph (2.235 m/s). You find him resting on a delicious plate of mac &amp; cheese that you want to eat so you swat him. </p>
<p>Scared for his tiny life, he instantly engages his tiny thrusters to make the jump to flyperspace and starts flying away as fast as he can, reaching max speed after flying for 1 full second. Let's also say that the idea of being smushed has brought back haunting trash compactor memories (from a sleep-over at his dad's house a long time ago) so terrifying that he doesn't pay attention to where he's going and flies right into a glass window as soon as he hits max speed. This gives the fly an acceleration of 2.235 (m/s)/s at the time of impact.</p>
<p>Now, the Force (hehe) equals mass multiplied by acceleration (F=ma). So if this young Jedfly reached his max speed at the instant of impact, he would still only strike it with a Force of 0.00002682 Newtons (0.000012kg x 2.235m/s^2).</p>
<p>So since 1 lbf (pound-force) is equal to 4.48 Newtons, Luke Flywalker flying at max speed into a window only puts 0.00000603 lbs of force in his body and he is free to eat your food another day.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the square-cubed law. Basically as things get smaller they get stronger proportional to their weight. The idea is that strength is mostly determined by the cross sectional area of whatever it is you are measuring, which increases with the square of the dimensions. The weight usually increases with the cube of the dimension. So if you have a rectangular bar and double its size its strength will increase four times, but it's weight will increase by eight times making it half as strong for its weight. This is also why ants can lift six times their body weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in their chemical composition but in their physical composition. Bathroom usually means ceramic tile and porcelain and kitchen usually means linoleum, stainless steel, and veneer cabinetry. </p>
<p>Ceramics are hard. In fact they are some of the hardest materials found in most homes short of glass, silica, or diamond. So a bathroom cleaner will usually contain a softer but abrasive agent to help scrub dirt and grime off of tiles but without scratching them. Because tile and porcelain are so hard, you can use some pretty abrasive stuff without fear of scratching them. However if you use them on plastics, linoleum, or veneers they can scratch and gouge them. </p>
<p>Some of the most abrasive cleaners will have warnings about which surfaces they can be used on. Their abrasive qualities however make quick work of hard water stains and soap scum such as in a shower or toilet. You wouldn't want to use them on a stainless steel sink though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The kitchen often have a lot of grease and requires cleaning agents that can dissolve fat. Bathrooms on the other hand will have more salts which have come with the water and gets excreted when the water slows down. So you need different kinds of solvents to get rid of the salts. You also need to take care when using a cleaner in the kitchen as trace elements might more easily end up in the food. So you have to use chemicals that is safe to consume and not alter the taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
