		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To begin, a Calorie isn't exactly &quot;absorbed.&quot; All a kcal is is a measurement of energy required to raise the temperature of one kg of water 1 degree celsius at 1 atmospheric pressure. And, in physics, the amount energy in the universe is fixed. We use the energy, but release energy as well as heat, as matter, etc.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, your body definitely would metabolize 2,000 Calories in one sitting versus several days completely differently. Your stomach generally holds onto food for 3 - 6 hours, depending on how much fat content is in it; fats take longer to break down because they must be emulsified first, and then broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, absorbed through your intestines into lacteals, which are a part of your lymphatic system, and then disbursed throughout your body.</p>
<p>The biggest factor to consider concerning metabolization and Caloric intake is which type of macro nutrient we are talking about. Ignoring vitamins and minerals, fats, carbohydrates, and proteins are broken down in different ways. Simple sugars and carbohydrates are the easiest to break down, and are a preferred source of energy in some ways, because of their high bioavalibility; sugar is excellent for bursts of energy, ya know, to outrun lions, or catch the rabbit for food. Fats require a lot of oxidation to be utilized, so when you are walking, sitting, sleeping, studying, pooping, or anything that does not raise your heart rate very much, (IE: using oxygen rapidly as energy in conjunction with sugar for your muscle cells) your body will use the oxygen to oxidize fats for energy. This is why we say fats give 9kcal per gram. Proteins are a different beast, that I will not get into.</p>
<p>TLDR; the way Calories are metabolized depends on the activity you are, or are not doing. And, there is a timer in which foods consumed will be utilized for energy, or stored for later use, and this time period is just a handful of hours--much less than one day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of depends. Mostly depends on the type of food.</p>
<p>Your body is going to do its darndest to absorb all the calories that it can. most of the time it does a pretty good job, but sometimes things make it down far enough into the intestines that gut bacteria get to eat some of it - oftentimes this leads to what we call indigestion.</p>
<p>If you spread out 2000 calories of normal food over a 5 day period, your body will get pretty much every bit of nutrition (calories, this case) that it can. If you eat 2000 calories worth of fat and sugar in one sitting, your body can pretty much get all those calories into your bloodstream where they will be dealt with in one manner or another. If you eat 2000 calories of tough meat, high fiber foods, and other tough to digest foods, and if you eat it all in one sitting, a portion of the meal will move down the intestinal tract before being absorbed, and a bit of it will be utilized by bacteria or be left over in your fecal matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

For a while I was eating like a king at home, but then packing bullshit ass lunches to try to lose weight. Now I ride my bike to and from work, eat like a king at work, and on my days off veg out and lay off the carbs; Essentially carb cycling.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economics student here with a focus on developmental economics. I'm late to the party but hopefully a few people can get me some upvotes for visibility.</p>
<p>Africa is impoverished for many reasons. </p>
<p>In no particular order, I will list some:</p>
<h1>All tropical areas tend to be more impoverished because they are more prone to disease</h1>
<p>-- You may notice that Northern areas and very Southern areas tend to be better off than Equitorial areas, especially wet ones. Places like the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Argentina used to be among that list of prosperous countries but had bad governance, and Chile is now quickly joining them. </p>
<p>This is because of disease. Until very, very recently (as in, since maybe the 1980s) people in those areas could not rely on being healthy tomorrow. Tropical diseases of many sorts, as well as diseases also common to temperate areas, ravaged them. This leaves working age people disabled or dead. Without a good ratio of healthy people to sick, an economy cannot be productive.</p>
<h1>Africa has suffered from bad governance</h1>
<p>--Since European contact, Africa has suffered from bad governance -- mostly from Europeans but also from African leadership as well. For a few hundred years, Europeans <strong>really</strong> wrecked the place with extortive policies aimed to overtly impoverish the population. This eased European rule and thus the capacity for Europeans to extract what they wanted from the area.  </p>
<p>Immediately upon independence, bad governance continued in many, but not all areas. Why? </p>
<p>Because those areas wanted to practice <em>autarky</em> (autarky is the opposite of free trade &amp; open migration -- Trump loves autarky if that makes it easier to understand). Why did they want to practice this policy?</p>
<p>They wanted to close their borders because of their history of subjugation at the hands of foreigners. So they decided to not trade with anyone, not accept investment, and not allow labor migration. </p>
<p>This left them without a means to transfer technologies from more technological areas, and without a way to get out of destitute poverty since they could not generate investment from exports or from foreign aid, or from foreign direct investment. They couldn't build industries at home because they had no source of income.</p>
<p>Today, many many African countries are much better managed. But, they've got a lot of growing to do. Nigeria, Botswana, and Kenya are some of the best examples of growing prosperity.</p>
<h1>Africa has recently been suffering from armed conflict, as is common among newly independent states</h1>
<p>-- Whether it was the fall of apartheid, the genocide in Rwanda, child soldiers in Sierra Leone and Uganda, or the ongoing civil war in the Congo, many Africans have not had their most fundamental need -- safety -- met. Without safety there is usually economic contraction, and often it is severe. This means that these areas, which were already poor, become more destroyed and more poor due to ongoing war. </p>
<p>Any political revolution, on the short and medium term, tends to cause economic contraction due to a loss of faith in contracts and jeopardizing safety. Some revolutions tend to cause economic growth -- sometimes huge growth -- on the long term. An example of this is of course the American revolution. Another would be the fall of Apartheid, from the fall of Apartheid until the rise of Jacob Zuma South Africa had very robust growth (but Zuma killed that with tribalist division).</p>
<h1>Africa lacks mature, essential institutions.</h1>
<p>This one can unfortunately be blamed mostly on colonial powers, as most African nations haven't been independent long enough to have developed fundamental institutions. It also falls as part of bad governance, but should be cited on its own.</p>
<p>While public schooling in Africa is becoming fairly common <strong>now</strong>, previous generations often were illiterate or had not finished elementary school. So, until this generation grows up the workforce in Africa -- while cheap -- is unviable. Sure, African workers will work for less than those in Bangladesh... but they can't read. They can't read instructions. Again, not all. The region is in a period of huge transition right now and places like, say, Kenya or Botswana, or South Africa are much further along than, say, the former Zaire or Sierra Leone. </p>
<p>Additionally, they lack banking industry. They lack large corporations and large bureaucratic structures. They lack a fully fleshed out police force especially in rural areas. A farmer in Namibia cannot, unlike an American farmer, enter in to a long term contract with a large purchaser to sell all of his, say, grain for the next two years at a fixed price. He can't do this because there aren't good courts and if there were then even if he won there aren't police out in the boonies where he lives to make the person pay him. He has his word, his family, and their collective weaponry to enforce agreements, and that's it. This limits the capability of investment and tends to cause disastrously volatile pricing which is extremely dependent on local conditions for that season. </p>
<h1>The keys to prosperity in this world are fairly intuitive.</h1>
<p>We need safety -- not only from violence, but from disease and dirty water too. Then, we need justice. -- those in power cannot be performing backhanded deals or serving their own profit. Finally, we need to be open -- freely exchanging with our fellow man and allowing the inflows and outflows of goods and people.</p>
<p>Africa had none of these things until recently. Now they need time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: It is my opinion that the hypothesis I've written about below is one that <em>adds</em> to the discussion rather than explains entirely why Africa has had developmental problems.  I am also aware that aspects of it may sound racist, however that does not warrant completely ignoring the hypothesis.  It's not my hypothesis, and while I do believe it may have some truth, I don't fully agree with it nor the economists who espouse it.</p>
<p>There is a fascinating concept called the &quot;geography hypothesis&quot; that might explain the economic hardships faced by subsaharan Africa.  There are wide ranging causes of economic despair across the globe.  When looking at a globe however, there seems to be a noticeable divide between the wealthy nations and nations with low income levels.  Nations that lie in the tropics are on the wrong side of the tracks when it comes to economic prosperity.  According to economist Ricardo Hausmann, these tracks exist at twenty degrees latitude and nations below this line are cursed with stagnant, declining, or slow economic growth rates as well as noticeably shorter life expectancy rates.   Nations in the temperate zones exhibit overwhelming economic success by comparison.  The temperate zones contain twenty-seven of the thirty wealthiest nations, the three exceptions being Brunei, Hong Kong, and Singapore.   These nations seemed to have escaped the curse by having extensive coastlines allowing them access to global markets.  Singapore for example is a small and flat island with few natural resources other than, arguably, the sea that surrounds it and allows the nation to enjoy low import and export costs.   The rest of the tropical zone is not so lucky, and economists who subscribe to the geography hypothesis have three main reasons for this: the tropics are geographically prone to diseases, tropical agriculture cannot use technology from other geographic zones because the different climates produce equally different crops, and the countless landlocked nations of the tropics face exorbitantly high transportation costs for imports and exports.  Many nations in the tropics face all three of these geographical obstacles simultaneously, and without the resources to overcome them these nations will continue to experience little or no growth.</p>
<p>Malaria is a useful example to study for this topic due to the vast amount of data collected on the disease, and it has such strong associations with the economically impoverished tropics that it has been dubbed the ‘disease of the poor’.   Ninety-eight percent of all malaria deaths occur in thirty-five countries, five of which are in Asia and the other thirty are in Sub-Saharan Africa.   Malaria is often treatable depending on the severity of the strain, however the most severe strains are virtually exclusive to Sub-Saharan Africa where they cause jaundice and frequent loss of consciousness in their victims.  The disease also claims more lives there than anywhere else.   One out of every twenty children under the age of five in Sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria and adults, while more likely to survive, suffer frequent and long-term debilitation.   The crippling effect malaria has on workforces in Sub-Saharan Africa has made investors wary and growth elusive.  The disease has effectively isolated the region from international trade and tourism by raising transactions costs to prohibitively high levels.   This unfortunate reality is sustained by the geographic attributes of the topics.  The tropical climate allows malaria to thrive year round, whereas colder temperatures spare temperate zones from having to contend with the disease as an economic hurdle.  Malaria continues to pester tropical economies as relentlessly as the mosquitos that spread it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Born and bred West African here who spent the first 24 years of his life on my beloved continent. Problem numero uno in my opinion is bad leadership. One thing you always have to remember about Sub Saharan Africa is that a lot of these nations are artificial non homogeneous creations by European powers. Take my home nation of Nigeria as an example. There are three ethnic groups within its borders with populations of over 20 million each. Sure they may have all looked black to the British but these groups are as culturally and linguistically different as Russians are from Chinese (if you think this is not a problem, imagine aliens invading Earth and declaring that henceforth, Greece, Turkey and Russia will be one country). Throw in another four or five groups with populations roughly equivalent to that of Ireland and another 20 or so numbering over a million and you have a recipe for chaos as individual groups jostled for power. It's no accident that the Nigeria of my childhood was wracked by constant military coups. In such a situation, it's not the cream of the crop with drive and vision who rise to leadership. It's the most brutish and the most unscrupulous who force themselves into positions of authority.</p>
<p>Something else people tend to forget is that the colonial period is still relatively recent. When I was a toddler, Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique were still engaged in conflicts related to their wars for independence. Apartheid was still a thing in South Africa. Heck, 7 years before I was born my own country was engaged in civil war. These conflicts were devastating and take time to recover from.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm optimistic about Africa. I believe the younger generation are far less hung about ethnic identity than previous generations. People now take as much pride in being Nigerian, Senegalese or Ghanaian as they do in being Igbo, Wolof, Yoruba, Akan etc. Skilled African migrants are returning home to setup businesses as a kind of reverse brain drain. The internet has made the world a lot smaller and you can sit in a small village and pick up valuable skills by browsing MIT Courseware. The politicians are still no prize but they are a lot better than they were when I was growing up.</p>
<p>I choose to remain positive. Give it 50 years and I think this is a story that turns out well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably going to get buried in the comments but Paul Colliers book titled, <em>The bottom billion</em> does a great job explaining this. He boils down poverty and economic disparity to these 4 main problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Never-ending conflict (countries plagued with conflict will never be economically successful in any meaningful way. Without security there's no economic success)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The natural resource trap (poor nations who are blessed with a few natural resources that should theoretically make them rich end up squandering the money and concentrating all their efforts into these resources while neglecting all other industries)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being landlocked (Surprisingly this actually has a huge impact on the success of developing nations. Countries on the coast or those with access to the sea have a greater ability to trade and move around goods and people. If you're landlocked then you're in trouble because you're dependent on neighbours for trade and if they happen to be a neighbour that's in conflict, poor or badly run then it's not just unfortunate but your own economy will suffer as a result). </p>
</li>
<li>Bad governance (this one pretty much speaks for itself and unfortunately most countries in sub-Saharan africa suffer from this)</li>
</ol>
<p>The book goes into depth about all these points but it's easy to read and really informative. Highly recommend!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're asking about Sub-Saharan Africa, yes? Because the African Mediterranean coastline has always done pretty okay, at least in comparison to parts further south. And it ought to be pretty clear why <em>Saharan</em> Africa is pretty poor: for the most part it's a godawful wasteland where almost nobody lives. So I'm assuming that you're really interested in Sub-Saharan Africa here.</p>
<p>As to that, the simplest answer I can come up with is that Africa is a continent where just about everything wants you dead, from lions on the macro scale, to microbes on the micro scale. </p>
<p>European explorers/colonists travelling to Africa had a distinct tendency to <em>die like flies</em>. There's a reason European countries spent almost three centuries colonizing North and South America before seriously turning their attention to Africa (which they'd <em>always</em> known about!), and this is a big part of it. Infectious diseases endemic in Africa--yellow fever and malaria in particular--contributed to such a high European mortality rate that Africa was known as the &quot;white man's grave,&quot; and not for no reason. The climate is about as fantastic a breeding ground for the spread of infectious disease as one could imagine. The parts of Africa that aren't tropical are sub-tropical. It almost <em>never</em> freezes, meaning microbes and the bugs that carry them never have to go dormant. </p>
<p>Well if Europeans died in such large numbers, how did Africans survive? Part of the answer is that African populations do seem to have developed a certain resistance to some of the more common tropical diseases. For example, there's a recessive genetic disease, sickle-cell disease, that's pretty miserable for people who have it. But for people with only one copy of the gene carrying the sickle-cell traits, it provides a fairly robust resistance to malaria. Sickle-cell carriers can get malaria, but it's a lot less severe when they do get it. There are some other examples, but that's a classic one.</p>
<p>But the other part of the answer to how Africans survived in places Europeans died so much is that they <em>basically didn't</em>. European mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa during the colonial period could be fairly described as &quot;catastrophic&quot;. African mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa during the colonial period, by contrast, could be described as merely &quot;pretty damned bad&quot;. Life-expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa has pretty consistently been among the lowest in the world for a <em>very</em> long time. Assuming the lions (or whatever) didn't eat you, and the monsoons cooperated to the point that you could bring in at least <em>something</em> in the way of crops, there was <em>still</em> a really decent chance you were going to catch some bug and die. </p>
<p>There are certainly other reasons. European colonial misadventures certainly didn't do the continent any <em>favors</em>, that's for damned sure, and certainly contributed to Africa <em>staying</em> poor a lot longer than most of the rest of the world. But Africa has trailed more temperate regions in terms of physical prosperity for a <em>very</em> long time. It's just a really tough place to live. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't switch just because a new president arrives. </p>
<p>Air Force One is piloted by Air Force pilots (typically O-6, O-5 or O-4 - very senior guys - it's a high profile gig) and each tour of duty (like the rest in the military) typically lasts 3-5 years, so they will naturally rotate out over time during a presidency and overlap with multiple Presidents depending on timing in their career.</p>
<p>edit: </p>
<p>Here's a great National Geographic Documentary on this and what goes into planning each mission: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKRQyDsKODE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKRQyDsKODE</a></p>
<p>edit2:
/u/since_ever_since mentioned that only full bird (O-6) colonel's could be Aircraft Commander of AF1. The other pilots/navigators could be lower ranks. It is a prestigious gig, so pilots are typically selected for it as a good deal tour of duty</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When they decimalised, they found people worked in shillings. So they came up with a system where the cent was similar in value to the old penny, and 10 cents was a worth one old shilling. To keep it decimal, they needed a new currency worth 100 cents, and so they picked the name &quot;dollar&quot; because it's understood as a currency name, and other proposals were unpopular.</p>
<p>Other countries weren't straight for their own currency, and adopted a decimal currency with a similar value to their neighbours. Dollars were recognizably different from pounds, so made sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Spanish Dollar (aka &quot;pieces of eight&quot;) weighed about the same as a Crown coin.  A crown was worth 5 shillings or 100 pence, so it was the natural unit to convert to when you're trying to decimalize with existing coins.  Also, during the 19th century the Japanese, French,  Americans, and British minted &quot;trade dollars&quot; of equal weight to the Spanish dollar as it had become the de facto currency of trade in Asia.  So to many the Trade Dollar appeared to be on its way to being a global currency.  This notion fell apart in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The UK did not do this because they decimalized very late and was less interested in fixing value to the pence or the crown but in retaining the &quot;very British&quot; pound.  So they kept the unit and reminted all the coins (which is more expensive, but not as challenging in the modern age).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>German: Thaler</p>
<p>Dutch: Daalder</p>
<p>In English, these became dollar. The dollar was a silver coin minted by a variety of Dutch &amp; German countries. And Bohemia. Yes, the Netherlands used the guilder as their currency before the Euro - that was their name for their gold coin. We're talking about silver here, which is far more widespread &amp; important.</p>
<p>The Dutch were heavily involved in international trade, including the fur trade in North America. So the word stuck. More importantly, the Spanish were minting galleon-loads of silver pesos like you wouldn't believe. From Mexico, and especially from Potosi. Potosi was a mountain made of so much silver it basically destabilized both Europe and China because it caused so much inflation. Pesos, pesos everywhere! In fact, our dollar sign probably comes from the mint-mark for Potosi coins.</p>
<p>English-language countries continued to use the word dollar for pesos because both coins contained the same amount of silver. In contrast, British pounds were heavier, containing more silver than a dollar/peso. With the wide-spread Spanish minting, the Spanish weight (also the dollar weight) became the international standard. And as other posters mentioned, Britain kept most of its gold &amp; silver in the domestic market.</p>
<p>So all around the world in British colonies people were using daadlers-called-dollars and pesos-called-dollars. But they couldn't call them the pound - because pounds are a different weight.</p>
<p>Paper currency without inherent value doesn't become common until after all these countries gained independence. If it had, those former colonies probably would be using something called the pound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>However, if you are asking about &quot;larger scale&quot; quantum phenomena, especially with respect to consciousness, etc., that is currently unknown, and there are various ideas floating around about those possibilities. </p>
<p>That being said, a really interesting example of quantum phenomena underlying a <em>very</em> important feature of biology and ecology on our planet is photosynthesis, which cannot occur without some specific &quot;quantum phenomena&quot;. I'm hazy on the details as this came out a few years ago, but it has to do with how photon energy is captured and transmitted through part of the molecular chain that allows for the absorption (and subsequent conversion into chemical energy) of sunlight. This process underlies the majority of the energy storage and accumulation in our entire ecological system and food chain...! I'll try and find a source but I'm on my phone. </p>
<p>Edit: here's a quick link, but there are better sources with more details of course.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP basically wants to know is if macroscopic neural behavior is freed from being completely deterministic by quantum effects. Every neuron has some threshold where it will either fire or not. If there is sufficient quantum noise and a neuron is close enough to that threshold, it may be impossible to predict if/when it will fire. If this happens often enough in the brain, since that neuron will fire off to maybe 10,000 other neurons, this could possibly make the large scale activity of the brain non-deterministic to some degree. It depends on how often, if ever, some kind of quantum randomness determines if a neuron fires or not when it is close to that threshold.</p>
<p>I would assume that if you were able to connect a neuron to a computer that controls its inputs and reads its output, and given random inputs it's able to guess it's output to a high enough degree of accuracy you could prove that quantum effects have no significant large scale effect on brain activity.</p>
<p>I think the answer is basically, no one knows for sure yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a quantum hypothesis for sense of smell that has some support from the neuroscience community. By no means is it the dominant view. </p>
<p>Here's a quick comparison between the quantum and non-quantum hypotheses. </p>
<p>We smell things like farts when little shit particles enter our nostril and interact with our smell receptors. The dominant view is that this interaction is best understood at the molecular level with a lock-and-key type mechanism. Our smell receptors are little lock-shaped molecules floating on cell membrane (our smell cell's membrane) and the shit particles look like little keys that only fit into certain locks (smell receptors) if they have the right shape. So we smell a fart when the shit particle unlocks the fart smell reaction.</p>
<p>That's the non-quantum, molecular view of how we smell. The quantum view is that it's not a lock and key mechanism that depends on the molecular shape. It's sensing infrared molecular vibrations through quantum tunneling. This is a distinctly quantum mechanism that can't be explain by the lock and key mechanism. </p>
<p>You can put the two explanations to the test with the following experiment. Offer people two versions of the same shit particle and see if they can distinguish between them. The particles have the same shape, but differ in the atomic isotopes used to construct them. The different isotopes would confer different vibrational frequencies to the shit particle without changing its shape. </p>
<p>There is evidence that animals can tell the difference between isotopes, but the studies have their flaws. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Although this is just an example it can be applied to most if not all urban centres. Since a city will have large amounts of paved surfaces (skyscraper window reflection affects this too) this increases the temperature of the city and is called a heat island. Also the lack of respiration due to lack of trees increases the temperature. Typically these centres will be anywhere from 5-10 C hotter than forested or rural areas. Although this increases the actual temperature of a city, it does not create more GhG emissions.</p>
<p>edit: the increase in temperature may not be as drastic as 5-10C in all areas, I know in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area, this is the case for Toronto's heat island, the case varies among cities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Research and Practical Meteorologist here:</p>
<p>There are two effects that dark, paved surfaces have.</p>
<p>The first is discussed in several other comments the &quot;Urban Heat Island Effect&quot;.  That is a result of three primary factors -
1) Decreased Albedo
2) Increased Thermal Mass (capacity to hold heat)
3) Loss of other &quot;systems&quot; that control heat flow in nature (plant transpiration/respiration cycles, surface water evaporation and surface water movement)</p>
<p>These effects play out on the micro-&gt;mesoscale and, at least to my knowledge, exist largely in a &quot;we know they occur, they could easily have an effect, but we don't really know how to incorporate them&quot;.</p>
<p>The second, more subtle and &quot;insidious&quot; effect is the hyper local effects that urbanization has on temperature MEASUREMENTS.  These are all on the microscale.</p>
<p>There are supposed to be rules about where the thermometers go and how high off the ground they are, and for the most part they are followed, but not always.</p>
<p>My experiences in military aviation forecasting saw things as simple as cutting the grass around the ASOS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_airport_weather_station" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_airport_weather_station</a>) could result in a increase in measured temperature of ~3-5 degrees F... which can be enough on a hot day to cancel outdoor PT on a military base.</p>
<p>This is the effect that gets climate change deniers all bound up in false data... it's also one of the primary effects that data scientists attempt to correct for.
The classic case is the thermometer that used to be on the roof of a wooden post office at the edge of town, gets moved to the top of a metal warehouse surrounded by an asphalt parking lot that is not in &quot;downtown&quot;.</p>

<p>Additionally, when the urban area is on or close to a coast or coastal area, the heated rain run-off (from the hot streets) when dumped into the local body of water can cause explosive growth of certain toxic organism (&quot;red tide&quot; comes immediately to mind) which have been known to wipe out all the marine life in the body of water due to several factors, but usually due to oxygen deprivation to the animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Don't receive the proper amount of oxygen your body needs, and blood flow begins to thin out. This thinning out will shrink your blood vessels at and near your eye or possibly bleed, causing the black tint. 2. Your eyes move around a lot, so the longer you're awake and use your eyes, the more tired the muscles in your arm gets, let's excess blood or fluid in the tissue around your eye, giving you the black tint.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an ideal ratio of protons to neutrons for an atomic nucleus to be stable.  Even when their protons and neutrons are at the right ratio, big atoms have a nucleus that is kind of wobbly and unstable to begin with.  Over time those big atoms, left to their own devices, will tend to split into fragments.  This is called <em>radioactivity</em>.  Exactly what fragments an atom splits into depends on what kind of atom it is (which is determined by how many protons and neutrons were there in the first place).</p>
<p>When a big atom gets hit by a neutron, an already-unstable atom has its proton-to-neutron ratio suddenly be &quot;wrong.&quot;  Which causes it to become extremely unstable and split into fragments almost instantly.  A bunch of binding energy is released which causes the fragments to fly apart, like what happens when you cut a tight-stretched rubber band.  How fast atoms are moving determines <em>temperature</em>, so when an atom is split, it creates heat as well as fragments.</p>
<p>Leo Szilard, a Jewish physicist who left Germany when Hitler became chancellor, realized that if we could find some atom that splits into fragments that include multiple neutrons, you could create a <em>chain reaction</em>.  In a chain reaction, one atom breaks and releases two neutrons, which breaks two more atoms, which releases four more neutrons, which breaks four more atoms, which releases eight neutrons...Szilard convinced other influential physicists, including Einstein, to advise the US government that this was possible and might be able to be used to create a powerful bomb.</p>
<p>If you have only a small amount of the right kind of atom, the chain reaction can't get properly started -- too many neutrons escape off the edges of the sample.  But once you have enough atoms -- a condition called <em>critical mass</em> -- the chain reaction will be able to sustain itself.  If you're just over critical mass, the sample will start to heat up and get hotter and hotter until it melts itself and its container, this is called <em>meltdown</em> (the flow will eventually spread it out enough that it stops being critical and cools down, but before that it can cause lots of damage in places that are difficult / impossible to safely repair because of radioactivity).  If you have way more than critical mass,  then incredible amounts of heat and neutrons will be produced very quickly, which causes an enormous explosion.</p>
<p>One use of this chain reaction phenomenon is to build a power plant:  Use neutron absorbing rods which can be inserted/removed from a sample to keep it near critical mass, enough so that it heats up enough to boil water to create steam and generate power, but not to the point of meltdown. Another use is to build a bomb:  Use regular explosives to smash two samples together to create a single sample far above critical mass, which will cause a very powerful explosion.</p>
<p>The right kind of atom for this process, a kind of uranium, turns out to be fairly common all over Earth, but since it is unstable, a lot of it has split into fragments over the billions of years that have passed since it was formed.  The remaining amounts of useful uranium are mixed with large amounts of useless uranium that doesn't release multiple neutrons.  So the useful uranium needs to be separated from the useless uranium.</p>
<p>Normally when scientists or engineers want to separate things, they will rely on different properties of the things they want to separate.  For example, you can melt the sample and let the liquid settle into different layers (taking advantage of different liquid density).  Or by making the sample hot enough for only one of the mixed things to boil away (taking advantage of different boiling points).  Or by adding chemicals which react differently with the things they want to separate (taking advantage of different chemistry).  But none of this works for uranium, because the two kinds of uranium are very similar and have almost identical properties.</p>
<p>The best method they found for separating uranium involves vaporizing the uranium into gas and then spinning the gas really fast with a machine called a <em>gas centrifuge</em>.  The two different kinds of atoms weigh different amounts, allowing the right kind of uranium to be separated and purified.  This process is incredibly expensive and inefficient, which is a good thing.  Hobbyists or terrorists can improvise regular bombs fairly easily, but can't feasibly build a nuclear bomb in their backyard.  Even for a government, in the age of satellites it's not really feasible to hide the enormous facilities needed, so countries basically know which other countries can / are trying to build bombs, and can pressure each other not to create weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a nuclear weapon uses fissile material. A fissile material is one that both undergoes fission (the atoms of a given isotope are unstable and will decay) and can sustain chain reactions (a decay byproduct includes neutrons that strike adjacent isotopes that cause them to decay). This is primarily Plutonium and Uranium, and I think there's one or two others that are fissile. You can also &quot;breed&quot; fissile materials, which is how we get plutonium from uranium, and thorium will break down into uranium.  So of the few isotopes that are fissile, U235 is preferred over U233 because it's more energetic, and Pu239 is preferred over Pu241 for the same reason. Plutonium is preferred over uranium because it's much more energetic, meaning they need a lot, lot less, but uranium is used often enough because it has a longer shelf life and is more abundant.</p>
<p>The goal of kicking off a nuclear explosion is to get the fissile material to go &quot;super critical&quot;, in that chain reactions occur at an exponential rate. They do that by compressing the &quot;configuration&quot; (shape is as important as total mass) to where the neutrons from decay can't be avoided and there's a cascade effect.</p>
<p>There are two ways of doing this.</p>
<p>One is the &quot;gun type&quot; weapon, where a &quot;puck&quot; of uranium is fired into a &quot;plug&quot; of the same. The puck is fired using conventional explosives down the barrel of a cannon, and the plug is at the end. The two smash into one another and compress. It takes about 90-120 lbs of uranium to pull this off. It can't be done with plutonium because reasons...</p>
<p>The other method is the &quot;implosion type.&quot; A hollow sphere is encased with conventional explosives which are detonated in a precisely timed sequence so the shockwaves evenly compress the fissile material. It takes about 30 lbs of uranium or as little as 4.5 lbs of plutonium. The configuration is extremely important, the shape of the mass, the explosives, the shockwave, the timing... These are complex weapons to get right.</p>
<p>A hydrogen boosted weapon uses a glass bead of hydrogen inside the fissile sphere, the nucleus of hydrogen is a neutron. It only takes about 100 hydrogen atoms to get a sufficient multiplier in efficiency.</p>
<p>There are other things you can add to increase efficiency, such as beryllium on the outside to reflect neutrons back into the mass, and lithium-6 and lithium-7 which rapidly decays, releasing neutrons. Castle Bravo was the largest test shot by the US because we miscalculated what lithium-7 would do. At 15 MT, it was several orders of magnitude larger than expected.</p>
<p>A thermonuclear bomb uses hydrogen like a boosted weapon, but the goal is to use the nuclear explosion to generate heat and compression to cause the hydrogen to fuse into helium, lithium, and beryllium. Castle Bravo was also the first thermonuclear test.</p>
<p>You can actually use a nuclear weapon to kick off another nuclear weapon. Instead of surrounding a core with conventional explosives, surround it with nuclear weapons! These are multi stage nuclear weapons, and they make very big booms. Russia built the largest such weapon called the Tsar Bomba, and it used 3 stages. The bomb itself was so big the carrier had to be gutted and modified to hold it, and it hung out the bottom of the plane. They wanted to demonstrate a 100 MT explosion but such a detonation would have covered the Earth in 1/4 worth of all nuclear fallout of all weapons ever tested to that date, so they dialed it back to a 57 MT explosion.</p>
<p>In 1815, Mount Tambora, a volcano, exploded, completely obliterating the island it was on and killing <em>everyone instantly</em> in the surrounding <em>100 or so miles</em>. So much ash was thrown into the atmosphere, 1816 was in perpetual winter, world wide. It was called the year without a summer. That explosion was estimated to be around 400 MT, just for comparison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear fission starts when a neutron hits a heavy nucleus, the reaction produces more neutrons and so on and so on. The more atoms you have in a contained space the faster fission will be and more energy will be created. Uranium fueled nuclear bomb is a ball of uranium surrounded by an explosive. During ignition the explosive is pressing the atoms together going to critical mass(when fission is self sustained) and over that to the point when a lot of fission happens at once producing a lot of light and heat. Little boy contained 64.1 kg of U-235 but only 0.8 kg went through fission and only 0.1% of that was changed directly to heat and light. The rest 63.3 kg was scattered around Hiroshima during the blast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The rest of the special physics is trapping the very rare and unstable radioactive materials in a casing where they can be forced together well enough that the first 10% of the reaction doesn't just vaporize the rest of the weapon.  It's very difficult, and mostly against international treaties, to make them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gluons and quarks are subject to the strong force. This makes them special because they can never appear by themselves. Their attraction to other strongly interacting particles is so large, that if you were to try and pull them apart to examine one by itself, the field lines connecting them would snap and create more particles which then serve to pair up the particles you were trying to pull apart. [Sort of a cartoon explanation obviously.]</p>
<p>Another answer mentioned glueballs. It is true that this is a particle in the standard model which would be made of nothing but gluons However, in practice, it is not really a particle so much as a &quot;intermediate broad resonance&quot;, Because as a particle it is so unstable that its existence itself isn't really a sensible way to describe it. It is more like an intermediate state in a long near-instantaneous decay chain of QCD hadron states, which decay their way towards sort of stable particles like pions and truly stable particles like protons.</p>
<p>However, interestingly, it is possible to imagine theories of QCD [The strong attraction] which do not have a light quarks. In that case, the glueball would kind of be the equivalent of the proton, meaning it is the stable form of matter in this theory sector. Furthermore, it is possible that this is realized in nature, but that we just do not yet see these interactions and particles. They could be related to dark matter, or be part of a meta stable &quot;hidden sector&quot; of particles and forces co-existing with our own, but only extremely weekly coupled to us (I.e. Standard Model particles).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
