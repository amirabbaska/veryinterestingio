		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no known mechanism by which the particles &quot;send a message&quot; to one another. The phenomenon is the result of creating a system of two or more particles whose wavefunctions depend upon one another. By measuring an aspect of one particle, its wavefunction is collapsed to known value, which causes the other particle's wavefunction to be known as the other value.</p>
<p>For example, take two electrons that are known to have a total spin of 0. Each electron has a 50% chance of being measured to be either spin-up or spin-down. If you separate them, each will still have a 50% chance.</p>
<p>However, if you separate them without changing their spin, and then measure electron 1 to be spin-up, then you will find that electron 2 is spin-down 100% of the time. How does it know that electron 1 is spin-up? Nobody really knows. It's an active area of research, however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A specific example of entanglement can be represented mathematically as |11&gt; + |00&gt;, where |XY&gt; is a notation that means &quot;first particle is in state X and second in state Y&quot;, and the + really means that they are in both situation (00 and 11) at the same time, not either one but a superposition of both.</p>
<p>For our example, that means you have a superposition of both particles 0 or both particles 1. Now when you measure the first particle you will not measure a superposition,  what you can get is either 1 or 0 as a result. For the sake of argument, let's  say you get 1. You know -- if you knew the state beforehand -- that the only state in which the first particle was in state 1 was |11&gt;, so now you know that the second one is also in state 1.</p>
<p>That's entanglement in a nutshell.</p>
<p>The real weirdness appears when you separate the two particles before measuring them, so that they can't know that the other particle was measured, even if they'd have communicated at lightspeed somehow. It will still stay consistent and the statistics can be shown to be different than that of particles that'd have been fixed at either |00&gt; or |11&gt; without you knowing, i.e. not in a superposition. It's been showed experimentally in an experiment called the violation of Bell inequalities. Fun fact: Bell thought that his inequities would not be violated, but it was actually proved otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had two guns. One in each hand. You also had a stiff wooden plank strapped to your back, extending the length of your outstretched arms forcing you keep your arms at full length and you cannot bend your arms in any way. If you raise one arm, the other arm is forced to be lowered by the stiff wooden plank.</p>
<p>Now in the case where you always fire both guns at exactly the same time we can say that the position of the guns is related to each other, because of the stiff board forcing the direction of one gun to be effectively opposite of the other gun.</p>
<p>Raise one arm so the gun is pointing to the ceiling and fire. You make a hole in the ceiling but you also KNOW there MUST be a hole in the ground. It doesn't matter if the ground was 5 ft away or a mile ( lets assume the bullet can travel in a straight line for an infinite amount of distance and ignore real things like air resistance for now etc), you still know there's a hole in the ground.
When two photons are entangled, there's a similar dependency on each other for things like their position and momentum. When you have two detectors for use in a quantum experiment, which is measuring the output of a non-linear crystal that generates entangled pairs , your two detectors will always receive the two photons at exactly the same time, you'll get synchronous clicks.</p>
<p>Since you got this far, its time to have a little ''mind blown'' experimental example!</p>
<p>Take a laser, but this laser is a special one where you can get photons coming out both ends, instead of just one end. Turn down the intensity of this laser until your basically only getting one photon out of each end at a time and where these photons are quantum entangled.  </p>
<p>Photons can have a polarisation. This is basically an orientation of the direction in which the propagating electromagnetic wave travels. For linear polarisations this direction is constant with propagation and can take any angle between 0-360, where 0 is arbitrarily defined by you . Now the cool part. Polarisers are sheets of material with molecules arranged in their surface such that only specific polarisation states can pass through. The non red/blue type of 3D Glasses in cinemas these days are polarisers, so your left eye sees a different image to your right eye because one type of image is polarised in one direction vicea versa. Now lets say we put a horizontal linear polariser at some point in the path of one of the entangled photons. The polarisation of the photon is random, it can be horizontal, vertical , 45 degrees -45 degrees or any angle in between. </p>
<p>If its horizontal it gets through 100% of the time and if vertical is blocked. But something interesting happens at 45 degrees. it actually has a 50/50 chance of getting through or getting blocked. However, in the times when it gets through , its polarisation will actually flip to horizontal afterwards, kind of like throwing pennies at a slot machine, if you throw the penny exactly ride itll slide easily through the slot, throw it at a bit of an angle it might bounce off but maybe it 'chinks' through the slot, changing its orientation. </p>
<p>However, remember that other photon  we made which was flying off into the cosmos? Well since it was entangled with the first, if we had measured the polarisation of the first photon, we would know that the polarisation would be the same in the second photon. However, at the moment the first photon when it gets through the polariser and flips to horizontal, when it started at 45, the other photons also instantaneously flips to horizontal too. </p>
<p>No matter if its at the other side of the lab or the other side of the universe. </p>
<p>And no, this is not superluminal information transfer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it doesn’t happen instantaneously. For example if you have a particle in an excited state with one lower-energy state (the ground state), the time-dependence of the wavefunction is something like exp[iEt/<del>h</del>], where E is a “complex-valued energy”</p>
<p>E = E<em><em>0</em></em> - iΓ/2.</p>
<p>E<em><em>0</em></em> is the actual energy of the excited state, and Γ is the energy width. </p>
<p>If you calculate a probability density for a wavefunction of this form, you get something proportional to</p>
<p>exp[-Γt/<del>h</del>].</p>
<p>Notice that this is not an imaginary exponential, which is an oscillating function. This is a <strong>real</strong> exponential function, and it decays with time. This is the exact same exponential decay that you see in radioactivity.</p>
<p>So the probability density for finding the particle in the excited state decays exponentially in time; it doesn’t instantaneously change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the epidemic. For rare diseases that pop up now and then, like ebola, this was important because people wanted to know where ebola was coming from. Years could pass without a single known human having it, so it was coming from the environment, likely some kind of animal. After finding out &quot;patient zero&quot; for ebola outbreaks, you can look at where they lived, what they did, etc. to identify likely candidates for animal hosts, and then go into the wild and collect those animals to see if  they actually have the virus. If they do, then you can now warn everyone that this is how you get ebola, so they know to be cautious. </p>
<p>Studying diseases that can jump species barriers can also potentially teach us about which diseases might do this in the future, so we can be prepared just in case it happens. </p>
<p>If <em>very</em> little is known about the disease in question, tracing the path of transmission can tell you how the disease is spreading. Is it airborne? Does it live in the environment, or only within hosts? How long can it survive outside the host? Does it even spread from person to person, or were all those infected exposed to the same source, rather than one passing it to the other? Legionnaire's disease is like this, it DOES NOT spread from person to person, it spreads through inhaling contaminated water vapor. So if a group of people get it, we can look to see  what water sources they've been near, so that we can stop any more people from being infected by that source. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For once, a question that I am more than an armchair expert in! </p>
<p>So what you need to understand is that most geostationary communication satellites in use don't know anything about protocols, data, or anything else like that. They are simple dumb bent pipes in orbit. They simply take the radio signal that's transmitted to them, shift its frequency, amplifies it, and retransmits it back to the ground. They do not demodulate or decode what's being sent through them.</p>
<p>This is done for a couple of reasons. First, modems are power hungry and often sensitive to radiation. Putting that on a spacecraft increases your power demands, and thermal control issues. All of that reduces the power you have available for your transmitters. It's also, of course, impossible to service or uograde something once it's in orbit.</p>
<p>Because all of this, the standard option is to put the complex equipment on the ground where it's easy to power, cool, upgrade, and service.</p>
<p>Now as far as the second part of your question, it's a mix of protocols. The network I operate is just running standard IP (over HDLC). The trick is that all satellite modems include various forms of Forward Error Correction (FEC). This is basically redundant/checksum data that lets the far end modem reliably reconstruct the data, even in sub optimal conditions. The net result of that is as long as my signal to noise ratio is above a certain threshold, the link is quasi error free. Maybe one bit in a billion will be wrong. There is virtually no packet loss if designed right, the satellite link is really just like a (very) long serial cable.</p>
<p>Now latency is an issue, mostly when it comes to the TCP window size. I have Cisco WAAS deployed, which does a bunch of tricks to make things more useable. It fakes out the acks to get things going, does de-duplication and compression where it can, and a bunch of other things. The biggest thing that hurts it is the move to SSL everywhere. My performance took a nosedive when Facebook switched to SSL by default. Prior to that it was eminently cacheable.</p>
<p>TL,DR: the standard protocols work fine as long as the network is designed properly. The satellites themselves don't care.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the Gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In contrast to the excellent answers /u/millijuna has given, all of my experience is with a few different science data satellites, rather than commercial data service satellites.  I'll note up-front that science data satellites tend to use tried-and-true standards rather than the latest technology.  The latest tech is reserved for demonstration satellites (which I haven't worked on...)</p>
<p>The satellites I've worked on used CCSDS standards, such as the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/727x0b4.pdf" target="_blank">CCSDS File Delivery Protocol</a> for transferring files.  For telemetry; i.e. spacecraft health and safety data, or science data: onboard information is packaged into packets; several packets are packaged into &quot;frames&quot; (see <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/102x0b5s.pdf" target="_blank">CCSDS &quot;Packet Telemetry&quot;</a> ) , which have Reed-Solomon error-correcting codes added on to them.  The frames are then convolutionally-encoded.</p>
<p>Both Reed-Solomon and convolutional encoding help to compensate for noisy data links.</p>
<p>The data is downlinked using various kinds of radio-frequency (RF) links -- e.g. QPSK.  You can <a href="https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsndocs/810-005/208/208B.pdf" target="_blank">read about how NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) does it.</a></p>
<p>For ground-to-ground links, some systems use yet another CCSDS standard called &quot;Space Link Extension&quot; (SLE).   SLE consists of several protocols, and not all of them are used by a particular system or satellite.  The older satellites don't understand SLE, so they continue to use the older CCSDS standards such as Packet Telemetry.  Some of the newer satellites understand one or more of the SLE protocols.</p>
<p>Uplink is a yet another standard; e.g. the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/202x0b3s.pdf" target="_blank">CCSDS Telecommand Standard</a></p>
<p>You can find detailed information about the CCSDS standards (e.g. SLE) by reading the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/publications/bluebooks.aspx" target="_blank">CCSDS blue books</a></p>
<p>For more on error-correction, see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3y8r77/how_are_satilites_that_are_very_far_away_able_to/" target="_blank">previous askscience post</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some spacecraft are using TCP over HDLC, with IPsec for security. But that does not work over long distance. As far as ESA probes are concerned, and also for a good part of the scientific satellites in Europe, protocoles defined by the CCSDS are used: <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx</a> </p>
<p>When controlling the satellite, you will send telecommands and receive telemetries. When you have a satellite that is far away, you will typically send a bunch of time tagged telecommands that the satellite will record and run when the times comes. And the spacecraft will send bunches of telemetry at the next contact. If the satellite is close enough, you can do all this in real time during the contacts, though you are still planning activities for when you cannot talk to the spacecraft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've used satcom links for TCP/IP (not to talk to the satellite, but through the satellite), and didn't have to use anything different, from the user point of view. I suppose the packets are encapsulated in something different from your wifi or ethernet cable at the lower layers, but at the TCP/IP layers, it's the same.</p>
<p>Remember that TCP/IP was conceived to be robust and able to recover from packet losses. Lost packets are resent, and it lowers your final throughput, but a properly sized link (antenna gain, tx/rx power and sensitivity) should minimize that.</p>
<p>For latency, there's no way to &quot;compensate&quot;. Gaming and other real time applications will suck, but there's no workaround for the speed of light.</p>
<p>The latency issue will be much better with the new generation of data satcoms, which will use non-geostationary lower orbit sats, but it still won't be like ground fiber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you take a look at the 7 layers of  OSI, you can see this in another perspective. The radio frequency part (wireless signal) of satellite communication is Layer 1. TCP/IP is Layer 3. As you go up in layers, the higher layer is just a payload to a lower layer. So you often hear, &quot;layer 3 rides on layer 2 and 1.&quot;</p>
<p>In essence, the protocols that you mentioned are all payloads of a layer 1 communications medium, so they ideally do not really have any awareness on how it gets transported from point A to B. I say ideally because your Layer 1 implementation still matters. For example, if you're using smoke signals as a Layer 1 medium to transmit TCP/IP packets, then you'd have to use trickery on the TCP/IP protocol to bypass its timeout settings and such because transmitting information via smoke would involve additional processing, which in turn translates to higher latency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>What sleep restores is not your energy, but your brain function.  Your brain is floating in a nutrient soup called <em>cerebrospinal fluid</em> or CSF.  Throughout the day, your brain cells drink in nutrients from the CSF, and spit out waste.  This builds up, and by the end of the day there's so much waste floating around in the CSF that it starts negatively affecting brain function.</p>
<p>When you sleep, channels open up and flush the day's supply of CSF away.  New, clean CSF is pumped in for tomorrow, and so you wake up with a clean brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain continuously creates something called adenosine while you are awake. This keeps you energized and ready to do anything. The more adenosine your brain makes, the more it has to carry, and sleeping is the only way to get rid of it. The more it carries, the more it gets tired.</p>
<p>Your brain also has an alarm clock called a 'circadian rhythm' of when to do certain things at certain points in the day. </p>
<p>Let's say it's night time, your brain is carrying way too much adenosine, luckily the 'circadian rhythm' tells the brain it's time to sleep. Because it's sleepy time, your brain creates something called melatonin. This makes you comfy, mix that with being tired from all of the adenosine and you get sleep.</p>
<p>During sleep, your brain starts putting away your memories it was holding throughout the day away into a library known as your long term memory (REM Sleep). This is when you dream, usually it's associated with whatever your brain is putting away.
Your brain is also firing old bad cellular workers and hiring new good ones that are ready to work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, your body's cellular workers destroy the adenosine while making important fixes and adjustments to the body. When the circadian rhythm says it's time to wake up, your brain stops making melatonin. You have no adenosine so you feel tired, but this is also an incentive to wake up since your brain is satisfied that the adenosine and melatonin is gone. Your cellular workers fixed any problems they saw so your body also feels good.</p>
<p>You do gain your energy from foods mostly as types of sugars that are fed to the little cellular workers in your body. Because your body is always working, you will always be converting food or fat into sugars to feed your cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And it depends on temperature/density. So the more dense the gas, the more probable it is for it's atoms to fuse and more energy is produced.</p>
<p>This means, that as the proto-star grows more dense, the rate of fusion increases and so does amount of energy produced. Then at one point, the star reaches equilibrium between energy pushing out and gravity pulling in. Also, this equilibrium changes over time, as composition of the star changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars begin hot and bright because they contain a ton of energy from gravitational collapse, with surface temperatures up to around 3000-4000 Kelvin and core temperatures above a million Kelvin. Young proto-stars are actually much more volatile than regular stars because the primary mechanism for heat transfer internally is convection, which leads to lots of irregularities. So much so that such stars undergo regular eruptions (enormous solar flares) as bubbles of heat boil up to the surface. As the star continues collapsing it gets denser and hotter, eventually reaching a state where fusion reactions start generating a significant amount of heat internally. This results in a sufficiently hot interior that the primary mode of heat transport changes from convection to radiation, which causes the heat profile of the star to settle down into a much more orderly gradient ranging from the core to the surface, reducing the frequency and intensity of stellar eruptions. When fusion begins the star as a whole gets hotter, including the surface, but the surface only increases in temperature by a comparatively small amount (10% or so, initially). Stars also get dimmer as they &quot;turn on&quot; because even though they are a little hotter they are <em>much</em> smaller after they've fully collapsed into a star, so their overall luminosity is much less (by orders of magnitude).</p>
<p>In short: stars shine even before they begin fusing due to the energy of gravitational contraction; pre-fusion stars are very bright (because of their large size) and unruly (because convection isn't great for heat transport); as they begin fusion they actually settle down, growing smaller, dimmer, and more well-behaved while only a little bit hotter on the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand this, you have to understand how star formation works. In space there are mind bogglingly large clouds of various gasses out there. Because gas stop has mass, it is attracted to itself. Over time this &quot;ball&quot; of gas gets larger and larger.</p>
<p>We know that if you add pressure you something, it gets hotter. At first the amount of pressure expressed on this gas is very small. But as it grows in size, so does the pressure. Eventually, you will reach a mass where the pressure at the center is so great it starts a cascading fusion reaction. A hydrogen star fuses its gas into helium. Follow the elements up the periodic table and that is what it begins fusing next.  Until you reach nickle that is. Nickle is the first element that consumes energy to produce, rather than producing it.  This consequently is one of the causes of a star going supernova.</p>
<p>Once this fusion reaction starts, it takes over pretty quickly, exact times are hard to pin down. But I would expect something along the lines of seconds to minutes. So now you have gravity pulling in on the mass, but a fusion reaction pushing out. At first the size of the star is very variable. But over time, these forces balance out.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The passage of time is relative between everything in the universe, and every other thing moving relative to anything else. As well as variances in gravity.</p>
<p>Consider a black hole that formed 10 billion years ago. There is matter, that from your perspective, is still falling into the black hole. From the perspective of the matter, only a few minutes may have passed as it falls inward. From your perspective the universe will suffer heat death before the matter passes the event horizon. The matter sees this happening in real time, in short order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is: more or less. It's not exactly the same, since time passes by for objects moving at different velocities and in different gravitational potentials, and the Universe isn't entirely uniform. Some regions are a little denser than average, and some are less dense. This is a pretty tiny effect, however: the differences in density from one region of the Universe to another are about one part in ten thousand, i.e., 10^(-5), and the age measured in these regions varies by a similarly tiny amount. Indeed, our best measurements of the age of the Universe have percent-level error, so that regional variation is still about a thousand times smaller than the <em>error</em> in our estimates of the Universe's age.</p>
<p>To put some numbers on all this, the age of the Universe is about 13.8 billion years, the error is in the ballpark of 100 million years, and the 10^(-5) variation between dense and underdense environments is in the realm of 100 thousand years. There are other reasons the age changes from place to place, such as other commenters have listed, but they generally lead to discrepancies far below even those relatively small numbers. One notable exception is near a black hole, where time slows down nearly to a halt as seen from outside, and time comes to an end entirely as seen from an object falling in when it hits the singularity. This is because black holes have extremely strong gravitational fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If your measuring age by how long it has been in existence, then technically everything in the universe, all matter, has existed forever, since before the big bang.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrical current through a wire creates a magnetic field directed in a circular motion around the circumference of the wire.  So, when you coil the wire into a circle, this creates a magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the circular cross-section of this coil (think of a donut of wire sitting on a table, the magnetic field would be directed upward or downward through the hole of the donut).</p>
<p>Now, if you take a second coil of wire and place it on top of the first coil, the magnetic field from the first coil will cause a flow of current in the second coil.  This is due to the reverse of how you generated the magnetic field.</p>
<p>The &quot;first coil&quot; is your wireless charger, and the &quot;second coil&quot; is inside your phone, connected to the battery.  The current generated in the second coil charges your phone's battery.</p>
<p>Edit: It should be noted that this was an extremely simplified explanation. An important aspect that I left off was that it is the <em>change</em> in magnetic field, called magnetic flux, through the second coil that induces a current.  This means the coils must use alternating current (the type of power coming out of your wall socket), then the second coil's AC current must be converted to DC current (type of current a battery produces/charges on) in order to charge the battery.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Awesome! I think I can help.
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Wireless_power_system_-_inductive_coupling_de.svg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Wireless_power_system_-_inductive_coupling_de.svg</a></p>
<p>This picture here illustrates well what is happening. The left side is your wireless charging pad, the right side is your phone.</p>
<p>First, we need two coils, then we need alternating current and that's pretty much it. The purpose of the coils is to intensify and guide the magnetic field so we have lower power losses.</p>
<p>In the picture above, &quot;B&quot; is the magnetic field created by the left coil. A magnetic field is created when you send AC through a coil.
As you can see, a lot of the magnetic field is &quot;lost&quot; on the left side of the transmitter coil, that's why magnetic charging is so inefficient and it takes a long time to charge the phone!</p>
<p>On the right side, we have the receiver coil. A &quot;changing&quot; magnetic field induces a Voltage and thus a current flow in the coil, which can then be rectified to charge your battery (since the battery is often charged with 4.2V DC)</p>
<p>And now the even cooler part: Wireless charging isn't scratching the surface of what kind of power we can deliver that way!
If you step up the power a litte bit, you can melt metal with a coil.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By an extremely simple concept, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Faraday's Law of Induction</a>, which states that:</p>
<p><em>'The induced electromotive force in any closed circuit is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit.'</em></p>
<p>Put simply, your wireless charger has a wire coil inside it. An alternating current runs through the coil. This generates a magnetic field with <em>changing strength</em>—this is a key point.</p>
<p>There's <em>another</em> wire coil inside your phone. As the changing magnetic field passes through this coil, an electromotive force, or a voltage, is generated. Since this coil is connected to a closed circuit, we have another AC current in the wire coil in your phone. </p>
<p>This AC current is then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wik
i/Rectifier?wprov=sfla1">fully rectified</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier#Rectifier_output_smoothing" target="_blank">smoothened</a> to a comparatively flat DC current, which charges your battery. </p>
<p><strong><em>This will not work if the magnetic field does not change in strength</em></strong>. So the first coil <em>must</em> either carry an AC current, or a non-uniform DC current, i.e. a rectified AC, pulsed DC, square, or sawtooth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: the equations explaining the whole idea of electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction may be complex, but the physical idea is simple.</p>
<p>Take a large metallic solenoid—it can be <em>any</em> metal, so long as it <em>is</em> metal. Connect the two ends of the spring to an ammeter or galvanometer. Drop a strong magnet through the solenoid, and see the needle on the galvanometer flick away from the centre line. </p>
<p>The kinetic energy of the falling magnet has been <em>indirectly</em> converted to electrical energy in the circuit. Why? The solenoid experiences a <em>changing</em> magnetic field of sorts. As the magnet enters the coil, the latter experiences an 'increasingly stronger' magnetic field as the magnet gets nearer. Likewise, as the magnet drops out of the other end, the magnetic field becomes increasingly weaker. As the magnet enters, it is repelled by the electric current in the coil, which generates its <em>own</em> magnetic field. Vice versa as the magnet leaves the coil, except that it is now attracted. </p>
<p>The entire concept of electricity and magnetism can be summed up in equations relating force in newtons, electric current in amperes, and magnetic field strength in teslas. It is an interplay of these three quantities that give rise to these phenomena. Actually explaining them on a deeper level requires a strong grasp of quantum mechanics and relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are basically a transformer. What is a transformer exactly? It is two wire coil (electromagnet) sharing a common core, which carry the magnetic field.</p>
<p>A classic transformer use a metal core, which help for the efficiency and to make it smaller, but it do not have to be metal, it can, in fact, be air.</p>
<p>The base have the primary winding, that's it, the one with power. The phone also have a winding, which would be called (drum roll) secondary winding. The electricity from the primary winding induce a magnetic field around it, which the secondary catch and convert that magnetic field into electricity. For this to happend it need to vary all the time, hence why they call it &quot;AC&quot;, or alternating current. In the case of those, the frequency, so the number of cycle per second, is relativelly high, but the frequency is not really important, it basically just change the size of the coil and the amount of power that can be transfered, the theory is still the same</p>
<p>So, in the base, you have a circuit that convert the direct current (DC) into AC, this is done by simply having a few transistors (think of switch) that turn on and off in a sequence. Basically you connect the 'left' wire to positive and 'right' to negative    and the current flow in one direction.  Then you reverse the wires, and the current flow in reverse. Think of a water hose and a pump. Connect one end to the in and the other to the out, then reverse, you will cause the water to move one way then the other. Congratulation, you made AC !</p>
<p>The way they do that is with what is called an H bridge, which is basically 4 transistors. By turning two (one per side) you can control which direction the electricity flow...</p>
<p>Once out of the secondary winding (the phone), you now have a small issue: you have AC, you want DC. This is easilly fixed by a diode (actually, most likelly 4, look up diode bridge, the advantage is that it use both the positive and negative portion by inverting the negative portion... look up how the bridge work), then follow that by a capacitor. The output of the diode(s) is pulsed, that pulse get absorbed by the capacitor, which basically act like a battery of low capacity, but can be charged millions of time.</p>
<p>Then you just need a charge controller to charge the battery.</p>
<p>The charge controller will ensure that the current do not excede the limit of the battery, else fire can happend. Also, it control the voltage, because to much voltage and the battery won't be happy (read: can catch fire). It will also stop charging when the battery is full, is too cold or too hot, and also under some other conditions. All of this to ensure a proper charge and to make the battery happy (read: don't catch fire).</p>
<p>tl;dr: the base and the phone both have a wire coil, which make an air core transformer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people say that the universe is expanding in all directions, they don't merely mean <em>at its edges</em>. The universe is expanding everywhere all at once. Galaxies aren't really moving apart from one another, the space between them is expanding. If we removed that expansion from their velocities they would be practically standing still.</p>
<p>All of the images that you see of the Big Bang show a spherical explosion, but that's greatly simplified for the masses. Remember that what is inside that &quot;sphere&quot; is <em>everything</em>. It's the whole universe. It's impossible to look at it from the outside because there is no concept of &quot;outside the universe&quot;. The idea of what it looks like from the outside is meaningless.</p>
<p>Why do all those animations show a sphere then? Well, in part because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">Cosmological Principle</a>, which says
that the universe looks the same no matter the direction we look, and the natural way to depict that is with a sphere (and because <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/112805/why-is-everything-spherical/" target="_blank">sphere shapes are very common in space</a>), but that's not the way that real explosions work. Even the most perfectly packed explosions don't generate perfectly spherical shockwaves.</p>
<p>Importantly, there would be no way for us to tell if the universe is shaped like, say, a giant chicken, because spacetime has no edges. We could be hip deep in chicken guts, but if we never see any feathers, we'd assume it's guts all the way down.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The universe isn't expanding at its edges because it has no edges, and the concept of what it looks like is meaningless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We tend to think in spheres when it comes to the universe because when it comes to space exploration, Earth has always been the starting point, or rather our solar system, we can only explore what is going on up to a certain distance in any direction from a 360 degree starting point, this is why the famous image of ''the visible universe'' is actually in shape of a circle. </p>
