		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well simply put - <strong>Because our brains are bad at multitasking</strong> </p>
<p>Daydreaming is a short-term detachment from one's immediate surroundings, during which a person's contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake.</p>
<p>Day dreaming is not actual sleep (despite the word &quot;dream&quot;). It is simply a short-term detachment from your surrounding. Put simply, it it just your mind wondering. Like any other action you take, you do it with your eyes opened.</p>
<p>This is mainly due to our brains being very good at selective attention. It is impossible for the human brain to focus on every bit of information it receives, so instead it will focus on one or two main points and effectively ignore the rest.</p>
<p>When we form mental images, we use many of the same parts of the brain as we use to process visual images. So, when you bring up a vivid mental image, you aren't able to make full use of those areas to process what you're actually seeing. Obviously, there is still plenty of information coming in through your eyes, but since you are distracted, it is not processed as thoroughly as when you are focused on the world around you.</p>
<p>The same goes for when you bring a memory to mind. I've often been listening to someone talk, and when something they says triggers a memory, I might not even hear what they said for the next few moments. The brain isn't too great at multitasking.</p>
<p>There are many types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst psychologists, however the characteristic that is common to all forms of daydreaming meets the criteria for mild dissociation.</p>
<p><em>What part of the brain switches those controls saying to stop processing outside information and start imagining?</em></p>
<p>We are not sure. It gets tricky from here. Not sure if is understandable for a five year old :( Experts now agree, however, that daydreaming is a normal, and even beneficial, cognitive function-albeit one that is largely still not understood. An area of the brain called the “default network,” which becomes more active as the level of external stimulus decreases, is often considered responsible for daydreaming. The default network mainly includes the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the posterior cingulated cortex/precuneus region, and the temporoparietal junction </p>
<p>Neuroimaging studies have offered support for this hypothesis, though only indirectly. These studies demonstrated “correlations between reported frequency of task-unrelated thoughts and default network activation during conditions of low cognitive demand, as well as stronger default network activation during highly practiced compared with novel tasks in people with higher propensity for mind wandering.” A different interpretation of these data, offered by Gilbert et al., argued that “instead of mind wandering, activations in the medial PFC part of the default network may reflect stimulus-related thought such as enhanced watchfulness toward the external environment that is also likely to occur during highly practiced tasks”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baddeley's working memory model tells us there is a part of our mind called the central executive (located in the frontal lobes) that controls where our attention is focused, and filters out the rest. It decides what is relevant for you to feel or notice. Mostly through practice. </p>
<p>When you first hear a loud constant noise (say, roadworks outside) it bothers you - but after a while you stop noticing it, because the central executive registers it, but filters it out of your conscious perception. When the drilling stops you tend to notice the silence as a relief because that filter no longer has to work. It's why we study better in quiet environments. </p>
<p>Same goes for hearing your name in a crowded room - central executive processes all, but only sends over stuff you might find interesting or relevant. </p>
<p>When daydreaming, we are focused on introspection so our central executive puts other stimili on the backburner until you need them again. </p>
<p>It's also what those &quot;you are now breathing manually&quot; or &quot;you are now aware of the position of your tongue in your mouth&quot; memes take advantatge of. Sorry. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely fact check me, but what we learned was that when people start to day dream or think introspectively the portions of the brain that are used for attention and working memory (right parietal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) &quot;quiet down&quot; in the sense that they lower their activity rates and the default mode network turns &quot;on.&quot; The default mode network is a network of brain regions that become more activated when the brain is focusing less on outside stimuli and more on internal reflection, day dreaming, or even meditating.   This network changes then Brian waves from beta (alert and active) to alpha (awake but relaxed). That's part of the reason people &quot;snap out of it&quot; when interrupted while daydreaming. Basically when zoning out different regions of the brain get activated and the higher thinking centers quiet down so you are less aware of what's going on in the outside world and more aware of your internal monologue, thoughts, feelings, etc. </p>
<p>Paragraph and Sources: In neuroscience, the default mode network (DMN), also default network, or default state network, is a network of interacting brain regions known to have activity highly correlated with each other and distinct from other networks in the brain.[3]</p>
<p>The default mode network is most commonly shown to be active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest, such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering. But it is also active when the individual is thinking about others, thinking about themselves, remembering the past, and planning for the future.[3][4] The network activates &quot;by default&quot; when a person is not involved in a task. Though the DMN was originally noticed to be deactivated in certain goal-oriented tasks and is sometimes referred to as the task-negative network,[5] it can be active in other goal-oriented tasks such as social working memory or autobiographical tasks.[6] The DMN has been shown to be negatively correlated with other networks in the brain such as attention networks.[7] Thinking about others also could include guessing their thoughts, emotions, and psychological motivations.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain has several commonly used paths of neurons, the cells in our brain that hold and conduct electric charges , we call these paths networks. When you're daydreaming, the network known as the Default Mode Network is more active. The DMNs activity is inversely proportional to the activity in the Dorsal Attention Network, which is more active when you're consciously thinking about something like math, higher-order reasoning, or anything where you feel like you're concentrating. So the DMN is active when you're thinking about nothing, when you're daydreaming or really any time you aren't concentrating

When you imagine things, your visual areas of the brain light-up just as if you were really seeing, your areas for movement and control of coordination also light up like your really there. All that's missing is... very little actually. Which is why what we experience in reality and what we experience in our imaginations are one continuum of what we imagine to be reality.

<p>The sister city program is a way for smaller cities (usually not Tier 1, which was a lot less until a few weeks ago) to get their name out in a country or region by pairing with another city in some way or another, promising better rates and opportunities for business, investors, entrepreneurs, and other notables between the two cities. It helps to foster a bond that will hopefully reap economic benefits sometimes in the near future.</p>
<p>They provide opportunities for students and other citizens with potential to visit schools and universities in their partner to help foster studying abroad and communication that, again, they will hope will foster economic connections and benefits later.</p>
<p>One of the more notable ones is Lodz, Poland (I think) and Chengdu being sister cities, which led to the first direct train route being built between the two cities, allowing for a lot more trade to happen between the region and Chengdu, which being a Tier 2 city, did not get some of the benefits cities like Beijing or Shanghai were privy to. Then, more direct routes from their respective airports opened up and have led to a more direct connection, both metaphorically and physically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago I ran the Sister Cities program for a major US city that had 6 sister cities. In that city, at least, the programs were initiated by groups of citizens who wanted to create exchanges, each for different reasons. Most were cultural, but some involved business exchanges. Some groups petitioned the city to make new Sisters in order to make a political statement.<br />
At that time that I was there, the city put very little money and effort into supporting the exchanges, which were mostly arranged and financed by the citizen groups running them. So each program was only as active as the citizen group.<br />
The Sisters in other countries had differing levels on interest, too. In some, the Mayor's office was very interesting in the exchanges, spent a lot of money and worked very hard to promoted the connection. In other cities you could barely get anyone from the Mayor's staff to answer the phone.<br />
In my time at that job I helped to coordinate student exchanges, performances by artists from the Sister Cities, a couple of trade shows. The program was not very active.<br />
The bottom line is that each program is different, depending on the parties involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sister cities, as mentioned elsewhere, are about joint economic growth and partnership. I won't delve into that because there's already been a great response on it.</p>
<p>Twinned cities don't always mean anything besides diplomacy, if that. Certainly in the UK it's largely just a hangover from the war, where it was believed that getting two countries heavily involved with one another would make another war less likely. Twin <em>cities</em> will often promote cultural and commercial links and perhaps even international business links, but for the most part twin <em>towns</em> (and villages) don't really have any connections besides in name.</p>
<p>E.g. my hometown of Crawley, population ~100,000 in the UK is twinned with Dorsten, population ~80,000 in Germany. And yet, I'm guessing maybe 1 in 20 people from either town would be able to tell you that.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with how the concept of the EU came about - fostering cultural and financial ties between nations in order to encourage peace and not have another war in Europe - it's basically the same thing at a more local level, although each twinning program is independent and don't necessarily mean anything at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They created partnerships between towns in different countries and organized cultural exchanges on a local level.</p>
<p>Usually the partner towns are similar in size and have something in common. Sometimes the something can be that both towns have an economy based on the same industry.

I was part of a cultural artist exchange program between the cities of Detroit and Turin, Italy. The cities are sister cities due to their respective relationships to the auto industry. The project was officially endorsed by the cities mayors and universities. The universities funded our travel. It was an exchange between musicians and visual artists from the two cities. I went to Turin twice and hosted a photographer from Italy here in detroit several times. It was one of the amazing experiences of my life. It lasted a few years and by the time it was over we had put on some concerts and exhibitions in each city, and I made great new friends in Italy who I later revisited and stayed with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hacking, fundamentally, is to force a system to operate outside of its intended parameters. Even if the term is most widely used for breaking into someone else's computer system, using the term in non-malicious and benign situations is perfectly valid.</p>
<p>When talking about computer security, using the term &quot;hacking&quot; as described above, can be seen as forcing a system that's intended to be secure to behave outside of intended parameters as well. That would mean it's no longer a secure system. The system has been compromised. </p>
<p>To &quot;hack&quot; a computer system involves (among other things) writing code that specifically targets vulnerabilities in the system's software or hardware. By exposing a system to a situation it isn't capable of handling, you can cause the system to partially break down and start doing things it shouldn't be doing. </p>
<p>&quot;All&quot; software is designed to handle a lot of unintended situations. A program that adds together two numbers and stores the result in a space that can only hold 3 digits might have code that makes it double-check that the result isn't 4 or more digits before it tries to write it, for example. If it gets a result that ends up bigger than 3 digits, it'll stop before doing something illegal.</p>
<p>When a hacker tries to attack a system, they try to find the errors that a program <em>doesn't</em> know how to handle properly, and then cause it to perform an action that causes this error. Then they attempt to cause this error to change things in the system that allow for even greater changes, hopefully a change that would allow them to gain full control of the system.</p>
<p>When a &quot;patch&quot; comes out for a program, this may be the creator of the program changing the problem that the hacker found. After the patch is applied, the hacker now needs to look for a different weakness in the program, which the creator of the program again will have to fix with a new patch. As you can see, this is basically an arms race. More and more sophisticated attacks being launched at more and more robust software.</p>
<p>As for what's used, sometimes, it's analyzing traffic coming in and out of a system, looking for patterns or anomalities. Other times, it can be going through a program's source code, attemting to find portions of code that would be vulnerable. The &quot;hacks&quot; themselves are often performed with an array of viruses, malware, etc. that is sent to a system. These are written with text editors that are optimized for coding or with software engineering tools similar or the same as what &quot;nice&quot; coders use.</p>
<p>Then there is also social engineering, which is isn't as much hacking a computer system, as it is to trick the users of it. If you can fool a user into giving you their password, you don't need to attack their system directly with malware or viruses. This is what often is the case when someone on social media says they've &quot;been hacked&quot;. Usually, they've been lead to believe they were using the real website of a service when they entered their login information, while they in reality were not. Once they've done this, criminals can often figure out the username and passwords for other sites this person uses, because a <em>lot</em> of users reuse passwords across sites and apps.</p>
<p>Social engineering is often used in conjunction with more technical attacks. If you can trick an employee into giving you their login info, you can use this to plant malware that wouldn't have been able to penetrate a company's network from the outside. However, if the malware was planted <em>inside</em> the company's network instead, by a compromised employee's account, it could work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A typical walk through of hacking a system:</p>
<p>1) Research</p>
<p>Before a hacker hits a system. They research the crap out of it. Every detail they can uncover about the system, they will. Programs like NMAP are used to identify the system and possible Internet programs they are running. It can tell you what versions of what server services (server programs) are running like Apache v2 on port 80, as well as Operating System details, etc. This information is used to identify a vulnerability and how the exploit code should work.</p>
<p>2) Build an Exploit</p>
<p>For the most part, companies don't update their software, or at least all of it. So after Step 1, the hacker has probably found some vulnerable software running. Maybe they have a script that takes the output of NMAP and compares the results with a local database of exploits that is built from online sources. Voila, there is a match. The target system is running an old version of Apache that has a remote code execution flaw. Doesn't even require much of an exploit since it's vulnerable by simply manipulating the headers of a HTTP request. A practical solution is to have the exploit setup a backdoor for remote management (ssh tunnel, vnc, whatever). The skilled hacker may take advantage of the kernel (operating system's engine) to hide the backdoor somewhere so it doesn't show up in &quot;system processes&quot; or any &quot;task manager&quot; (like in Windows).</p>
<p>3) Send/Run Exploit</p>
<p>Send the exploit. Initiate the attack. Sit back and watch it work. Most typical hacks occur in milli-seconds, after latency is resolved. Complex hacks can take minutes, but for the most part, a hacker will do what they can to minimize the time in and out of a target system.</p>
<p>If you are interested in playing with some tools, check out NMAP, Wireshark, Reaver, maybe even Cain and Abel. If you are interested in learning how to exploit systems like a pro, I recommend studying low level programming like Assembly. If you master low level mechanics of computing, you will have keen insight on how to manipulate other systems. Cheers!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arcade culture is a big deal in Japan. One of the reasons is Japanese kids go to arcades to socialise a lot more than American kids do. Japanese arcades are sometimes 10 story buildings, filled with games of every type. Usually there's at least one entire floor devoted to dance/rhythm games. People that live in Japanese cities tend to have small apartments, so, it's hard to have all your friends over to play games, they go play at the arcades. Dance/rhythm games are a social thing and the Japanese take it very seriously whereas in a lot of other developed countries, arcades have died out, yes they still exist but nothing like the scale of what you find in Tokyo. I've been lucky enough to visit quite a few countries, Arcades in Tokyo are amazing. They even let you smoke and drink. Japan is awesome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an adult who was diagnosed with ADHD as a child (called ADD at the time). Thanks to the video that was on the front page a few days ago, I was recently introduced to the work of Dr. Russell Barkley. Much of what he said about ADHD being primarily an impairment of executive function sounded like it made a lot of sense, and it matched up very well with my own experience of my disability. Is this a well established theory of the cause and nature of ADHD? Is it well supported by the work of other researchers, or is Dr. Barkley on the fringe? If it goes against the consensus, then what is the consensus? Or what are competing theories?</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR1IZJXc6d8" target="_blank">video</a> that summarizes his ideas.</p>
<p>EDIT: Here are a few more videos that better describe Dr. Barkley's theory of ADHD, executive function, brain morphology, and genetics:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR</strong>: <em>Executive function deficit is widely accepted as an effect of ADHD but not as a cause. It fails to explain the entire set of common ADHD symptoms.</em></p>
<p>The most commonly accepted explanation for ADHD symptoms relates to the the production and uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Shortly, the idea is that failures to adequately utilize these neurotransmitters (associate with reward, alertness, and arousal) causes the people afflicted with ADHD to seek other easy sources of these. This means that high reward tasks are more attractive and novelty is more important.</p>
<p>It's also true that executive functions are impacted by this neurochemical deficiency. Executive functions require the ability to self regulate and the ability to essentially force reward temporarily in exchange for greater reward later. If one says, &quot;I must complete this homework so that I can play outside later&quot; part of the process is simply making the decision, but another equally important part is keeping the brain engaged and active during the 'low reward' part of that task. People with ADHD experience difficulty with that second part.</p>
<p>To answer your question directly; yes the executive model is widely accepted, but moreso as a partial model of the symptoms and as a note on the practical implications of non-pharmaceutical / behavioral therapy. The executive model is not a pathological model nor does it explain 100% of ADHD symptoms. The most accepted pathological model (see above) explains the executive deficits as well as other symptoms such as hyperactivity, fidgeting, and sleeping difficulties seen acutely in children. The neurochemical deficit model also points to the obvious and effective pharmacological treatment for most suffers; stimulants.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm afraid of my post getting deleted because I didn't include sources, so here's a random metanalysis (not that linking even 20 metaanalyses would prove concensus). In a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00439-009-0694-x" target="_blank">2009 meta-analysis of genetic causes of ADHD</a> plausible genetic components for ADHD were reviewed. The authors point to variations in DAT1 (dopamine transport), DRD4, DRD5 (dopamine receptors), 5HTT (serotonin transport) HTR1B (Hydroxytryptamine receptor), SNAP25 (a synapse transport protein), and DBH (enzyme for dopamine-&gt;norepinephrine conversion). I think the genetic components themselves go pretty far to support the most widely accepted cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered how credit processing fees effect large businesses (and various size businesses).  Here in Oregon we have very large grocery store that does not accept credit cards.  It also seems more and more common for gas stations to have cash prices different from credit prices.  I carry cash for small purchases like a soda from a minimart, but how does it add up for the store owner if I use my credit card for my $1.50 purchases?</p>
<p>So I guess a perspective for my question is how much can a company save (assuming sales are unaffected) if they do not take credit cards?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to address the last part of your request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how much can a company save if they do not take credit cards?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other commenters have done a great job explaining credit card transaction fees, but the answer to this particular piece of your question is quite subjective and somewhat intangible.  Businesses save money <em>per transaction</em> by accepting only cash - there's no doubt about that.  This is a great business model for your local ice cream parlor, barber shop, or small business where they tailor to a specific community.  Here's the kicker - how many transactions/customers are you losing because you only accept cash?  Many people carry little to no cash in today's digitally-driven world and therefore don't patronize cash-only businesses.  Businesses therefore need to plan accordingly, whether by having cash-specific prices (gas stations), minimum electronic transaction amounts (popular in bars/pubs), or pricing products/services accordingly to cover the expected transaction fees.  Credit card companies have obviously figured this out and have made themselves indispensable, ingraining themselves into the global economy and introducing strategic new products (cash back rewards, frequent flyer miles, etc.) and services (fraud protection, purchase protection, global helpline, etc.).  Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like some others said, 2.5-3% but it's a complicated question because the interchange rate is dependent on a few things (merchant, merchant type, purchase type, amount charged, platform).  </p>
<p>Merchant is just the store that has the credit card terminal.  All of the interchange rates can be negotiated by the merchant. So for example, Walmart has a lot lower fee that your local mom and pop's store since they have a lot of leverage. </p>
<p>Merchant type is grocery store, gas station, retail, etc.  Because of the different margins of those businesses the interchange fee can be different.  </p>
<p>Purchase type is card present, card not present. These are different because fraud rates differ depending on how cards are used.  You can probably guess card not present (online purchases) have a higher fraud rate and thus a higher interchange rate.</p>
<p>Amount charged mattered because in a lot of cases there is a minimum charge of a few cents for each transaction + a percentage of the transaction (e.g. $0.15 + 1.5%).  So small purchases can actually be more costly to a merchant on a percentage basis.</p>
<p>Platform and network is the probably the most important. You have MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express,  for example. And  they all have their own payment systems and fee matrixes. Here is Visa's matrix in PDF. Amex tends to be the most expensive. Furthermore, within each matrix there are different platforms.  For example Visa has (had) Visa Platinum, Visa signature and some others.  The reason they have these is to attract different types of spenders through additional benefits.  Visa signature people tend to spend a lot more than Visa Platinum so the interchange rate is higher.</p>
<p>Anyways this was just an overview. It's a little bit more complicated than this.  I used to be a business analyst for a major credit card company for years so I was just going off the top of my head.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1.5-3% of the transaction is what I pay.  AMEX is the highest and pretty much set by AMEX.  There isn't a lot of negotiation room with them.  Visa and MasterCard have more haggle room with them.   You also pay some additional flat fees.  There is a small swipe fee on some cards + the transaction %. If I hand key in the card number there are additional fees because that is considered a higher risk transaction.   Debit card cost me less since there isn't reward and kick back programs the fees have to cover.
Then there is a batch settle fee.  Whenever you settle your terminal with the cc processor.  Some companies will only do this once a week to save this fee and that is at some transaction will sit on your card as &quot;pending&quot; for so long.  We settle nightly.  Cost a bit more but we get paid faster.</p>
<p>The actually bill I get each month is several pages long and confusing as heck.   So many little charges that really add up. Ra</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, the currency argument becomes a thing. While many webbased businesses don't handle cash or cheques, the personnel cost involved in handling these currencies is lighter on credit card purchases than the other types, so while you do see a cost on many cards, there is also a saved cost due to less cash/cheque handling. </p>
<p>I live in Denmark which for many people outside our country is kind of utopian. We have had to send our cheque system on pension this year and are also currently discussing to allow corporations to reject cash payments. This isn't because we don't like money, but people are simply advancing into card and mobile payments at a scale you don't see elsewhere, which eases the administration required by maintaining a currency cashier position.</p>
<p>So while the cost for card payments are 0-3%, those corporations save the time to run the daily cash to the bank and the time needed to count the days incoming payments/sales. Propably salaries in the amount of an employee on a five year basis.</p>
<p>Also credit cards allow the corporations to dip into sales that would otherwise be postponed because now, people have it in a credit option in their wallet - this increases revenue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
