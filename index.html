		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I am an anaesthetist. I am very happy to see a question I am qualified to answer.
The principles behind pulse oximetry are some of the required knowledge for basic anaesthetic trainees.
As has been outlined, the pulse oximeter uses two wavelengths of light: 660nm (red light) and 940nm (infrared light). These lights correspond to the maximum absorption by deoxygenated haemoglobin and oxygenated haemoglobin respectively. This light shines through a finger, toe, lip, ear (and sometimes hands and feet for neonates) and is picked up by a detector on the contralateral side of the probe. The ratio between the two wavelengths that is transmitted gives an R value (Red/Infared) which corresponds to an oxygen saturation. An R value of 1 is equal to roughly 80% SpO2. Oxygenated blood absorbs more infrared light and deoxygenated blood absorbs more red light.
I hope that explanation helps a bit. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095461111300053X" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=332" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple of articles that explains the science and limitations of oximetry in more detail. Thanks for letting me answer.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The instrument that reads the oxygen levels of your blood (referred to as SpO2) is called a pulse oximeter. It shines different wavelengths of light (usually IR and red) through your finger to find how oxygenated your blood is. How does it do this? Hemaglobin, which is the protein in your red blood cells that binds oxygen and takes it to your cells, can absorb light (like most materials). How much light it can absorb depends on the wavelength of light shining on it and whether the hemaglobin is holding oxygen or not. A sensor on the other side of your finger (a fancy lil thing called a photodiode) will detect how much light makes it through your finger. Plug these absorption values into an equation and you can figure out how much of your hemaglobin has oxygen in it. Hopefully if you're healthy it will be between 95-100%, although 100% SpO2 is not that common. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biomedical engineer. Everyone correctly describes that light of 2 specific wavelengths is shone through the finger. The amount of light absorbed by deoxy and oxygenated blood is different. The relationship between the amount of absorbance is measured and this provides the oxygen saturation levels.</p>
<p>However, the amount of light absorbance isn't directly related to the O2 level. Instead, there have been data tables created that relate the O2 levels to the light absorbance... this was done EMPIRICALLY, i.e. by experiment, and not by theory. So the device is just correlating the light information to pre-programmed data table relationships. The relationship breaks down somewhere around 80% and below, and thus the pulse oximeter can no longer properly measure oxygen levels below this percentage. Regardless, the device would have started beeping an alert by then anyway. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many reasons that meat can turn brown. Cooking meat at a high temperature browns meat because of the maillard reaction. As meat ages it turns brown from oxidation. The oxidation process is a result of the bound iron molecule in myoglobin going from the ferrous to ferric form. This produces what is called metmyoglobin. Metmyoglobin is the cause of the characteristic brown coloration of meat that occurs as it ages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Breathing has 2 components: autonomic control and plain physics. The autonomic control center regulates your breathing frequency/intensity depending on CO2 levels in your blood by stimulating your breathing muscles in a very efficient way, taking maximum advantage of the physics of airflow. When you're breathing manually, you interrupt the respiratory center and you have to force the breathing muscles to contract by yourself</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;The definition of masculinity and femininity is inherited by the generation of that time and is manifested by the attire of infants (Maglaty, 2011). In a June 1918 article of the trade publication Earnshaw’s Infants Department it dictated that the “generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls.&quot; The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” In the current 21rst century Infants whose sex is ambiguous are identified by the colors of their attire it is common knowledge that pink is for girls and blue is for boys (Ben, 2007).&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much impossible to explain what it feels like, but the basic idea is that you have receptors that respond to the presence of various chemicals, more strongly to some of them than to others. Things have a smell because of trace amounts of chemicals circulating in the air, and getting picked up by these receptors. You could say it works like a combination of hearing (transmission via air) and tasting (biochemical receptors). The way the sensation works is closer to tasting, I guess, but there are way more smells than tastes.</p>
<p>Because air carries these chemicals around, how far away you can smell things depends on airflow/wind, the concentration of the chemical at the source, and how easily your receptors can detect the chemical in question. For instance, smell receptors are <em>extremely</em> sensitive to the stuff they mix into domestic gas, ethyl mercaptan, basically one milligram per tonne of air can be smelled. Spill a barrel of that stuff somewhere and chances are people will notice tens of kilometers away (subject to wind direction). Many everyday things carry just a few meters or less, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And the forum poster was saying that it's completely possible to do that, by just explaining that certain objects can be differentiated from each other by the visible light they reflect in their environment. And that over the course of your life, you become familiar with the amount of light each item gives off and how it should behave. And can even feel uneasy when you detect a type of light that isn't expected for the object, or that possibility indicates danger.</p>
<p>It is similarly the case with smell. </p>
<p>Just as objects reflect visible light, they also give off a detectable scent into the air. Some objects more then others. And over the course of your life, you become familiar to how things should smell. And can immediately tell when something isn't right (food not smelling the way it should because it was turned), or that possibility indicates danger (the smell of natural gas or other flammable material).</p>
<p>To smell is almost like detecting a different type of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taste is akin to touch; it happens in a very specific location, and only in direct contact. You 'feel taste' with the specific part of your tongue that the thing is touching. </p>
<p>But smell is more like hearing; you don't really 'feel sound' with your ears, it's just something happening outside you. In the same way you don't really 'feel smell' in your nose - your brain maps the sensation to the outside world. </p>
<p>The quality of the sensation itself is perhaps closest to taste; we use it as a much more detailed sense of taste, in fact. When people get a cold and temporarily can't smell much, they complain that they can't taste anything. Which they can, it's just they've lost a good 80% of the bandwidth they're used to. </p>
<p>So yeah... taste-hearing is probably the best analogy I can give you.</p>
<p>As for how far away... it depends on the smell. Again like hearing, some things carry more than others.</p>
<p>A cardboard box has a distinct smell, ferinstance, but unless you're in a room full of them, you have to stick your nose right in it and sniff to pick it up. </p>
<p>On the other hand, some smells you can pick up from across the room or across a whole building, even if they're quite faint. If someone's reheating a dried-fish curry in the common-room microwave in my building, the whole floor will know about it, at the very least. </p>
<p>The scent of wattle (acacia) blossom is famous for its ability to carry; despite being only slightly noticeable even close up... on a warm summer night, you can sometimes still notice it half a mile away. </p>
<p>Also, we adapt to constant smells quite rapidly; we can sit at home all day and not notice anything, go out to the shops and when we come back realize that ew, the garbage needs taking out; the smell built up slowly from a low level, so we adapted without even noticing. Coming in from outside, however... ewww!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully you'll find it reassuring that smell is probably the least important sense in day to day life. I like the comparison others have made to it feeling like something between tasting and hearing -- it serves a similar function of detecting chemicals like with taste, but those chemicals are in the environment around you, like sound.</p>
<p>Smell and taste aren't really that strongly correlated. For example, a toasted asiago cheese bagel can have a powerful, repulsive smell, but taste mild in comparison. On the other hand, salty foods don't really have a &quot;salty smell&quot; but can have a strong taste. The big thing here is that we learn to associate smells with tastes. You can learn to like a bad smell if you know what is causing it.</p>
<p>Strong smells can have other effects too. Bad smelling food can make you feel nauseous, strong-smelling volatile chemicals (like gasoline) can make you feel light-headed. Good food smells can make you feel hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, fighting isn't allowed in pro hockey, there are rules against it and players who engage in a fight are assigned penalties.</p>
<p>There's kind of an unspoken code among hockey players though that dictates when it's appropriate to pick a fight with someone. Generally fighters (or enforcers or goons as they're sometimes called) only fight other fighters. Both players need to consent to the fight, either verbally or by physically fighting back and the fight stops when one player falls to the ice. You don't often see a skilled goal scorer getting into fights, but there are a few who'll drop the gloves if they need to.</p>
<p>An enforcer will usually start a fight with an opposing player if they've done something nasty to one of their teammates like lay on a dirty hit that might have injured them. The referees can't catch everything that happens on the ice and losing your star player for a couple of weeks to an injury is far worse than taking a 5 minute penalty for beating a guy up. It also sends the message that if you want to play rough with our best players, you have to pay the price.</p>
<p>Since fights are for the most part consensual and players assume a certain amount of risk when playing hockey it's very, very rare that any kind of criminal charges get laid against fighters. The only times that it's happened are in cases when one player sucker punches another or decides to use their stick as a weapon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fighting is allowed because most of the injuries aren't too severe, and it's become part of the sport. When two players go at it, the sticks get tossed away (so no one is assaulting anyone with a blunt weapon) the gloves come off (so when they punch each other in the face they feel it just as much in their knuckles as the opponent does in the face) and the skates stay on the ice (so no one is getting a skate stabbed into their femoral artery). Balancing on skates while fighting, there is an upper limit to just how hard you can punch a guy without risking a spill yourself, and while there are a number of very dramatic looking injuries (like the occasional tooth getting knocked out, or split brows bringing that bright red blood splatter on the ice) it's rare that someone is in real peril from a fight; for instance (per wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ice_hockey_players_who_died_during_their_playing_career" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ice_hockey_players_who_died_during_their_playing_career</a>) during the period of 2000-2009, only one guy died as a result of a hockey fight, and that was because he fell over and hit his head on the ice, while more guys died from medical complications during training. </p>
<p>The fights are not &quot;planned&quot; in a wrestling sense, nor are they just for show. No one is sitting with a clipboard and a radio telling the players when they're scheduled to have a punch-out. Fistfighting serves as a form of deterrence against opposition actions that are either frowned upon but not strictly against the rules, or against fowl play that is pulled off while the refs are looking elsewhere. Say for instance someone decides to use their stick to trip an opponent; even if the ref misses it, the other team knows damn well what they did, and he's going to be in less of a hurry to repeat that stunt if he knows that one or more guys on the team (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer_(ice_hockey" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer_(ice_hockey</a>)) are ready to eat the penalty time in order to retaliate. </p>
<p>As far as the risk/reward ratio, the risk is that one of your players ends up in a penalty box or with an injury that requires medical attention, versus the reward that the other team isn't going to screw with your players (especially important players) unless they're ready to taste some blood in exchange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Hockey is different today. Intimidation was a huge part of the game (less and less so since the mid to late 90's, and probably even before that).</p>
<p>Take 2 teams:</p>
<p>Team A is significantly more skilled/talented.
More often than not they are going to beat Team B...</p>
<p>Team B knows they are significantly less skilled...</p>
<p>They have little chance of winning if it's just based on skill. However Team B realizes that Team A with its skilled players (skill players are normally smaller) can be intimidated (or let's say they hope they can be intimidated) to the point where their skill advantage is nullified.</p>
<p>Team A will employ players to protect their skilled players.
Team B will employ players to attempt to intimidate them.
It becomes an arms race of sorts. </p>
<p>Fighting is less and less relevant in today's game.
It probably serves little purpose except for allowing players to unleash some frustration without swinging a hockey stick at someone's head.</p>
<p>Now it's more tradition; the day is coming when it's eliminated but I don't think anyone in a position to make that change wants to do so because there will be severe backlash from a significant segment of NHL fans.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where I stand. I think it's time for it to go, but a part of me hates myself for saying that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Late 90s I'm watching playoff football, I can't remember the teams but I want to say Pittsburgh and San Diego? Anyway, one team had an amazing running back, foundation of the offense and every time he had a run the other team was going after his legs; twisting, falling on his ankles, shitty stuff. The refs were calling it though and by halftime they (the team attacking dudes legs) were losing and the announcers were all over the penalty yards stat: &quot;200yds in penalties! (or whatever it was) that's not how you win at football!&quot; So about a third of the way through the third the RB in question goes down to a leg injury and the team becomes one dimensional on offense. Other team just Ts off on the blitz. 3 and out. 3 and out. 3 and out. &quot;Dirty&quot; team goes on to win. Penalties don't mean shit if you can get the best player off the field.
Good luck with that shit in hockey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's the same with foreign employees with a corporate sponsored work visa. Those employees will get kicked out of the country of they lose their job for whatever reason. That's why big corporations are always pushing for more H-1B visas (in addition to pushing down salaries for highly trained personnel). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens right now is BigCo pays its workers partially in cash and partially in health benefits.  It doesn't need to pay taxes on those health benefits, so the same money paid in health benefits is far cheaper for the company than it would be in salary.</p>
<p>If you remove the option of providing benefits, all you do is shift the salary portion upwards.  After the stickiness settled out, BigCo would be spending the same on its employees and its employees would be making a higher salary (but almost certainly getting this additional money and more taxed away to pay for universal benefits).</p>
<p>However, the issue isn't really BigCo.  It's SmallCo.</p>
<p>Let's say you're a senior partner in a 50-person law firm.  Your firm offers excellent health benefits.  More importantly, you <em>personally</em> have decision authority over those benefits.</p>
<p>What that means is that when your child gets sick with a nigh-unto-incurable conditions, you have enormous clout with the insurance company.  If they're not willing to cover the care or they're hassling you over bills, you can threaten to take your business - and the business of the other 49 people in your law firm - elsewhere.</p>
<p>In contrast, that same senior partner in a universal health care world has no clout whatsoever.  They're still making the same six-figure-plus salary, they still belong to the same golf club, but now the people making decisions about their health care aren't returning their phone calls.</p>
<p>The same happens with unions.  Many unions control the health care for their members.  If you create a government universal health care plan, they suddenly lose control over their health care.</p>
<p>And this is literally a life-and-death issue.  People outside of these sorts of arrangements (unions, professional middle class) don't have much power over their health care under any scheme, so it doesn't matter very much to them.  The tremendously wealthy and influential - CEOs and Senators - have control no matter what.  But the middle class goes from having decent, responsive medical care to being treated like indigents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To a certain degree, socialized anything has a stigma attached to it. Market-based systems developed organically (for most consumer transactions, health care included), and those market systems had to work through some wrinkles to work. Because of that, in most cases they work reasonably well, and help allocate goods and services in a relatively efficient way. In a few cases, various governments tried socializing some services. Those socialized services didn't work out well initially--and of course they didn't, the market based systems took time to get right too--which has attached a stigma to any new initiative that hopes to socialize something. People see the problems that have been created by socialized systems, but not the solutions that they've provided. </p>
<p>The problem in healthcare is that it doesn't lend itself to a fair market transaction. If you're dying of a disease, and only one person can cure that disease, that supplier can charge you whatever you're willing to pay. If you have a gun shot wound, and you need treatment right now, you're not going to shop from surgeon to surgeon to get the best price. </p>
<p>On the other side, the moral issues in healthcare can be really tricky. If I have a disease that can be treated, but at a very high cost, at what point is the cost of my treatment too great of a burden to inflict upon society? How does my role in society impact that determination? If I'm a skilled surgeon, should society be willing to tolerate more expensive treatment than if I'm a used car salesman? Who makes that call? </p>
<p>I interned for a family court judge for a semester some years ago. Those judges make really difficult decisions that have a significant impact on kids lives. The emotional baggage clearly weighed on the judges I interacted with. Can you imagine asking someone to be a judge on a panel determining (in essence) who lives and who dies? The emotional burden would be enormous. </p>
<p>All that being said, I'm the odd person who is right-of-center politically, but believes a single-payer system is the right healthcare solution. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>this is a problem of agency. </p>
<p>Most of the employees of most large corporations <em>should</em> be in favor of this, but since many of them get health insurance through work, they don't think that they would benefit (not realizing that they <em>should</em> be demanding substantially higher wages when their employers no longer need to pay for their health insurance, which would more than offset their personal increase in taxes, if any). </p>
<p>High ranking, highly paid executives who have a lot of influence on corporate policy and lobbying not only have health insurance through work, they also make so much more money than average that they would personally lose out by having to pay higher taxes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You can see this by looking at organisms given heavy water, which contains deuterium instead of hydrogen. Since the nucleus of deuterium is heavier, that means it is less likely to tunnel, and the rate of mutation in these organisms decreases.</p>

There's a general misconception that any damage to your DNA is irreversible, but usually several different things have to go wrong with the reconstructive part of the genome before real damage will occur, IE cancer.

<p>I'm not an expert in biology, but even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling#Quantum_biology" target="_blank">quantum tunelling article</a> on wikipedia says they are important in hydrogen bonds.
