		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to the idea that corporations are legally &quot;people,&quot; the courts have upheld the notion that political contributions are an exercise of &quot;free speech&quot; by these <em>people</em>, and the <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em> ruling by SCOTUS removes the caps on these donations and allows the donors to remain anonymous, thereby creating the perfect storm for the sort of campaign contribution abuse to which you allude.</p>
<p>And, yes, it has created an environment in which our elected representatives are beholden more to their benefactors, the ones who enable them to be elected and to keep their jobs, than they are to &quot;we the people.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify, <em>Citizens United</em> does not permit massive corporate contributions directly to the coffers of individual politicians or political parties, by establishing procedural and policy hoops they have to leap through. However, there is never any question where the money is coming from or for whom or what it is intended, so the net result is still the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll provide a more macro perspective on this because I think it helps. One must ask first, why would the government deny anyone the right to do anything that they want? If two people make an agreement whos the government (being the third party) to come in and tell them that the agreement they made is void? </p>
<p>And so we come to a very old idea between two parties regarding the freedom to contract with one another. This old idea is incorporated across the world in many different ways from the most simple of cultures to massive political systems such as the USA. Determining whether agreements are equitable between parties or bad for public policy or many other things is what each governments burden is when creating laws that suppress this original freedom.</p>
<p>So to answer your question in a nonspecific way, the United States has not abolished (although they have made some campaign finance reform in other ways) this idea... yet. </p>
<p>I hope my answer was helpful as a foundation for the basis of your question in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, it does NOT go into their pockets. Not legally, at least. It is used to help them campaign, achieve reelection, and achieve other political goals. The problem is, it's still possible to &quot;buy&quot; or unfairly influence politicians by giving lots of money to their reelection campaigns. </p>
<p>Why is it allowed? There is an argument that it's free expression or free speech. You can give up your yard for a campaign sign, give up your internet bandwidth to share campaign slogans on social media, give up your time to call people and encourage them to vote for your cause.</p>
<p>Why can't you spend money in other ways to help the causes you believe in? Of course this can be incredibly unfair and has a lot of potential for abuse and corruption. But that's the basis of it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of wrong answers here.  Very simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporations cannot give money to politicians directly.</li>
<li>Corporations cannot donate money to politicians' campaigns.</li>
<li>Corporations <em>can</em> spend money to advertise on political <em>issues</em>, but not [edit] in cooperation with a campaign.</li>
<li>Certain corporations have publicly advocated for or against candidates for most of the nation's history.  We call those corporations &quot;newspapers&quot;.  The <em>Citizens United</em> Supreme Court decision basically made it so that any corporation could endorse a political candidate without having to go through the hassle of buying a newspaper.  But that's not the same as giving money to a campaign, and certainly not the same as giving money directly to a candidate.</li>
<li>Most of what's reported as &quot;corporations giving money to politicians&quot; is actually <em>people who work for corporations</em> making <em>individual</em> donations to a campaign.  There are websites that track this, but again, it's often incorrectly reported as &quot;Walmart gave $$$$ to Senator X&quot;, when it's actually people who work for Walmart who made individual donations.</li>
<li>Individual people <em>are</em> allowed to make donations to political campaigns, because that's how they're funded.  But it's limited in size so that super-rich people can't basically buy a candidate.  People who work for corporations can give money just like people who don't.</li>
<li>There have been some proposals to make campaign costs be paid for by the government rather than from donations, but there's a serious problem with those proposals - they really help people who are already in office.  People who are already in office have good name recognition and already have connections with the media, so they have a huge advantage over challengers.  Fund-raising is one of the few ways that challengers have of getting an advantage over a veteran politician.</li>
<li>There is corruption and it is a real thing, but for the most part, this isn't it.  Corruption tends to be more of an informal arrangement - where a politician looks out for a corporation or other special interest, then they offer him or her a cushy job or super-generous &quot;consulting fees&quot; or &quot;speaking fees&quot; after they leave office.  That's entirely legal, but seriously questionable ethically, but it happens all the time.  But again, this isn't it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of lobbying for political favor is just the people asking for what they want.</p>
<p>However, it becomes a problem when people organize themselves into groups, and then lobby on behalf of their own interests as opposed to what's good for everyone.</p>
<p>These groups are often businesses, and businesses do what businesses are supposed to: make money. When a business lobbies for political favor, they are asking for special treatment in order to operate differently, and therefore, at an advantage to the competition. In order to achieve this goal, bribes are given, under the presumption that the bribed will work politically to improve the briber's ability to dodge competition or cut corners.</p>
<p>The problem isn't so much the bribes, it's where they are coming from. It's who is allowed to make the &quot;donations&quot;.</p>
<p>Money is necessary in politics because campaigning is expensive, and politicians don't directly create anything of value. As such, they must be allowed to accept money.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the first step to fixing government is to fund campaigns via tax money and forbid direct donations. Appeals to political favor made through rhetoric, not money. And to best fight against under the table bribes, require campaigns to set goals and make promises that they must pursue, otherwise they forfeit their position and a new election is held.</p>
<p>When individuals are politicians focus not  collectives, then we can have good government.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a purely computational standpoint, this in a sense boils down to how one explains multiplication by fractions, such as 0.7 <em> 2. Clearly that is 0.7 + 0.7, but it is also 7 </em> 0.2 = 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2, where all we're really doing is playing around with powers of ten. Once you understand how to represent a fraction in terms of powers of ten, multiplication by fractions is very similar to integer multiplication. I'll show below how we can use this to retain the interpretation that multiplication is repeat addition:</p>
<p>e ~ 2.72, π ~ 3.14</p>
<p>e x π = 2.72 x 3.14</p>
<p>2*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04) +</p>
<p>7*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04)/10 +</p>
<p>2*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04)/100 = </p>
<p>3 + 3 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.04 +</p>
<p>0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + </p>
<p>0.03 + 0.03 + 0.001 + 0.001 + 0.0004 + 0.0004 = 8.54</p>
<p>Edit: I should say that this is just an explicit example which shows that multiplication as repeat addition makes sense for fractions. I'm sure there is some other explanation as well, which more directly answers your question, <em>what is multiplication?</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A great way to think about multiplication is to think of it as scaling.  As stretching the number line.</p>
<p>In your example, imagine a number line and put a mark at e and at pi.  Now stretch the line so that 1 is at the e mark.  Where the pi mark stretches to is the value e times pi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you want to take a class in real analysis. The really quick answer is that your definition works for rational numbers, and we extend that to irrational numbers by defining them as limits of sequences of rationals.</p>
<p>Here's a bit longer answer, but you'd likely need at least the first few chapters of a real analysis book to make sense of it. You construct the real numbers from Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. (Equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences with the same limits, to be precise.) For multiplication, you just create a new sequence by multiplying the elements (pairwise) of the two multiplicands. Proving that this is also a Cauchy sequence is easy.  </p>
<p>In general terms, think of it as writing e and π to <em>n</em> decimal places. Then your repeated addition definition works fine. Now do it for <em>n</em>+1 digits. Show that as we add more digits to the multiplicands, the product doesn't change until (say) <em>n</em>-1 digits. So we can compute the product to arbitrary precision just by starting with enough precision in the multiplicands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit 2: or for the lazy,</p>
<p>&quot;These are called phosophenes. This happens when you touch or rub your closed eyes, or even squeeze them tightly closed, because the pressure stimulates your retina and makes your brain perceive light. Your retina has tiny cells in it that are used to collect light. When it takes in a light stimulus, the sensation crosses over to the other side of the eyeball which is why you see the light form opposite of the side of the eye that pressure was added. Phosophenes are different from hallucinations because they are caused by a physical pressure to the eyeball that creates the sensation of &quot;seeing light&quot; whereas hallucinations are generated solely in the occipital lobe.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit 3: I am not an opthalmologist, I just remembered someone asked a similar question. I know nothing of Opthalmology aside from that iritis sucks a whole hell of a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sound waves that move like this</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<pre><code>
The sound waves are moving perpendicular to the ground. 

If the source is to your left, and your ear is to the right, then you'll hear the sound just fine. 

If we put a really thin wall between the two.

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~ 

You'll still hear the sound, the sound waves hits the wall, transfers the energy THROUGH the wall to the air on the other side, and you'll hear it. 

Now, a larger wall

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

You may still hear it, but it will be very faint, maybe you'll have to put your ear to the wall, that's because the sound wave have to move a much larger amount of mass to transmit the signal and they don't have as much energy. (This is very simplified)

Now, rather than a wall, you've got snow. 

If it's snowing lightly.

~~~~~~~~#~~~~~
</code></pre>
<pre><code>

The sound is just partially muffled from the snowflake interfering with the path of the sound wave, it absorbs some of the energy of the wave and it doesn't go as far. 

If it's snowing heavily

~~~~~#~~~~~#~~~~~~##~~~~

~~~~#~~~~~~#~~~~~#~~~~~#

~~~~##~~~~~#~~~~~~#~~~~~~#~~

The sound wave loses a lot more energy as it goes from the source to your ear. Making the sound less loud, and it won't travel as far. 

Edit: formatting, cause the snowflakes didn't work well.</code></pre></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sound energy as a tennis ball. If you drop it on a hard flooring(cement/tile) it almost bounces back with same energy. Now if you drop the same ball on a sand pit , it hardly bounces. This happens because in a hard flooring the particles are tightly packed. They don't move . So all the energy that the ball carries transferred back to the ball and makes it move in the other direction. On the sand the particles are loosely packed so the get to move . So a lot of energy is expended in moving sand particles and very little is transferred to the ball. </p>
<p>Something similar happens to the sound. When it snows the snowflakes are not tightly packed. So they can absorb more ambient noise compared to before snowfall. So it relatively feels quieter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is honestly one of the most uninformed threads I have seen. There are only 2 laws that grant Congress immunity that the average person does not have, and they both are related to Congress doing their job. Congressman cannot be detained for minor crimes while on their way to cast a vote, and Congressman cannot be sued for things they say or votes they cast while in a session of Congress.</p>
<p>Both of these protections are very minor and yet very necessary. </p>
<p>But let me emphasize that you often <em>hear</em> news stories that say Congress is exempt from a law, but those news stories are <em>intentionally misleading.</em> Here are a few recent examples.</p>
<p><strong>Congress is exempt from insider trading</strong>. This gets circulating around every year or so and it is 100% false. Congress never has, and never will be, exempt from insider trading laws. When you read these news stories you will find out that Congress is allowed to buy and sell stock with the early knowledge of how their laws will affect companies. But this is <strong>not insider trading</strong>. It sounds like insider trading to someone that does not know the laws, but legally speaking it is not. Congress has to follow all the same insider trading laws as you and I, and it has always been that way.</p>
<p><strong>Congress is exempt from the Affordable Car Act/from the ACA replacement.</strong> This is also 100% false. The ACA set up health care exchanges where people could go if they did not have employer sponsored health insurance (among other things). Congress has employer sponsored health insurance as they are a government employees. Thus they will not use the exchanges, and somehow this got to people reporting that they were &quot;exempt&quot; from it. They are not exempt. </p>
<p>Just as if Congress passed a law that regulated Alaska crab fishing, you would not say they are exempt from the law because none of them are currently crab fisherman. They just passed a law that does not directly affect them. They do it all the time, that is their job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The straightforward answer is that Congress makes the laws, so if it passes a law that says Congress is exempt, and there's no law blocking such an exemption, then Congress is exempt.  </p>
<p>So, why would Congress make itself exempt from anything?  In some cases, the rules deal with things Congress doesn't want to do to itself, such as giving some protections to their own workers.  In other cases, it's just for more innocent, logistical purposes.  For example, as part of the recent Republican efforts to pass a new healthcare law, Congress exempted itself to avoid a conflict related to which committee can alter congressional health plans.  That being said, another bill was written to un-exempt Congress.  (<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2017/05/congress-exempt-gop-health-bill/" target="_blank">Here's a longer explanation.</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a standard all across the world for members of parliament to have some protection rights. For example, they can't be detained for some smaller crime until parliament waives their immunity. They also can't be prosecuted for the things they say while performing the duty of an MP. </p>
<p>Why? Because, unlike in the US, it has been relatively common for dictators to arise from the executive branch of govt in which case the parliament is either obedient from the start or the dictator removes problematic MPs because police found &quot;evidence&quot; that they're criminals so that they can be removed and replaced.</p>
<p>So they have immunity rights, which is still not a guarantee against this sort of thing but is still better than nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These laws are put in place with good intentions. For example, the Congress and most state legislatures have a law that says representatives can't be arrested on their way or from the capitol. That's a very important law that can keep a corrupt local sheriff from detaining a state legislator just long enough that they miss the vote on the 2017 Hold Corrupt Sheriffs Accountable Act. But like any other law, this one can be abused, or made subject to a bogus defense claim. It's easy to find examples of legislators disputing a DUI or reckless driving charge by claiming they were on their way to a vote.</p>
<p>Some of these &quot;exempt themselves from laws&quot; things are a matter of interpretation. For example, in my home state, legislators are allowed to carry a concealed weapon. That might sound like a special privilege until you realize there's little difference between their CCW privileges and yours. Congressman Smith still can't carry a gun into a bar or on an airplane. And like the above no-arrests example, this law is designed with sensible intentions: think back to the civil rights movement, when a legislator could legitimately fear for their safety for voting against segregation. So really it is just another law intended to protect government officials.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that the laws that apply to office holders <em>while in office</em>. Despite any voter complacency, the people do have some say in the matter, and it's not a freebies-for-life sort of deal. Once you're out, you're out. And since it's an elected office, so you could at least theoretically attain the office yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In anhydrous settings, partial melting is much harder to achieve and the plate tectonic conveyor belt &quot;seizes up&quot;, as rifting fails to give way to oceanic crust formation for lack of sufficient melt. the same problem occurs at the other end of the conveyor belt, as anhydrous lithospheric material will also require temperature a few hundred degrees higher to succefully initiate anatexis. Furthermore, the temperature increase for partial meltin of anhydrous rocks intensifies at higher pressures. (<a href="https://journals.lib.unb.ca/journalimages/GEOCAN/2006/Vol_33/No_04/geocan33_4ser01_fig8.jpg" target="_blank">See also</a>) And just to be clear, it is not sufficient for the water to occur on the surface, the mantle has to be pervasively hydrated for the presence of water to matter.</p>
<p>The case of Mars interesting, as <a href="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/37/12/1087.full" target="_blank">the martian mantle is understood to be water-poor, but chlorine-rich</a>. So, even if there was water in Martian oceans, there does not appear to have been an efficient conveyor belt reintroducing that water back to the Martian mantle. And the Martian Lithosphere is much thicker that Earths, so the corresponding anhydrous melting temperatures are rather daunting. Yet, there was incipient rifting on Mars [see Valles Marineris], it just failed to open and produce oceanic crust. There is no evidance of incipient subduction to my understanding either. There was intense hotspot volcanism as witnessed by those spectacular shield volcanoes, however, so at least some degree of partial melting occured; just not enough at sustained rates enough to open up...</p>
<p>That being said, I can't imagine how a global planetary ocean would interfere with an active plate system. Just gotta remember that over the course of geological time, plate tectonics tends to favor the progressive formation of continental crust which is much thicker and persistent, so just cause you start with a 100% oceanic crust and no emerging land in your system does not imply it will remain that way over geological time periods. In our Earths history, continental crust seems to have been much rarer and in smaller pieces in the Archean than today. </p>
<p>TLDR:</p>
<p>1 - No water - no significant plate tectonic activity</p>
<p>2 - water sequestered at the surface without a way into the dry mantle: no significant plate tectonic activity</p>
<p>3 - water at the surface in small or huge quantities and a wet mantle: plate tectonics all the way</p>
<p>4 - No water at the surface, but a pervasively wet mantle: plate tectonics galore as long as the mantle remains wet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Rather they're both due to an underlying cause: Mars is no longer geologically active. Obviously this has caused Mars to cease tectonic activity; it is also the reason that Mars has no water, because no geological activity means no magnetosphere to prevent the atmosphere being blown away by solar wind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I talk about this extensively in my book, Our Cosmic Story:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Cosmic-Story-Exploring-Civilization-ebook/dp/B01N6O2OBC/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Our-Cosmic-Story-Exploring-Civilization-ebook/dp/B01N6O2OBC/</a></p>
<p>From what we know of Earth, it is a resounding YES, but on other worlds it depends on how large the planet is, as hat is a key indicator of how active and hot its interior (viscosity). There appears to be a fine balance between not enough and too much interior activity. </p>
<p>Mars lost its atmosphere, water, and plate tectonics (likely in that order) because the planet is simply too small to support an active interior (and thus a magnetic field that protects the water and atmosphere from erosion), and probably had too thick of a crust as well. Venus is simply too close to the sun and succumbed to a greenhouse effect on a massive scale, losing its water through atmosphere escape. It still has an atmosphere due to it being larger than Mars and able to hold on to those gases via other methods (and an erosion process that overloaded its atmosphere with carbon dioxide).</p>
<p>Back to Earth, it has plate tectonics because of water helping to lubricate the plates and keep them moving along mainly the subduction zones. At times in Earth's history these plates were not moving (what's called a stagnant lid scenario). If there was no water on the Earth, it's quite reasonable to presume that plate tectonics would have long shut down, and our world would be a slightly cooler Venus. This will still be the case a couple of billion years from now as the Sun continues to heat up.</p>
<p>Worlds that are on the larger super-Earth size of 1.6 radius or more may not have plate tectonics either because their interiors are too active to allow the just-right anchoring of the plates and yet allow them to slide at regular intervals. This is still quite uncertain though, as these worlds may have super thin crusts, which may be enough to offset the interiors activity... though it may prove a problem with too much outgassing.</p>
<p>There is a window of where even more habitable worlds than Earth might reside with just-right plate tectonics that never form a stagnant lid scenario, or rarely, and without needing water for lubrication. These are worlds roughly 1.1 to 1.5 radius of the Earth. A thinner (but not too thin) crust is likely on these worlds as well, which helps to prevent a stagnant lid scenario. </p>
<p>The depth of the water will not have much, if any, effect on the plate tectonics being active or stagnant. Once there is water sufficient to cover the active subduction zones of the plates, driving water downward into the mantle to help lubricant the process, that is all that is required. 100 meters or 10,000 meters of water will do the same job here.</p>
<p>Water is essential to life at all stages of development, and at least as far as simulations are concerned, it seems to be nearly that case for the planet itself to maintain active geology of the type life would fine necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This effect only happens in matches that contain trace amounts of metal such as iron. For example, some match heads will contain some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III\)_oxide" target="_blank">iron (III) oxide</a>, i.e. the stuff in rust. This scattered iron oxide will have rather weak magnetic properties. However, when you burn the match, carbon present in the match can reduce the iron oxide to metallic iron:</p>
<p>Fe2O3 + 3C -&gt; 2Fe + 3CO</p>
<p>The metallic iron you get is ferromagnetic. As a result, the entire match will be much more strongly attracted to a magnet after burning.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Something I am actually qualified to answer! I actually started a <a href="https://blog.birchfinance.com/newbies-beat-the-banks/" target="_blank">beginner's guide/series to reward programs</a> on my blog and <a href="https://birchfinance.com" target="_blank">my startup built an app</a> that helps you optimize your credit card rewards and find the best cards for your spending.</p>
<p>There are two main parts that make up credit card reward programs:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Earning rewards  </li>
<li>Redeeming rewards  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types of reward currencies you can earn  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cash back  </li>
<li>Points  </li>
<li>Miles  </li>
</ul>
<p>(points and miles are virtually the same and vary depending on what that specific reward program wants to call them. A lot of Airlines will use miles because you're &quot;flying a certain number of miles when you travel&quot; and others use points because they tend to be more generic - hotels, specific bank branded credit cards etc.)<br />
Let's break down each type of program:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cash Back</strong>  </p>
<p>Cash back is pretty simple - you earn a fixed cash percentage back on your credit card purchases based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_category_code" target="_blank">mcc code</a> multiplier or a specific merchant (like Target or Banana Republic). For example, the <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-preferred/" target="_blank">Amex Blue Cash Preferred</a> earns 6% cash back on groceries, 3% cash back on U.S. gas stations and department stores, and 1% cash back on everything else. You can read the Blue Cash Preferred <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/personal-card-application/terms/blue-cash-preferred-credit-card/36501-10-0/?pznOfferCode=PIWG-3PBEQC-25WM-9O4&amp;print#offerBenefitTermsDisclosures" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/rewards-info.html" target="_blank">Reward Terms</a> to see which MCC codes are included/excluded and also learn about every other limitation/quirk this card has.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The complicated part</em><br />
The biggest complication with cash back cards are the limits/caps the issuers put on how much you can earn each year. With the Amex BCP, you only earn 6% on groceries on the first $6000 in grocery spend each year, then 1%. Some cards offer <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar.html" target="_blank">rotating categories</a>, like the Chase Freedom and Discover It cards.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Points &amp; Miles</strong>  </p>
<p>I'm bucketing points and miles together because although they have different names, they are effectively the same thing - a virtual rewards currency. Any non cash back reward program will be either points or miles. These include airline, hotel, car rental, supermarket, gas station co branded cards and more, as well as bank specific non cash back cards like the Chase Sapphire Cards where you earn Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou cards where you earn ThankYou Points.  </p>
<p>Instead of earning a cash back % for each $ spent, you instead earn a points/miles multiplier on specific categories and merchants  - The <a href="https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-preferred" target="_blank">Chase Sapphire Card</a> (CSP for short) earns 2x points on travel and dining and 1x for everything else. Of course, there are exclusions in the terms and conditions.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The complicated part</em><br />
Redeeming points &amp; miles is extremely variable, and the $ value for what the rewards are worth changes depending on a whole lotta factors. For example, if I redeem Ultimate Rewards from my CSP card for Travel I &quot;get 25% more value when you redeem for airfare, hotels, car rentals and cruises through Chase Ultimate Rewards. For example, 50,000 points are worth $625 toward travel.&quot; &lt;- Directly from Chase's site. That means if I redeem my points for non travel, they're worth less. The Points Guy does <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/category/points-valuations/" target="_blank">monthly reward valuations</a>, but IMO they're a bit too simplistic and I'm not sure he uses a big enough data set to make super accurate calculations.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, in this case above, if I can redeem 50,000 points for $625, that means each point is worth $.0125 each. Meaning that if I earn 2x on travel and dining and redeem for travel, I effectively am getting <strong>2.5% back</strong> per $ spent.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take it one step further, I'll use United's MileagePlus program. (In light of current events I still enjoy flying United, personally have their CC, and fly 3-4 flights for free each year). The miles on United's program vary depending on the airports you fly to/from, the time of day you fly, how far in advance you book, seat class, etc. This holds true on many other airlines as well. And even though United is a <a href="https://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx" target="_blank">tier structure</a> - if you select North America as your departure and arrival location it will show you the 10k, 12.5k, 25k chart - the flight values vary, so the more expensive flight I can get for 12.5k miles on way, the more my rewards are worth. Most recently I flew Orlando -&gt; San Francisco and redeemed my miles for around 2.9cents each, so on each purchases where I earned 1x mile I got 2.9% back effectively, and any purchases with multipliers I got 5.8% back, effectively.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get even more complex, I can <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/chase-ultimate-rewards-transfer-partners" target="_blank">transfer my Chase Ultimate Reward Points</a> as a 1:1 ratio to United. So purchases made on my CSP card at travel and dining and redeemed for the reward example above would net me 5.8% back.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take this system of changing reward rates above and apply it to hotels and other redemption types and it gets tricky. This is why a lot of people choose cash back cards with a flat 2% cash back, like the <a href="https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card" target="_blank">Citi Double Cash</a>, but many of us enjoy racking up points and miles and getting higher value when redeeming for travel (usually the highest).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a complete list, and there are so many more things to consider like annual fees, foreign transaction fees if you travel abroad, cards that offer airport lounge access, anniversary bonuses, spending bonuses, other caps and exclusions, sign up bonuses and more. And if you travel, you earn rewards just by flying the airlines and staying in hotels, so you can rack up points beyond just what the credit cards offer.<br />
&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So who pays for rewards?</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Interchange Fees: The credit card issuer takes a cut of your purchase when you pay at a retailer. The rate on this varies but is usually higher then the redeemed value % on that purchase (plus a lot of rewards just sit around and are never redeemed)  </li>
<li>Credit card debt: The interest that revolving card holders pay will fund reward programs much of the time. That's about half the US population.  </li>
<li>Annual fees: The annual fee you pay on the cards will sometimes offset the reward value earned  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tl;dr: You earn rewards a variety of different ways and redeem for different reward types where values change. Cash back is just a % back on your spending. All have exclusions and limitations to look out for. </p>
<p>edit: formatting<br />
double edit: My first gold! Thanks stranger! Who would have thought it would be a comment about literally the one thing I know this much about because I work in it all day long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten several excellent answers to &quot;how&quot; rewards work, but there are also interesting reasons &quot;why&quot; they've grown in popularity.</p>
<p>About 10-15 years ago, when airline &quot;miles&quot; were still the dominant credit card reward, the IRS decided that these rewards from credit cards would not be treated as income and, thus, would not be taxable.  This is different from traditional interest on a savings account, for example, which is still taxed as income.</p>
<p>The rationale is that credit card rewards are earned only when you purchase something, and so they operate like rebates or even simple price reductions.  In other words, if you used a coupon at the grocery store for 2% off your entire purchase, you wouldn't have to pay income tax on the 2% that you saved; and if you went to the grocery store, and a week later they sent you a rebate check for 2% of your purchase, same thing; and if you went to the grocery store, and paid with your credit card, and later you got 2% back on your credit card statement ... well, same thing, says the IRS.</p>
<p>Now, add this to the fact that interest rates on savings have been at rock bottom for nearly 10 years now.  Banks couldn't attract new customers with higher savings rates because, frankly, the economy just wouldn't support paying out interest.  So instead, the IRS revenue ruling has created something of an arms race as banks use bigger/better credit card reward programs to attract customers.</p>
<p>Finally, it's not just the banks.  Many popular cards are co-branded with specific companies (the Southwest cards offered by Chase are a popular example), and those companies not only get a cut, but they use enhanced points and perks to drive up their own business.  Southwest recently reported in an earnings call that their credit card revenue is the fastest growing source of revenue in their company!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Credit card companies make money in 2 main ways;</p>
<p>1) If you do not pay of the balance at the end of every payment period (usually a month, but there might be cards with other terms), they can charge interest. Usually this is a rather high rate.</p>
<p>2) Companies that want to accept payments from credit cards must pay the credit card companies for this. For this reason credit card companies give you gifts for using their cards. If you want those rewards, you'll use your credit card more often, which means companies must pay your credit card company more.</p>
<p>A little more color on #2.
Retailers that take credit cards from your mom and pop shop all the way to Walmart pay about 2.9% per transaction. This is what is used to subsidize your rewards program. The retailers pass this fee onto you via higher cost of goods.
On average, rewards program values are around 1% of your transaction.</p>
<p>Lots of retailers are starting to push back on this since they are the ones subsidizing the rewards program of these credit cards. In addition, for low margin businesses like grocery, their typical profit margin is between 3-5%. If they didn't have to pay the cc transaction fees, they could double their profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>How Reward Systems Work.</strong> Reward cards offer a variety of rewards in different ways. Some give cash back on all purchases, some give bonuses if you meet a spending threshold (such as 50,000 airline miles for $3,000 spent in the first 3 months), and some give other perks.</p>
<p><strong>Why Some People Get More/Better Rewards.</strong> Some people get more points or rewards because they qualify for rewards that other people don't. Just like qualifying for a loan, card companies offer different cards (with different rewards) to people based on their credit worthiness. A reliable consumer qualifies for better reward cards with better perks just like a reliable borrower qualifies for better loan terms. </p>
<p>Also, the amount of rewards you get is based on the amount you spend on the card. So if you have a card that offers 1 mile per dollar spent, but you only spend $500, you only get 500 miles. If I spend $15,0000, I get 15,000 miles.</p>

The only reason card companies offer these cards is because: <strong>1.</strong> People qualify for the card but don't end up meeting the minimum spend, <strong>2.</strong> People let the points expire, and most importantly <strong>3.</strong> People incur enough fees that the amount they pay in interest or fees exceeds the value of the offered rewards. (And because card companies make a little money on each transaction.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
