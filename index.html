		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a book about New Haven pizza- New Haven is considered by many as the birthplace of American pizza. Pizza was seemingly always delivered since it came to America in the early 20th century. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<p>&quot;...pizza was largely popularized starting in the 1910s when it was sold on the street and delivered to the factories and the Market Exchange, an important regional farmer's market.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the most famous pizza places/owners is even credited as the inventor of the pizza box to facilitate delivery. About Frank Pepe's:</p>
<p>&quot;(Pepe) continued to deliver pies...but he employed a new method to package them, the pizza box. The National Folding Box Co., a local firm, began making them, creating the oldest record of a pizza box in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>So again, to reiterate what I stated above- Pizza seems to have started in America as a food that was typically delivered. The tradition was just copied and continued from these original locations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three factors: the nature of pizza production, the physical and financial infrastructure available for that production in the United States after World War II, and the portable nature of pizza itself.</p>
<p>First, production: a pizza parlor needs only two pieces of specialized equipment, a heavy stand mixer for the dough and an oven that will hold temperatures over 700F. If you are handy, you can build the oven yourself with brick and pipe. So long as you aren't trying to open a full-service restaurant with lots of seating and a varied menu, the only expensive piece of equipment you have to acquire is that stand mixer. </p>
<p>Second, infrastructure: after World War II, the US government had a lot of surplus items they were selling cheap: jeeps, canteens, army boots,... and huge Hobart stand mixers. The Hobart mixers were big enough to mix a battalion's bread, and they were going cheap. A veteran could get a small business loan from the GI bill, buy his mixer, rent a small storefront, build his oven, and boom, he was in the restaurant business. It's a restaurant that can make a lot of pizza efficiently, but it can't make much else. You aren't going to get a lot of sit-down trade. People want to take what you make to eat someplace else. </p>
<p>This brings us to the third item: pizza is a perfectly portable food. It doesn't need a knife and fork. It can be reheated multiple times without a discernable loss in quality. By varying the toppings of vegetables and meat, it can easily be a single-dish meal that makes the entire family happy. As pizza parlors spread from urban centers, owners realized there was a limit to the walk-in traffic they could expect. They knew from their urban experience many customers were taking the pizza home. How could they replicate that trade in the suburbs? By offering a new service: pizza delivered to the customer's house. </p>
<p>Edit: something I forgot, which added steam to the spread of pizza delivery in the 1950's, particularly in the midwest: narcotics. Suppose you are an Italian organized crime boss in Chicago or Kansas City and you want to distribute narcotics in Lincoln, Nebraska. You can't just send a couple of Sicilian nephews to hang out on a street corner. Two Italian guys just stopping to buy gas in Lincoln would attract attention in the 1950's. People would notice. If the same two guys open a pizza parlor, however, no one cares. They can hire compromised people down on their luck as delivery men. They will learn soon enough who can move and consume their product. They have the perfect cover business: all cash, deliveries going all over the city, and open late. I don't know how much this happened in the East, and I don't think it happened at all out West, but I know this happened around KC and Chicago a lot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had a concrete source to provide you with, but in searching the internet for the history of pizza delivery I did come across a few connections that may be helpful:</p>
<p>Pizza as a food took off in American following WWII, when soldiers returning from overseas found themselves wanting that delicious pizza they ate while in Italy.  During this time, car culture also began to pick up, with more people having access to a car, which is important to note for the whole &quot;delivery&quot; part.</p>
<p>Moving forward into the middle of the century: work/life shifts that found both men and women in the workplace and spending more time traveling to get to their jobs found people with less time to cook dinner and greater interest in dining out or getting take out dinner.  Around this time somebody also figured out the better design for the pizza box, which made it easier to transport.</p>
<p>One other important thing for you factor in in regards to why more restaurants don't deliver is demand and profitability, etc.  If you live in an area that isn't densely populated, it may not be worth the time for a business to offer delivery if each delivery takes the person 45 minutes one direction for order number 1 and another 30 minutes another direction to drop off order number 2.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen a sign on the wall of a shop that says something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Cheap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pick Two</strong></p>
<p>That's essentially what's going on with our brains. A human brain uses up about 20% of the food we eat everyday, which is a lot for something that doesn't have to move us around or pump blood or anything 'strenuous' like that - but they could use a lot more. A computer that could do what our brains do would be enormous and would use thousands or millions of kWh of electricity. So, our brains are actually pretty efficient or &quot;cheap&quot; for what they do, which includes things like figuring out the right things to say and how to pronounce each word whenever we have to talk.</p>
<p>So, if they're &quot;cheap&quot; that means that they can't be as good and fast as we'd like. They're going to make mistakes sometimes. It's better to get the words right 99% of the time and be pretty fast and efficient, then it is to get the words right 100% of the time and be huge and use way more calories all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> - For a non ELI5 way to think of it we can <a href="http://www.definitionsblog.com/2017/01/animal-learning.html" target="_blank">think of our brains as lossy compression of things we've learned</a>. Instead of perfectly mapping inputs to outputs we map the responses on top of each other where possible, which results in a network. This saves a ton of space and energy, but it means that often our responses are &quot;good enough&quot; instead of being exactly what we might've wanted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's like a computer where one wire connects to other ports and wires to create a while computer. Once in a while, a neuron will fire when we are speaking but will go down a little different path which our brains are not used to. This will cause some lag just like a computer program that was not used in a while. This can ultimately lead to a stutter. To my knowledge, this occurs randomly and unpredictably. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I had to stop talking and take a few deep breaths in the middle of the conversation to recollect myself and catch my breath.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can control it to a certain extent if you can control your breathing.
Cross your arms in front of you and notice how you breathe into your chest, stretch your arms to the sides and notice how you breathe down into your belly.
When you stutter or mispronounce your words it's because you get excited, nervous or wound up in some other way, you're almost always breathing with your chest.
This is your body's emergency breathing system, and using it also produces cortisol, the stress-hormone causing you to loose full perspective on what you want to say and be more focused on 'getting the sentence out' (often because people think the listeners will lose attention if they talk normally) leading to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2127686/How-stress-shut-command-centre-brain.htm" target="_blank">frontal lobe shut-down</a> essentially shutting down your capacity to think broadly.</p>
<p>Our brain talks to our nervous system but our nervous system also talks back, if you can force yourself to breathe right you won't fumble words that way. Also, people will perceive you as more confident if you do this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tax exempt status is allowed for nonprofit organizations that are operated exclusively for religious, educational, scientific or other charitable purpose. There are a few more rules, but those are the two big requirements: (1) nonprofit and (2) religious, education, scientific, or charitable.</p>
<p>As you can see, churches don't get special treatment over other nonprofits. However, you might still ask why &quot;religious&quot; organizations are included at all. One reason is that it helps maintain separation of church and state. As the Supreme Court noted in one of its earliest decisions regarding a national bank, the power to tax is the power to destroy. By not taxing churches, the state removes itself from interfering in church business and also makes sure the state doesn't start relying on church taxes for its operation.</p>
<p>Another reason is that historically churches were important charitable and social centers. That's still true for many churches today, but it was even more apparent when the tax laws were first being made. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The federal tax code makes organizations that meet certain criteria tax exempt. &quot;Being a religious organization&quot; is enough to qualify under current law, but let's just pretend that it wasn't for a minute. </p>
<p>Even if it weren't, churches would pretty much all still meet the criteria (see below!) and thus qualify for tax exempt status. So the only way of <em>excluding</em> churches from tax-exempt status would be discrimination on the basis of religion. That's unconstitutional under the First Amendment. </p>
<p>Also, at this very moment, there are churches that <em>don't</em> qualify for tax-exempt status because they violate other rules for tax-exempt status. I'm not talking about the <em>highly</em> debatable notion that churches risk their tax status be engaging in political activities. Set that aside for the moment. No, I'm talking about rules that prevent the benefits of any nonprofit, tax-exempt organization from &quot;redounding to a particular person or persons,&quot; i.e., using a tax-exempt organization as your own personal slush fund. The most egregious example would be someone routing their earned and presumably taxable income through a tax-exempt entity that then pays all their living expenses &quot;charitably&quot;. That's called &quot;tax evasion,&quot; and turns out to be an <em>excellent</em> way of <em>going to jail</em>. </p>
<p>Now most churches don't have <em>that</em> problem, if for no other reason than the IRS tends to catch on to that kind of dodge pretty quickly. But there are <em>definitely</em> ways that churches--innocently or otherwise--can get into trouble here that have <em>nothing</em> to do with religion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not by religious doctrine, but by government mandate. You <em>have</em> to pay a certain amount of money.</p>
<p>Keep in mind governments tend to care for things that bring in more taxes, so bigger churches and bigger religions would be favored in developmental plans to prevent disruption of government income. This could be something as small as redirecting a highway so it goes through a neighborhood instead of a church or as large as adjusting policy to benefit one church more than another. The only requirement is that the government doesn't discriminate between religions. I may be completely wrong, but it seems to me that it can still discriminate between churches of the same religion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bailout of 2008 was premised on the notion of Keynesian economic theory, which basically means that economic cycles can last longer than human lifetimes hence government intervention into capitalist systems are necessary in the &quot;short term&quot;. </p>
<p>At first, the administration toyed with the idea of allowing the banks to fail, then letting the system repair itself. That's why Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers weren't bailed out at first. It's important to recognize that shareholders were screwed anyway; in a bailout you basically dilute all your equity. So a bailout was less of a handout than a genuine rescue of the economic system. </p>
<p>However, the intertwining relationships between banks and major financial &quot;too big to fail&quot; entities like Fannie Mae or AIG meant that allowing one bank to fail would mean a cascading domino effect across the board. The way it works is like this. Many banks work essentially by taking short term debt (deposits, money instruments, etc) and investing it into longer term debt (mortgages, bonds, etc). Loss of confidence would spark a liquidity crisis much like a global bank run on US financial entities; and with many banks reliant on each other to pay back their loans, one big default could mean everyone would fall like dominos. This was because their assets were marked to market; in layman's terms, they were worth whatever the bond market thought they were worth, so overnight they could become &quot;worthless&quot; and therefore bankrupt, even if nothing had changed in one day. (fundamentally, they were supposed to be bankrupt in an orderly fashion a long time ago)</p>
<p>Hence the immediate bailout response (TARP) was more of a liquidity measure rather than a fundamental rescue (there was nothing to rescue anyway) to give confidence to the international pension fund and institutional money managers, so they didn't do a &quot;bank run&quot; on the US economy. This allowed for a slower, more controlled release of the pent up financial panic, and gave some breathing room for the government to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>The next order of bailouts that the general public is more familiar with, Quantitative Easing, is basically the same thing but on a much grander scale. Essentially, nations themselves can become over leveraged with debt, although in a slightly different meaning as they also can print money. But the basic idea was that the US economy as a whole had far more credit in the system than was represented by the productivity of its population - which means some lenders had been suckered and weren't getting their money back. </p>
<p>In order to &quot;deleverage&quot; the economy as a whole, you had to remove the debt in the system. This was done by buying up toxic assets from aforementioned financial entities and retiring them, using printed money since the government unlike most financial entities can print money. Governments have a host of options available to them that goes beyond the scope of this topic, but generally speaking the idea is the same. Remove debt so that the amount of credit in the system more closely matches actual productivity.</p>
<p>As there is just way too much debt accumulated over decades (started since around the 80's), there is no easy solution. Going against the Keynesian model and doing things the traditional way by letting the economy fail and correct itself had actually been done before - following the Great Depression of 1929. This had disastrous results for everyone, sparking mass suicides and social unrest, and the economy languished for over a decade and would have continued to do so for who knows how long had it not been for massive war spending. As Keynes himself put it, &quot;in the long term, we're all dead anyway.&quot; This formed the basis for the bailouts, justified by the premise that it was the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>To the common man on the street, the main thing you should be taking away from this is that the bailouts were necessary, but things aren't going to get much better soon. Adjust your expectations lower, as this will be the new normal going forward, at least for 10 years or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will add with the idea of the consequences of them doing so. Bailing out the banks cemented in the minds Wall Street execs that the government will always bail, at least most of them, out given the right circumstance. This is called &quot;Moral Hazard&quot; where banks are incentivized to engage in risky behavior that is likely to lead to further fraud and risky behavior. Are the consequences disastrously bad if we did not bail them out? Yes, but they are also not very good for doing so. </p>
<p>I will also bring in the ideas of Hyman Minsky. One of his overarching claims is that stability is destabilizing. The government has worked to create stability for decades now in the form of safety nets for the unemployed and failing businesses. It is this stability and appearance of safety that specifically leads businesses to engage in risky behavior. If nothing is planned to go wrong and you wont be punished for what you do, why not keep pushing the line a little bit further?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To give a brief idea: too many banks would fail, Govs wouldn't be able to pay the guaranteed deposits to virtually every member of their economy and also deal with the collapse in trade from the absence of the payment systems and money dealers.  Also, all the publically traded business or investors who would lose all their investments from the collapse of the equity markets.</p>
<p>Plus mass unemployment, not just from the banks themselves but also all other businesses going bankrupt.  Also the inevitable collapse in the currencies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have already pointed out, Twitter is an expensive operation. I want to drill down on one specific aspect of its operations.</p>
<p>If you talked to anyone at Twitter, they would actually tell you that they made a net profit this last quarter:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Q4 GAAP net loss of $167 million and <strong>non-GAAP net income of $119 million</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>^(<em>- from their SEC filings, emphasis mine</em>)</p>
<p>That's quite a big difference! What is this GAAP and non-GAAP business and why does it give such wildly different profit models?</p>
<p>Herein lies one of the costliest aspect of Twitter's operation: <strong>employee retention</strong>. This is a well-known secret within the tech industry, and it is somewhat peculiar that a (relatively, by the tech standard) mature company has to spend so much money to keep a reasonable tenure rate that it's pushing their profit margins into the black hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>GAAP vs OLD NAVY</strong></p>
<p>GAAP and non-GAAP are two different accounting models that the CFO and his analysts use to compile Twitter's financials. In simple terms, GAAP is the model that the security exchange wants, and the non-GAAP model basically takes some of the expenses of running Twitter, and reasons that they are &quot;self-reinvesting&quot; enough that they shouldn't be accounted for as an expense altogether.</p>
<p>For Twitter, their non-GAAP trick is to magically erase the impact of &quot;Stock-based compensation expense&quot; and &quot;restructuring changes&quot;. In other words, they don't believe that their accountants should really care about what they have to pay their employees to show up everyday because that's not really reflective of whether they will succeed.</p>
<p>Of course, this raises several questions.</p>
<p><strong>Why would anyone care about the no-compensation model in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>Compensation is as much of a cost of operations as RnD, servers, physical assets, or a host of other expenses required to keep Twitter chugging along. This is obviously the opinion of the SEC as well, so why does Twitter even think it can get away with reporting a, quote, &quot;non-GAAP net income of $119 million&quot;?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that there is some precedence for evaluating a company's <em>potential</em> even when they are not profitable. For many early companies, shelling out for good talent from time to time (or during growth sprees) isn't really an ominous thing. Nevertheless, standard accounting of their financials would lead your shareholders to believe that, because Foofle brought on an expensive director this year, its profit suffered. For healthy companies, excluding these expenses actually can give shareholders more clarity on the long-term direction of their company.</p>
<p>So far everything seems reasonable, but there's more to Twitter than meets the eye.</p>
<p><strong>Why are Twitter's financials peculiar?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's actually not that difficult to answer. Including both stock compensation and restructuring fees, Twitter spends around $240m to make sure that their employees keep coming into work every morning. With a total revenue of $700m, that's over a third of its total revenue! (For reference, Facebook, who pays the third most to retain employees, only pays out 15% of their total revenue) No other comparable companies in that vertical, or even in tech in general, spends that much to keep their employees.</p>
<p>Why is Twitter having trouble here? Well, the fact of the matter is, the RSUs (stock units/shares in Twitter) that the company grants to its employers is losing value every quarter. If you look at the historical price per share since Twitter went public, it's been dipping monotonically. As a result, the shares that were granted to an employee is only worth a fraction of the prices that they are worth when they were granted. (Some of this depends on the technicality of how those shares vest/when they can be sold).</p>
<p>Obviously, people are generally not very happy when they are holding what appears to be a depreciating asset. As a result, to keep their employees happy, Twitter will re-issue refresher stocks each year to compensate for the depreciation in the value of their equity, as well as a bit extra as a bonus (probably).</p>
<p>So what's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Nothing. It's just that Twitter's performing so poorly that, to keep their compensation competitive, they're actually eating up a third of its revenue in order to keep their engineers, their strategist, and their other employees happy.</p>
<p>But there's some good news for Twitter at least. This percentage of total revenue that goes towards employee retention is declining every year (it was about 50% back in 2014). For the most part, this is mostly due to increasing revenue. However, if they become GAAP profitable and beat earnings, their stock prices will probably go up. At that point, their employees stocks will suddenly become an appreciating asset. As a result, they'll probably also stop bleeding so much money out to compensation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Most of the expenses are likely from not only the servers that run Twitter, but the back ups of the servers as well. In addition, you would need an IT staff around the clock to be able to put out any fires before they have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Twitter whole purpose is to allow people to post thoughts and weblinks, etc. immediately.  In other words, twitter being down would completely unacceptable, otherwise you'll lose business as people will go to other social media platforms to post their items and ad revenues would decrease as companies would spend money elsewhere.  So they are losing money still, but if their reliability is compromised, they would likely be hemorrhaging money even further. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have attempted to answer your question regarding the biological processes by which music is interpreted by the brain as <em>music</em> rather than just a collection of repetitive sounds.</p>
<p>But I don't see anyone taking a stab at explaining why certain sounds are &quot;pleasant&quot; or &quot;unpleasant.&quot; It turns out that there is a fairly wide range of diversity between cultures on that point. I'm not talking about the contrast between, say, hardcore punk and baroque fugues. Distinctions between harmony and counterpoint aside, both of those are firmly located in the Western musical tradition and are largely indistinguishable in terms of their musical theory. Their &quot;opinions&quot; as to what sounds &quot;happy&quot; and what sounds &quot;sad&quot;, for instance, are basically identical. Both of those genres have far more to do with each other than either has to do with, say, Eastern European polyphonic vocal traditions, which make significant use of intervals that Western music, for the most part, deliberately avoids. Or some Indonesian traditions which use instruments intentionally designed in such a way that when they are properly tuned, they produce the same kind of frequency beats that are the hallmarks of what defines an instrument as being <em>out</em> of tune in the Western tradition. </p>
<p>So yes, we have a pretty good idea as to what happens, biologically/neurologically, when we hear sounds/music that we consider to be pleasant. But exactly <em>what</em> sounds/music any particular individual or culture perceives to be pleasant appear to be almost entirely arbitrary functions of human culture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>When we expect something and we get it, it feels good. Music is made primarily up of patters, and when the pattern yields a certain set of notes that you expected to hear, it feels good. Imagine striking the keys of a piano  descending order and making a full octave. It's not a stretch to say that the final note it what makes it. If the last note were to be something disharmonious however, that would pretty much ruin the progression.</li>
</ol>
<p>A single melody isn't the whole picture though, there are patterns of expectation and reward on smaller and larger scales. One might argue that the notes themselves yield a micro pattern of expectation and reward. An a note gives way to a c note, etc. the song as a whole also follows a pattern. If y hear a certain progression of notes, the listener expects to hear directly afterwards another certain progression of notes. this is most likely why listening to a song after the tenth time playing sometimes feels better than that first time. When we expect something and we get it it makes us happy.</p>
<p>Surprise also plays a role too. When we expect something and we get something different, we also like it. We don't want to get bored. This is why 99.99% of music is a carful mix of repetition, expectation/reward, and surprise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscientist here...</p>
<p>Music doesn't cause &quot;dopamine release&quot; in the brain.  It's a pop-culture myth that feelings of happiness / euphoria / reward / etc. are due to dopamine release.</p>
<p>The underlying truth is that <em>one</em> of the many dopaminergic circuits in the brain appears to be active when an unexpected good (OR BAD) event happens.</p>
<p>But the release of dopamine in that circuit doesn't directly affect the rest of the brain, just like release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain) in your visual cortex doesn't directly affect the rest of your brain...  Neurotransmitters have <em>local</em> effects, by definition.</p>
<p>Additionally, that circuit I mentioned <em>also</em> involves at least a half-dozen other neurotransmitters besides dopamine. including acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, glycine, phenethylamine, tyramine, and serotonin.  We call it a &quot;dopaminergic&quot; circuit, but in truth it's no more dopaminergic than it is glutamatergic, or GABAergic, or glycinergic, or serotonergic...  Et cetera.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong>  There is a brain circuit that is <em>very tangentially</em> related to reward, but it does NOT simply fire whenever something feels good.  That brain circuit contains dopamine releasing neurons, but so do a lot of other brain circuits.  This circuit also contains neurons that release at least a half dozen other neurotransmitters.  We can stop saying &quot;pleasure = dopamine release&quot; now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Music is communication, just like a conversation.  The frequencies used in music to convey emotion are <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031942" target="_blank">similar in pattern</a> to the frequencies used in speech to convey the same emotions.<br />
So for example when we hear a sad song, the notes and their corresponding frequencies are mimicking the patterns we'd hear in the phrases used by a person who was talking about something sad.  And differences in Eastern and Western musical scales is indicating the difference in frequency and cadence of the common languages of those regions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><pre><code> The sense of musical beauty and emotion is created by the presence of tension and release.  I'll explain how this plays out in the domains of harmony, rhythm, and melody.  
 When we talk about harmony we are are talking abut how different pitches (musical notes) sound when combined.  If we play two pitches at the same time and look at the ratios of their frequencies, the ones with simpler ratios such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 sound pure and restful.  Those with more complex ratios sound less so, and in some contexts may even sound ugly.  We call this restfulness consonance and the opposite dissonance.  It varies from culture to culture and over style periods exactly where to draw the line between consonant and dissonant, but in general movement from complexity to simplicity results in a feeling of tension and release. 
 In rhythm, we are dealing with placing musical notes in time, so imagine this as being the horizontal axis of music.  Most music has the concept of the pulse or beat.  Patterns of beats create a feeling of strong and weak beats which when manipulated give a sense of motion and direction.  Think of walking; before you can take a step you must first lift your foot.  At the moment your foot is in the air, it is like a weak beat in music, and when it comes down this is the string beat. Just like when your foot is suspended in air, there is a natural urge for it to come back down, so is the urge for the weak beat to progress to the strong beat.
 Melody, or the tunefulness of a musical passage, is created by the interaction of dissonance and consonance and the weak-strong beat structure.  We also take into consideration the melodic contour. Generally speaking, a rising line builds tension and a descending one releases it.  Wide leaps create more tension than stepwise motion.  For example take the tune "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."  It begins with the leap of an octave, which is a wide interval so we start the tune of with a dramatic expression that builds tension, followed by progressively smaller leaps in the 3rd and 5th measures.  The phrase resolves with stepwise motion leading back to the same note it begins on.
 With a bit of quick explaining of the mechanisms behind what makes music work, I hoped to share what is actually going on from a musical perspective.  I cannot really speak to the biological response because I am not a doctor or scientist, but it is my belief as a musician and music teacher that these processes can be understood intuitively, and the pleasure we feel when playing and hearing music is from the mind being subtly engaged in tracking all of this beautiful order.  </code></pre></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike people in this post are saying, it's not because it's &quot;more efficient&quot; or &quot;because it actually works&quot;. It's due to a lot of historical events. Capitalism is global because capitalism countries won the ideological war against the other systems, to put it simply.</p>
<p>The Bourgeoisie won over the French Revolution and changed the world's politics because of that. They adapted the previous representative system that kings used to listen to people into the modern concept of representative republic (more on it in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8vVEbCquMw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8vVEbCquMw</a> ). In the process, they also obtained control over the means of production (such as lands), and the system they devised also excluded most of the population from the political process.</p>
<p>Having control over the means of production gives the controllers A LOT of power over other people's lives. Economic power and political power are directly correlated, and capitalism favors the concentration of economic power in the hand of a few. That creates a vicious cycle, where people with more power can acquire even more power. If you try to overthrow them, you'll find yourself fighting against the monopoly of force. It's beneficial to the people in power for the system to continue operating, and that's why it still operates, and why there's so much propaganda on &quot;it working properly&quot;.</p>
<p>I know people will come and say &quot;ok, so if communism is better why didn't it won over capitalism on the USSR?&quot;. That also has some historical explanations: Marx himself believed that capitalism made industrial development a lot more efficient, and when he talked about implementing communism he was talking about doing it in fully developed industrialized countries. Russia was an agricultural country back at the times of the revolution (and yet, in just some years, it was about as industrialized as the rest of the world, in a much shorter timestamp). Nevertheless, communism is also the control of the means of production by the hands of the <em>workers</em>. USSR had the means of production in the hands of a <em>representative republic</em>, which can be easily be controlled by private interest. The actual workers were still alienated from the value of their work. That is, USSR's communism is not that far away from the capitalist system, and some social scientists, such as Noam Chomsky, call that system a &quot;State capitalism&quot;.</p>
<p>Why do I talk about propaganda? Because capitalism doesn't &quot;work&quot;. It just generates value in the hands of a few and drives industrial progress towards that goal, but that by no means is inherently good. We're all seeing the effects of the industrialization on the environment. We all see that people still die of hunger every day. Unemployment rates are getting to an absurd point, because industrialization is driving automation for efficient profit, and that has as a consequence that less people need to work.</p>
<p>I don't wish to imply communism is the solution for such problems. I think my point is that a good economic system should be fit for people in general, and not for those in power. Communism tries to address that, but it has its own set of criticism among other socialist authors (such as Bakunin, Kropotkin, or Bookchin).</p>
<p>Rojava has an interesting experiment in a truly democratic society, inspired by the work of Bookchin, where economy is planned to benefit people in general, not just private interests. It is working well, even if you consider they are in a state of war against the daesh.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm having to argue over and over and over and over again on how socialism doesn't imply central planning, and I'm tired of it, so please, PLEASE, read about more socialism models than the USSR model. Please. This is an example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics</a>)</p>
<p>It's by no means the only one.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Thanks for the gold, anonymous stranger! I believe I could have worded this answer a lot better if I had more time for research, but my point is that most capitalist apologists completely ignore both the moral grounds for capitalism (which Weber did a great job on writing about it) and the historical reasons on why it became so pervasive (which Marx and Chomsky also wrote very well about).</p>
<p>EDIT 3: while I consider myself an anarchist (not a communist or marxist - although I do like Marx's historical analysis), I find it funny that, even though I explicitly stated that I don't wish to imply communism is the solution for the problems of capitalism, most capitalism advocates are still insisting in pointing that &quot;communism failed and capitalism is better&quot;. So... thank you to prove you have not read the post, I guess?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So economic models are really models of power and ownership.</p>
<p>Without any structure, ownership is based on what you can protect. If you have a tool, and you set it down, and someone takes it, you don't have a tool any more.  If you scare or befriend them into not using it without permission and giving it back when they're done, you own it.</p>
<p>As societies grow, social relationships do too. Now instead of someone not taking your tool because they are afraid of you, someone doesn't take your tool because they're afraid that everyone will dislike them when they discover that they've taken your tool, and they need to cooperate with society to survive.  But still, not every tool belongs to someone, some things belong to everyone, and it's more important that people take care of those things. </p>
<p>As societies grow apart and fracture, you get groups that are independent of eachother.  If another tribe takes your tool, they aren't afraid of the repercussions of everyone in your tribe hating them. But for their tribe, they've just got a new tool.  Now instead of individuals scaring or befriending individuals, tribes will scare and befriend tribes.  Maybe a militia is formed, and people from a hostile tribe are attacked or scared away when they try to steal your tools.</p>
<p>But maybe not everyone wants to, needs to, or is capable of fighting in the militia. Some people have their safety and belongings protected by the people who will fight.  Those who fight feel that this elevates them to a position of power within the society.  They start to use that power to demand service.  If they are not served, then they can fight the people who aren't able to fight back, or they can simply stop protecting them.  This leads to a more feudal society where the serfs work for a lord in exchange for the lord's protection. </p>
<p>Now the world is filled with different societies, and the world is a very big place.  Lords are powerful, they have a lot of surplus.  Some people can travel far away to trade things from their homeland for things that are very unusual in their homeland.  Lords don't really want to do this, they're wealthy already, they're more or less safe and comfortable, so they let someone else do this.  Market forces emerge, as these rare items trickle back and the wealthiest want to make a show of them.  A class of people called merchants start to develop. </p>
<p>Lords fight amongst eachother for land and power, but cultures develop around those lands, and as threats from outside the culture start to come, these culturally similar lords may start to unite under a single banner as a country to protect their way of life from foreign invaders. </p>
<p>Unity within a country leads to stability, and as countries, even more feudal countries, with a small merchant class, start to become stable, the lack of fighting brings more wealth.  In conflicts between countries, the more stable countries have an advantage, which leads to a stabilizing effect on their enemies.   Descending into infighting is a great time to be pillaged by your enemies.</p>
<p>In the way that the serfs are ruled by a lord, the lords are ruled by a king, or similar head of state. All countries prefer peace because a war is harmful to both them and their enemy, leaving them open to attack by a 3rd party, but they are still at odds with eachother so they instead battle through mercantilism, or essentially, strategically trading to enrich your country and weaken your opposition. This sees the merchant class grow even stronger, and develop into it's own real class. You can't survive strictly on your lords when your country's prosperity relies on the efficacy of your traders, so they become legitimized. </p>
<p>This is the start of the emergence of capitalism. While we were being all mercantile, relative peace and competition leads to some technological advancements, particularly in terms of the steam engine.  This allows for more complex technology that can mass produce goods.  Instead of tools, there start to exist complex machines that need complex infrastructure to support them. Not just anyone can get these machines, they are rare.  So wealthy people are the ones who get the machines, and just compensate people to operate them.  Using a sewing machine is far more efficient than sewing by hand, but an individual could not buy a sewing machine nor would they have the capability to sell like a factory could. This leads to another subdivision of classes, the capital owners, and the labor.</p>
<p>Another big thing that happened at about this point was weapons like guns were developed, which allowed a man to kill another man easily without putting himself at risk.  In the past you couldn't carry bows around in the streets.  We also had urban migration as efficient factories could produce enough to support a lot of people in a small place.  Mass production led to things like newspapers and radios so information spread quickly. </p>
<p>People started to communicate with eachother and organize, and were upset at the fact that the few people holding capital (like the factories) could take advantage of everyone else, and started to argue that the state should hold the capital, and be controlled by the will of the people.  This idea is communism, and a number of countries tried it.  The people in power don't like these kinds of ideas so this led to instability and war. </p>
<p>Now some countries managed to install communist governments. They seized private ownership of capital.  But there is a problem with communism and that is that it is run by people.  Even a benevolent communist leader is just not smart enough to make the correct decisions for millions of people.  This leads to people being hurt by the system, their personal or unique needs not being attended to.  The leader must also delegate this authority because he can't personally distribute wealth to the population so he must ask thousands of people to each distribute wealth to thousands of people.  But he can't personally manage thousands of people, so he must ask someone to manage dozens of people, who each manage dozens of people, who each manage dozens of people, who each distribute wealth to thousands of people.  But even if the communist leader is benevolent, he loses control as it goes down the chain, and some of those people down the chain realize that if they skim a little off the top for themselves, it won't be noticed, or they won't be caught. </p>
<p>On the capitalist side changes to technology happened so rapidly that new technology would outpace old technology, and shrewd investment into new technology, or development of new technology could take you from being a laborer to owning your own means of production.  This made the system seem more &quot;free&quot;.  You could make the transition from the labor class to the capitalist class through hard work and smart investment. </p>
<p>On the communist side, the issue becomes one of delegation.  When you consider the problem, what if rather than having multiple layers of potentially corrupt bureaucracy, you just let the individuals manage their wealth.  Then you don't have the inefficiency of trying to manage thousands of people to deliver wealth to millions of people.  You have millions of people delivering wealth to themselves.  The state might still seize ownership of the means of production and try to make decisions about who must work where, but rather than trying to leave the planning and organization of distribution to millions of people to a single head of state and his delegates, you leave those decisions in the hands of the people, and make more broad decisions. </p>
<p>Capitalism is pretty standard because across the globe, machines and factories make a lot of goods that individuals can't, and it takes a lot of work to make factories and machines.  So someone needs to convince people to build factories and machines, and they pay to convince them to do that.  Since they pay to convince them to do that, they want to own the factories and machines, and get a return on their investment.  Even in communist countries like China, where the government has taken public ownership of a lot of industries one way or another, it remains a somewhat capitalist model because someone is in charge of managing that capital, and is typically well compensated for it. </p>
<p>This is really very similar to feudalism.  Those in power promising to protect the others, and the rest providing wealth to those with power.  In many cases it seems more &quot;fair&quot; because there's not as much killing, and not as much politics.  If you make enough money, you can start your own business, you can run it well, and you can become part of the other class.</p>
<p>This progression happened because technology is changing, so people who were strongly invested into old technology might be wealthy, but aren't immediately able to take advantage of the newest technology. You might have cornered the market on saddles, but when the automobile is developed, it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>Right now, technology is changing though. The first big change is the Internet, and that allows a company to have access to the entire world market very easily.  Instead of thousands of companies selling to billions of people, you might have one company selling to billions of people. This concentrates wealth within a very few people.  This also means that the barrier to compete with these people raises as high, and we lose that fuzzy feeling of the &quot;american dream&quot; sort of promise of class movement.  In the industrial revolution, more technology meant you could make more things, but you still needed people to do it.  Modern technology means that in many industries you need fewer and fewer actual humans.  This brings a shrinking of the labor class. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://www.squawkfox.com/peanut-butter-recipes/" target="_blank">this web site</a>, it's much cheaper to make peanut butter at home than to buy it ready-made, which would go against your premise.</p>
<p>But then I found <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/make-or-buy-peanut-butter-153019" target="_blank">this site</a> which backs up your premise, and showing it costs a lot <em>more</em> to make peanut butter at home.</p>
<p>So why the discrepancy? The second link might shed some light on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I used all organic ingredients for the homemade version and was somewhat limited by what was available at Peapod. If you have access to bulk bins or un-shelled peanuts, you can likely bring the cost of the peanuts down by quite a bit...</p>
<p>I feel sure that more cost-effective sources of peanuts can be found at local markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems like the answer is to buy un-shelled peanuts, in bulk. You're paying a premium when you buy peanuts because they've been shelled and packed into small packages. This a) pushes the cost of manufacture up, and perhaps more importantly b) means we are prepared to pay more for the convenience of having them this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You assume the peanuts that go into a jar of peanut butter are the same ones that go into a bag of peanuts. They're not. </p>
<p>The food that you buy whole (e.g. peanuts, tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries) are the best of the crop. The food that you buy processed into some other form (e.g. peanut butter, tomato sauce, tater tots, strawberry jam) are the small or bruised or misshapen or damaged parts of the crop. The appearance or condition doesn't matter because it's not going to retain that form when processed anyway. </p>
<p>People will pay more for nicely formed, pretty produce. So the stuff you buy whole in the supermarket (or <em>lightly</em> processed, like a jar of roasted nuts) is more expensive than the produce that goes into highly processed foods (where highly processed = it doesn't retain any of it's original shape or form). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The price of an item doesn't have to be directly tied to the cost to produce it; often times a business is more interested in the price customers are willing to pay for an item. If customers are willing to pay more for unprocessed peanuts than they are for the equivalent amount of peanut butter, then a company will gladly charge more for the peanuts even if they don't cost more to produce.</p>
<p>(An example of this came from a previous thread about child rates at movie theaters -- it costs the same to have a child in your theater as it does an adult, but they still charge less because families may not be willing to pay full price for all their children.)</p>
<p>There may be other issues such as peanut quality specific to peanut butter as well, but I don't want to speculate on those. I know more about pricing than I do about food processing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because they can use any peanut to make peanut butter, regardless of cosmetic flaws, or size. Actual peanuts, usually have some kind of quality control for the nicer looking peanuts, or size. It's a grading process. When they harvest peanuts, they determine based on size, and quality, what's what. I literally live in the middle of a peanut field in Virginia, and lease the property to peanut farmers to pay the personal property tax.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually work for a peanut butter manufacturer and am a roaster supervisor. There are a lot of different kinds of peanuts and a major factor when making peanut butter is the aflatoxin levels in the peanuts. How you sort the peanuts is a major factor into what peanut lots you can use for the final product. There are many many more factors that go into it. The color of the roasted product, the viscosity, the quality as far as the aflatoxin specifications which differs based on if you are making an EU product or domestic. Shits complicated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The difference between European freedom of speech and American freedom of speech. American freedom of speech is there to protect the person who is saying things others may be offended or disgusted by. You are allowed to have and express any opinion so long as it does not place people in immediate danger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its more of an ideal than how it is in practice. The idea is that Americans have the most freedom. Freedom is scary to a lot of people because it means you are responsible for your own errors and decisions in life. Thats why its land of the free and the brave. Because freedom requires bravery, bravery to deal with your own problems and whatever life throws at you. To be the hero in your own story instead of the guy who asks the government to fix all your problems at the detriment of all around you. Given that the government is an institution of non-voluntary action.</p>
<p>But in practice the USA has for the most part forgone that ideal and it just like all the other western countries but instead sniffs its own farts with rhetoric it has abandoned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fundamental difference between American and European Freedom^^TM is the concept of negative vs. positive freedom and where we get our rights from. </p>
<p>Negative freedom is the freedom FROM government action. It's a restriction on what the government can to do you. In the American concept you have the freedom of speech, to own a gun, to privacy, of religion, of the press, etc. The government doesn't say, you can't say that, you can't own that, you can't hide that, you can't worship that, you can't print that. The government is prohibited from action. </p>
<p>Positive freedom is the freedom TO government action. Look at European governments on what the government must do for you. You are free to not be offended, not be unsafe, not be bothered, not be sick, etc. You have a freedom TO be something, but it is a compulsion of the government to provide it. In Germany the government is tasked with protecting the equal dignity of all. So that means the government can impose upon others to ensure your  (positive) freedom.</p>
<p>America is unique as it is the only country which takes negative freedom to such an extreme. America says &quot;yes, literal not even the neo- version, NAZIs have a right to march through Jewish neighborhoods to celebrate the holocaust.&quot; There's not this government having the ability to compel some social norm or protection. There's this government having the mandate not to restrict someone else's rights. </p>
<p>Second, America has a vastly different idea of where rights come from. Rights, especially in Europe are seen as derived from some agreement or some historical moment or something along those lines. Rights, thus, can be created, amended, or done away with when times change. In America, rights are inherent in your being. You don't have the right to say whats on your mind free from government interference because it was a good idea in the 1780s-1790s, you have that right because it is God-given.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; <strong>that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;</strong> that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not government, its a state of natural existence, that people have rights. These &quot;unalienable&quot; (because what government is equal to divine providence?) rights are part of you and the government either recognizes and protects these rights, infringes on the rights, or its not a right. </p>
<p>And because these rights are granted by the creator, divine providence, the supreme being, or God... they are contained within His creation and not within government (creation of man) or the behavior of others so it's a rejection of positive freedom. Because freedom, in the American sense, is self-contained (you can act as YOU wish because YOU have free will) and government is not the final power or arbiter on what are rights government can not impinge on your self-contained free-will (so be an asshole, no freedom not to be offended).</p>
<p>So that's the two ways it mainly differs from other countries. </p>
<p>Edit: Sorry, I know I'm late to the party but the foremost explanation of what I'm trying to say comes from the Virginia Declaration of Rights, mainly the first clause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 1. That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.</p>
