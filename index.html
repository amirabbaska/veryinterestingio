		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers make conventional sense, but they don't get to the heart of why this is really true, /u/maphhifi.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: maps differ depending on who draws them, and more importantly, where those people are from. A map that the Haudenosaunee (aka Iroquois) people would have drawn to lay out their territory would look very different than what White Protestants would draw. Generally, when the people who have historically lived in and thrived in one location draw maps, they do so with those considerations in mind: <strong>when locals make maps, they usually try to divide up populations, territory or villages based on culture, economics, politics or language, not simple geography.</strong> Why would they? After all, knowing what village is allied with which tribe, or knowing which town speaks what language or follows which religion, is much more important to everyday life than knowing where a mountain or river is.</p>
<p>Now, look at a map of the world, and count how many countries, provinces, territories and states have borders with straight lines. Notice anything? Yeah: <strong>almost all of those straight-lined borders</strong> are in Africa, the Middle East, Australia, the western and north-western US/Canada. What's the common element here? <strong>These are all nations and provinces that were subject to colonialism and colonization.</strong> And colonialism/colonization, as systems employed by the empires of the world (as well as the US), had one goal: the <em>extraction of value</em> from nations, the same way you'd extract value from a mine or farm you own. And if your goal is to extract value instead of show borders between different cultures or towns, you're going to draw that map very differently. More specifically, you're going to draw it with a lot of simple, straight lines so you don't waste time or energy mapping it out or considering what the land is like, who is on it and what they might feel about it. </p>
<p>Probably the worst example of this (and that's saying something, if you've ever read about the tragedy that was the Scramble for Africa) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement" target="_blank">Sykes-Picot Agreement</a>, which the British and the French formed between themselves to divide up formerly Ottoman territory after World War 1. The map of the area (which encompasses parts of what is now Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and, most importantly, Syria) was almost entirely <strong>a straight line</strong>, with the Brits taking one half and the French taking the other. That boundary was one of the deciding factors that split up dozens of cultures and people who spoke dozens of languages and dialects, believed different religions, and had radically different cultures and political philosophies. It split communities that were probably better off together, and put communities who were enemies together. If you've ever wondered why Africa seems to have so many civil wars in relation to other continents, <em>this</em> is one reason you can trace it back to: cultural conflicts that force opposing interests into one space.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is the real reason why there are so many nations with straight-line borders: because they were almost all colonized nations or territories of a former empire, which usually had really bad consequences.</p>
<p>One of my favourite professors ever in the History department summed this up best: &quot;Any time you see straight lines on a map, you can bet money that the person who drew that map didn't live there.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boundaries between states can broadly be separated by whether the people responsible for drawing up the lines lived there at the time they were made or not.</p>
<p>Boundaries between states (in the broader sense of the term) where people have lived for a long time tend to follow geographical features -- rivers, mountain ridges, etc.</p>
<p>Boundaries drawn up by outsiders or over unoccupied territories tend to be much less complicated, because there's no one (important) there to care about the conflict.  Very important geographical obstacles, like rivers that can't be forded, may be considered, but the &quot;empty space&quot; between is often divided by straight lines.</p>
<p>The eastern US's borders were largely defined by the original 13 colonies, and the borders between those colonies were geographically defined.  There was however <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd/british_colonies_1763-76.jpg" target="_blank">a lot of unsettled territory to the west of the initial settlement sites</a>, and borders more or less turned straight east-west past the point at which people lived and cared.  <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a3/c1/b0/a3c1b01b243391b0334bc9717810f661.jpg" target="_blank">As states like Alabama &amp; Tennessee were carved out of the territory claimed the Georgia and North Carolina</a>, their latitudinal borders stayed straight lines extending from established states until they hit a powerful geographical border that could not be ignored -- the Mississippi River.  Similarly, Kentucky was defined by the Ohio River to its North and a straight line to the South.</p>
<p>That began a pattern that followed after territories were gained with the Louisiana Purchase, the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, the annexation of Texas, and the Mexican American War.  We'd take large territories that we now owned and largely cut along the latitude east to west.  We started making straight lines north-to-south too, except when a river got in the way, because no one lived there to get in disputes over minor adjustments back and forth like they do in densely populated territories.</p>
<p>You can see a similar pattern in the way that Europe divided up colonial Africa and the Middle East with no regard for the natives living there.  Rivers where they were big enough.  Straight lines to keep thing simple beyond that.  Quick and dirty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the US, especially out West, where the land is flat and featureless, there is no reason not to draw a straight line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That means it is not just random in the way a coin toss is random: If we would know exactly the velocity, angular momentum, mass and some other properties of the coin in the air we could predict the outcome but since we do not know these properties with enough precision we say the outcome is random. This is called chaotic randomness. </p>
<p>Quantum effects like nuclear decay are purely random. That means there are no hidden variables and it is not only technically but in principle impossible to know the outcome (the time of the decay).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One issue is that free trade naturally means more competition. Say you've got a good little business making and selling gizmos in the US. No one in the US does it better and cheaper than you, so you're doing well.</p>
<p>Now a free trade agreement is signed with China, which means they are suddenly allowed to export gizmos to the US and sell them there. Wages are lower there so their gizmos are 40% cheaper than yours. For all the people who buy gizmos, that's wonderful, and if you look at the economy as a whole it might even boost growth (because all the gizmo buyers now have more money let to spend on other things, plus whatever they build using gizmos can now be made cheaper and in greater numbers), but it <em>also</em> threatens your job. It may create new jobs, but it <em>also</em> costs existing jobs. </p>
<p>For your country as a whole, the free trade deal might be a net benefit, but for some individuals in that country, it means a loss of their job or their family business. If this process runs unchecked for a long period, you end up with large areas of the country where virtually no jobs and no industry exists, where unemployment and poverty is rampant, even while he country <em>as a whole</em> becomes wealthier. This has happened in both the US and the UK, for example. The cities are doing great, but in other areas, people have <em>nothing</em>, because their old coal or steel mines closed, as free trade agreements meant the same could be imported more cheaply, and while new jobs were created in the big cities, nothing happened in these desolate areas.</p>
<p>Another problem is that these &quot;modern&quot; trade agreements have tended to have some dubious provisions in them allowing huge corporations to sue countries if they introduce laws that make it harder for the corporation to sell their goods. For example, some countries have been sued by big tobacco corporations because they introduced laws to discourage smoking. Others have been sued for blocking mining companies from creating new, environmentally harmful, mines in populated areas. The EU has dropped bans of certain harmful pesticides in anticipation of TTIP, because such a ban would risk a lawsuit if the trade deal was ratified.</p>
<p>The especially problematic thing about these lawsuits is that (1) these corporations often have greater revenues than the GDP of many smaller countries, and the country might simply be unable to afford losing such a lawsuit and be forced to just do what the corporation wants them to.
Additionally, these cases are not taken to actual courts, but are run by special tribunals which are effectively above national law: they judge <em>solely</em> based on the text of the trade deal, not on what is actually legal in the country in question.</p>
<p>Such investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS) have the potential to be devastating for democracy, as you end up with corporations effectively coercing governments into writing or lifting certain laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: The benefits of free trade are massive, but divided into very small bits spread across entire populations, making them very hard to notice. The harm of free trade is smaller but extremely focused on small groups, who are therefore more vocal in their opposition.  </p>
<p>There's 2 main issues (and a whole whole lot of smaller issues, but keeping it ELI5...)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>While the entire population benefits, that positive impact is not as noticeable to an individual as the negative impact of losing their job. (Though Free Trade does not destroy jobs, it does re-locate them.) So if 300 million people save $10/year from cheaper free-trade goods, that's $3B, which is way more than the $500M in wages lost by the people who lost their job as a result. However, you and I don't think 'wow, i saved 2 cents, thanks free trade!' when you're buying paper towels - but the company that shut down knows exactly why, and is vocal about it. </p>
</li>
<li>Free Trade Deals are never Free Trade - more like Freer Trade.  NAFTA, TPP, and others are all about loosening of restrictions, but there are still TONS of restrictions.  And when you're negotiating these complex things, you have to give and take, when means you prioritize some industries over others and playing favorites.  Again, less restrictions are overall better, but if you're not one of the groups with well connected lobbyists or a strong influence on voting, then you may end up seeing your market become freer while others still enjoy federally-protected monopolies.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason free trade deals are criticized is that their benefits are largely invisible while their downsides are readily apparent.  </p>
<p>The costs of a free trade deal are concrete; factories close, people lose their jobs, communities that rely on those jobs suffer.  Its easy to understand and communicate these losses.  You can publish photos of decaying empty factories and send a news crew out to interview unemployed men sitting in their kitchens and see it as you drive past a shuddered small town main street.  The pain is real and immediate but it can also be misleading because relative to the size of the economy the losses are minuscule.  Its like how people overestimate the risk posed by terrorism or shark attacks because it is so emotionally raw and reported on when it does happen.  </p>
<p>The benefits are harder to visualize.  While some industries are hurt others begin to expand thanks to increased demand from exports and go on to create new jobs and open new factories and generate new wealth.  But unlike the losses which are centralized the new gains are diffuse and harder to pin down.  On top of the growth, free trade deals drive down the cost of consumer goods improving the spending power of working class people.  But once again the savings are small and spread out making the gains impossible to see day to day.  </p>
<p>Free trade also generates huge political gains but those are even more amorphous than the economic ones.  Free trade deals bind countries together diplomatically, give them strong economic incentives for peace, and provides them with a legal framework to settle their differences. These things are incredibly important for world peace and stability but you can't put a value on them; you can take a picture of them to show next to the rotted out factory.  </p>
<p>Look at NAFTA.  NAFTA affected an incredibly small portion of the economy.  It cost the US roughly 700,000 jobs and closed some auto plants as we transitioned into the deal.  But the best estimate is that the resulting growth and price saving generates roughly 100 dollars per US worker per year indefinitely.  That is a huge value.  It is fair to say that we didn't do right by those 700,00 people who were hurt --that we didn't do enough to retrain them and soften the pain-- but that is an extension of the failure on the part of US government to do right by the entire working class and not a failure of NAFTA.</p>
<p>Free trade is a lot like global warming.  The economic science is in and ninety-nine percent of economists agree that free trade is good for countries and beneficial to their citizens, but its a value that is hard to see while the immediate cost in jobs is apparent to everyone.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loss of control.</p>
<p>Imagine X Land and Y republic both make products and sell them.  </p>
<p>They want to sell internationally.  </p>
<p>XLand could &quot;cheat&quot; by making all sorts of taxes and laws in order to artificially to make YR products more costly to buy in XLand, in order to help Xland companies (and the XLand economy) by making sure XLandians &quot;buy XLandian&quot;.  </p>
<p>Of course, this is kind of unfair, and YR might retaliate by doing something similar, which just stifles trade and makes less products available at good prices for all the people.  </p>
<p>Instead, both countries agree to &quot;free trade&quot; they won't do anything to block each others' sales.  They'll just allow open market competition.  Best products win.  </p>
<p>Problem: </p>
<p>What happens when YR starts cheating in another way?</p>
<p>YR products are competing with Xlandian products.  Obviously, its good for the YR economy is YR companies are doing better.  </p>
<p>So, YR companies start intentionally targeting Xland companies, making their own versions of the same products, fighting for the exact same markets, knowing that they don't have to play by the same rules.  Xland has strict rules about minimum wage, and safety regulations, and environmental protections.  YR doesn't have any of that.  Thus their companies can make competing products at a cost Xland can't match.  </p>
<p>Then, YR cheated the exchange rate. They intentionally under report the value of their own currency.  1XL dollars should be worth 2YR dollars, but YR lied.  They claim things are going worse for them and that their dollars are weaker than they really are.  The set it up so that 1XL dollar is valued at 4YR dollars.  This phony exchange rate makes XL dollars twice as strong as they should be.  (Read: YR products twice a cheap on the Xland market).</p>
<p>To make it worse, YR is outright copying Xland.  Their companies are copying Xland companies designs.  XLand company can't sue because the YR companies aren't in their country, so they can't take them to court.  YR won't enforce Xland patents  or copyrights.  In fact, there is evidence to show that YR companies straight spied on XLand companies.  It even seems like the YR government's official spy service helped private companies spy on their XLand rivals so they could get an edge.</p>
<p>So, YR is doing all these shady things to fix the market so that YR companies are beating Xland and Xlands businesses and economy are suffering for it.  </p>
<p>Normally, Xland would just say &quot;WTF? From now on, any product that isn't produced fairly, by a company following our rules, can't be sold here.  It will be blocked, or at least taxed unless it plays by our rules&quot;</p>
<p>BUT, the trade agreement says XLand isn't allowed to do that.  They have given up their right to do that.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main issue is that Free trade agreement means that companies might freely stretch into a lot of different countries, and all of these have specific taxes, and different ecological laws.</p>
<p>Well if you make a free trade agreement, the companies, to be more competitive, will split there activities where it's the least expensive, so they will put their corporate seat in the country that has the lowest corporate tax, their heavy factories in the country that has the least social protections and lowest wages, their R&amp;D pool in the country that has the lowest taxes on high wages, ...</p>
<p>Before the agreement, if your raise the taxes by five percents, you are risking a slowdown of your economy, more or less proportional to the raise in taxes. After the agreement, any law that make your country less competitive than any other country in any given sector will give all your industry of that kind an invective to leave.</p>
<p>It also means that ecological laws have a much amplified effect on industry : if it makes, say coal 10% more expensive to extract than in the neighboring country, and provided that they have enough supply to satisfy the demand, ALL of your coal industry is going to die overnight.</p>
<p>All in all it put a huge pressure to the governments to lower taxes on companies, and get rid of ecological laws far above what it was before the free trade agreement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before answering the question, consider the easier task of determining the likelihood of your distribution given you know the true underlying distribution. Once we know the probability of the outcome given the true distribution, we can begin to look at the set of distributions which could lead to the observation with some bounded probability. We will also show that this set becomes increasingly smaller for more samples, and as a result the distance between the true distribution and any distribution in that set decreases. I will be assuming a discrete probability distribution, but this should not be seen as overly restrictive as that you are considering histograms after all.</p>
<p>Beginning, denote by Q the true underlying distribution, and denote by P the empirical distribution after observing n-independent samples. Writing t(P) to denote the set of all possibilities which lead to an empirical distribution of P, we have</p>
<p>| -n^(-1) log Q(t(P)) - D(P||Q) + (|X|-1)(2n)^(-1) log(2πn) + (2n)^(-1) log ΠP | &lt; (|X|+1) log( 1 + (12n)^(-1) )</p>
<p>where D(P||Q) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence" target="_blank">KL divergence</a> of P to Q, |X| is the alphabet size of X, and Π is the product of the probabilities of the distribution of P (for instance equal heads and tails would result in .25).  Indeed this formula comes first from observing that the probability of any sequence with empirical distribution P has probability exp(-n ( H(P) + D(P||Q))ln 2 ) and then summing over all possible values which result in that empirical distribution. The bounds occur by use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation" target="_blank">Stirling's approximation</a> in estimating those quantities. </p>
<p>Note that from the formula, n^(-1) log Q(t(P)) converges to D(P||Q), or in other words Q(t(P)) converges to exp( -n D(P||Q) ln 2 ), which is actually fantastic for your purposes. Indeed one can interpret D(P||Q) as a distance (which strictly speaking it is not, since D(P||Q) does not equal D(Q||P) ), between P and Q. Thus, intuitively, the probability of P occurring given Q is exp( -n (distance between P and Q) ). In fact, for the remainder of this discussion I am going to equate Q(t(P)) with exp( -n D(P||Q) ln 2) for simplicity, obviously those extra terms would have to be added back in for a more detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Now we move to the situation where we do not know Q, and instead just know P. Take the set of Q which could result in P with probability greater than n^(-a). Using our formula we see that D(P||Q) &lt; a' n^(-1) log(n) for all such Q. In essence, we have now bounded the &quot;distance&quot; between P and Q, based upon the number of samples of samples. </p>
<p>From that bound, we also have
d(P,Q) &lt; a'' √( n^(-1) log n ),
where d is the L1 distance between distributions, which follows by a simple application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsker%27s_inequality" target="_blank">Pinsker's inequality</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Now try to construct a histogram of the the normal distribution parameters (mean and variance). A fairly simple way to do it would be to repeatedly resample your population with replacement (called bootstrapping, I believe).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Use a Z test against the probability histogram. You know the population mean and standard deviation and the sample mean and standard deviation. From there you can calculate the probability of your sample occurring in the population. For example, you have a population with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 that is normally distributed. You take a sample of size 1 ( the equation changes depending on how many samples you take but we'll use 1 for simplicity) and get a value of -1. We know that ~67% of results will fall within one standard deviation of the mean, leaving 33% that would be outside of 1 standard deviation with half falling above 1 standard deviation above the mean and half falling below one standard deviation below the mean. Essentially, the probability of getting a mean below -1 or above 1 is 33%. In order to find the probability of getting a result at or below -1 (ex -2,-3 etc) we take 33/2=16.5%. That is, the probability that a sample of size 1 taken from the population has a value of -1 or below is 16.5%. This is obviously a really simple example to Illustrate the point and real samples of larger sizes are obviously more complex but I hope this is sufficient to answer your question. Feel free to respond with any other things you feel are unclear or any other questions you might have and I'll try my best to answer them. </p>
<p>Edit: one more point, because probability distributions involve using integrals, the probability of getting an exact value is 0, which is why we use ranges rather than specific values when calculating probability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In summary: There are 4 stages of dying. CAS stands for Cardiac Arrest Stage.  </p>
<ul>
<li>CAS 1 - Final heart beat to Final pulse of blood containing oxygen  </li>
<li>CAS 2 - Final oxygen containing pulse to &quot;Delta blip&quot; (short burst of Delta waves on EEG)  </li>

<li>CAS 4 - Low voltage (&lt; 10uV) to no electrical activity  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
What's interesting is that in CAS 3, there was an increase in synchronized gamma waves, indicating </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a highly aroused brain, and collectively, the data suggest that the mammalian brain has the potential for high levels of internal information processing during clinical death. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gamma waves are EEG waves that are associated with wakefulness and conscious attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The return of these neural correlates of conscious brain activity after cardiac arrest at levels exceeding the waking state provides strong evidence for the potential of heightened cognitive processing in the near-death state</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I'm taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread.</p>
<p>Changes in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won't go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer.</p>
<p>On the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it's entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It's also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don't know.</p>
<p>Tldr: shits complicated literally</p>
<p>edit: First, I know the difference between a theory and hypothesis. I was using the term colloquially, which <em>even scientists</em> do sometimes.</p>
<p>People seem to have extrapolated way more than they should have from my comment. Like are asking me where to buy bread with wheat germ and how to fix their gut microbes. That's really not how this works. Anybody who gives you an easy answer to your problems is probably trying to sell you something (I'm looking at you, supplement/probiotics industry...). </p>
<p>Until relatively recently we didn't even know bacteria could survive in your gut, so expecting the scientific community to have a solid understanding of the gut microbiome now is absurd. These questions span the fields of nutrition, microbial ecology, microbe-host interactions, immunology, and more. I'm sure there are hundreds of plausible explanations, but we are VERY FAR AWAY from definitively answering most questions related to the gut microbe. We DO know that it affects digestive health, mood, weight, and all kinds of other human physiology. What we don't know is how to bend it to our will or how it causes all of these things. We do know that the answer is complicated. How do different bacteria interact with each other in your gut, and then with your body? We also don't know much about that. But we're learning.</p>
<p>There is a unique soup of maybe 1000 species of bacteria in your gut, and they are mostly different than the species that live in mine. We are just starting to learn how specific individual species of bacteria can affect their hosts. But even with this research, we don't think that it will be the same in everyone.</p>
<p>example: Maybe bacteria A has effect B on me, but it has effect C on you, because I have bacteria Q in my gut and you don't, and bacteria Q is necessary for effect B. Now consider that x 1000 species, and that a genetic component also affects this, and diet and stress levels and fitness also affect this. See where I'm going?</p>
<p>We do know that the gut microbe is influenced by stress, diet, sleep, environmental exposure, your parents, exercise, infection, travel, antibiotics, alcohol consumption, genetics, epigenetics (which is affected by all of these things and more), social habits, sun exposure, etc. Just to name a few. The extent to which these affect each person is probably highly variable. So asking about specific solutions or a quick fix is a waste of time, especially on the internet. And if you have a shitty diet - especially one high in carbs and sugar - or high stress levels, or you drink a lot, addressing those first is probably a smarter solution than asking about wheat germ and special bread and probiotics (may work in some cases for some people sometimes, and usually not as a &quot;fix&quot; but as a supplement. it's just not well studied enough.) and GMOs (no evidence of them affecting any of this or even a feasible mechanism for how they would). </p>
<p>tldr2: no really, shit's complicated. Something that works for one person may not for another for hundreds of reasons that we don't know much about yet, but are sort-of on the verge of understanding. This is also why the human microbiome is so hard to study. Remember, none of this is well researched enough for there to be standardized advice for anybody outside of the normal &quot;live a healthy lifestyle&quot; advice, and slowly figuring out what makes you feel better. So don't ask for a quick fix and don't trust anyone who offers one. Here are some links about the microbiome and a couple on the microbiome and gluten. </p>

<p>edit2: yes, non celiac wheat/gluten intolerance exists. some studies have shown that people who claim to have it do not, but that does not encompass all the literature. the key to those studies is that they were looking at SELF REPORTED gluten intolerance, so basically your average &quot;but gluten&quot; person, not people who were medically evaluated and thought to have it. turns out you just have to find the right people to study (who actually have it). just skim this google scholar search and you will see significant evidence of its existence: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=non+celiac" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=non+celiac</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a great Netflix 4-part documentary called Cooked that delves into this. The documentary series 4 parts were titled Earth, Air, Fire &amp; Water, and it looked at an anthropological history of our diets and hunting/eating/cooking rituals. The Air episode was all about bread, and about how it has been a staple of our diets for so long.</p>
<p>Their postulate was that for the vast majority of people, gluten isn't the issue. Sure there are some people for whom the gluten is the problem, they just assume it is because modern bread doesn't agree with them because of the accelerated processes they use to make it. Or perhaps there used to be something in bread that prevented gluten from having such an adverse reaction.</p>
<p>It used to be that bread was fermented. The dough was a living, breathing colony. In more recent years, to speed up the bread making process, instead of allowing the natural bacteria in the water supply to thrive in the wheat and change it - they instead use &quot;clean&quot; additives, such as yeast.  Due to this, there are various nutrients that used to be in bread that aren't any more, so manufacturers have also added fortifications in also, to make up for those that were missing and actually have it be nutritious. </p>
<p>TLDR: The bread we eat now isn't really anything like the bread our bodies evolved with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The most common explanation for increased allergies is the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that aggressive modern hygiene removes the parasites and bacteria that help calibrate the immune system, leaving it more likely to react to harmless targets.</p>
<p>It's also been suggested that modern wheat could be more allergenic. The cross-breeding of new wheat strains in the 1960s, which allowed us to feed billions of people, could have selected for a protein variant that immune systems just don't like. Modern wheat processing has also been noted as a potential contributor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a little off topic : one thing I read a long time ago in nature before the anti-gluten trend we're seeing.  It was an article about fibre in our modern western diets.  and how we lack a lot of fibre in our diets and how the lack of fibre causes the lower intestines to not be healthy, getting swollen and enflamed.  When the lower intestines get to this stage, gluten can and has been shown to pass through the walls into the blood stream. At that point, once past the barrier,  problems occur.  It was a good read and I'm sure I'm paraphrasing it way wrong, but what I took from it, because our diets are bad in one way it's causing other problems to appear.  And you didn't have to have an allergy or Celiacs to see some of the problems appearing.   note: I think this is very different then the trend we are seeing today where everybody is afraid of the &quot;glutens&quot; </p>

It says that the original way to make bread, with homemade flour and long periods of fermentation, is better for people, and that most people aren't allergic to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

From an evolutionary perspective our bodies are designed to react very intensely to any kind of trauma in that particular anatomy. Our goal is to reproduce, and getting your seed sack whacked isn't helpful. Over a million plus years, those mutations for a painful nut punch ensure that particular lineage would continue up until you get your dingleberries dung and put out of commission.

<p>Basically France produced an agreement which require developed and developing countries alike to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels. Finance will be provided to poor nations to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. Countries affected by climate-related disasters will gain urgent aid.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement (French: Accord de Paris) is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in the year 2020. </p>
<p>The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC in Paris and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015. It was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 (Earth Day) at a ceremony in New York. As of May 2017, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the treaty, 147 of which have ratified it.</p>
<p>After several European Union states ratified the agreement in October 2016, there were enough countries that had ratified the agreement that produce enough of the world's greenhouse gases for the agreement to enter into force.The agreement went into effect on 4 November 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Details -</strong></p>
<p>Paris produced an agreement which require developed and developing countries alike are required to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels, of 2C with an aspiration of 1.5C, with regular reviews to ensure these commitments can be increased in line with scientific advice. </p>
<p>Like any international compromise, it is not perfect: the caps on emissions are still too loose, likely to lead to warming of 2.7 to 3C above pre-industrial levels, breaching the 2C threshold that scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which the effects – droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises – are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Poor countries are also concerned that the money provided to them will not be nearly enough to protect them. Not all of the agreement is legally binding, so future governments of the signatory countries could yet renege on their commitments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was an agreement between countries through the UN to reduce their carbon emissions by a certain date. This would include a reduction in coal plants and associated jobs,  increasing green energy resources. Each country determined what they could do, and committed to those numbers.
The goal is to keep the global average temp below a 2 degree c increase.
You should care because if we don't make any change, the earth will keep heating, severe weather may increase, droughts may get worse, arctic ice will continue to melt. These will affect global food and movement.
The us is no longer the number one producer of green house gas(may be wrong last I read it was China), but we are a huge contributor. Mainly it's industry not people, but reducing what you do helps too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say for arguments sake that the current extreme weather we are experiencing here in Florida is due to natural climate change like that that has occurred many times in the past. Its a slow process with a devastating impact that will result in starvation and violence as everyone competes to survive and the cost of food and water will increase the worse things get. Now add in the human impact of the Industrial Revolution with its smelting plants going back as far as the mid 1600s and all the plastic that are now polluting beaches due to the volume of plastic we have thrown in the ocean since the 1950s that will help to speed up the natural climate change. Coal use became abundant in the mid 19th century and only recently looks like it will be extinct. And add in vast world wide human development along the coast line and the deforestation to build homes.</p>
<p>So if we are into the early stages of the next natural climate change, why would you not want to take steps to slow it down? Is it because it will not affect you as much as your grandchildren? Is it not being restricted in whatever you want to do and live for the moment? Is it because it will make you rich? Switching from a fossil fuel based economy to an alternative is no different than switching from an agricultural economy to an industrial one. Jobs will be eliminated and others created.</p>
<p>And yes, it will cost more to implement the change. But it is a matter of what account you want to place your money because the money is going to be spent either way. You either spend it on fixing the problem or spend it on your fading health and damage caused by the worsening weather. The reality is you are going to have to fund both. </p>
<p>As for Trump pulling out of the agreement, fortunately we have states rights that say anything not mentioned in the Constitution are reserved to the states. And among them are the big liberal states that have the most industry, GDP and population that will abide by the Paris Agreement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand why not, you have to understand how a battery works. It's not a tank of electrons, exactly. A battery is a chemical reaction between an anode (-), cathode (+), and an electrolyte (or some form of conduit) which facilitates the exchange of electrons.</p>
<p>When you discharge (use) a battery, a chemical reaction is occurring, moving electrons between the two chemicals (anode and cathode). So, don't think of a battery as a vessel which just holds a pile of electricity. It's a specific transfer of energy between two chemicals.</p>
<p>Now, in a rechargeable battery, this reaction can be reversed by applying electricity using a charger. But, again, it's not adding anything, really. It's reversing the chemical reaction which is putting the chemicals back to their original state.</p>
<p>When charging, it takes time for the reaction to reverse and at the same time, heat is created because the electrons are moving back across the conduit they travelled across originally. Electrons moving over a conductor meet resistance which creates heat, no matter which direction. Much like the battery heating up when you use the phone, the battery will heat up while charging for the same reason. If you were to throw a bunch of current at the battery, it could easily cause a thermal issue. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd: pronounced Nye-Cad) batteries had a problem called thermal runaway where the battery, if charged too quickly, the heat generated could induce a self-feeding loop where the battery could heat to a point of ignition or explosion. But that's not an issue with Lead-Acid batteries (like sealed lead acid batteries like in your car, which use a liquid electrolyte, also known as a wet cell [thanks to u/gilescoreywasframed for the correction below]). Also prone are Lithium Ion (LiOn, like in your cell phone) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-PO) batteries (credit to u/incrediboy729 for the correction here), but these usually incorporate circuitry to prevent this situation.</p>
<p>tl;dr - it is dangerous, and modern cell phone chargers and batteries have circuitry to prevent too fast/overcharging which could lead to heat damage or fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is very different from our current technologies, all of which use an electrical current to reverse a chemical reaction. As everyone is saying this process necessarily takes a while and is fairly inefficient, hence battery chargers getting hot, heat production=wasted energy. This is essentially the same difference between lightbulb types. Incandescents are very inefficient, so they get very hot, CFLs are fairly efficient so they only get warm and LEDs are very efficient so they barely produce heat at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms without getting into battery chemistry:</p>
<p>Power (wattage) in a conductor is resistance times current squared.  So when current is flowing in or out of a battery, it is going to create waste heat based on it's internal resistance and the current flowing in or out of it squared.  This means the battery itself gets warmer when it's in use or charging.  And since it's current squared doubling the current quadruples the heat.  If you either charge or discharge too fast, it will overheat.  The result of overheating will depend on the type of battery.  Could make the pack fail quietly, or could make it burst into flames...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A battery is made of metal and rust. One of the metals wants to give away the glue that holds it together, so it can turn to rust. The rust wants to get some glue so it can become metal again. Instead of letting them make their trade normally, by putting both in a bath of basically saltwater, we put something in their way. Now, they have to push it through a pipe to exchange it. the power they spend pushing is used by your phone to play youtube and stuff. How hard they push is called voltage, or how badly they want to trade electrons. Your battery wants to be at 0.00V. If it goes below 2.90V, we won't be able to recharge it, because one metal will be a pile of rust and another will be overgrown from all the electrons the rust gave it. </p>
<p>At too high a voltage, the metals say &quot;lol, screw this&quot; and start doing stuff we don't want, like making hydrogen gas (explosive) or getting too hot. And we also can't recharge them after this. </p>
<p>If you try to charge too quickly, you make too much heat. The types of metals in batteries really like heat because it helps them rust quickly. All this heat lights your phone on fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It follows from: n^a <em> n^b = n^(a+b)
n^a </em> n^0 = n^(a+0) = n^a
So n^0 = 1</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is to follow the pattern:
To get from n^5 to n^4 we divide by n
To get from n^4 to n^3 we divide by n
To get from n^3 to n^2 we divide by n
To get from n^2 to n^1 we divide by n
And finally to get from n^1 to n^0 we divide by n.
But n^1 = n, and n/n = 1. So n^0 = 1</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at the pattern below. We can move from one integer exponent, to one less than that integer exponent, by diving by the base.</p>
<p>n^3 = n^4 ÷ n</p>
<p>n^2 = n^3 ÷ n</p>
<p>n^1 = n^2 ÷ n</p>
<p><strong>n^0 = n^1 ÷ n</strong></p>
<p><em>which can be re-written as...</em></p>
<p><strong>n^0 = n ÷ n</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that n is not 0 (you can't divide by 0), the answer will always be 1.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you continue this trend, it also provides some insight into negative exponents:</p>
<p>n^-1 = n^0 ÷ n</p>
<p>Now knowing that n^0 is 1, we can rewrite this as...</p>
<p>n^-1 = 1 ÷ n</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One small catch: n^0 is <em>not (necessarily)</em> equal to 1 when n = 0.</p>
<p>Usually when n=0 you will have to do some limit analysis to see if you can assign a value, depending on the actual function you are using.  Otherwise it is simply undefined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So basically it's just an unseen pattern.
X^1 = X,
X^2 = X times X,
X^3 = X times X times X,
and on and on right?
Well when you hit X^0 you start going backwards and get:
X^0 = X÷X = 1,
Any number divided by itself is 1, right?
All numbers below zero cancel out as negatives times negatives equal positives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
