		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Was labor lawyer for a long time.  I think it is 3 things:  </p>
<p>(1) Our labor laws create dumb incentives for unions.  A union has to represent a terminated employee and will try and get jobs back for members who hide all day and sleep, cause massive damage due to laziness and incompetence, fight, bully, are insubordinate, etc.  I always implored our union reps to focus on wages and benefits and working conditions and to quit fighting for the lowest common denominator employee.  Americans don't think its fair for someone who gets caught stealing to get their job back and hates the union for trying to.  Also, America has a very strong &quot;at will&quot; employment ethic which people generally support - you should be able to be fired at any time.  </p>
<p>(2)  PR.  America has a weird political system where a small number of billionaires have created a small number of think tanks, almost exclusively funded by billionaires, to create junk &quot;science&quot; and PR which is then widely disseminated and used by rightwing politicians to turn people against their own interests.  It is a relentless, well oiled machine.  It is a frequent refrain that unions cost jobs and cause companies to offshore.  I was part and parcel of this machine, which we used in union campaigns to convince these poor dopes that the union was going to cost them their jobs.  My mother was a nurse who complained for 30 years about how terrible and arbitrary her employer was, and I would keep telling her how they are violating various labor laws, but she hated unions because a talk radio host repeated the Heritage Foundation talking points over and over (and to be fair used actual anecdotes about bad employees getting their jobs back) and suffered her whole career because of it.  </p>
<p>(3)  Fairness.  Unions actually do a great job at raising wages and benefits (though the threat of a union accomplishes almost the same).  As a consequence union workers are paid six figures despite not having even finished high school some time.  If the union is a pain (see #1) and workers refuse to do anything they don't have to (like if there is trash on the floor and they refuse to pick it up because it's not in their contract), Americans find this lazy and unfair, especially when they are paid a lot and especially if they cant be fired for it.  As a final subpart I will say unions have had a history of corruption and mafia ties so Americans find that unfair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grew up in a big union area.   I'll throw out some key items, some of them overlap. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unions got greedy. It simply became very easy for manufacturers to leave </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don't do this so much anymore but unions would strike in a manner that people found unbecoming.. i.e. - when nurses strike, people suffer. When teachers strike, students suffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jealousy - often the most well off families in town were union</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related to jealousy - often the well paid union members was dumb as a box of rocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency part 1 - everybody has stories about the new guy being told to slow down (threatened) because they were working too hard and making it worse for everybody else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency part 2 - everybody has stories of trying to get things done in a union shop but due to union rules, the simplest tasks (sweeping up, repairing/maintenance) made ridiculously time consuming and expensive because doing said task had to be completed by specialized union members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency part 3 - (I'm going to generalize based on personal anecdote)  it you are an engineer working to improve assembly line at UAW shop, is hard as hell to just go out and change things up because changes are frowned upon. Job protection is number 1.  It was easier to change things up at another facility where they were Teamsters. I imagine it would be super easy at non union shop.</p>
</li>
<li>Mob influence - not an issue so much now, but it does exist. Criminal gangs ran union leadership. Family member worked at union HQ  where bomb went off during internal war. Odometers were rolled back for free just because. I'm giving personal anecdote. Big picture, think Jimmy Hoffa types. </li>
</ol>
<p>Non union people working in the community see and hear of this kind of crap and have watched the jobs leave and they blame the unions. Personally i think much of the criticism is justified, but I don't think that justifies letting 3rd world manufacturing import at no cost.</p>
<p>I'm sure I've forgotten other reasons.</p>
<p>Source - multiple family members work(ed) for GM, Chrysler, Toyota, Teamsters, and other miscellaneous parts and suppliers. Multiple UAW members. Some went into management/engineering.  I was briefly a Teamster.</p>
<p>Edit - I can appreciate union membership. There is no doubt that the personal benefits can help. Still, I have many family members who have drank the Kool Ade and the union can do no wrong. Some like me have at times really resented the negative effects of unions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First we need to distinguish a difference between Trade unions (Carpenters/Welders) and Labor unions (United Auto Workers).  Generally speaking, everyone respects Trade Unions, as they actually train their people, and deliver on promises.  Labor unions are the ones giving organized labor a bad name. </p>
<p>To form a Labor Union, all employees within a given designation (say floor workers) at a particular employer vote to unionize.  If more than 50% vote YES, 100% of employees within that designation are now in the union, may appoint a representative, and the employer MUST bargain with them collectively.  Anyone that joins the company within that designation must also join the union.  </p>
<p>Labor Unions are pretty objectively bad for the employer, but that's also why they get started.  Employees that vote for one have usually been asking for raises, sick leave, or generally not-shit work environments, and unionizing forces the employer to fix shit.  Otherwise, the union will go on strike, and the employer will have to either negotiate or replace 100% of their floor workers, likely including those that train the floor workers. </p>
<p>Labor Unions are objectively good for society by creating a better/safer work environment, and generally forcing the employer to do right by their employees.  However, eventually things reach a happy medium, and then Labor Unions start having problems justifying their membership dues without something to &quot;fight&quot; for.  That's when they start making unrealistic claims, and threaten to choke out the management.  </p>
<p>By their nature Unions have to be 100% either way.  All of the value for the members comes from collective bargaining.  Without the 51%=100% rule, Labor unions are neutered, as an employer really could live without 50% of it's workforce when they fire all the strikers.  </p>
<p>&quot;Right To Work&quot; laws make union membership optional in most workplaces.  It seems attractive to someone just getting in, as you might get a marginally higher wage than your union peers, AND don't have to pay dues, but you also don't have the same days off or health benefits.  If enough people don't join, the union has no leverage to negotiate with, and working conditions start slipping back to their pre-union days with no way to fix it (because they don't have to negotiate).  </p>
<p>TL;DR: Unions can be objectively good, but they need to get better at leveraging their purpose in society.  If they don't figure it out soon, Right To Work laws are going to kill them forever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having worked for a Union based company for a long time, I can try to provide some insights.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It doesn't matter how much you know, or how amazing or capable an employee you are, everyone under the same job title and contract is paid exactly the same.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the employee who knows everything there is to know about the job inside and out ( your go-to type ), to the one who couldn't do this job if their life depended on it. The pay is the same. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This causes two problems. </p>
<p>1:  Eventually, your super employees realize their efforts are for nothing as their pay is exactly the same as the idiot warming a chair two cubicles over.  As a result, over time, they tend to do less as they realize there isn't any reason to continue busting their ass.  </p>
<p>2:  Your less than stellar employees will never do more than the bare minimum because they realize that doing as much work as the super employee doesn't pay any more than they're already making.  As a result, there is no motivation to put in any additional effort.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:  The less than stellar may have once been the Rockstars of the group.  Over time, they've come to the realization that their extra efforts go unrewarded and eventually become the employee they've hated for much of their career.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also notoriously difficult to fire a Union Employee unless they do something just completely outrageous.<br />
The paperwork and steps involved to fire someone are so immense, that most companies won't even bother to mess with it.  The craftier ones know this and get away with quite a bit.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could probably strip naked, smear yourself in Nutella and go stand on the roof armed with a rifle shouting obscenities at the homeless and still not get fired.  They'll put you into some sort of Employee Assistance Program for a month and let you come right back to your job :|    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In larger companies, multiple Unions can be involved all of which are under different negotiated contracts.  Imagine working next to someone where they are paid more than you are to do the exact same job and you have ZERO ability to re-negotiate your pay.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine how you would feel about Bob making 10% more than you do, while doing the same work, at the same location, during the same hours.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demotivating as hell.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the Unions themselves don't give a damn about their members.  They like to pretend they do.  They put on the big show like they do, but they don't.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They care about exactly two things:</p>
<p>1:  The number of Union jobs in a company<br />
2:  The pay level of those jobs in a company  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Union will fight for the two items above fiercely because Union Dues are typically a percentage of a Union Members base pay.  As a result, if more Union jobs are created or current Union jobs receive a pay increase, then the Union pulls in more Dues.  It's a self serving fight for them.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They like to tell you they're fighting for YOU but, in reality, they're fighting for themselves, just using the members as a proxy to do so.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This becomes evident in things such as healthcare.  They don't fight for it at all because they've already got their money from you.  Since your dues are a percentage of your base pay, the fact you have to pay extra every year in healthcare premiums isn't their concern. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I cannot support the Unions any longer.  I'm lucky to reside in a State where I have the choice of joining the Union or not instead of it being forced on me.  It is noteworthy, however, that joining the Union is far easier than leaving one.  They intentionally make it difficult to leave to dissuade such things.  In my company, joining up is as simple as signing a simple piece of paper.  To LEAVE it, you have to send in a certified letter explaining your intentions to leave, during a ONE WEEK window of the year based on the date you joined.  Miss that window, and you're stuck with the Union for another year.  :|</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experiences with them,  they're just not worth it any longer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, I don't really mind unions. However my own personal experience with them was not so great. My group at my old workplace was a bit further along than expected and we needed these big server racks in place in order to continue. The union guys were unpacking the racks from these shipping pallets. They needed three people per pallet and had five. Since I had nothing else to do, I asked if I could help. They said yes and we got things done fairly quickly. Well, the next day some dude I'd never seen walked in with a few of the union guys, who pointed me out, and he slapped a paper down on my desk and informed me that my project was being fined a thousand dollars (or something roughly that) for taking union work. The looks on the faces of the union guys (that had seemed like decent people the other day) was so smug as they looked at me. I went over to my boss and handed him the paper, he just shrugged and said &quot;If I could pay a thousand dollars to get a day ahead of schedule, I'd take that trade any day. Don't worry about it.&quot;</p>

<p>The belief stems from an outdated set of circumstances that no longer exist.  Once upon a time, battery casings were made from more porous materials - tarred wood, <a href="http://www.powerstream.com/1922/battery_1922_WITTE/batteryfiles/chapter03.htm" target="_blank">rubber</a>, etc. - which were susceptible to degrading after exposure to the moisture coming from unsealed concrete.  As the casing degraded, battery acid could leak out and water could enter the battery, causing the battery capacity to drop.  </p>
<p>With modern, plastic-encased batteries, the moisture-related degradation isn't really an issue on any meaningful time scales.  </p>
<p>(Incidentally, anecdotal proof is not actually proof.)  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>RAY: Thirty years ago or so, most battery casings were made of hard rubber. And because of the porosity of that material, battery acid would sometimes seep through
the rubber and create a conductive path through the damp concrete, draining the battery.</p>
<p>TOM: But that can't happen today with plastic-cased batteries. That's because molded polypropylene (a k a plastic), is not porous at all.</p>
<p>RAY: So today, you can put your battery on a concrete floor for as long as you want. And here's the interesting thing, Clay. The cooler the temperature, the slower a
battery's rate of discharge. And because concrete is often cooler than its surroundings, leaving a modern battery on a concrete floor might actually make it last
LONGER.</p>

<p>Putting a battery directly on the concrete floor can gives you an abnormally low voltage due to the fact that a concrete slab in winter can be exceptionally cold. colder batteries result in slower chemical reactivity in the cells, which then translates as a lower battery output voltage. This means that a battery could be reading as empty when it still holds a substantial charge inside.</p>
<p>This is bad because winter is generally the time that battery systems are used the most due to lower light conditions.</p>
<p>When installing batteries we specifically set them either on wooden slats or plastic boards to thermally insulate them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They raise their eyebrows when they're happy to see you. They look around to see the world and to observe others. Their eyes, in other words, are &quot;alive.&quot;</p>
<p>Depressed people either don't feel these things, or spend so much time not feeling them that they lose touch with how they'd usually express them. A depressed person will smile with their mouth, but not their eyes. They won't move their gaze around to see the whole picture - they don't care. They basically use their eyes strictly as a tool to grab certain information and not trip over things. They might not even be paying attention with their eyes, or with any of their senses. They might point their eyes at you just so you'll think they're fine. In other words, their eyes are &quot;dead.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That twinkle comes from natural lubricant on the eye's surface. When eyes connect exactly with someone else's, they reflect light back and forth creating a sparkle/reflective effect. When people are happy they have a greater likelihood of making more eye contact, depressed people tend to avoid it and thus no sparkle while tired and worn out eyes will be less lubricated and other signs of fatigue such as redness or dark circles will offset the twinkle too. Additionally, when you smile, you squint, increasing the depth of the lubricant, by reducing the surface area of the eyeball with your eyelids increasing the amount of sparkle on the eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any literal twinkle/sparkle must come from reflected light. In most situations, lighting cones from above. In order for you to see a reflection of that light on someone's eyes, you have to see a portion of their eye that is on an angle somewhere between the angle facing the light and the angle facing your eyes. Depressed people tend to look downwards more than up, and tend to have their eyes less than fully open/half lidded. On average, the angles that would show a reflected light are covered by their eyelids or shadowed due to their downcast gaze.</p>
<p>Add this to the general lack of energy and emotion in their eyes and you get the dead eyed effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

More generally, mental imagery activates the same parts of the cortex that are activated through corresponding perception/action (but weaker). There are both imaging studies and reaction time studies to show this. So since there is no possibility for imagery, your dreams would probably be visionless if you lost your (entire) visual cortex.</p>
<p>However! Sometimes partial damage to the occipital lobe is associated with people who are in fact cortically blind, but still claim/believe that they can see!

<p>as for dreams with visual cortex damage: there's been no systematic study of this, possibly because every patient is different and would report different things. but also because, i guess, the right people haven't gotten together to collect the data?</p>
<p>i have worked with a number of hemianopia patients (blind in half the visual field due to primary visual cortex lesion), and talked with them about their experience including dreaming. most thought that their dreams were similar to their waking experience; I think one or two believed they could see more in their dreams. a problem there is that, with cortical blindness (even with retinal blindness) it is difficult or impossible to &quot;see what you can't see&quot; - everything may actually look normal, and yet you keep walking into furniture and bumping into doorframes. so it would probably be very difficult (but not impossible) to get convincing data about this question from a dreamer.</p>
<p>that said, considering that visual cortex is the substrate of visual experience, you would have to expect <em>some part</em> of visual experience to be missing in a cortically-blind dreamer. what part, exactly, can be guessed by the ostensible function of a brain region, but it's never really that simple...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Eşref Armağan was born blind but is a successful painter. The odd thing about him is that when he paints his visual cortex lights up even though he's never seen anything. Researchers put him in an MRI and scanned while he painted. IIRC the TV show was about people with super powers (not those kind)... A man who doesn't feel cold, a woman with synesthisia, a blind painter (Eşref Armağan)....</p>
<p>There is a case study on it <a href="http://brain.huji.ac.il/publications/Amedi_et_al_blind-painter_BRES08.pdf" target="_blank">http://brain.huji.ac.il/publications/Amedi_et_al_blind-painter_BRES08.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The painter also has a Wikipedia page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eşref_Armağan" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eşref_Armağan</a>  </p>
<p>So that is to say they jury is likely out it. Anecdotally, there are many reports of people who vividly real coma dreams, live other lives entirely. I think since there is such a variation of genetics, there are likely people who are blind either from eyes or damage visual cortex, who can &quot;see&quot; in their dreams. Maybe not as we do but in some form or another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Gamma radiation is too high-energy to interact with atoms other than just blasting electrons completely free, which ionizes the atom (hence the term &quot;ionizing radiation&quot;). Radio photons are too low energy to do anything on a photon-atom level, but a radio wave can affect large numbers of atoms in something like a conductor.</p>
<p>Visible light is a particular range which tends to correspond to atomic orbital energy levels. An electron requires a specific amount of energy to jump up one orbital, and releases a specific amount when dropping down one. The amount of energy absorbed/released by those processes tend to be around the visible range. So, visible photons are happy to be absorbed and/or emitted by atomic matter.

When the wave passes through the oscillating electric field will try to make the electron oscillate with it. Different frequencies of the oscillations affect the electron on the spring differently, if you've ever looked at the forced oscillations in classical mechanics. </p>
<p>Thus, when the frequency is too high the electron can't follow on its slow spring. But when the frequency is similiar to the eigenfrequency of the spring, the electron will move accordingly and absorb the energy with 'friction'. When the frequency is too low, nothing much happens again. </p>
<p>This is of course just a rough analogy, but can explain some properties of light in a material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It is more that the interaction of waves and particles has to do with the wavelength and the size of the object. Reflection as much as absorption and emission. </p>
<p>A very small wavelength (less than an Angstrom, aka shorter than 10^-10 or so) meters is able to pass through the atoms because they are able to sort of dodge through without interacting with anything. If they are wavelengths significantly larger than the atoms they dodge around the edges of objects smaller than them (which is why radio waves go through windows and around mountains, but you lose them in valleys). They actually don't go through super solid walls all that well, which is why you put the TV antenna on the roof.</p>
<p>This is why you can only see things in the micrometer range with visible light that is reflected, need an electron microscope to see things an the sub-microscopic level that visible light will not have enough resolution to show you, because the visible light and the electron wavelength are different lengths. It is also why your car antenna is about half a meter long in order to most easily pick up the resolution of radio waves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, some studies that helped me with my reasoning: A study has shown that people who are imagining visual stimuli (as opposed to actually seeing it) still show activation in their visual cortex. A different study that looked at the <a href="https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1426245/rubins-vase.jpg" target="_blank">vase-face illusion</a> found that people's brain activity differed depending on which part of the illusion they were perceiving - if they reported perceiving faces, their fusiform gyrus (the brain's face area) was stimulated, but if they were perceiving a vase, the same area was not lit up. There didn't seem to ever be a time where brain activation showed both patterns indicating perception of both the vase and the faces simultaneously, which suggests that your brain can only perceive one thing or the other. </p>
<p>So my guess at what is happening, in the visual aspect at least, is that your visual cortex would be stimulated, but the stimulation in your visual cortex when you're &quot;seeing&quot; your thought would be different from the pattern of stimulation when you're consciously perceiving what is in front of you. </p>
<p>So for example: you're sitting in front of a striped black and white wall, but you're imaging or &quot;seeing&quot; a solid red coloured wall. When you're focusing on (i.e. consciously perceiving) the striped wall, the visual neurons that respond to contrast would be stimulated, but the neurons responsible for colour perception would not. When you switch your focus so that you are consciously perceiving the imagined red wall, your colour neurons would be stimulated, but your contrast neurons would not. </p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain responsible for stuff like reasoning, cognition, and other executive functions - probably also plays a role in the thoughts that you &quot;see&quot;, because it's implicated to be heavily involved in consciousness. </p>
<p>As for people who can't &quot;see&quot; things in their minds, you're not alone. There's a condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">aphantasia</a> where people don't see pictures in their head. If I asked the average person how many windows they had in their home, they would probably do a mental walkthrough of their home and count the windows. For somebody with aphantasia, they'll know, but they might not know how they know. </p>
<p>TL;DR: activation in the visual cortex for the &quot;seeing&quot; part, and likely activation in the prefrontal cortex for the &quot;thought&quot; part. Also, not being able to &quot;see&quot; things in your mind is actually a thing - aphantasia. </p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811902912437" target="_blank">vase-face study</a></p>
<p>EDIT2: <a href="http://psylux.psych.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/assets/images/vase.jpg" target="_blank">cool example</a> of the vase-face illusion, of faces of two real people - who are they? :D </p>
<p>EDIT3: fixed the study link so that you don't need a school log in, but it only shows you the abstract (the summary) for free. </p>
<p>EDIT4, <strong>attempting to ELI5 even more</strong>: the part of your brain that you use when you see is turning on both when you're looking at a thing, and thinking about &quot;seeing&quot; a thing. there's a different pattern when each of those happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer this on a deeply neurological level, but I can on a cognitive-psychological one. The short answer is that while visualizing something in your head, you're not <em>fully</em> processing what's in front of you, at least not to the same extent.</p>
<p>Think of your brain like a computer, i.e. an information-processing machine. All of your senses are essentially &quot;input&quot; sources for information;
your eyes are getting visual info, your ears are picking up sound, your skin is picking up pressure and temperature (and possibly pain), etc. There are actually <em>way</em> more than 5 senses, but the point is that at any given time, there is a <em>lot</em> of sensory information that is flowing into your brain at any given time.</p>
<p>Then you have <em>internal</em> information, which you pull from your stores of memory or your thoughts. This would be the origin of something that you're &quot;picturing&quot; in your head, without seeing it in front of you. Your brain includes what effectively amounts to a biological graphics card, so when you're picturing something in your mind, you're essentially running a kind of simulation.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the main point: even though all of this sensory and internal info is <em>presented</em> to your brain, your brain isn't necessarily <em>doing anything</em> with it. It's not all being automatically processed. To use vision as an example, your eyes are basically giving the rest of your brain a video feed, but <em>that's all that your eyes do</em>. In order for you to do even basic things like recognize objects or faces, tell the shape of an object, etc, your brain needs to do further processing on this visual feed, and here's where the bottleneck is.</p>
<p>As powerful and complex as it is, the brain has a <em>limited amount</em> of computing power. It simply <em>can't handle</em> everything at once, especially when two different tasks are competing for use of the same parts of the brain. The brain has to choose which information it <em>attends</em> to (&quot;attend&quot; = the root of &quot;attention&quot;) and which information it just lets drop and be overwritten.</p>
<p>In the case that OP cited, the visual feed from the eyes is usually handled by the same neurological hardware that also performs the &quot;picture in your mind&quot; bit, so they're directly competing for cognitive resources. When you're picturing something intensely, your attention is mostly on the simulation that your brain is running. Meanwhile, the info coming from the optic nerve is being stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_memory" target="_blank">sensory memory,</a> which is sort of like a temporary cache for sensory information that hasn't yet been processed further. Your brain is still paying a <em>little</em> bit of attention to this sensory memory, but not as much it normally would, because your attention is being diverted towards another task. </p>
<p>The reasons I listed above are also why visualizing something is often easier with your eyes closed. Similarly, for an auditory equivalent, reading comprehension is typically impaired while listening to music with lyrics, but it is <em>not</em> as affected by music <em>without</em> lyrics; language is processed by the same parts of the brain whether read or heard, so presenting both at once essentially creates competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Add to what others are saying:  There was an experiment started by nasa a long time ago where they were having people wear glasses that inverted the vision.  The reasoning had to do with the lack of orientation in space.  They had to wear this 24/7.  It was discovered at about the 3 week mark that all test subjects actually became accustomed to this flip, and they were able to go about their day as if it were normal.  What was discovered was that the &quot;mind's eye&quot; was able to overcome this change and see things normally again, despite the inverted vision.  It was also later discovered that the mind's eye actually flips what images go into the retina naturally.</p>
<p>In other words, the mind's eye is more powerful than you can take at face value.  The brain just interprets the data as it needs, regardless of what it actually sees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>that imagery and perception share common processing mechanisms, and demonstrate that the specific brain regions activated during mental imagery depend on the content of the visual image.</p>

<p>That's from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/media/pdfs/OCravenKanwisherJOCN00.pdf" target="_blank">this fMRI study</a>, but there are many more.</p>
<p>One of the things you learn in a cognition &amp; perception class is that there's not really such a thing as &quot;multitasking.&quot; The best we can do is shift our attention between multiple things quickly. So if you're imagining visual imagery, you're attending to that and not really processing—or we should say, <em>perceiving</em>—what your eyes are sensing at all. If I understand it correctly, studies like these suggest that the brain uses the same areas to perceive both imagined imagery and real imagery coming through your optic system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former pastry chef here. As some other users have pointed out, apple has a mild flavor profile. Why is that, though? One of the reasons is that apples are a pretty watery fruit, so it's less concentrated in flavor compared to fruits like strawberries or cherries. B-but wait, what about pineapples or watermelon? Those are watery and you see those in ice cream!</p>
<p>Flavor is directly affected by the sugar content of the fruit. Apples don't taste as sweet as other fruits commonly seen in ice cream and they happen to be on the tart side (tartness hinders the way we taste sweetness). The natural sweetness of a fruit is really important for seasoning products. If you make banana bread with bright yellow firm bananas, then the banana bread will be bland because of the lack of sugar development. You'll just end up with a sugar loaf with banana in it. Concentrate the apple flavor by means of reduction, add it to a base and you've got yourself some delicious apple ice cream. However, extra steps in preparation = extra labor costs.  </p>
<p>It really isn't about texture because people tend to be adventurous with fruit flavors. You can make almost any fruit agreeable in texture. I hope I could offer some insight on this. </p>
<p>Edit: Changed sentence wording and added a bit about tartness because I forgot.<br />
Edit 2: Edited banana bread sentence to be less confusing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In Spain however, the word used to describe a similar rank (leader of companies of men) was <em>coronel</em> (which may have happened because <em>corona</em> is crown so <em>coronel</em> implies royal authority).  So the term <em>coronel</em> migrated to English, and the word started being pronounced according to English rules, which is where the modern pronunciation came from.  </p>
<p>Later, as European communication increased and military ranks were becoming more standardized the spelling was changed to better reflect the original Italian roots of the word, but the pronunciation was well established and remained true to the Spanish coronel.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two mechanisms controlling sleep.  Circadian rhythm, which responds to light stimulation and issues wake / sleep hormones accordingly, and also a &quot;body clock&quot;, which generally keeps track of how long you've been awake, to pressure you into sleeping if you've exceeded ~16 hours or so. </p>
<p>Circadian rhythms sort of become fixed when we're teenagers, and some people's are more flexible than others'.  The rhythms dictate when you produce cortisol, a hormone that induces wakefulness and alertness, and melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. </p>
<p>And this effects many other systems in the body, including digestion, &quot;core temperature&quot; (your internal body temperature), brain patterns, etc.  If you're forcing your body to try to go to sleep when its in wake mode, the sleep you get is generally much lower quality, because you're not entering deep sleep and REM.</p>
<p>For people whose circadian rhythms are flexible, you can generally go to bed within a wide range of times, and experience relatively little effect.  But some people (like me) have a disorder called Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome.  Basically, my circadian rhythym is VERY rigid, and what's worse, I feel tired around 4AM and want to wake around 12PM.  Deviating from the schedule makes me feel like garbage.  And because it isn't flexible, it takes a herculean effort to &quot;retrain&quot; my body, and the effort is all wasted the moment I stay up a little too late, and my body &quot;snaps back&quot; to the previous configuration.   </p>
<p>When you put me in a sleep study, and I go to bed at 11, even though I will &quot;fall&quot; asleep, its basically restless, crap sleep, until around 3 - 4AM, when suddenly the graph shows me drop into very deep and restful REM sleep.  </p>
<p>So even though I <em>think</em> I'm getting eight hours, because I closed my eyes at 11 and woke up at 7, in reality, I only get about 3.  And this is very common for people with DSPS, and most people don't even realize they have it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure a doctor will pop in with more info later, but your body operates on a schedule called the circadian rhythm.  Long story short is your body expects to have a certain amount activity/rest throughout the day, and on a fairly regular schedule.  So deviating from that will throw it off slightly.  It is also not on a 24 hour cycle, I think the last I read was it's actually a 25 hr schedule, so your body, if left unchecked would have you go to bed a little later  each night and sleep in a little more each day (but sunlight and other factors prevent the sleeping in later as a great time for sleep).  When the sun is up your body wants to be up, that's why you need blackout curtains to sleep well during the day.
So, going to bed an hour early is not going to upset your established circadian rhythm because your body is still going to expect to get up at your normal time, plus it should be during night hours so no morning light to mess up your sleep.
Also, if you're planning on sleeping more than usual keep a glass of water next to your bed, that overly groggy feeling from 'too much sleep' is usually just dehydration.
I know I have skipped over a lot, experts of sleep please feel free to throw in the gaps/correct as necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure they didn't intend you to sleep the same length, they probably intended you to go to bed earlier to get more sleep.</p>
<p>Still, even if you go to bed earlier and sleep the same length, we were awake for a shorter time that one time you started, and should need a little less time to recover so in practice you still do get a little more sleep than you needed that one time...</p>
<p>But that is minimal, the main advantage if you both go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier is that you give yourself the margin to sleep a little extra (to the usual time you went up before) when it's needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
