		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a primitive response to danger. Your body releases large amounts of adrenaline and triggers your fight or flight. Everyone will usually feel this in different symptoms. Some people get tingles in their feet, others get a really fast head rush, palpitations, etc. But basically your heart rate will elevate to pump blood to where ever it feels it needs to go in order to help you escape your situation and your breathing quickens to get that good sweet oxygen inside you and even you muscles will tense. </p>
<p>The feelings of dread or impending doom usually come before, not after the attack, and usually have to do with trauma or deep seated fears. Once you've had a triggered response, your brain will interpret other similar responses, and put you in full panic mode. Sometimes it doesn't even need to be that similar to a previous experience, but your brain will just assume it so. Remember that one time you felt sick after eating seafood on that really long car ride? Well now maybe just eating and being in a moving vehicle triggers your anxiety.</p>
<p>It's very common for people who have anxiety to also have obsession disorders, and it's a cyclical thinking that will continuously trigger the attacks. Can't sleep, but you know you need to, makes you anxious. Anxiety than in turn keeps you from sleeping. But you know you need to sleep, big day tomorrow. But you keep thinking about trying to sleep, more anxiety. </p>
<p>There doesn't even need to be external trigger either. There is a lot of evidence for people who are very sensitive and in tune with their bodies to get frequent attacks. There are lots of studies that the gut may have something to do with anxiety attacks. For example, having acid reflux, or bad gut flora. </p>
<p>Mostly though, everyone gets some sort of anxiety at some point in their life. The people that seem to get it the worst, and often enough to be a disorder, seem to be those more sensitive to internal/external factors, and those who have constant obsessive or obtrusive thoughts, in which case it really needs to be taken seriously and the person should be assisted. </p>
<p>EDIT: words. Thank you. </p>
<p>EDIT2: Been through it myself, and done a lot of research. For the people asking what you do in situations like this, people have mentioned them down below; mediation, but mostly just breathing. Focus on your breathing. As hard as it may seem sometimes because you have so much going on in your head, go back to your breathing and continue to focus on it until your body calms itself down. Like I mean really focus on it. Feel it go in and out of your body, take really deep breaths. 4 seconds in and 4 seconds out. It's a life saver.         </p>
<p>EDIT3: Hey everyone, just remember you're not alone in this and it's nothing to be ashamed or scared of. Find something that works for you and make yourself better!   </p>
<p>EDIT 4: Thanks for the reddit gold kind stranger! I hope this post is informative and helping others out!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have described the initial &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. I would just add that as an episode of acute anxiety progresses, you have adrenaline pouring into your system. You breathe faster, and this changes the acid-base balance of your blood. You can break down the physical sensations into a few processes:</p>
<p>-Adrenaline:</p>
<p>*Your muscles tense, getting ready for physical action. You may also notice a &quot;lump&quot; in your throat and tightness in your chest.</p>
<p>*You breathe faster, increasing oxygen flow in anticipation of action. You may feel like you can't breathe or are suffocating.</p>
<p>*You may tremble, sweat, and have pupil dilation</p>
<p>-Fast breathing / changed acid-base balance in your blood (because you rapidly breathe out carbon dioxide):</p>
<p>*You start to feel lightheaded</p>
<p>*You notice tingling, typically first in your hands, feet and lips</p>
<p>*You may feel &quot;dissociative,&quot; like you are &quot;removed&quot; or watching yourself</p>
<p>-Changes in activation of the Vagus nerve (going from your brain through your gut):</p>
<p>*You notice &quot;knots&quot; in your stomach</p>
<p>*In extreme cases, you may pass out (this is quite rare)</p>
<p>There are other signs and symptoms of anxiety. Mindfully recognizing and allowing these sensations to unfold can help nip an anxiety attack in the bud. For further reading, check out Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Russ Harris has written good books about this (The Happiness Trap, The Confidence Gap).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parts of your brain take in information about your environment, like when you feel a small tickle from something you didn't see or hear a frightening sound, but your brain also stores memories of where you are and the context in which you experienced something. All these factors contribute to your brain reacting, which produces a fear response in a part of your brain known as the amygdala. When this happens, your amygdala sends signals out to other systems of your brain and body, which cause your heart rate to go up, certain hormones like adrenaline to release, and your body temperature to change in preparation for danger. This can happen even if the perceived threat is all in your head. </p>
<p>Usually if you find you're not in danger, you will learn that the cues that made you feel fear and dread are no longer dangerous; it is possible that you do not learn this though, and the fear stays with you anyway for a variety of reasons (for example, trauma). This is how PTSD is believed to work, and is why it feels uncontrollable to people who have it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is what happens when the mainstream media and its useful idiots make shit up, publish it, only to have it gobbled up, misinterpreted, and regurgitated by other useful idiots.</p>
<p>The surface web, deep web, and dark web are all manufactured concepts that are almost entirely meaningless to any computer academic.</p>
<p>Summed up briefly, they can be roughly defined as follows:</p>
<p>Surface web: The surface web consists of web pages that are accessible or discoverable through search engines.</p>
<p>Deep web: The deep web consists of content that is not accessible or discoverable through search engines, often requiring extensive navigation or even authentication. Most &quot;deep web&quot; content is obvious, such as password-protected services; for example, the contents of your GMail account will not be found on an anonymously accessible search engine.</p>
<p>Dark web / Dark net: The dark web consists of content that is accessible only through the use of special software, most notably Tor, I2P, and Freenet.</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<p>It's often repeated that 90% of web content is found on the deep web or dark web. However, a &quot;web page&quot; is entirely impossible to quantify, it's not a metric in any sane sense. Accordingly, it's impossible to evaluate objectively. The static web page of the 1990s and early 2000s is gone, now everything is dynamic. To make matters worse, most &quot;deep web&quot; content isn't actually deep at all, it's expressly excluded from search indexing at the website maintainer's request because it's not search worthy. However, this alone does not mean that it is not indirectly accessible through a search engine by way of another resource that incorporates it. To make matters worse, how big is a piece of &quot;web content&quot;? Are the petabytes of Youtube videos considered to be part of the surface web?</p>
<p>It would have been more appropriate to say that there is a great deal more content on the internet than is available through most search engines; this maintains the largely subjective and highly imprecise and non-scientific matter of trying to quantify and classify the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to understand that the <strong>deep web</strong> should not be confused with the <strong>dark net</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>deep web</strong> is simply composed of all the web pages on the Internet not typically indexed by search engines like Google. This includes things like password-protected pages, dynamic pages, or encrypted networks. You visit these pages all the time, usually through means of starting from a page found on the surface web and navigating further through the website.</p>
<p>What you're likely thinking of is the <strong>dark net</strong>, which is a subset of the deep web accessible only through special means, the most well-known of which is likely the TOR network. It is here that you're more likely (but not always) to find &quot;shady&quot; transactions and media content.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, most people actually know <em>what</em> the deep web is but simply don't know <em>it's called.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modernism and Post-Modernism are extremely broad terms that describe mass cultural movements in Western art and philosophy. To understand them, one must also understand the general evolution of Western philosophy, especially the concepts of Rationalism and Romanticism.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p><strong>Modernism is an extension of Romanticism (which was a revolt against Rationalism)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-Modernism is a critique of Modernism.</strong></p>
<p>I don't know much about Post-Post-Modernism (what a name) as I believe it is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>In long form:</p>
<p>I'll try to start with Rationalism. Rationalism developed through the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and encouraged the use of empirical observation and reason to determine the truth of the universe. A quintessential example of Rationalist thought is Descartes and his famous conclusion, &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;. To keep it brief, Descartes theorized that human beings may not necessarily be able to trust their own senses - you may see, hear, or touch an object, but how can you trust that what you see is the truth rather than a very elaborate illusion. He therefore uses deductive reasoning to determine the first thing that can objectively be determined as real - because you think, you therefore <em>must</em> exist as a real, and not illusory, entity. Descartes is thus using deductive reasoning to determine what is objectively real.</p>
<p>Romanticism was a reaction to the changing society of 19th-century Europe - industrial and scientific developments were quickly rendering ancient institutions and social orders obsolete. It was thus a reaction against the values of Rationalism that had been quite important in developing the modern scientific method and driving that progress forward.</p>
<p>Romanticism was also far more of an art movement than a true philosophical movement. It evoked imagery of a romantic past, and emphasized the use of meta-narratives to justify an argument. It focuses more on the intangible than the tangible. For example, a common theme of the Romantic movement was that scientific progress disrupts the natural order and is thus dangerous and volatile - Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> is one of the most famous works of the Romantic movement, and concerns this theme.</p>
<p>It is from Romanticism that many intangible modern political concepts spring. Manifest Destiny, Ethnic Nationalism, Zeitgeist, &quot;Human Spirit&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>In between here, Realism developed as an art movement, a reaction to Romanticism. It emphasized realistic depictions of its subjects and sympathized more with the lower strata of society and new developments rather than the upper strata and an idealized past.</p>
<p>Modernism was an evolution of Romanticism. Modernism utilized meta-narratives, but also encouraged the criticism of everything, including the old order. It rejected Realism. Where Romanticism was more concerned with the dangers of human progress and a return to an idealized past, Modernism was more concerned with finding out where wayward progress went wrong and finding out what is &quot;holding back&quot; true progress. As Modernism developed as an art movement, it encouraged the use of more abstract forms of creative expression - hence the stereotype of &quot;modern art&quot; being incomprehensible.</p>
<p>World War I was a huge influence on the rising Modernist movement. The horror and destruction of that war showed how dangerous and destructive modern industrial warfare could be. But World War I also represented a huge shake-up of the European political order - old monarchial empires were toppled in favor of democratic republics or communist states. And so as a political movement, Modernism examined the meta-narratives surrounding Western society - what holds back social progress, and how can that change.</p>
<p>It is from this that we see the rise of social movements against perceived oppression: progressivism, socialism, feminism, civil rights, popular sovereignty. These are all movements centered around a meta-narrative of one group being oppressed in some way by another - laborers by capitalists, women by men, minorities by a majority, ethnic groups by other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Post-Modernism developed as a result of the trauma of World War II. It is primarily a critique of Modernism. A central part of Post-Modernism is the inherent unreliability of human judgment - humans are not inherently rational creatures, and will commit irrational and self-defeating actions if they <em>believe</em> those actions will be beneficial. Post-Modernism thus emphasizes the inherent unreliability of those Modernist meta-narratives - these meta-narratives are formulated by humans, and are thus an unreliable source. A pretty good example of how this relates to WWII, and the inherent unreliability of meta-narratives, is the Nazis themselves - the Nazi ideology heavily relied upon the use of extreme (and false) nationalist and racist meta-narratives to justify itself.</p>
<p>Thus, in both Post-Modernist philosophy and art you will see a heavy emphasis on criticism of institutions and their foundations. Overcoming oppression on the surface-level is not enough - we must examine and change the factors and flaws deep within our culture and society in order to progress as a species. Thus you get emphasis on concepts such as moral relativism in Post-Modernism than in Modernism.</p>
<p>I'm more familiar with the artistic side of Post-Modernism, and can give several examples of Post-Modern art. One of the most famous is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;The Treachery of Images&quot;</a>. It is a painting of a pipe, with the caption reading &quot;This is not a pipe&quot;. The image is not lying - it's not a pipe, it's the painting of a pipe. But when you look at it and are asked what it is, you wouldn't say &quot;That's a painting of pipe&quot; you would likely say &quot;That's a pipe&quot;. I hope this isn't too abstract. Essentially, the image encourages the observer to question their assumptions about what they are seeing.</p>
<p>Post-Modern film and television tend to examine and critique the tropes and norms of their genre or medium (as a Post-Modern social movement would critique the norms and values of their culture). For example, a big part of <em>Scream</em>'s appeal and popularity was its willingness to extensively explore and make fun of the conventions of the slasher genre, which had been run into the ground by the mid-1990s. <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> examines the conventions and cliches of the horror and high school drama genres, and is positively soaked in existentialist philosophy.</p>
<p>And in literature, a good example of a Post-Modern book series is <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, which brutally deconstructs the conventions of the high fantasy genre. And <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" target="_blank">Deconstruction</a> is a key weapon in the arsenal of the Post-Modern artist or activist - examine a convention or norm, explore its unfiltered effects and origins, and try to make it different.</p>
<p>As for Post-Post-Modernism, again I am unfamiliar, but because it is a reaction to Post-Modernism I assume it has to do with rejecting the relativist and deconstructionist beliefs of the Post-Modernists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a module on contemporary American fiction last term at university -- I study English literature -- so I'll add my two cents on how postpostmodernism was presented there.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's what you'd expect; how do the generation of writers born after the postmodern epoch of the 80s/90s deal with that intellectual shadow hanging over them?</p>
<p>The two writers we associated most strongly with the term were David Foster Wallace and Jennifer Egan. You can make relatively decent arguments for them both actually being just postmodern, but hey, it's the humanities: you can argue a lot of things.</p>
<p>In brief, their takeaway from postmodernism was one of overbearing cynicism. True knowledge is impossible. Capitalism is destructive and capricious. There was a shift from ontology to epistemology, usually in the vein of &quot;you can't ever really know anything, har har!&quot;. Mass-media was thought to be profoundly affecting society, usually in a bad way. We lived in a hyperreal late-capitalist wasteland of cultural emptiness, copies without originals, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The postpostmodernists, essentially, got tired of this cynicism and decided to have a go at fighting back. David Foster Wallace is linked with the term 'sincerity' for this reason, and a lot of his works deal with themes of how to break down the endless barriers of irony, cynicism, facades, mind-games and double-guesses of academia and postmodern discourse to arrive at actual sincerity. Egan goes at it from a different tack, essentially (I'm summarising in very broad strokes) saying that if we're strictly historical, if we very carefully map out how our culture got to where it is now, we might be able to understand things -- and change them.</p>
<p>Everything I've said here is up for debate. That said, no-one else has yet offered much on postpostmodernism, so I hope you find this useful. I welcome any questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Postmodernism (at least to me) is the backlash to modernism and is super snarky, pretentious, socially aware, and critical in comparison. Sort of a &quot;Your future sucks and needs to be better.&quot; You see a lot of weird -isms pop up here.</p>
<p>Postpostmodernism is a more gentle backlash to the previous backlash and is sort of a &quot;Christ, that was exhausting.

<p>In food terms: Modernism is a TV dinner (Salisbury steak), Postmodernism is sushi (while it was still &quot;new&quot; in America) with a bunch of zig-zagged sauce all over, Postpostmodernism is a Chipotle burrito after they stopped using unethically raised chickens and also you got it delivered using an app on your phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If all the organs are reversed, the body functions completely normally, and it is not unusual for it to go undetected.  The main issue is making sure medical providers know about it, especially in an emergency.</p>
<p>In some cases, the reversal is imperfect, and this can lead to a number of health problems, with the most common being cardiac problems.  Also, situs inversus can be caused by Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, which results in improperly formed cilia in the body.  Other symptoms include sinus and lung problems, and male infertility.  These are chronic conditions you would have already had.</p>
<p>Finally, situs inversus can complicate organ transplants involving asymmetric organs like the liver or heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Make sure this is added to your medical notes wherever you go. A lot of your organs are asymmetric so it's important to know. Make sure your SO knows so they can tell medics if you can't. A medical bracelet is a good idea. Also fill in the emergency medical details on your phone. It's a good idea to have a rough idea where your appendix should now be, just in case you get weird stabbing pains in your stomach. </p>
<p>I had fun with this when I was a kid. I was a subject for the finals at a medical school. I remember the colour draining from one young soon-to-be doctors face when he couldn't hear my heart, then the look of relief when he tried the other side. Lol. Got paid too, about £15 I think.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I experimented with this after suffering blackouts on a regular basis over about a few months. I read that it was down to the blood alcohol level and at a certain point it interfered with long term memory. So I set out by restricting my calorie intake each Friday before going to the pub and drank 6 pints of budvar over approx 3 hours. </p>
<p>I restricted calories by skipping meals. Breakfast, lunch or dinner </p>
<p>3 meals in sequence = drunk no blackout </p>
<p>Breakfast and lunch = pretty hammered, no blackout</p>
<p>Breakfast = brown outs with a lingering memory of arguing at the Indian takeaway for a smoked sausage</p>
<p>Breakfast and dinner &amp; lunch and dinner = brown outs with little to report.</p>
<p>No meals = ruined. I apparently peed in the cupboard and argued with my own reflection in a mirror before taking the mirror off the wall and placing it in the bath.</p>
<p>Shortening the drinking time from 3 to 2 hours had a huge impact, pretty much without 3 meals i was blacking out. </p>
<p>I also repeated this in different establishments and dark indoor pubs seemed to have a impact, although not enough that I could make any conclusions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

for many years I drank as naturally as I breathed,  and I was able to ingest and sustain, what seems now to be a heinous amount of hard liquor or beer for a 19/20yr female of my size, (5'4&quot; and probably around 100lbs at the time,  if that) and for a good while i never blacked out,  like.. ever. not once! and I had a bad diet,  bad sleeping habits,  you name it.  but there was a certain night when it distinctly changed,  I got into, what was then,  the worse  fight I had ever been in, with my (then) SO. yelling at each other outside a gas station,  screaming after one another down a quiet neighborhood street at some horribly rude hour of the night,  definately post-midnight, bawling in someone's front yard,  strangers coming up and saying if things didn't lighten up they would get the police involved,  the whole nine yards, extremely dramatic bullshit,  totally unnecessary, totally embarassing, but hey,  everyone has at least ONE night where they act a complete fool in their lives... right? lol.
aaaaanywho,  that night I blacked out for the first time and after that I started to black out it seemed like every time my emotions would get even a little frazzled,  it always felt like that night, had like... been some subconscious tipping point where my brain said never again!  so, before- I was able to hold it together but afterwards, even if I was in a perfectly fine mood,  celebrating even, not a dark cloud in the metaphorical sky,  it wouldn't matter, once i passed the tipsy stage and proceeded into drunkenness,  i became an emotional mess and would black out almost like clockwork, (hence beginning the official stages of a definite spiral into a dark alcoholism period)
bbbbbut I'm just wondering if that's common? to have a said,  &quot;tipping point&quot;, or if that's just a mental health commonality pertaining to depression ect ect</p>
<p>and also- the inability to form long term memories is a logically sound explanation for most blackouters, but I'm also curious to it pertaining to if your mixing, let's say MDMA with alcohol,  cuz it was my experience, that I wouldn't black out or get drunk when I was rolling,  us that just a side effect or the drug,  some suppression of alcohol receptors cuz their too busy wanting to dance? lol,  I've always wondered about that.  ah to be young again... lol </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>our brains are hard wired to recognize human faces and eye contact. In fact, there's a whole part of your brain devoted specifically to that task, and people with damage to it can get something called face blindness. So human faces in your visual field get some special attention when it comes to how your brain processes the image in front of you, leading to quick attraction and notice.</p>
<p>For people you can't see, you might recognize their presence by some other means, such as sound or touch. Then when you turn, both you and their face-recognizing visual systems have a reasonable chance to result in spontaneous eye contact. This might fool you into thinking you &quot;sensed&quot; them looking at you.</p>
<p>Otherwise it is likely simply a matter of confirmation bias. You recall when you felt something &quot;odd&quot; and met someone's eyes, and forget when you just &quot;felt something odd&quot; and nothing happened. There's no real basis for a 'sense' that can detect eyes looking at you, eyes don't transmit anything unique that makes an impact on human skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In as ELI5 as I can: you can't, but you think you do. One of 4 things can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is looking at you, and you notice.</li>
<li>Someone is looking at you, and you don't notice.</li>
<li>Nobody is looking at you, and you notice.</li>
<li>Nobody is looking at you, and you don't notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the first one, you'll remember. You think &quot;why is Johnny looking at me? Has he been looking at me the whole time? That's kinda weird.&quot; The 2nd and the 4th, you cannot remember, since you didn't know it was happening. And the 3rd, well, you notice but you don't remember it, usually. Why would you? Nothing happened. People around you just doing their own thing.</p>
<p>Let's assume for fun each of these events are equally likely. Then some is looking at you (and you notice) 1 in every 4 times, on average. But it will feel like almost every time, because you don't bother remembering the times when someone isn't looking at you.</p>

<p>Human hearing is more sensitive than many of us credit.  There was a recent example--predicted by William Gibson, by the way--of a blind person who learned to navigate a room by making bat-like clicking noises and learning to &quot;read&quot; the echoes.  </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A possibly useful survival trait would be the ability to detect a silent predator by the change in <em>ambient</em> noise.  That's a change in the texture of other noises going on as something silently occludes a sound source or echo.  So our brains may retain this ability.  Furthermore, humans seem to have evolved from an early time in close proximity to a potentially useful ambient noise point-source--a smoldering fire.  Eyes burning a hole in your back, see--or rather, hear?  Does that turn of phrase go all the way back to the caves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shape of the human head might reflect ambient noise in different ways.  We have convex foreheads and, more to my point, we have two semi-concave eye sockets which, at a certain distance, might actually <em>focus</em> ambient noise.  When someone is looking directly at the back of your head (or more likely, from an angle that might help the subject to guess the position), their eye sockets may be focusing ambient sound directly at your <em>ears</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>Thus, when a person behind you turns to face you (as in staring), I think it's possible that some people may actually be able to <em>hear</em> a change in ambient noise that gives them the &quot;feeling of being watched.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, it would of course depend upon the shape of a person's face, the distance and position of that person, and it would be useless beyond a certain very short distance.</p>
<p>But it <em>might</em> explain some of the incidents that occur in enclosed places with a fair amount of ambient noise, like for example in waiting rooms or on the subway.  </p>
<p>And, in conclusion, I wish to credit Iron Maiden for the idea: <em>You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back/ A footstep behind you he lunges prepared to attack</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The energy output by the sun is decreased by traveling theough the atmosphere. Would there be any benefit to using planes or balloons to collect the energy from the sun in power cells using solar panels above the majority of the atmosphere where it could be a higher output? Or, would the energy used to get them up there outweigh the difference from placing them on the earth's surface?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is actually currently being researched:
<a href="http://eas.caltech.edu/engenious/twelve/idea_flow" target="_blank">http://eas.caltech.edu/engenious/twelve/idea_flow</a></p>
<p>The idea is to launch arrays of space-based photovoltaic cells that would use microwave transmission to beam energy back to Earth. The big benefit of this type of approach is that it mitigates the variability of traditional solar panels. </p>
<p>In the short term cloud cover can cause variability in power output of solar cells and also the obvious issue of the day-night cycle. In the long term, the closer you are to the poles the more your sunlight varies throughout the year. What might be enough solar panels to get you through a 16 hour day in the Summer won't necessarily get you through an 8 hour day in the Winter.</p>
<p>A space-based solution could theoretically solve all of these problems by having several arrays of cells in geostationary orbit, such that some subset of them will be exposed to sunlight at all times. Since the energy could be beamed down in microwave spectrum, clouds etc. would not be as much of an issue as they are for visible light. </p>
<p>Obviously there are tons of technical issues to get this sort of thing working, but people are working on it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere is largely transparent to visible light, which is the range most conventional photovoltaics use. If located higher there could be a marginal increase (ignoring other factors at the moment) because there would be a few percent more of that light, however without the atmosphere blocking the more energetic wavelengths like UV the cells degrade requiring you to add thicker shielding/glass to mimic the effect of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Additionally photovoltaics have a reduced efficiency when hot, which is a concern when they are being hit by useless wavelengths (which normally the atmosphere blocks) that only heat the panels and contribute nothing to the actual generation of power while also having very little to no medium to assist in transferring that heat away</p>
<p>Finally you'd need a way to get that power from the panels back down to the ground, which could be done in a variety of ways, but realistically it's not practical from an engineering or cost perspective when you want the power at ground level in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons to why we like a song and most of them are cultural and have to do with our experience. I'll start with an example: a person from India who has mostly listened to ragas will find Beethovens 9th symphony very boring and flat and find all symphonies very simialar while a westerner will find ragas are a complicated series of rithms (bars can have a time signature of 17/8 and stuff like that) and eventually also find them all very alike. That's because the complexity of each kind of music es based in different parameters and all the dynamics of a certain music are only perceptible by a trained listener.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that you can associate certain sounds with emotions like happiness or melancholy or suspense, has to do just with what you have taught yourself by listening and associating sounds with images/situations/emotions all your life, but you are not born with this associations. </p>
<p>Also, a song as we know it was developed no more that 300 yeas ago. Medieval music was just one melody but the concept of armony, the understanding of the relations between music notes sounding at the same time was not part of western culture. Then the renascence brought polyphony, but as a series of melodies (contrapunctus) that don't produce &quot;chords&quot;, they produced a complex net of sound that to us sounds kind of flat because it has no harmonic direction, it goes nowhere cuz there is no one melody more important than the other. </p>
<p>With the arrival of the reform of the church and the baroque there was also a big aesthetic change, there was an intention to make music less complicated and get the message home (religious). So just then the concept of harmony/melody was created. This concept is what we call the tonal system. It was brought to perfection by the musicians of the classic period, exceptionally good example is Mozart, he just knew the system up and down.</p>
<p>Then later the romantics and expressionists created music that would go further than just sound good or happy or sad, they wanted to create music that would express complex emotions like anxiety or terror so they created a database of relationships between music and complex things that now is the basics for all the music you hear in movies, parts of star wars sound track is a rip off of Stravinsky's rite of spring. </p>
<p>So that said, nothing can be true about our preferences, but given that we like &quot;melodies&quot; over &quot;chords&quot; that create a &quot;harmony&quot; because of all our cultural background, I would suggest with not much certainty that the art of creating a good melody is in the ability of the composer to do good musical phrasing.</p>
<p>For example, if i writhe only short sentences you will find what I wrote rather boring and annoying. If I write big complex sentences you will also find it annoying. A good writing mixes short and long sentences. In music, phrasing is the ability to understand the timing for starting an idea or a melody and finishing it. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we have the tonal system deeeply learned in our heads, so we expect things to follow this aesthetic rules. Then again, if you only follow the rules and you just make music that doesn't challenge the listener then you get bored, but if you are all the time making a fool of the listener and never do what he expects then you will annoy everyone.</p>
<p>tl;dr: It is a cultural learning we are not born with the understanding of what is a song. In the end, a good melody has to do with good timing and the right playing with the listener expectations (in my opinion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's dozens of reasons. Many of them have been mentioned, I'll take a shot at the ones that haven't been, or haven't been mentioned in detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>North Koreans don't have any marketable skills. East German unemployment is pretty high (compared to 0% under their old system), but most people were able to either keep their old jobs (particularly the working class), or could easily train to be as good at their careers as West Germans (in the case of sciences, history/sociology/anything that has a political bent to it, and so on). North Korea has some fantastic workers. They have doctors who can operate on you using an old beer bottle for an IV, and tools that were made before the Korean War even happened, and have a high chance of success. Their life expectancy is very high for a country roughly at the same economic and technological level as Ghana. But when those doctors enter a South Korean hospital, with state-of-the-art equipment and specialized drugs, nobody's going to need their beer bottle anymore. Those doctors will know next to nothing on how to work in a South Korean hospital, besides maybe a decent understanding of biology and anatomy. More likely, they're going to have to wait tables and sweep floors in that kind of society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who knows anything in that country is probably a member of the elite and closely tied to the ruling family. If you get rid of all of them, put them in jail or so on, you'll have a serious case of Problem #1. Also the actual unification will be harder because they'll fight until they've got nothing left to shoot but their fingers, because they have everything to lose and nothing to gain. But if you keep them on to help in the transition, it's going to be a huge political mess, because the last thing the North wants is more of the same - we just sold them on the idea of joining the rich, high-tech South Koreans - and the political blowback from keeping the people who were putting their own people into death camps, running the same group of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting to the unification is going to be a problem. The Kim family won't hold on to power forever, but they can hold on for a very long time. If we try to make peace with them (as we have before), they'll probably take us for a ride again, and then go back to business as usual, their regime a little more stable. But if we try to push them into a war they can't win... the South Korean capital happens to be just a few miles away from tons of North Korean artillery. West Germany couldn't've probably integrated the East by force for the same reason (West Berlin). The people in Seoul aren't going to be happy if their gung-ho leadership ends up getting the whole city shelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whereas in Germany you had the Allied powers wipe the slate and set up the eventual reunification, Korean division was a bit more messy. North Korea used to be home to a lot of landowners, who made sure to take the deeds to the huge estates they owned with them when they escaped to South Korea or Japan. Many of their kids and grandkids still have those deeds locked in a safe somewhere, and since the South technically claims sovereignty over North Korea (they even have official governors of those provinces), there's nothing right now stopping them from marching North and demanding their huge tracts of land back from whatever group of farmers is currently there.</p>
</li>
<li>In East Germany and other Soviet bloc countries, the worst thing that could happen to you is that you could be shot. If life sucks enough, you might be willing to get shot if the alternative is a chance at a better life. Why live on suffering? Eventually, life began to get so bad throughout the communist bloc that tons of people looked at each other, realized life was pretty bad, and started to rebel. If your dad went to jail, you could lay low, but still have some hidden sympathies that would come out when the time is right. In the North, punishment is collective. If your grandpa gets caught listening to the wrong radio station and doesn't have the bribe money (about 4 years' worth of honest wages for that crime) or lives in a politically significant area like the capital, he's going to get sent to a concentration camp, but so will his close family and whoever lives with him, which probably includes you. If it's a serious crime (like escaping to the South), they'll probably follow it through to the letter, which means three generations of your family goes to camp. If the third generation doesn't exist, it'll be born there. Some North Koreans are born and die within the walls of a single concentration camp (look up Escape from Camp 14 for more on this). And if by the clemency of the Great Leader you're released back into your society, your songbun (for all intents and purposes, your caste) will be the lowest, &quot;hostile&quot; tier. So you'll be untouchable and your kids and grandkids will be untouchable, all because your grandpa tried to tune in to a South Korean soap opera. So that kind of pressure makes people very, very hesitant to stray from the system, whereas in East Germany, by the end, everyone was so wary of the government that you seemed suspicious if you were 100% enthusiastic about the ruling party or the socialist system.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, reunification between East and West Germany wasn’t a seamless as your title suggests. West German taxpayers have spent over $1.5 trillion to modernize the East since unification and it still lags behind the West in nearly every metric that matters: per capita GDP, household income, poverty, worker productivity, education, etcetera. Even at that though, East Germany was by far the most robust Soviet block economy and things could have been much worse had it not been.
East and West Germany voluntarily reunited and the chance of North Korea voluntarily and peacefully reuniting with the South are non-existent. Similarly, East Germans were well educated, relatively well skilled and still maintained contact with relatives and friends in the West (all be it heavily censored). North Koreans on the other hand are dirt poor and know nothing of the outside world other than what the government tells them.
As hard as East West German reunification was, it would be several generations and cost Trillions to bring North Korea anywhere near to the Souths level of development. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that the 1989 Chinese Student Protests had just happened and the Soviet Union's leadership did not want that to happen in the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1989 there were widespread student protests across China that culminated with a crackdown on the central protests in Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989. Hundreds to thousands of students died, soldiers were attacked by mobs of civilians and even some PLA units, including most of the 116th Division, refused to advance on the students.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1989 various Communist bloc nations in Europe were allowing people to leave and go to NATO member states, it became something of a crisis and ultimately lead to the fall of the Inter-German border and the eventual unification of Germany.</p>
<p>There wasn't more violence because in July 1989 the Soviet leadership said that the Soviet Union wouldn't invade a Warsaw Pact ally that was liberalizing. With that assurance Hungary took down it's border walls in August 1989 and the whole thing unraveled by Christmas 1989 when the leaders of Romania were sentenced to death by their own people.</p>
<p>In North Korea there is no discussion about such liberalization because it is an absolute dictatorship in a way that no Communist country has ever had.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In common usage, the term special relativity is used more to refer  to things like time-dilation effects and such related to ones speed relative to the speed of light where general relativity is associated with the distortion of space-time in the vicinity of a gravitational source.</p>
<p>In reality, special relativity is just general relativity when there are no gravitational sources and the underlying spacetime &quot;texture&quot; (metric) is the simplest possible (i.e. special relativity is general relativity in the most boring possible spacetime structure).  Thus, &quot;special&quot; relativity is just a special limiting case of &quot;general&quot; relativity.</p>
<p>Historically, special relativity was developed first, by Einstein, in 1905 and then followed up with a more general framework in 1915ish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two short answers and a long explanation.</p>
<p>1/         Special relativity (SR) doesn't include gravity, whereas general relativity (GR) does.</p>
<p>2/         In SR, the laws of physics are the same for all inertial coordinate systems, that is those in which Newton's First Law of Motion is true.  In GR the laws of physics are the same in all coordinate systems, whether they are inertial or not.  So SR is a special case of GR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Special relativity &quot;fixes&quot; Galilean relativity by preventing objects from travelling faster than the speed of light. This does not come from nothing, but is required by classical electrodynamics. It leads to spacetime as a four-dimensional Minkovski space replacing the old 1D time + 3D Euclidean space. This implies to things like the famous energy-mass equivalence.</p>
<p>General relativity is a theory of gravity that is consistent with special relativity, explaining gravity as a distortion of spacetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
