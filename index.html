		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additionally autism is now basically a catch-all diagnosis. Every new edition of the DSM adds symptoms and imho it's being massively over diagnosed at the moment.</p>
<p>But to answer your question the brain is divided into regions with each region being responsible for a specific task. Examples are processing visual input from the eyes, muscle control, regulating emotions, controlling breathing etc. Most brain disorders only affect one or a few of these regions, leaving everything else working normally.</p>
<p>Often the brain compensates by using another region to do the task of the broken region, but this is a bit like having one person do the work of two people. It's more hard work and the results are suboptimal. This is why some people with high-functioning autism/Asperger syndrome are virtually undetectable. Their brains have compensated, but they may be consciously applying rules of social interaction that they've learnt rather than it being an automatic process.</p>
<p>Where an unaffected person would know that someone who is trying to change the topic of conversation isn't interested in the current conversation someone with Asperger syndrome would need to consciously recognise the body language and other signs that this is happening, compare that to previous conversations and figure out that's what's happening.</p>
<p>Someone without the condition would do this automatically and may not even recognise it's happening.</p>
<p>As you can imagine being able to hold down a complex conversation whilst simultaneously analysing the body language and subtle social cues of the people you're talking with is harder than doing one or the other. This is why some people with the condition just do one or the other, and will keep talking as you get more and more uncomfortable. ðŸ¤£</p>

/u/DuplexFields points out below that DSM-V narrowed the scope of autism.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your brain as a character in an RPG. You start out with base stats, and you get to assign 10 points to any stat you want. Everybody gets roughly the same total ability, but how they distribute those points can be customized. </p>
<p>So you have languages, empathy, imagination, logic, memorization, coordination, anticipation, math, spacial orientation, all as possible things to put points into. </p>
<p>This is a way of thinking of the different things a brain does, which is a LOT. If you think about it from an AI perspective, just teaching a computer to have a consciousness is almost insurmountable, yet even the most Autistic person can do that easily. So things we take for granted, are still a kind of miracle, like looking at an apple and knowing it came from a tree, what it tastes like, smells like, what you can do with it etc. </p>
<p>People with learning disabilities may be deficient in some areas like memory, or logic, but be strong in others, like math, empathy, or anticipation. Someone could have excellent memory, but lack the capacity to really understand the meaning of what they are memorizing. </p>
<p>Now we don't all have exactly the same total ability, but I would wager the difference in brain power between Einstein, and your gardner is not as great as you think. Certainly not as large as the difference between IBM's Big Blue and a 9 yr old. </p>
<p>So people may be capable of much, but have trouble learning. They may arrive at high function, but it may take them longer to get there. People with dyslexia for instance are not dumb, but school can be hard for them and they need longer. </p>
<p>Other people may be severely disabled and lack the ability to do things we take for granted, and yet have extraordinary gifts in other areas. </p>
<p>Even average people may have a few abilities that are far above average. It depends a lot on a persons mind, and not just their brain. How organized their thoughts are, can affect how well they communicate ideas, how well they reason problems out, even without getting into the physical aspects of a brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my theory is compensation. I am autistic, and I think I have to work  extra hard in some arenas just to keep my social head above water, and this manifests itself in some interesting ways. </p>
<p>pretty simple, if someone loses an arm, the other one gets stronger, because they must work harder with what remains. </p>
<p>In my case, I have a difficult time remembering information people tell me, because it all sounds like a wild cacaphony, so I don't well distinguish it from background noise or simply from people bullshitting, stuff I should ignore anyway. I don't have automatic context, and context is the only way I can find to retain information. I undergo far too many permutations to find meaning in what you guys automatically and skillfully rifle through. </p>
<p>My solution is to start to &quot;paint&quot; facts and feelings and stories on the landscape onto or near where I heard it. It barely works, and I fail all the time, no matter how hard I try. I put tons of effort into it though, and I really have to focus to listen and then apply. </p>
<p>The hilarious side effect is that I could recreate a setting I was in with uncommon clarity and detail, and tell you what facts or stories or information may have occurred there. Alternately, I'll revisit a place I &quot;painted&quot; the info onto, and I'll remember a lot of irrelevant data I applied to the scene. I won't remember the facts any better than anyone, but almost no one on earth will remember the setting better than I. This isn't especially useful, but I'm lucky that people are attracted to others with uncommon abilities. </p>
<p>Also, it makes me better than average at 3D modeling and spacial recognition, and visual problem solving, and pattern recognition. All of which I am in the top 1%. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With respect, the answers saying the autistic are dedicating more of their brain to memory and have special abilities are perhaps missing some practical information.</p>
<p>I've been working with the autistic for a decade now. The reason they seem to have good memories about preferred topics is <em>perseverance</em>. That's the symptom name for their habit of repeating things over and over and focusing on one small preferred topic. You hear about the autistic teenager who knows every bus number and scheduled bus time in Los Angeles? Well, you could know that too if you spent 6-7 hours per day staring at a bus schedule and repeating the numbers, for years, like he does. That's an actual example. Some of these kids wake up in the morning and grab their preferred material from next to the bed and go over the information for the millionth time and keep at it every chance during the day. They lag in other areas, and are often hard to draw into speech about anything other than their preferred topic.</p>
<p>If they're lucky the preferred topic can at least be something other people are interested in. If not, they might be memorizing part numbers for the 1965 sears craftsman tool and die catalog. It can be hard to understand or predict what they will seize onto. Your memory could be just as good, though, if you dedicated as much time to the narrow material choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a post about what causes Autism*</p>
<p>*Representing a pretty well supported but not final body of research in neurology. </p>
<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a diagnosis based on social and behavioral features (restrictive interests, repetitive behavior, problems with social interactions) rather than by a common biological cause. </p>
<p>Interestingly, there seem to be two rough groups of people affected by Autism. The first group tends to have the social/ behavioral problems in addition to intellectual disability, developmental delay, mis-developed body features, other stuff associated with  genetic disorders. There is mounting evidence that for these folks, Autism if often a result of various spontaneous genetic mutations in the parents sperm or egg (or in early embryo) that interfere with brain development in ways that converge on a common pattern &quot;Autism&quot; as well as other symptoms depending on what genes are affected. </p>
<p>But for group number 2, they have the same kinds of social/ behavioral features, but are otherwise completely normal and don't have the higher incidence of harmful genetic changes seen in group 1. I don't know of any comparable leads on the biological basis of the disease for this group but awesome science is happening a the time so who knows. </p>
<p>I can provide sources if anyone is interested </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you hopped in a time machine that was stationary but could travel through time like the one in H.G. Wells's &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; and set the dials for the beginning of the universe, you'd zoom back through time as the universe shrank around you. The universe would shrink to a size too small for you and your time machine to be in before you got to the beginning though, and even before you got to the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_\(cosmology\)" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> period, at which time the universe was about the size of a grain of sand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can &quot;see&quot; all the way to the cosmological horizon already, the edge of the observable universe. What we see there is photons that were emitted about 380,000 years after the start of the universe. Before that, the universe was so densely packed with stuff that any photon emitted by one atom would be absorbed by another atom almost immediately. Those photons have been travelling for so long and so far that they are all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" target="_blank">redshifted</a> to microwaves, but in any direction, that redshift indicates a distance of 46.5 billion light years.

This means that where ever you are in the universe everything is generally moving away from you (with exceptions due to gravity). This means that all points appear to be the location of the big bag and the center of the universe from that locations frame of reference. Therefore it is not possible to find the center ( if there is one ) with this method. An easy way to demostrate this is to take a rubber band cut it so that it is a straight line and make different points on it with a marker. Stretch it and check the movements of each of the points relative to several different frames of reference and you will find all things seem to move away from the frame of reference you choose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A side point I haven't seen anyone else mention yet:</p>
<p>While it's good to return the same error message whether the username or password was wrong, there's another security consideration to take into account here: the time it takes to return that error.</p>
<p>Imagine you're an attacker trying to brute force combinations on a website. All you know is whether the combination worked or not and how long it took for you to get the message. If the validation code looks something like this, then you can figure out more information than they intended (bolded lines are where a message is printed):</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if user exists</li>
<li><strong>If user doesn't exist, print error</strong></li>
<li>Get user's password</li>
<li>Compare user's password with entered password</li>
<li><strong>If both passwords match, print success</strong></li>
<li><strong>Otherwise, print error</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at that logic, you can see that the error caused by an incorrect username is printed much earlier than the error caused by an incorrect password. Also keep in mind that password validation both takes a lot longer than simply comparing two usernames (so long as passwords are even somewhat properly stored) and always takes roughly the same amount of time. Because of this, if you can observe the timing of your requests, then you can determine, regardless of the text of the error message, whether the username you entered exists or not. This is called a timing attack, and security experts generally recommend mitigating it by always doing every step of the verification. </p>
<p>Compare the above logic to this logic, which isn't vulnerable to the same timing attack:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if user exists</li>
<li>If user doesn't exist:
<ol>
<li>Get the string &quot;doesn'tmatter&quot; from the database</li>
<li>Compare entered password to this string</li>
<li><strong>Print error</strong></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Get user's password</li>
<li>Compare user's password with entered password</li>
<li><strong>If both passwords match, print success</strong></li>
<li><strong>Otherwise, print error</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with databases and how passwords are stored, just know that step 2.1 is necessary in case of a database that takes a while to respond. Anyway, in this new one, we actually validate the entered password against an arbitrary string in the case the username's incorrect and then discard the result. Because of this, it should always take effectively the same amount of time to get all three options, leaving an attacker with no indication of whether a user exists or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For better security. Any information no matter how small could allow someone to game the system and brute force a login. </p>
<p>Let me give you an example. Say that I really didn't like Joe Forman and I wanted to get into his facebook account but I don't know what his username is but I know a few email addresses he's used. </p>
<p>Login: Jforman@.at.google.com
bad username
Login: Joe_f@.at.yahoo.com
bad username
Login: Lvs2@airmail.net
bad password</p>
<p>Aha. So Instead of not knowing what was wrong, now I know that lvs2@airmail.net is the right login. Now I can use other tricks to log in. I can try some commonly guessed passwords. I can go to a black hat web site and see if anyone with that email address ever had a password stolen, and hope they use the same password on other sites. </p>
<p>I could google Joe Forman or that email, find out their birthday, maybe the name of their pet, favorite color from some questionnaire they took 5 years ago in a public forum. And I can use some of these to do a password reset &quot;What is your birthday? Your pets name?&quot; etc. </p>
<p>Basically brute forcing an account is infinitely easier if you are able to get any pieces of information. It goes from impossible to hard, and hard is just a matter of patience and research. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This practice is somewhat misunderstood as a good security practice, under the principle that you cannot know if you've tried to hack with a correct email address (or username or id or whatever.) However there are other ways to verify the email address information you're providing--notably, by attempting to register that email address. The system will already tell you if an email is in use and as such there is no real security benefit to not revealing whether it's the username or password that is incorrect.</p>
<p>To developers out there, the best security is a strong password with good salting/hashing, and preventing people from knowing whether it was their email or password that was incorrect is bad usability that only hurts people trying to log in, not scripts that probably already know which email is being sought.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're basically caused by a certain kind of skin cell called a melanocyte, which is responsible for giving you a tan by producing the pigment melanin. There's supposed to be one of these melanocytes for every ten 'normal' skin cells you have.</p>
<p>The exact cause of moles is pretty unclear, but when you're developing as a foetus, signalling molecules and how they're distributed determine quite a lot of characteristics that you'll have throughout life. One thing that happens if these signalling molecules aren't distributed evenly is that you get melanocytes replicating before they can be 'spaced out' properly. This leads to an overproduction of melanin in a small area and, through that, a mole.</p>
<p>The saying with moles is &quot;you aren't born with any; you don't die with any&quot;. This is because they migrate from the outer layers of the skin, where there is no reaction against them, to the inner layers of the skin, where your immune system recognises the cells as foreign and begins to pick them off at a low level. Hence by the time people are 55+, most of their moles have gone.</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify what seems to be a controversial point, when I say 'you aren't born with any; you don't die with any', this isn't an absolute rule. It refers to moles formed by melanocytes that go through the standard progression of Junctional&gt;Compound&gt; Intradermal naevus. This doesn't cover other, rarer forms of moles such as congenital naevi, which can be present from birth, nor does it cover other pigmented skin lesions which are often called moles (such as seborrheic keratosis- an extremely common lesion in elderly people with fair skin).</p>
<p>Overall, &quot;mole&quot; is a very ambiguous term that isn't used officially within medicine, but is most commonly used when referring to melanocytic naevi, and that's what I've geared my answer towards on here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komatiite" target="_blank">Komatiitic flows</a>. These are a type of volcanic flow involving low-silica magnesium-rich lava. Komatiites had a distinctive composition, were high-volume, very high tempearture and low in volatiles. They used to produce large sheets and are associated with nickel deposits. Their production required the earths mantle to be hotter than it currently is. Most are af Archean age (&gt; 2.5 billion years) with a few slightly younger stragglers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another obvious one would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation#Relation_to_atmospheric_oxygenation" target="_blank">Banded Iron Formations</a>, especially Algoma types. BIFs are laminated sedimentary deposits rich in iron oxydes, and the source of most iron production today. These were related to the great oxygenation event and are pretty much all formed in the Proterozoic (2.5 to 0.54 billion years ago.)</p>
</li>
<li>Planetary glaciations of the <a href="http://authors.library.caltech.edu/1015/1/KOPpnas05.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Snowball Earth&quot;</a> type. Imagine the icecaps growing all the way past the tropics and meeting at the equator ... Latest one ended about 580 million years ago, and we haven't seen another one since.</li>

<p>Lycopsid trees (which incidentally look like something by Dr. Seuss) had just invented lignin, a major polymer in modern wood. It took a while for decomposers to fully catch up and figure out how to break down this new polymer fast enough to keep up. Enormous amounts of dead trees that could not rot piled up until they were buried or burned in massive forest fires. Quite a lot of coal started out as charcoal from those forest fires of dead rot-proof trees.</p>
<p>Decomposers eventually learned to keep up with lignin, and it's still around as part of the wood in every form of plantlife you'd consider a tree. Nothing like the Carboniferous will ever happen again unless trees invent a new inedible polymer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can, which means operating each flight as close to 100% full as possible.</p>
<p>Imagine you're operating an airline. Most of the time, a few people don't show up for their flight. So you start selling a few extra tickets for each flight. If everyone shows up, you don't have seats for them all. But everyone showing up is very unlikely.</p>
<p>Actual airlines use statistics to determine how many no-shows are likely to happen on each flight. They factor in everything, such as where the flight is to and from, age of the passenger, gender of the passenger, if they're flying with anyone else, the time of the flight, the weather that day, and a <em>ton</em> of other factors. With all of this information, they can get a <em>very</em> good estimate of how many people won't show up for a particular flight. So they then go ahead and sell more tickets for that flight, based on their estimate.</p>
<p>Most of the time, there's no issue. Everyone who shows up gets to fly. But some of the time, there is an issue, because more people than expected showed up for the flight. In these cases, airlines typically offer incentives for travelers to voluntarily give up their seat on the flight, and although this costs the airline some money, the extra money they make by overbooking to get every flight as full as possible more than offsets this cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Great Barrier Reef is a zone which indicates a relative diversity of life on Earth, like Rainforests. The more diverse life is on the planet, the better, as we humans like to harvest things. Imagine if rubber trees didn't exist? Or if the fungi that made up immune suppressants didn't exist? Diversity is really good and when one of these places loses its diversity, we see that most other places are losing diversity too. Furthermore, an estimated 375 billion dollars are generated from food and tourism related to reefs, with about 500 million people dependent on their survival. Animals that depend on these corals for food go too. Entire food chains are disrupted. Imagine no more snapper, grouper, clams, or oysters! Fish rely on corals for protection from larger predators. </p>
<p>About 70% of Earth's oxygen comes from the ocean, from the smallest organisms to the largest kelp forests. Losing life in the ocean directly impacts our world's ability to sustain life. If the reefs, which are some of the most fragile ecosystems start to die, then it's an early warning sign that things are going to get worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're just talking about the Great Barrier Reef, the most tangible effects are local. If the corals bleach and die, the reef structure will still be there for some time, but will gradually be lost to erosion. (When corals are alive, they balance out the erosion by laying down new calcium carbonate skeleton.) So first you'll lose the species that depend on live coral, like butterflyfish that feed on coral. Then you'll start to lose the species that depend on the physical structure as their habitat, including lots of fish that are commercially important. The reef structure is also important for dampening the force of waves coming into shore, so as you lose the structure to erosion you also lose protection from storms.</p>
<p>The bigger problem is that it's not just the Great Barrier Reef. Coral reefs throughout the tropics and subtropics all face the same threats (ocean warming which causes bleaching, ocean acidification which makes it harder for them to build skeletons) and they collectively support millions of people in coastal communities in terms of providing protein, coastal protection, employment (e.g. tourism), and cultural identity. The loss of coral reefs on a global scale is a huge looming disaster.</p>
<p>There are scientists working with coral to try and identify the ones that are most tolerant of warmer water, clone them (they can regenerate from fragments) and use them to build new reefs. This works on a small scale but it's hard to do it at a large scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coral Reefs are highly connected system where almost everything is interdependent on something else. Also it is important to understand the hard Corals are bleaching due to ocean acidification (due to increasing temperatures) which also have impacts on many molluscan species preventing them from building up layers of their calcium shell for defense. Corals and sponges play a particularly large role in remove nutrients from the water and with excess nutrients, there will most likely be decreased visablitly (reducing the photosynthetic capabilities of my of the reefs primary producers) and huge blooms of algae and plankton. This can have massive impacts on the surrounding reef organism and even change the coral reef to a less productive and diverse algae prone system. The point I am trying to get across is nature is extremely complex, far more complex than our models and estimation could ever predict. All we know for sure is that there will be change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

We already have some sugar, no need to raise our hormone levels and take the energy from the reserves. Due to this we wake up with lower blood sugar levels than if we wouldn't have eaten causing the sensation of Hunger.</p>
