		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly lets take down a misconception. GIF (<em>Graphics Interchange Format</em>) is a static image protocol, much like JPEG, mostly intended for portability and compression. However, it supported more than one image in the same file. You could see each image individually or play them sequentially. If these images are different frames of a short movie, you got yourself an animation.</p>
<p>Therefore it was never really intended to be a video format. But since it became famous for such feature and for its simplicity, some optimizations were introduced but still a far cry from proper video formats. However, video formats do demand much more resources and are found in a myriad of different algorithms and protocols, many proprietary, while GIFs were supported natively by browsers since the Netscape days.</p>
<p>[EDIT] It's worth mentioning that, despite not being the most bandwidth/storage efficient format, GIFs were still preferred in the old Internet days due to the way they store the image. When you're downloading a GIF over a slow connection you can kind of guess what the image looks like early in the process. The image would start showing up as a very blurred version of the original that became increasingly more detailed as more data gets downloaded. If you decide that you don't need to see the final image you can abort the transfer and don't bother with the rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all videos are optimized, not all gifs are. Now, what is this optimisation? When you watch a video the subsequent frames are nearly identical. It is rare that all pixels of a frame change. So the videos store only the changes and viewing program updates the pixels that change and leave the pixels that haven't changed alone. this reduces the size of the file, like, a lot. Gifs can do that too but they rarely do. They store all the pixels of each frame regardles if they changed or not.</p>
<p>Also gif must usually be loaded in full before it starts playing. video can start playing when it is partially loaded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GIFs (the real ones, not the gifv which are actually muted videos) are full images put sequentially together so if you have a 10kb picture and you want a smooth framerate (say 24 fps, which is the minimun you can use before the eye starts noticing somethign is wrong) if you make a minute long GIF of the same 10kb pic, you end up with a 14,400kb GIF, or about 14Mb to round.</p>
<p>On the other hand, videos store the initial picture and then track the pixels that change each frame, so you'd start with the initial 10kb pic, and then add nothing because nothing is changing, so you end up with a minute long video wich is only 10kb.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the video is extremelly scrambled frame to frame, it could weight as much as the GIF, but then if you watched it you'd probably would see somethign resembling to weird interferences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All modern video and image formats are compressed using various tricks unique to their file format.</p>
<p>PNGs use a decoder which allows pixels to calculate the value of one of their adjacent neighbors, and according to their specification, are also compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm.</p>
<p>JPEGs take color and brightness and lossily convert the image into &quot;blocks&quot; that look pretty close to the original pixels but take far less data to display.</p>
<p>Videos use lossy but extremely efficient codecs (eg. H.264) that are optimized for only storing enough data to show a frame based on the previous frame and a list of differences.</p>
<p>GIFs have none of these compression tricks or optimizations. A GIF is a series of 8-bit indexed images with some metadata for telling the renderer how to animate it.</p>
<p>The format is similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>[Header]

[Colors: 256 * 3]  
[Image: 1 * Width * height]  
[Metadata: 1]  
Repeat for each frame...</code></pre>
<p>For a 800x455 image that uses a color table for each frame, it would end up being somewhere along the lines of 350 KiB for every single frame. When animating that at 24 FPS, it takes 8.5 MiB to display a single second animation.</p>
<p>This can be reduced a little bit (3/4 of a KiB per frame) by using a global color table instead of a per-frame one, but it still doesn't come close to an actual video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most video formats are smarter then that and only update what changed. Often in video the frames aren't completely different so you don't need to load every frame completely. You just need to know some keyframes and then the changes from the key frame. GIFs just have way too much unnecessary data taking up space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers so far are a little too dismissive. The answer is that it depends on what you mean by one infinity being more than another.</p>
<p>The cardinality of the two sets measures how many elements each has. It is the same for both sets because you can re-label every element in [0,1] to get [0,2] and vice versa.</p>
<p>The (Lebesgue) measure of the sets corresponds to their &quot;length.&quot; The interval [0,1] has measure 1 and [0,2] has measure 2, so it's larger in that sense.</p>
<p>Edit: A third way to compare largeness of sets is the subset operator, ⊂.  Think of ⊂ being analogous to a less than symbol, &lt;. In that sense, a set A is larger than B (ie, B⊂A) if B is a subset of A and not equal to it. The problem is that, using that operator, not all sets are &quot;comparable.&quot; For example, [0,2] is neither larger or smaller than [1,5] using that definition. This type of operator is called a &quot;partial order&quot; in mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think all of the previous answers are missing the fact that there are different notions of the 'size' of a set.</p>
<p>One concept, which others have mentioned, is cardinality, which amounts to counting the number of points in a set. In the infinite case, two sets have the same cardinality if you can find a mapping which uniquely maps a point from one set to the other (<em>injectivity</em>) so that each point is mapped to (<em>surjectivity</em>). For the sets [0,1] and [0,2], the function which maps x to 2x meets this criterion.</p>
<p>Another concept for the size of a set are 'measures', which basically behave like volume measurement functions. For simple sets like [0,1] and [0,2], the so-called Borel measure can be used, which would be 1 and 2 respectively. For most of the more complicated sets, a generalization called the Lebesgue measure can be applied. It also forms the basis for the modern definition of integrals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No they are equal. To prove that they are equal, we can pair up each value between 0 and 1 with 2 times itself in the values between 0 and 2. Since all the values will be paired up with one from the opposite set, we can say that the two sets contain the same number of values. This shows that the two infinities are indeed equal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question and it was a huge problem a few hundreds years ago. </p>
<p>The issue here is what you mean by &quot;size&quot;. We have to make this precise. How are we judging the size? Clearly, the interval [0,2] is longer than the interval [0,1] - in some sense, if we were to <em>measure</em> the two sets, the first one would be bigger. </p>
<p>But does that really mean one has &quot;more&quot; points than the other? Perhaps... there are points in one interval that are not in the other interval.</p>
<p>But is this enough to conclude that the &quot;amounts&quot; of points are different? And this is where the idea of countability comes in. There might be points in the first not in the second, but that doesn't mean that the two sets are of different &quot;sizes&quot;.</p>
<p>How would we count if we were a primitive tribe that didn't have numbers? Let's say you got into a fight and lost some fingers. How would you be able to tell if you have more or fewer fingers? The best way would be to pair them off, each finger on one hand to the corresponding one on the other. You know that if you can't do this, then the hand which is missing fingers has fewer fingers. </p>
<p>Georg Cantor used this idea to determine the &quot;size&quot; of certain sets of numbers. There are three kinds of sets: finite sets, countable sets, and uncountable sets. </p>
<p>A finite set does not have an infinite amount of stuff in it. </p>
<p>An infinite set can be countable or uncountable. What is a countable set? A countable set is one whose elements can be enumerated - just like our example with hands and fingers, if you can match up the items in the set one-by-one with the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,... then your set is countable. </p>
<p>An uncountable set, in some sense, is bigger than a countable set: no matter <em>how</em> you do it, there is no way to match up the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,... with the elements of an uncountable set. If you tried to make such a list, there would always be elements that are not on it. </p>
<p>The interval [0,1] is an uncountable set. The interval [0,2] is also an uncountable set - it's gotta be, because it contains all the numbers between 0 and 1, too. But are they the same size? Yes - because, just like with our fingers, we can come up with a rule for matching them up one by one. </p>
<p>All we do is use the rule which maps one numbers to its double: so for any number in the first set, just correspond it to its double. </p>
<p>Because this rule associates precisely each element in [0,1] to [0,2], and we know that any number in [0,2] is the double of some number in [0,1], this rule perfectly matches the sets. The only way the sets can be perfectly matched up like this is if there were as many elements in each set, just like with our fingers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start, you need to know what a blockchain is.   Basically, it is a ledger, a record of transactions.   Normally, this function is handled by a central authority, such as a bank.   You put money into the back, they write it down.   You spend it, they write that down.   If you try to spend it twice, they say no.</p>
<p>But central authorities provide a single point of failure, and require trust in that authority.   This is a weakness in many cases -- especially regarding regulatory uncertainty in many parts of the world.   But without a central authority, who will keep you from spending your money 5 times, or even know if you have any to begin with?</p>
<p>The answer is a mathematical and computing breakthrough called a blockchain.   The first successful one was called &quot;Bitcoin&quot;.   Basically, it replaces the central authority with some complicated math and majority rules and some interesting economics, so that the ledger is public and its state is determined by computers.</p>
<p>There are many blockchains, Bitcoin is just the most famous.   Bitcoin is suitable as a transfer of value and not much more (and increasingly unsuitable for that). </p>
<p>Ethereum took the ideas from the blockchain, and said, what if we attach a computer program to each  entry in the ledger?   So instead of &quot;address 123 has 400 coins&quot;, it could have a program that says &quot;Address 123 has 400 coins, and they will be released 5 coins per week to Address 155 and 175 on alternate weeks.&quot; </p>
<p>This program is now a contract: offline, a couple people agreed to this payment schedule, you write it into code and are guaranteed payment over time because the Ethereum network enforces it.</p>
<p>That's just scratching the surface, though.   What if you could attach any program or file or contract between any two people, and it is enforced automatically by the network, and nobody could shut it off?</p>
<p>Want to gamble but your country doesn't like it?  Too bad, they can't stop it. The blockchain cannot be shut down by a central authority.   Do you live in a third world country where property rights don't mean much, but you want to get investors in your business?   Put your business on the blockchain and they can give you money securely.</p>
<p>There are thousands of ideas of what to do with Ethereum, but it is very young and it is likely that its most valuable uses aren't even conceived yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ethereum is like a globally shared spreadsheet (blockchain). Every 14 seconds (block time) everyone synchronizes their spreadsheet by adding any new rows (transactions) at the bottom (append-only transaction ledger). You get the spreadsheet kinda like how you can download a movie from Bittorent (decentralized network) and connecting to peers (nodes) hosting the file. </p>
<p>No one can cheat or make extra money (Ether / cryptocurrency) out of thin air, because the software (protocol) checks that you only spent money you got from someone else (cryptographic signatures ensure transactions are valid) or that you won it in the lottery (mining reward) every synchronization (block).</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Ethereum is that it's not just a spreadsheet like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3" target="_blank">Lotus 1-2-3</a> (bitcoin), but was built fully featured like Excel with VBA macros (SmartContracts).</p>
<p>Why all the fuss? Because it's the first time in human history that any 2 people (2-party) on opposite sides of the world can make a bet with eachother and they don't need a bookie (escrow / bank) to hold the funds (counterparty).  They can do it with this spreadsheet alone (trustless / no counterparty risk) by writing a macro to decide who wins the bet and gets the money (the macro [SmartContract] holds the money [Ether]). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A decentralized network is a collection of computers connected together over the internet that run some common program. An example of this would be bittorrent. Bittorrent enable anyone running a bittorrent client to share files directly with each other rather than downloading that file from a single computer. </p>
<p>Decentralized applications have the advantage that there is no single computer that can be turned off that would shut down the functionality of the entire thing.</p>
<p>In 2008 an anonymous person named Satoshi published a design for a distributed network that could be used to record a ledger. A ledger is a history book in this case a digital one. This network went live in 2009.</p>
<p>The main advantage a distributed ledger has is that there is no single point of failure. Just like bittorrent there is no single server you can shut down to disable it. Unlike bittorrent however it is important that a history book is the same for everyone who views it. This is not a problem for bittorrent because you are not adding to the files you share. You share a torrent file which contains the information that describes the files and if you want to make changes you have to create a new torrent file. But with a history book you are always adding to it and the order in which new information is added is important.</p>
<p>Another reason to distribute the history book is to prevent tampering. If everyone holds a copy of the history then one person changing the history will not show up in every one elses copy. </p>
<p>The way it works is that there are a set of rules that everyone's copy of the software follows when they receive a new message containing data to add to the history book. If information comes in that conflicts with those rules then it is simply ignored. </p>
<p>This is not enough though to make sure everyone gets the same copy of history because some people might get messages in a different order to others. For instance If a message is created in Australia and the USA at the same time then someone in Australia might get the message generated in Australia first and a person in the USA might get the message generated there first even though both messages are valid.</p>
<p>To solve this problem Satoshi designed bitcoin so that messages are grouped together in blocks and a sort of lottery is run on those blocks. People perform a mathematical function on the data in the block to generate a number and if that number fits a certain condition then the rules of the network say they should accept that block... well they should accept that block if it follows all of the rules and if it is the least likely winner out of all the known winners. The least likely winner being the last block of messages found on the longest chain of blocks.</p>
<p>The difficulty of this lottery is adjusted (again by the common set of rules) so that blocks of messages are accepted at a regular rate that allows them to spread through the network before a new block is found to fit the criteria.</p>
<p>Since performing the math function requires time and energy the cost of a ticket in this lottery cant be faked. Someone wanting to change history would need more computing power than every one on the network combined.</p>
<p>To resolve conflicts when 2 blocks are found at the same time you wait until the next block is found and accept the longest chain. Blocks of messages can only refer to a single previous block so the people playing the lotto are also betting on the previous block also being accepted all the way back to the first one.</p>
<p>Now this is where currency comes into it. Those messages that are being recorded are actually financial transactions of a new currency that only exists as messages in this history book. And the way this currency is created is as a reward for the lottery that makes the system work!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's actually really simple. If she knows about Bitcoin, we explain using Bitcoin. If she doesn't, use a physical object for analogy instead, like an apple.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bitcoin is basically digital money - like cash. </p>
<p>We could have a <strong>simple transaction where I send you 1 bitcoin</strong> - now it's yours, and that's it. Just like cash, you now have it, and I don't.</p>
<p>Ethereum is basically programmable money. Instead of a simple Bitcoin transaction, we can now add programming logic to it. </p>
<p>Our <strong>transaction</strong> would be, say, <strong>I send you 1 ether <em>IF</em> the clock turns exactly 9:05PM</strong>. And if the network verifies that the condition is met (it actually is 9:05pm), then the transaction goes through and you'll receive your ether.</p>
<hr />
<p>And you can have any condition, as long as you can program it! How about I send you 1 ether <strong><em>IF</em></strong> this Reddit thread reaches 25 comments? How about I send you 1 ether <strong><em>IF</em></strong> Marine Le Pen becomes president of France? Programming logic opens up a massive world of opportunities and that's what makes Ethereum special.</p>
<p>This is how I explain Ethereum in person to people and I'm easily able to do so in minutes. Just adjust for your target audience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>People want to do stuff in the business realm like exchange money, have contracts, and know who owns what.    With physical money, exchanging it is easy, but you have to have someone issue the money and fight counterfeiters. For contracts, two people signing a paper often isn't enough, and you need to file it with the court and/or sue them in court if they break contract.   And some government clerk is in charge of keeping records of who owns what land. </p>
<p>All of that depends on &quot;authority&quot;.  Someone in control who governs how these things are handled, what's fair, and keeps people from screwing each other. </p>
<p>Ethereum (and blockchain tech in general) is software which uses encryption and distributed computing to remove the need for an authority. With a blockchain you can mathematically prove that someone else did a thing.  Like paid you $5, transferred ownership of a house, or agreed to a contract. And it's computationally so difficult to make a forgery that it's impossible.  You know, unless there's a software bug or something.  Which actually happened to Ethereum. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I understand that it is some sort of decentralized internet? And that I can help support it by offering my computer hardware to the service and I get paid for it in a crypto-currency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More like a decentralized computer that people can trust to crunch numbers and do business over. And yes, you can help out and get paid in crypto-currency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

This was the Irish tradition and O' meant &quot;grandson of&quot; while Mac meant &quot;son of&quot;. So David would be David MacDouglas or David O'Brian. However, David's son William would be William MacDavid or William O'Douglas. At some point where surnames had to be preserved to record family relationships for inheritance and the like, the name &quot;froze&quot; at that point and was adopted as a static surname for future generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Portable chargers and phones are not directly connected batteries. The portable charger has a boost converter, that takes the voltage (between 3 and 4v) from the internal battery(ies), oscillates it to create an alternating current that can be boosted in voltage using a coil, capacitor or both, and then it gets rectified back to DC at 5v (USB standard).</p>
<p>(edit: in a discussion below, I'm corrected: the current is not alternating, is in fact pulsating DC. And therefore doesn't get rectified to 5v, it gets smoothed to reduce ripple) </p>
<p>The phone, on the other side, takes the 5v from the USB input and steps it down to the required voltage to charge the internal phone battery. That varies according to the technology of the battery, the charge remaining in it, the charge speed the phone wants, and so on.</p>
<p>When you connect two batteries directly, yes, they more or less reach an equilibrium, because as the most charged one (higher voltage) recharges the empty one, its voltage decreases as the other one's increases. When there is not enough difference of potential (voltage, in other words) to make the charge flow from one battery to another, they reach the equilibrium.</p>
<p>In the portable chargers, the boost circuitry makes sure the output voltage is 5v as long as possible, of course by drawing more current from the lower voltage internal cells, because in both sides of the conversion circuit the power should be almost equal [ P = I * V ] (ignoring losses in the conversion). So the charger extracts more current from cells to generate those 5v the phone needs, and the phone as long as it haves the right voltage, can charge the internal battery, so eliminating the &quot;equilibrium&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people can give a more detailed and strict answer, but this is the way I get it.</p>
<p>PD: sorry for any mistakes, english is not my main language. Regards!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always find it easy to think of electricity like water. In this situation you have two pools, the portable charger and the phone battery. If your phone pool is low then the circuit board in the charger acts like a pump that takes water out of the charger pool and pumps it into the phone pool. This allows it to take all of the water out of the charger pool and put it in your phone pool. This fills up your phone pool even to the point of being fuller than the charger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of circuitry between the batteries that makes it all work.</p>
<p>As for the charged device, it's (most commonly) provided with 5V DC, whilst the battery tops out at 4.2V. There's charge-regulators between the 5V and the battery that makes sure charging stops when the battery is full.</p>
<p>As for the portable battery charger. Let's assume (for simplicitys sake) that it's a small one. It'll contain one Li-Ion battery that'll have 4.2V when fully charged, and 2.8V when it's practically dead.</p>
<p>Now, to charge the other device, it'll need to provide 5V. It does this through a &quot;DC-DC Boost converter&quot; which increases the voltage provided by the battery to 5V.</p>
<p>Now, this is not some physics-breaking EE voodoo. It's all about energy. If your device wants 1A current at 5V to charge, and your portable battery chargers battery is at 3V, the boost-converter will draw 1.666A from its battery.  (  5 <em> 1 = 3 </em> 1.666 )</p>
<p>This is of course assuming 100% efficiency, which isn't attainable. Most well-designed boost-converters are above 90% efficient though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

These portable batteries, as correctly described in the other posts, has some circuitry that allows it to charge your devices. But the part of that circuitry that actually prevents the current from flowing in both directions, is called a Schottky diode, or blocking diode. It's like a one-way check valve and will only allow current flow in one direction. </p>
<p>This is actually what keeps them from reaching &quot;equilibrium&quot;. Cheers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all probes are crashed down at the end of their mission, and the crash itself is more complex than just getting rid of the probe. When they do crash a probe on purpose, it's often to collect new data that they could not otherwise get.</p>
<p>For Cassini in particular, they are planning what they call its <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/overview/" target="_blank">Grand Finale</a>. From now until September, Cassini will dive between Saturn and its rings several times, gathering data on those regions which we've never been able to explore before (and most likely sending back some <em>incredible</em> pictures of the inner rings and planet atmosphere).</p>
<p>On the final orbit, the probe will dive into the atmosphere of Saturn, sending back data on the atmosphere itself for as long as it can survive. At some point, the probe will simply burn up and disintegrate, much like a small meteor burns up in the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<hr />
<p>Other than gathering data on Saturn, NASA is also concerned that some of Saturn's moons - Enceladus and Titan - may contain organic life, even if just microscopic.</p>
<p>Similar to the Prime Directive in <em>Star Trek</em>, they don't want to risk contaminating those environments in the case that Cassini - after it spends all its fuel making orbit adjustments - crashes into one of them. So, disposing of the probe completely by burning it in Saturn's atmosphere is the safest way to prevent it from being a nuisance in the future.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it's nice to see NASA and JPL cleaning up after themselves. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Casini in particular was sent into the atmosphere of Saturn so that it couldn't accidentally contaminate any nearby moons potentially capable of harboring life. While it's pretty long odds that it would succeed to do so, destroying the probe in the atmosphere removes them entirely, and at the time the plan was to send future probes anyway that could take over the operation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The #1 reason is to preclude any possibility that Earth-based lifeforms on the probe itself contaminate a possible source of extraterrestrial life. Space probes like Cassini are sterilized to kill anything off before they are launched, and of course outer space is not very conducive to life. But there's no way to guarantee that <em>some</em> microbe won't manage to survive the trip. </p>
<p>Should we one day discover extraterrestrial life on Europa, or Titan, or Enceladus, it would be a major bummer to determine that such life wasn't extraterrestrial at all and had just hitched a ride on an old probe a few hundred years before. Even worse: our Earth-based microbes might kill off any extraterrestrial life before we know it's there.</p>
<p>We limit where probes land on Mars for the same reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwAG0Ddatww" target="_blank">Gillette video</a> the average guy takes 170 strokes or more to properly shave. From my experience, the reality is that you never get a clean shave in a series of single passes no matter what blade you use. </p>
<p>In my case it takes multiple passes in different directions to get what I consider a clean shave. The first pass removes the shaving cream and some of the hairs and the lubricating strip ensures that the next pass glides smoothly. It also may have some impact on the angle of the cutting action. </p>
<p>Then consider that as the lubricant wears off the angle changes and the razor may not cut as well over time as the angles gets ever more flatter. How hard you press the razor into your skin may also affect the angle and at what angle you hold the blade may impact its effectiveness if the lubricating strip acts as a fulcrum to lift the blades away from the skin surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Easy, the sports culture in the US grew up alongside the schools.  Have you noticed that sports around the world are centered around &quot;athletic clubs&quot; and such?  Well in the U.S., most began as high school and college sports and with no pro sports (apart from like golf, baseball and a few others) even the best athletes would quit after graduation.   The idea of serious athletes became culturally relegated to school age men and women until the 20th century, so naturally, the fierce regional rivalries that sports usually breeds, emerged in the high schools and universities in America, not clubs.  </p>
<p>Even when pro sports came of age, they paled in comparison to college atmosphere and energy for decades.   </p>
<p>The 20th century saw the Olympics and other international competitions take hold.  While other countries developed through sports clubs and creating &quot;Ministries of Sport,&quot; the United States had no need since, their schools were doing all the work already, and they were an instant heavy hitter on the international scene, dominating in a lot of sports.    </p>
<p>To this day, the US has never seen a need to develop the nations athletes any other way than using the High Schools as the prospect developer and the colleges are training centers.   This is hurting a few US sports, like soccer, where academies are only just now finally being built that train players much better than the NCAA.   A lot of Men's sports are suffering because schools are legally obligated to have an equal amount of male and female athletes.  Plus, the governing NCAA puts strict training hour restrictions on the athletes.  Which makes sense so a coach doesn't overwork an engineering major, but is bonkers for a US male gymnast who is going to the Olympics against a Chinese athlete who trains 10 hours a day. </p>
<p>EDIT:  I posted this in a comment but it's very topical here.   Stephen Fry described college sports as basically the most American thing to exist.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, other countries don't.</p>
<p>In other countries, sports are generally run on the 'pyramid system', which means that a team can advance into the league above by winning the league below.  Theoretically, any amateur team right at the bottom, even as a 'hobby team' has the potential to go right to the top.  As every community will have a team at some level, the local support tends to attach itself to this team (or the nearest professional team, or both) rather than to the local high school.</p>
<p>In terms of advancing to the professional leagues, individual players will often be signed up to the youth system of a professional club, so unlike the US, success at sport in the education system does not provide a direct pathway into the professional game, hence it has less consequences, even if the players involved are just as committed as in the US.</p>
<p>In the UK at least, university sports are taken more seriously than high school sports, and playing/training facilities are often very good, although large scale stadia as in US college football are unheard of as are the sums of money invested - again, this is because university sport does not generally form part of the pathway into professional sport.  </p>
<p>Certain events between rival universities may attract large crowds, but often that's related to the tradition of the event, rather than the importance of the event as a sporting competition, although the events may still be keenly contested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here in the UK it tends to be clubs outside of schools rather than the schools themselves. Schools have sports teams but usually limited to the popular ones, mostly football, cricket, rugby, netball and athletics. Fee paying schools will typically have different sports they have teams for in addition to the above.   </p>
<p>Anything who shows talent will often sign up to the youth team for established sports so if that happened in the US you would have the LA Lakers under 11 team for example, and it is at that level that the real competition exists. As there is no draft system it also suits the clubs as they can uncover and develop a potential £100m player without having to buy them from another club.  </p>
<p>I do like the school sport culture in the US though. Until you hit the big time the only people in the crowd will be parents of the players. Must be nice to run out in front of hundreds or even thousands of kids supporting you at that age. I used to be a mid-talent runner and was lucky enough to be cheered on by about 150 people once and that was amazing. I never won anything though but just having people cheer your name shaved half a second off each lap. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High School Baseball is still a thing in Japan and ridiculously popular. The annual high school tournament is broadcast live on TV and becomes a source of national pride from whatever prefecture they come from. Its called <strong>Koshien</strong> and the entire thing sweeps up the country like crazy. When I was in Okinawa, everyone was glued to the TV to watch a bunch of 18 year old kids slug it out on account of the fact the local team from that area got to the final.  </p>
<p>Football (soccer) less so, but they do broadcast the high school cup final live on TV as well. </p>
<p>Baseball in Japan is kinda fucked up though. The professional league loses a shit ton of money because they still run it like its the 1960's and don't understand the modern-age with slick marketing and whatnot. A big problem you have is that many of the kids at the high-school level get really bad coaches and they are often worked to death. Especially at Koushien. Matsuzaka Daisuke who latter played in MLB, once pitched 17 innings, as a high-school kid. Crazy. </p>
<p>The whole concept of sport-science, technical coaching, fitness etc is very low. And its all blood and thunder nonsense. This is why soccer is continuing to dominate because they take a 21st century approach and get in qualified coaches teaching kids and get them thinking like athletes at a young age. You don't get that in baseball. Its all tradition and bullshit.</p>
<p>In terms of facilities and spending, I really can't comment that much. But often I find that Japanese schools pay for a lot of shit for their kids. And they'll equally build an arts centre and baseball field as much as they do tennis courts and libraries. Its equal opportunity  spending all across the board if you go to a school which excels at pumping out gifted kids in whatever field.</p>
<p>I will say this though, they train like a motherfucker. 5-6 days a week. Very common for sports teams in Japan, even to the university level. Even if the team is shit, they'll still train. Its the whole 'ganbaru' - never give up bullshit which consumes the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, sports are seen as a (potential) revenue stream for the school if they can get people attending games, paying for tickets or concessions, bringing in grant money from organizations that do scouting, etc.</p>
<p>Often, the sports programs get more attention because the administration believes that money put in to the sports teams is money that they will see returned and able to be reinvested in other areas.</p>
<p>It's not always(or even often) a net benefit to the school to put that money in to sports, but it's something that has to be examined on a case by case basis for each school- if the school budgets in your area are a matter of public record, it might be interesting to compare sports spending to revenue from sports related sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>911 gets special consideration by the carriers due to FCC regulations.  This means a couple of unique things for 911 calls.  </p>
<p>First, even if the phone does not have a service plan attached to it, it can still call 911.  No service/no bill, doesn't matter, your phone is still allowed to make 911 calls.  Keep in mind though, that since your no-service phone doesn't have a phone number attached to it, if you get disconnected the 911 operator cannot call you back. </p>
<p>Second, no bars doesn't necessarily mean you can't call 911.  For most numbers your phone has a minimum threshold of signal required for it to even attempt to make a call.  If the signal is less than what would represent 1 bar on the phone's display, the phone won't try a call because it knows that it's likely to fail/cause a bad experience for you.  For 911 though that rule does not apply.  Your phone could have 1 of 10th of 1 bar worth of signal, and it will still try and call 911. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

the hardware required to make calls/get internet is already in the phone. the sim card is just the pay card to access that.</p>
<p>now the 911 call will just skip all that and directly connect to the services. afaik every carrier has to agree to let 911 calls through from anyone without charging or authentication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When the phone talks to the cell tower, it provides its credentials, and the tower authenticates that your phone should be allowed to make calls.  This is checked when you try to make a phone call.</p>
<p>When you call 911, the tower sees that you are trying to call 911, so it skips the part where you have to authenticate your phone and are just let through to the 911 system. (or, rather, allows the call to happen, but it will still grab what information it can to identify you- which could become relevant they needed to trace you back- say if the call disconnected, or if you were making a prank call)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only thing preventing a deactivated phone from making a call is software, either on your end inside the phone or on the carrier's end in the network servers. The hardware is always there. Even actions like turning off the Wi-Fi radio or mobile data on an active device are all software commands that either tell the various hardware pieces to power down and not send data to the processor, or tell the processor to ignore whatever data is being sent to it from said hardware. Samsung forced a software update that locked out and bricked the Note 7s that people didn't want to turn in, preventing them from being used.</p>
<p>The always-on 911 feature is just software. If certain conditions are met, e.g. the phone is locked but you perform the correct sequence of actions to place a 911 call from the lock screen, the software will unlock and open whatever hardware has been deemed necessary to complete that call. This includes communicating back to the carrier's servers that the lock-screen-911 feature has been activated and the call must be allowed to pass through. The server will then make the necessary changes and connect the call.</p>
<p>If the signal is weak, it may be possible to reallocate power to certain hardware and/or software resources to try and internally boost that signal so the call can still be made. Since this extra power boost would drain the battery faster and is not necessary for the vast majority of regular calls made, it would not be made available outside of the 911-call-on-a-locked-phone scenario. But this would only work if there was a signal to boost in the first place. No signal means no call.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Gerrymandering for racial reasons has more case law and is more likely to be thrown out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that most of the comments here are in error. The prior Supreme Court cases have not ever found that partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional, quite the contrary. The only reason that the Supreme Court has found for overturning district gerrymandering is for racial reasons, and even then they are of two minds. </p>
<p>Consider a state that is 60% white and 40% black. What should the legislature of that state look like? If the two populations are evenly mixed, then every district will be predominantly white and they could very well end up with an all white state congress. On the other hand if there were some all white districts and some all black districts and the districts all had the same population, then the most likely outcome would be a 40% black and 60% white congress. Which is the most racially unbiased result? </p>
<p>So, gerrymandering is sometimes used to increase minority race representation in congress and sometimes it is used to decrease it. The Supreme Court generally finds as you might expect in those cases. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if a gerrymandering case is brought to the court that doesn't have a racial component, they have generally not heard the case, since there is precedent that partisan gerrymandering is not illegal. There is no obvious part of the Constitution that it violates. Sometimes a case might be partisan or it might be racial and they will hear those cases. </p>
<p>Some states have laws against partisan gerrymandering, which changes things. And it appears that public opinion on the matter might be changing which is forcing the SCOTUS to be willing to reexamine this precedent. For the first time in a long time the SCOTUS is going to rule on a case of strictly partisan gerrymandering this year. </p>
<p>TL;DR: partisan gerrymandering is mostly legal, but that may be changing, both at the state and federal levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a difficult thing to manage.  As a result of a Supreme Court ruling in regards to civil rights the states are not allowed to spread minority votes across district lines since it was determined that that doesn't give them a strong enough voice and doesn't allow them a united voice as well as the advancement of minority politicians in Congress.  The court actually requires states to intentionally create districts that have a majority population of minorities.</p>
<p>States largely complied.  But, as time has gone on people often believe that giving minorities their own districts actually hurts their political power because states put them all in their district, they get one politician and then the rest of the districts aren't a melting pot.  So now there is a push to try to prevent states from districting based on racial lines, but the Supreme Court has already required them to do this.  So it's a very fine balancing act the states have to go through, and in many cases they exploit the Supreme Court requirements/ruling to their political advantage.</p>
<p>And if you removed the racial districting you might actually lose minority representation in Congress in terms of number of minority Congressmen, which people don't want.  So gerrymandering is this strange mix of affirmative action for Congress and political gamesmanship to protect a party's numbers in Congress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And the federal courts have upheld this, I should add.
Here's the relevant Wikipedia source, if you'll accept this:</p>
<p>Other states including California, New Jersey and New York have opted to protect incumbents of both parties, again reducing the number of competitive districts. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Pennsylvania gerrymander[5] effectively cemented the right of elected officials to select their constituents by eliminating most of the grounds for disenfranchised constituents to challenge gerrymandered lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Finally, in some states there are federal court orders dictating there be majority districts for various ethnic groups.  Complying with those sometimes decades old orders in the face of popular shifts can make for a challenging map.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
