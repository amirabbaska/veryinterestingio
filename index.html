Example: the water can be used to irrigated crops that the cows eat, that then get slaughtered for market because it's enough steps away from human consumption but they cannot use the water for the cows to drink. Also it can be used to water the vineyards because the grapes go through a fermentation process before consumption so that gets counted as an extra step.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So say a population of birds goes off and splits in two, through some random environmental means such as a major storm pushes them into unfamiliar but beneficial territory, or the group just wanders off.</p>
<p>Those two isolated groups will then interbreed amongst themselves, and their respective gene pools will tilt toward one prediction or other.</p>
<p>Eventually, through all this interbreeding and mutation etc, those two bird populations, originally of the same species, are now separate species. This means they can no longer produce viable offspring, or if they can produce living offspring, said offspring cannot produce viable/living offspring of their own. This is known as a post-zygotic isolation.</p>
<p>Pre-zygotic isolation is when the group(s) somehow diverge in habitat, behavior, temporal and mechanical parts/traits. There is also gametic isolation patterns that can come into play here. Generally this means that the birds can no longer inhabit the same area of space, their mating signals differ slightly enough to discourage interbreeding, they wake/sleep/mate at different times, and their genitalia are no longer compatible. Any of these isolations can create speciation within a group over a period of time.</p>
<p>Speciation can occur in a group that is split as well as a geographically identical population. Any manner of these pre-zygotic (before mating period) isolation factors can occur in either of these instances.</p>
<p>Sorry if not clear, on mobile.</p>
<p>Edit: wow guys I'm glad this got the discussion flowing! So I'm still on mobile, and I am currently a passenger in a car and I get sick if I look down too long, plus I have to go to school early in the morning. </p>
<p>SO, if anyone feels like answering the comments or whatever then feel free, I'm far from an expert. I'm actually attending school for a BA in Biology so that's how I managed to answer this very fundamental question.</p>
<p>That being said, any flaws in my logic, please feel free to correct them! Sources would be very helpful for things like case studies, as I find this really interesting and would love to learn more about this subject!</p>
<p>I'll try to get some more info from my professor tomorrow if you guys would like, so yeah! Thank you for this question to OP and thank you for all the additional information!</p>
<p>Edit: Wow so this really blew up over night...
I guess to summarize, one species can become two or more through various processes such as geological splitting and behavioral differences, and this happens over a long period of time, and is not a concrete explanation, as many have felt free to point out.
I guess if you want a better answer then you can check out the evolutionary biologist's comment thread.
Again, NONE OF THIS IS CONCRETE, just a single explanation in a sea of multiple explanations to similar sets of questions. This is also what I learned in class, and again I am not an expert.
This is also ELI5, not Scientific Discourse 410. I know my explanation was a bit more complicated than what one would tell a 5 year old (not that I would know, I don't talk to kids much anyway), but it's the simplest I could make it while typing it out on a tiny screen on an hour drive and trying to get as much relevant information as possible out there.
All that being said, I think this will be the end for me here. Just wanted to say that I acknowledge defeat, and I look forward to continuing to read what you all have to say. Thank you for all your replies! It'll be slow going, but I'll try to read them all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda late here but as an evolutionary biologist I thought I would add my input.</p>
<p>The question you are asking is essentially: When are 2 living beings different enough to be considered different species?</p>
<p>The short, and frustrating, answer is there is no one definitive way. Makes sense though, the natural world doesn't act in absolutes, but we as humans like to. I'll explain how we do it, but first let me ask you a question to think about: When does red become orange on the color spectrum? Surely it does as anyone would agree, but exactly where? Tough to say. Depends on who's looking, who you're asking, how you define red and orange. Lots of different things come in to play.</p>
<p>Anyway. The most agreed upon way is that if 2 animals can reproduce and have a viable AND fertile offspring, then they are the same. Otherwise they are different.</p>
<p>Viable = able to live.</p>
<p>Fertile = able to reproduce.</p>
<p>So, for instance, if a human and a horse attempt to reproduce, they would have an inviable (and therefore infertile) offspring. So they are different species.</p>
<p>If a Donkey and a Horse reproduce they actually have a viable offspring. A mule. However, a mule is not fertile, so therefore cannot reproduce, so we call horses and donkeys different species.</p>
<p>And finally, if 2 horses reproduce they have a viable and fertile offspring and are therefore considered the same species.</p>
<p>This is why ALL dogs are considered the same species according to a biologist, despite the remarkable differences between a chihuahua and a Great Dane.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, there are exceptions to this. One example is in Giraffes. There are considered to be a handful of different species of giraffes in Africa (5 or 6, can't exactly remember). But the only difference between them are subtle differences in the patterns of spots in their hide. If and individual of one species got together with an individual of another and decided to reproduce they would produce a viable and fertile offspring. So why don't we say there is one one species of giraffe in Africa, similar to dogs? Because, as far as we can tell, these different species NEVER reproduce with each other naturally. They all mind there own business, have their own territories and are all separate from each other, so we go ahead and say they are different species.</p>
<p>Similar exceptions can be found all over the world. And of course it gets much more complicated when we start trying to differentiate between single-cell organisms/bacteria/viruses especially are very odd and full of exceptions to our rules.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope this helps!</p>
<p>Speciation is the term you should do research on if you want more info. It's actually a very interesting area of evolution and is often overlooked!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an analogy. There is a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Color_gradient_illustrating_a_sorites_paradox_with_labels.png" target="_blank">color gradient</a> that starts green, then every pixel, becomes slightly more red. Between every 1, 2, or even 10 pixels, there is no noticable color change. However, if you look at the colors between 10,000 pixels, there is a change. So where is this &quot;line&quot; between green and red drawn? Well, you can't draw a line. There is no distinguishable boundary between the two colors.
Let's pretend that the green color is the predecessor to the horse, and the red a horse. Every pixel represents a generation. Each generation is essentially exactly alike to its offspring and its parents. Yet over time, there is change. </p>
<p>When talking about species, the term almost abitrary. Although horses and donkeys are considered different species, 100,000 years ago, they were the same. They would produce fertile offspring 100% of the time. Then 90,000 years ago, they were 90% likely to produce fertile offspring, so on and so forth. Even today, there is a small chance that a donkey and a horse can produce a fertile offspring. When is the line drawn? As you can see, it's is quite tough to categorize species, especially when looking at them in such a micro point of view. </p>
<p>tl dr there is no one clear &quot;line&quot; that separates 2 species. Instead, think of evolution as a gradient, where over hundreds or even thousands of generations there is change, but no clear cut single point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The mechanism underlying whether speciation (i.e., two populations of the same species are becoming separate species) is occurring is called &quot;gene flow&quot;.   </p>
<p>If there is adequate gene flow between two populations, the genetic structures of the populations are unlikely to diverge enough for them to speciate.</p>
<p>If gene flow is inadequate, then the genetic structure of each population starts accumulating their own unique mutations.   </p>
<p>Past a certain point it may be the case that mating between members of the two population <strong>can't</strong> produce viable offspring, but it can also be the case that hybrids are entirely viable but, under normal circumstances, the two populations simply <strong>don't</strong> interbreed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Richard Dawkins' <em>The Tyranny of the Discontinuous Mind</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a time machine could serve up to you your 200 million greats grandfather, you would eat him with sauce tartare and a slice of lemon. He was a fish. Yet you are connected to him by an unbroken line of intermediate ancestors, every one of whom belonged to the same species as its parents and its children.</p>
<p>“I’ve danced with a man who’s danced with a girl, who’s danced with the Prince of Wales”, as the song goes. I could mate with a woman, who could mate with a man, who could mate with a woman who . . . after a sufficient number of steps into the past . . . could mate with ancestral fish, and produce fertile offspring. To invoke our time machine again, you probably could not mate with Australopithecus (at least not produce fertile offspring) but you are connected to Australopithecus by an unbroken chain of intermediates who could interbreed with their neighbours in the chain every step of the way. And the chain goes on backwards, unbroken, to that Devonian fish and beyond. On the way, about six million years into the past, we would encounter the ancestor we share with modern chimpanzees. It so happens that the intermediates, like the common ancestor itself, are all extinct. But for that (perhaps fortunate) fact, we would be connected to modern chimpanzees by an unbroken chain of intermarrying links. Not just intermarrying but interbreeding – producing fertile offspring. There would be no clear separation between Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes. The only way to maintain our human-privileging laws and morals would be to set up courts to decide whether particular individuals could ‘pass for human’, like the ludicrous courts with which apartheid South Africa decided who could ‘pass for white’.</p>
<p>And of course the argument extends to any pair of species you care to name. But for the extinction of the intermediates which connect humans to the ancestor we share with pigs (it pursued its shrew-like existence 85 million years ago in the shadow of the dinosaurs), and but for the extinction of the intermediates that connect the same ancestor to modern pigs, there would be no clear separation between Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa. You could breed with X who could breed with Y who could breed with ( . . . fill in several thousand intermediates . . .) who could produce fertile offspring by mating with a sow.</p>
<p>Humans are clearly separable from chimpanzees and pigs and fish and lemons only because the intermediates that would otherwise link them in interbreeding chains happen to be extinct. This is not to deny that we are different from other species. We certainly are different and the differences are important – important enough to justify eating them (vegetables are our cousins too). But it is a reason for scepticism of any philosophy or theology (or morality or jurisprudence or politics) that treats humanness, or personhood, as some kind of essentialist absolute, which you either definitely have or definitely don’t have. If your theology tells you that humans should receive special respect and moral privilege as the only species that possesses a soul, you have to face up to the awkward question of when, in human evolution, the first ensouled baby was born. Was it when the first Homo sapiens baby was born to parents belonging to whatever species is considered to be our immediate predecessor (erectus, ergaster, heidelbergensis, rhodesiensis, no matter, the argument stands regardless)? There was no such baby! There never was a ‘first’ Homo sapiens. It is only the discontinuous mind that insists on drawing a hard and fast line between a species and the ancestral species that birthed it. Evolutionary change is gradual: there never was a line, never a line between any species and its evolutionary precursor.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of typical &quot;telomeres&quot; answers, but that's BS.  Your body can create eggs in which the telomeres are restored, allowing for a new human baby that can then continue to grow up normally. Thus, clearly a mechanism exists to correct the loss of telomeres (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase" target="_blank">telomerase</a>).  Further, research with rats has shown that disabling telomerase has little to no effect on the health or aging processes of rats for up to 6 generations.</p>
<p>The answer to your question is currently not well understood but appears to be related to the scientific field known as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">epigenetics</a>&quot;.  Epigenetics is the study of how gene expression changes over your lifetime and how these changes in expression can be handed down over generations.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this, why is it that every cell in your body has the same DNA and yet some cells grow up to be skin, others to be brain or muscle or liver?  Epigenetics! i.e. the selective expression of some genes over others.</p>
<p>The reason an egg can become a new human that doesn't possess the age of its parent is because the epigenetic markers of the parent are &quot;reset&quot; when the egg is produced.  This suggests that age is a process by which epigenetic changes accumulate over the life span of an organism.  These changes may be somewhat programmed to happen, but are also influenced by environment (e.g. toxins from smoking that reduce life span).  <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014821" target="_blank">In fact, your age can be &quot;guessed&quot; to within about +/- 5 years just by counting the number of epigenetic markers in your DNA.</a></p>
<p>So, to answer your question, the most likely cause of aging is that we are in fact programmed to do so.  We die because evolution wants us too.  Death is advantageous to life and so it is programmed into the very fabric of our being.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A new car you want to repair and replace as much as you can. As the car ages, it gets more expensive and time consuming to repair, and easier to just replace the whole thing.</p>
<p>Now consider that evolution is about what survives and prospers as a species. And consider the innumerable dangers that could destroy an organism. Nature has a few creatures that do effectively live forever, but as a general rule, replacing constantly works better, so that is what prospered and spread.</p>
<p>Also note your own body does the same thing. Rather than make cells that never die, it constantly removed and replaces cells. It's such a good system that some of your cells even self destruct or kill other cells to make this happen.</p>
<p>Further, note that replacement allows evolution to happen faster. The shorter a creature lives before procreation and the less it sticks around after, the more changes will happen.</p>
<p>Edit: to summarize, it's possible, but evolutionarily speaking, not desirable. Creatures actually moved away from that as time went on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lifespan is related to cancer. The body has a cellular clock that will tick down as the cells replicate (telomeres), providing a significant barrier to the development of cancer: if you grow out of control but don't surmount this mechanism, you will eventually die. New bodies are produced from a single cell (egg+sperm) that starts this clock all over again. If this cell is defunct in some way and doesn't replicate properly, it is basically just ejected and you try again. The loss of an embryo is not significant to the organism<br />
Brief edit: to clarify, the clock is deliberate, you trade likely dying from cancer at the ripe age of 4 for an eventual expiration date</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anything from ground service, to in flight food, how can an economic powerhouse like the US have such universally poor quality airlines? (Certainly I'm not talking about safety.)</p>
<p>I don't see any US-based carriers on this list of top airlines:</p>
<p>ANA All Nippon Airways</p>
<p>Asiana Airlines</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific Airways</p>
<p>Emirates</p>
<p>Etihad Airways</p>
<p>EVA Air</p>
<p>Garuda Indonesia</p>
<p>Hainan Airlines</p>
<p>Japan Airlines</p>
<p>Korean Air</p>
<p>Lufthansa</p>
<p>Qantas Airways</p>
<p>Qatar Airways</p>
<p>Singapore Airlines</p>
<p>Swiss</p>
<p>Thai Airways</p>
<p>Turkish Airlines</p>
<p>EDIT: I wanted to add 2 cents from Gary Leff:</p>
<p>&quot;What I desperately wish I could remember is which of these books it was where I read extensively on United Airlines President Pat Patterson. Patterson had been the Wells Fargo loan officer who authorized funding for Pacific Air Transport, later acquired by Boeing Air Transport, which was ultimate merged in with other carriers to become United Air Lines. Patterson moved over to Boeing and then to United, becoming General Manager and ultimately President of the airline.</p>
<p>While he’s perhaps best known for approving the hiring of in-flight nurses which morphed into onboard flight attendants, he’s also more than any other, the man who brought union control into the operation of the airline business. The version of the story I recall is that he believed that the unions were closer to their workers, and better understood their needs, than management was. It wasn’t just a matter of collective bargaining, but deeply held belief, that the workers would be better off (and that this would benefit the airline) if unions and union procedures handled scheduling.</p>
<p>I’m not a scholar in this area by any means, but the shift from company control over its employees to union control — and from management evaluation of employees to roles and responsibilities determined by seniority — has consequences which reverberate across the industry today.</p>
<p>Great flight attendants provide great service because they’re proud to do so, because they’re driven to do so, internally. In some ways the exceptional US flight attendant deserves much more praise because they are doing it on their own, when there is little if any benefit to them to do so. They aren’t going to lose their job as a result of occasionally grumpy and often lackluster service. They aren’t going to get paid more for going above and beyond for a customer. They do it because they’re internally driven and believe it’s the right thing to do. I truly thank them and honor them.</p>
<p>But as long as scheduling is done by seniority, and pay is doled out by route, and as long as commendations and criticisms are only ancillary to performance evaluations, pay, and perks, airlines aren’t going to be able to align the incentives of their frontline workforce to deliver outstanding service.</p>
<p>It isn’t all institutions, and it isn’t all culture, but the two of them combine so that superior companies drawing on service cultures and fostering those cultures can provide a superior experience. Mediocre companies drawing on a service culture will offer good and bad, just as companies here in the US without strong service institutions will occasionally offer flashes of brilliance (but often ‘good enough’). And in most cases I don’t expect either the cultures or the institutions to change very much.&quot;</p></div></div>

<p>To put some numbers to this, as of a couple years ago, American Airlines saw half of its revenue come from the 87% of its customers who flew the airline only once that year.

<p>That puts is two slots above China, which isn't exactly known for expensive prices. That's because in the US, a lot of people fly to and from work in coach. People generally want the cheapest flight possible, even if they end up with a bad experience.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, the Rosetta Stone played a huge role in deciphering hieroglyphics since it included translations in languages we already knew. But how could it be deciphered if we didn't have that kind of cheat sheet? </p>
<p>A fascinating example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B" target="_blank">Linear B</a>, a pre-Ancient Greek language discovered on stone tablets on the island of Crete. It was long assumed that it would be completely indecipherable without some sort of &quot;Rosetta stone&quot;, but we cracked the code in 1952, thanks to decades of study by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22782620" target="_blank">Alice Kober and Michael Ventris</a>.</p>
<p>The first breakthrough came after Kober diligently recorded the frequency and position of each symbol on the tablets (While this type of analysis is not hard to do with computers today, this took <em>years</em> of work for Kober). In doing so, she discovered many instances of the same groups of symbols, but with consistently different endings. Through this, she realized that Linear B was an inflected language with different endings based on usage, like verb endings in Latin and Spanish. </p>
<p>She also noted that there were about 200 unique symbols in total. Being an expert of many languages, she knew that this was too many characters to be alphabetic (each symbol representing a letter - English, for example), and too few to be logographic (each symbol representing a word, like Chinese). She surmised that each symbol in Linear B likely represented a syllable. </p>
<p>Now we have a clear understanding of what <em>type</em> of language Linear B was, but how do we determine what any of it means? This is where Ventris stepped up. </p>
<p>He theorized that these tablets likely had location names, and knew that location names often stayed similar over long periods of time. So he basically did <del>brute force</del> trial-and-error using the ancient Greek names for towns in Crete: What if a particular group of symbols are syllables that mean something like, &quot;ko-no-so&quot;, meaning the Cretian city of Knossos? After exploring this idea in countless ways, he eventually discovered a pattern that confirmed this: When he interpreted one particular set of symbols as &quot;ko-no-so&quot;, other symbols began to make sense. Slowly but surely, that first bit of translation led to him fully deciphering the entire language. </p>
<p>EDIT: As /u/QuarkMawp pointed out, brute force was not the correct term.</p>
<p>And since this has gotten some traction, if anybody is more interested in this and other sorts of amazing cryptography achievements throughout history, I highly recommend <a href="https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/" target="_blank">The Code Book</a> by Simon Singh. It covers a broad history of immense achievements in cryptography including Linear B, along with things like development of new codes in Renaissance Europe, cracking the Enigma Machine code in World War II, Navajo Wind Talkers and modern Public-Key Encryption. It's very informative and engaging, and also very accessible for the layperson. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why did the ¥ cross the road?</p>
<p>The ¥ we ate last night was good.</p>
<p>We had fried ¥.</p>
<p>The ¥s ran out of the coop.</p>
<p>The ¥ feathers were beige.</p>
<p>We can start narrowing in on what ¥ is because there are only certain things that can be filled in and make sense. In this case birds are really the only thing that work, in particular I started with chicken.</p>
<p>Sometimes we don't have an absolute answer but a close enough answer that can be used. As we see the symbols more we have more knowledge about what the symbol means.</p>
<p>It is actually the same way you learn new words, the context eventually reveals the information, and as you hear the word more often you can fix any mistakes you've made in the meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm going to give an example that I leaned about when I took a class on reading hieroglyphs in college; unfortunately, the details have faded a little.   </p>
<p>Back in the 50s or 60s, egyptologists thought they had the translations down. Then, one discovered a pattern in verbs that indicated a whole tense no one had noticed before. This tense looked very much like present tense, but was subtly different. They had to go back and re translate practically every thing. The fundamental meanings didn't change a whole lot, but the subtleties did. I think this new tense is called &quot;second tense&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides inferring from translations, there is also some help in errors that have been made by the people who wrote in hieroglyphs. Because when you make an error with language, it's not random but rather reflects the system of the language. So if you find a phrase that is repeated in many places, but in one place there's a mistake in it, you can look how it differs and thus get a better idea about the phrase. It's a bit hard to imagine, but one example is Latin pronunciation - a writer might confuse I with E because the sounds are pretty close, but he won't ever confuse I with X because they're very far apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Two language can be very similar and mutually easily intelligible but if there are two governments that have the authority to say they are different languages, then they're considered two different languages. As I have been told is the case with Serbian and Croatian (I don't speak either so I'm just going by what I was told by someone who lived in the area). On the other hand, there's Arabic. I'm told that what is spoken in Lebanon is so different from what is spoken in Saudi Arabia that they're not mutually intelligible... but they're both considered to be Arabic because there's a purposefulness to keep calling them the same language. Yet at the same time these are all different countries so there's no cohesive movement to pick a standard version of the language so the different regions start speaking the same version. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is true for Northern and Southern Italian, French from different regions, and Chinese especially. Just because you speak one of them, doesn't mean you'll understand all of them.

<p>That's not quite right.  You have 14.7 psi pressing on <em>all</em> surfaces -- the top of your head, the bottom of your feet, your stomach back and sides -- at the same time.  It's not a directional &quot;from the top&quot; pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air pressure does not press down.  It presses in.</p>
<p>When you're standing up the top of your head has 14.7 PSI pushing down on it, while the front of your body has 14.7 PSI pushing you back and the back of your body has 14.7 PSI pushing you forward.  Some air even gets under your shoes, so you have 14.7 PSI pushing you up (if you prevented air from being under your shoes then you could remove this force; that's what a suction cup attempts to do).</p>
<p>When you sum up all of those forces you wind up with essentially zero net force on your body.  If you throw a pile of calculus at the problem you come up with the fact that it doesn't matter what shape an object is:  if it's facing the same pressure on all surfaces then the net force will be zero.</p>
<p>In fact, you can take things a step further and consider what happens if the pressure changes with height.  In this case the force on your back nicely cancels with the force on your front, but the force on your head is less than the force pushing up on your feet.  If you throw a similarly sized pile of calculus at this problem you come up with Archimedes' principle:  the net force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Think about it: if it only pushed <em>down</em>, then how could you possibly keep yourself off the ground? If you were lying on the ground, that's one thing, but what if you just stick your arm straight out from your body? That's almost 15psi, right? <em>Hundreds</em> of pounds of force. No way you could possibly support that weight if it was all pushing in one direction.</p>
<p>But, fortunately for us, it pushes <em>up</em> just as much as it pushes down. The air under your arms acts to counteract the air above your arms. So you don't feel that weight at all. And if you're touching the ground, sitting on a chair, etc., you've got the pressure of that solid surface to counteract air pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Read this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/11/cancers-invasion-equation/amp" target="_blank">Cancer's Invasion Equation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>which was covered in this reddit post:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/72itrn/cancers_invasion_equation/" target="_blank">Cancer's Invasion Equation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>According to the article, even when a human has a few tumors which are stable there may already be metastatic cancer cells detectable in their blood - i.e. the tumors are shedding that.  Yet in many patients these do not cause additional tumors (i.e. there is no rampant metastatis or spread/re-seeding in another place of the cancer cells etc.).  This is contrary to the layman understanding of tumors and cancers - where just having <strong>any</strong> cancer cells shedding from the tumor are seen as being potential metastasis agents - i.e. almost like every such cancer cell that is loose in the bloodstream can lodge somewhere and create another tumor.  But this article suggests the reality is something different - i.e. actually cancer cells are being shed all the time, and don't necessarily create new tumors.  And when they do create tumors, they tend to favor certain organs more.  The idea being suggested is that actually humans may have a pretty robust system working <strong>against</strong> cancer all the time - it's just when that fails that you find metastatis taking place.  Again I am not an expert to comment on these things - that is just my reading of what the article seems to be suggesting.  But this idea that cancer cells are being shed by tumors all the time - is scary.  But then the idea that despite that constant barrage, new tumors happen only in certain special conditions - is heartening.  Because it suggests cancer cells do not hold all the cards - there are other factors (i.e. the &quot;soil&quot; or conditions in the patient's body - which may depend on immune system, as well as organ to organ variation in how welcoming the conditions are for cancer cells to lodge and grow into tumors in that location).</p>
<p>This suggests that it may be possible that in cancer patients, and possibly even in non-cancer patients (or undetected cancer humans) there may already be metastatic cancer cells running around in their blood.  Except those cancer cells are not taking root elsewhere.  This is what the article discusses - the idea of looking at cancer not just from the point of view of the cancer cell, but from point of view of the &quot;soil&quot; i.e. what causes already-prolific cancer cells to NOT take root (example being patients with a few stable tumors who are shedding cancer cells, but they are not taking root beyond a few places).</p>
<p>If this view of cancer is correct - it could mean blood transfusions from even a presumed non-cancer patient could be dangerous.  And it is dangerous for sure when that donation is taken from a known cancer patient - because even though they are cured i.e. their existant cancer cells are not taking root, they might do so in another patient.</p>
<p>They give the example of cancer patients who have gone in to remission and seem to be long-term cured - yet when their organ was donated to someone else - that recipient developed aggressive cancer.  The idea being that for some reason in the donor the immune system or &quot;soil&quot; so to speak had become hostile or conditions were not right for cancer cells to prosper as tumors.  But in another patient (i.e. different &quot;soil&quot; - using that analogy again) - those same cancer cells may find a more supportive environment for those cancer cells to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I go on, there are a few little things that make a big difference. Plastic is the cheapest. Glass is the most expensive. Cans are effective and still relatively cheap, and flavor issues aren't much of a concern as there's a small coating of plastic inside the can. Cans and glass bottles can also hold carbonation much more easily, hence why they're more likely to be the choice for beer and pop.</p>
<p>Beer: cans and glass bottles don't 'leak' oxygen through the walls, which spoils the beer. Bottles are usually heavily tinted and cans block all light which helps keep it from degrading, as some wavelengths of light break down flavors in the beer and make it taste pretty gross. </p>
<p>Pop: Cans, glass, and plastic. almost anything goes because they are sterile already and don't have to worry about the flavors spoiling like beer. Cans are relatively compact and fairly durable, but more expensive than plastic bottles, and glass bottles can help preserve the taste more, since cans have a thin plastic coating on the inside to prevent the aluminum from altering the taste. Glass bottles are the most expensive and most people don't notice or don't care enough to spend twice as much on a bottle of pop. </p>
<p>Water: Water, well, water. It doesn't have the flavors to worry about, so the cheapest option is chosen: plastic bottles. By using only one kind of bottle they can also further reduce the cost because the economies of scale are a beautiful thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Aluminum cans could be used for water, but a bit of the aluminum does dissolve into the drink. Sodas typically have enough other flavorants that you don't notice the aluminum taste, but it would make plain water taste unpleasantly metallic.

On the treadmill, the males expended 520.6 ± 27.6 kJ for 1600 m; this was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than the energy expenditure by the females (441.1 ± 25.6 kJ). For the walk, the males expended 370.4 ± 17.7 kJ, and the females expended 309.6 ± 17.2 kJ for 1600 m (P &lt; 0.05 between genders). When energy expenditure was adjusted for fat-free mass, the gender effect disappeared, but running exercise still required more energy than walking (P &lt; 0.01; Fig. 1b).</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a u-shaped sort of curve for walking. It's more biomechanically efficient at slower speeds (becoming less efficient at very low speeds as basal metabolism becomes significant given the amount of time). <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Calories_burned_running_and_walking" target="_blank">This</a> has a whole bunch of info, and takes slope into account. Pretty cool. According to their data, a 14 min/mile is roughly the crossover point where running starts to be more efficient, but that depends on the person a bit (different sized legs).</p>
<p>Any running motion is pretty much steady-state as far as energy expenditure/distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exercise physiologist here.</p>
<p>I wish a couple physicists had chimed in on this... fundamentally, It takes the same amount of energy to move an object of given mass and volume a known distance through a constant medium, irrespective of time. However, running and walking are biomechanically different. Your mechanical efficiency is lower with running and therefore you'll 'burn' slightly more calories. Running is basically controlled, rhythmic, leaps forward thus more vertical work is being done to move the known object (you) forward. In addition, the higher heart rate will also increase your caloric consumption since the heart is a muscle and it needs energy too; I do not know if it is detectable by current measurement techniques within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Where I think this question  arises as I've  received it in the past: Not all treadmills are created equal and the estimation equation for calorie consumption per distance/incline travelled may not account for differences between the mechanical efficiency of running or walking. </p>
<p>TL,DR: run the distance, yields less time and increased calories consumed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My own conclusion was that even IF a 10 minute run burned the same amount of calories as a 20 minute walk, it still leaves me 10 more minutes of other <em>potential</em> exercise during my time allocated to working out - which is where I determined that the potential is there to burn more calories regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
