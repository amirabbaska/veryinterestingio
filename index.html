		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now artificial wombs aren't anywhere close to being a reality. Organizations that do want to clone endangered or extinct animals at this point need to use closely related species as the artificial womb. For instance the people working to clone mammoths will use an Asian or African elephant as a surrogate mother, that is one of the reasons they are considered clone-able. But for other animals like the Steller's Sea Cow or the giant sloth cloning is not considered an option yet because there are no closely related species that are large enough to be the clone's surrogate.  You can read about specific criteria and species at this website. </p>
<p><a href="http://reviverestore.org/species/" target="_blank">http://reviverestore.org/species/</a></p>
<p>EDIT- as far as the giant panda goes, you could hypothetically set up some IVF program with their closest relatives, the Spectacled Bear.  They could be birthed from Spectacled Bears and potentially nursed by them, or there may be some kind of hormone therapy you could give pandas that would cause them to lactate so the tiny pandas could be weened by their own kind/on their own milk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't understand enough of what happens during development to be anywhere close to making artificial wombs a reality. DNA isn't everything, and early development plays a huge role in determining how animals will turn out. Genes are turned on and off (and up and down), sometimes permanently, as a result of conditions in utero.</p>
<p>In humans, we know that conditions experienced by a grandparent can impact disease risk and mortality through a process known as transgenerational epigenetics. We also know that this process is really complicated.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Överkalix_study" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Överkalix_study</a></p>
<p>RadioLab did a nice treatment of this recently, discussing how human embryos will only develop in the laboratory up to a certain (early) stage, and then die. Scientists have recently been able to extend this period, but not by much, and we don't really know what the barrier is.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/primitive-streak/" target="_blank">http://www.radiolab.org/story/primitive-streak/</a>
<a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/251876-inheritance/" target="_blank">http://www.radiolab.org/story/251876-inheritance/</a>
(Bonus RadioLab including the grandparent story.)</p>
<p>So, a major part of why artificial wombs won't save endangered species is that they aren't likely to exist for a very long time, if ever. Turns out DNA sequence is only part of the picture - you need just the right developmental conditions to get that DNA to make that endangered individual, and right now, a real mother* is the only way to get that.</p>
<p>*Can possibly be a mother from a very closely related species, but still: you need the real deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leaving physiology aside because I know very little about it, artificial wombs may aid in stabilizing a small captive population but I feel wouldn't play a very large role is saving a species as a whole. I think that there are a couple of things that limit the success of a captive breeding program more so than just getting the numbers up but I am definitely not an expert and would love to talk more about them if someone disagrees.</p>
<p>First I think that creating more individuals without understanding the reasoning why the mating behavior isn't being expressed would be synonymous to treating a symptom of a symptom instead of working towards the actual cure. I don't know much about the panda example but I do know another one where numbers were low (can't remember the animal, I'll edit later) because female preference was low for males below a certain body-mass. which all of their males were. Understanding more about what these animals are all about is part of why we want to keep them around and so I think working with the animal's instincts should be a top priority. Not only preserving the physical animal but also that animal's behavioral culture.</p>
<p>The other issue I have is that I am picturing an animal raised in an artificial womb being raised either in non-ideal groupings or by humans. We already know the importance of avoiding human imprinting and the people running the best programs put a lot of work into doing that (see Whooping Crane). An artificial womb I feel would increase that risk and brings up more questions like: If the animal is raised in a lab environment will it be lacking in information that would be otherwise be passed down by herd-mates or parents? Can the animal survive as well once it is time to be released without that information. </p>
<p>I guess the key things that make me skeptical after all that rambling are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>could the effort be better spent on addressing the 'why' behind the lack of breeding success (or the 'why' of it's endangered status)</p>
</li>
<li>is the risk to the animal's social knowledge worth the increase in the animal's physical numbers</li>

activity. <em>Research Quarterly</em>, 45, 93-103. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, from what I can gather, this scale simply is a measure of the degree to which respondents rate themselves as physically fit and &quot;attracted to&quot; physical fitness activities, so it's not surprising that this would be a fairly good predictor of getting through a physically tough challenge like Navy Special Operations training.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Citrus clones are interesting in this regard. Most citrus, especially culinary types, are closely related. Being highly self-fertile, it would be relatively easy to make a land race that looked and tasted the same; as opposed to apples, which for uniformity sake, a cultivar is much more practical.</p>
<p>However, citrus often take a long time to first fruit when propagated from seed. Often a decade or more. When citrus grafts are used the graft is part of a tree much older than the root stock, and has already matured to first fruit. This means the grafted trees start bearing fruit in one to three years, opposed to one to three decades.</p>
<p>Another interesting clonal plant that humans use is the German iris. The root, known as Orris root is used in perfumes and artificial fruit flavors like grape and raspberry. Some cultivars of it, that are still grown commercially today in Europe, are thousands of years old and go back to Roman empire and ancient Greek times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The sound is produced by the air escaping from between the palms as they come rapidly together. It's like a little explosion.</p>
<p>You'll notice you can clap very softly with your fingers, but the loudest  clap is palm to palm. The palms are slightly cupped, and the compression of these two cup shapes together encloses a larger volume of air, which then has to explode out of the space as the clap progresses.</p>
<p>If you clasp your hands palm to palm and then squeeze, you can hear the air coming out. Clapping is like that, but faster, so the sound is more explosive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Inside your ear is a very fragile part (that you mustn't touch because it would hurt), and the way you hear is by that thing getting shaken by the air touching it.  Just like how your hand can feel something doing big slow shakes against it, your eardrum can feel the tiny fast shaking in the air.  Sound can even go through other things that are solid or liquid, because they can shake the same way, some of them even better than air (I had her put her ear to a picnic table while I knocked on it).  This is how you can hear underwater, even with no air inside your ears. </p>
<p>This might all be pitched a little young for a 6-year-old, but it seemed to be an acceptable explanation when I tried it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance" target="_blank">Helmholtz Resonance</a>. This is basically where there is a low pressure area outside your car because the air is moving relative to the car which, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli's_principle" target="_blank">Bernoulli's Principle</a>, lowers fluid pressure. The air in your car wants to equalize with the lower pressure outside your car, so it gets pushed out. By the time the pressures have equalized, the air is still moving out due to its inertia, so extra air gets out. This creates a low pressure zone in your car and the reverse happens. It flows into the car, but too much flows in, leaving another high pressure zone in the car, and the cycle repeats. This oscillating high and low pressure happens tens of times per second, which we perceive as sound.</p>
<p>Side note: u/fyrillin could be on to something with the bluff body vortex shedding. However, the reason I think he could be wrong is that I get this effect when only my sun roof is open. How could there be a winning side and a losing side if there is only one hole? It is similar to blowing on a bottle and making a noise, which is confirmed to use Helmholtz Resonance.</p>
<p>Edit: I mixed up where the high and low pressure zones start. Fixed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's starts splashing and pulsing as it comes out.  The reason this happens is for the same reason your car &quot;flutters&quot; when you have only one window open.  </p>
<p>The air only has one hole to go in and out of. So as air leaves, it creates a slightly lower pressure in the car which wants to pull air back in now to equalize. But it has to go through the same hole, and it can't be doing both simultaneously. So this switching back and forth between exiting and entering air creates the flutter sound you hear. </p>
<p>If you crack a second window, the air will have multiple entry and exit points and you will not hear the flutter :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you roll them down, air still slips past them, but the air moving past the open window creates a Venturi effect.  This drops the pressure in the cabin very quickly.  As soon as the pressure drops below a certain point, the Venturi effect breaks for a second and a slug of air gets drawn into the cabin.  The sudden increase in pressure reestablishes the Venturi effect, drawing air BACK out of the car.  This is cyclical and happens very rapidly. </p>

You generally see radioactivity in heavy atoms because they're pretty unstable due to the relative weakness (weak in the sense that they do not work as well as they do in lighter nuclei, they're still mathematically the same amount) of the nuclear forces in it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like there exists the periodic table, which is based on proton number and the way electron shells are filled, so too is there a &quot;nuclear periodic table&quot;.</p>
<p>Although it is the number of protons in the nucleus that determine the element, the number of neutrons in the nucleus determines the isotopes possible. </p>
<p>To clarify, hopefully you've heard of carbon ¹⁴ and carbon dating? If not, my explanation may not be general enough. Carbon is defined by having 6 protons. However it can have 6, 7, or 8 neutrons (possibly more, possibly not; you can't keep adding neutrons infinitely).</p>
<p>Those are isotopes of carbon. They are chemically the same (basically) but have different atomic weights (protons + neutrons). In addition, adding those extra neutrons can cause nuclear instability. Not every isotope is radioactive. </p>
<p>There's a reason why carbon ¹² is the most common carbon atom. 6 protons and 6 neutrons is the most stable configuration for a 6 proton nucleus. Plus, when radioactive atoms decay, they almost always (always?) change into a different atom. That's because the decay occurs via the degradation of a neutron into a proton + another particle and/or energy (photon).</p>
<p>To take an extreme example, there are elements natural and artificially made (either in a lab or in extreme astronomic cases) whose nuclei are so unstable they last on the order of milli or nano or pico seconds. They naturally release a lot of radioactive energy because the atoms decay spontaneously almost simultaneously. </p>
<p>If you study a chart of nuclear stabilities (the combination of protons and neutrons that are way more stable than other combinations) you start to notice certain &quot;sweet spots&quot;. Certain combinations of P's and N's are way more stable than others. Then the abundances of elements and their radioactive siblings starts to become more apparent. </p>
<p>It's harder to get a real stable nuclear configuration to accept another neutron (or proton, but that's even harder because of its positive charge) simply because the nucleus would be going from a low energy/stable state to a higher one. </p>
<p>Google nuclear number and stability of nuclei and see if that information helps you understand better. </p>
<p>Hopefully my explanation wasn't too scattered (pun intended) and clumsy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, any particle physics reaction that <em>can</em> happen has some probability of happening. The more &quot;extra&quot; energy in the resulting reaction the higher the probability of it happening, so it'll happen with a faster rate.</p>
<p>The reason familiar particles like electrons and protons are stable is because they are &quot;locked in&quot; to their current state due to some conserved quantity, such as electric charge, etc. There is no lighter stable particle than the electron that is charged so the electron is stable because it's stuck with that charge. A heavier cousin to the electron is the muon. It can shed its conserved properties into other, lighter particles easily, it can transfer its &quot;muon-ness&quot; (which is conserved) to a muon-neutrino that weighs almost nothing, it can transfer its charge to an electron, and it can avoid breaking &quot;electron-ness&quot; conservation by creating an anti-electron-neutrino. That handful of particles shares all the same conserved quantities as the muon, but with a fraction of the rest-mass, so a muon decaying into those particles would leave a lot of excess energy. For that reason the probability of that reaction is high, and the rate is high, muons only have a lifetime of microseconds.</p>
<p>Similarly, protons are stable because of baryon number conservation and charge conservation. However, free neutrons are not stable because the collection of proton + electron + anti-electron-neutrino has less total mass (energy) than the neutron. Inside of a nucleus protons and neutrons exist in energy levels so a proton or neutron can only decay into the other if there's also enough energy left to raise the resulting particle into a free energy level. Which is why even though free neutrons are not stable some nuclei can be. For example, in Deuterium the neutron can't decay into a proton because the lowest energy state for a proton is already occupied and there's not enough extra mass/energy available (between the mass of the Deuteron and the total mass of the resulting particles from a hypothetical decay of the neutron to a proton) to push the new proton into the next available energy level.</p>
<p>However, in different nuclei there can be enough extra mass/energy available to allow for some sort of reaction. Such as a proton turning into a neutron (emitting an electron / beta particle); a neutron turning into a proton (emitting a positron); ejecting a part of the nucleus such as a proton, neutron, or alpha particle; a re-arrangement into a lower energy configuration without emitting any particles but leaving excess energy which is radiated as gamma rays; or the nucleus splitting into pieces (fissioning), sometimes releasing additional protons or neutrons in the process. If any of these reactions due to a nucleus having a viable decay path emits some particle or photon which has enough energy to ionize an atom then it is called ionizing radiation. It's this radiation which is capable of breaking atomic bonds inside the human body, which if it happens in sufficient quantity can disrupt some of our delicate and intricate cellular machinery on a wide enough scale to cause bodily harm, even death.</p>
<p>Different types of radiation (beta, alpha, gamma, protons, neutrons, positrons, etc.) release particles with different amounts of energy, which affects the relative &quot;strength&quot; of the isotopic decays as a radiation source. However, an even more important factor is decay rate, which is tied to half-life. Half-life is just a different way to express a proportional, continuous decay rate. The more there is of something the more of it will decay, but proportionally the same relative amount will decay over a given period, it's just more convenient to use time units related to half-life because it makes mental math easier. You could, for example, talk about the interest rate on a mortgage in terms of &quot;doubling time&quot; instead of APR. Anyway, the shorter the half-life of an isotope the faster its rate of decay, meaning also that the intensity of radiation emitted from a given sample will be higher. That's why you can hold a sample of natural Uranium (half-life of billions of years) in your bare hand without particularly worrying about it whereas if you did the same thing with Cobalt-60 (half-life of about 5 years) you are going to have a bad time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<pre><code>10 / 1 = 10</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by 1 gives us the same number</p>
<pre><code>10 / 0.5 = 20</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by a half doubles the number</p>

<p>Dividing by a quarter quadruples the number.</p>
<p>So, the smaller the number we divide by, the bigger the result. This suggest that dividing by 0 should give us infinite.</p>
<p>However, let us look at it from the other end of the number line:</p>
<pre><code>10 / -2 = -5</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by -2 gives us minus a half</p>
<pre><code>10 / -1 = 10</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by -1 gives us the same number, only negative</p>
<pre><code>10 / -0.5 = -20</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by a half doubles the number, only negative</p>
<pre><code>10 / -0.25 = -40</code></pre>
<p>Dividing by a quarter quadruples the number, only negative.</p>
<p>So the closer we move to zero from the negative direction, the closer the result moves towards minus infinite.</p>
<p>This suggest that dividing by 0 should result in minus infinite.</p>

<p>Let's have a*b=c</p>
<p>Let's define division as a slight reordering of this into

<p>So 0/0 is not undefined but indeterminate. This distinction is important because the number itself IS defined, but cannot be determined as it has an infinite number of valid solutions.</p>
<p>To see this, let's try plugging in 0 for c and b (to give us our 0/0) and rearrange it into our first equation
a*0=0</p>
<p>Well shoot, that's true no matter what value we put in for a. This is why it's indeterminate.</p>
<p>Now let's try division by zero where the numerator isn't 0. Let's try c=1 and b=0
a*0=1</p>
<p>Well as we can see, we run into a problem. What value of a can possibly make this true?</p>
<p>None of them can. There is no value of a that can ever be multiplied by zero to give us an answer of anything BUT zero.</p>
<p>Using <em>this specific definition of division</em>, it's easy to see why division by zero is undefined. There IS a way to give division by zero a definition but that starts going into beginnings of calculus :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically what I'm asking is why bother having so many different strong opiates if they all have very, very similar profiles? </p>
<p>Besides duration, and the ceiling of the painkilling effects (i.e. codeine vs. morphine), the differences are very slight between these drugs. In fact I believe only morphine makes the WHO's list of essential medicines for a healthcare system. Why bother stocking all the rest? </p>
<p>Edit:To add to this, I'm mostly interested in what, if any, implications the often slight alterations in morphine's analogues have that make them more desirable than morphine itself. Primarily I'm interested in how these small changes effect a drug's structure-activity relationship. Opiates are really just an ideal example I picked, if you know something regarding this in other kinds of drugs, that's also of help.</p>
<p>I am aware of the following points: Pharma pressures doctors to use new but not very innovative products, and that doctors like to rotate a person's pain medication to reduce tolerance effects.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are some differences within the group of opiods/opiates, you are right to question the clinical value of them.</p>
<p>Oxycodon may have a better metabolism (morphine has active metabolites and is more reliant on kidney function) and a more predictable bioavailability. </p>
<p>In some surgical protocols you want a very short half-life (you might have continuous administration) which makes remifentanils pharmacological properties beneficial.</p>
<p>There are some opiods that have secondary effects, suchs as tramadol and tapentadol (monoaminergic reuptake inhibition).</p>
<p>There might also be a difference in documentation, for instance a pharmaceutical company might have been more willing to perform a study on a &quot;new condition&quot; using drugs that they still own - and we are more willing to use drugs with good studies backing them up. </p>
<p>A very down to earth reason is that daily dosages of morphine in the 400 mg range <del>i.v.</del>parenterally (with extra doses around 70 mg) evokes more worry than 80 mg of hydromorphone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of these answers are somewhat incomplete. There are many reasons for there to be different opioid medications, including differential receptor activity, differential patient effect, differential route suitability, and intent. There are many reasons to have a variety of pain medications, particularly because these pain medications constitute different classes within what could be termed the opioid family. The classes would be phenanthrenes, phenylheptylamines, and phenylpiperidines. </p>
<p>These are basically ways to describe the structures of the pain medication, and these structures are important- it means differential effects on opioid receptors and different effects on different people. If a person is allergic to morphine, they might not have an allergy to oxycodone, fentanyl, or dilaudid. If a person has intractable vomiting with oxycodone, changing them to hydrocodone or oral dilaudid might alleviate the symptoms. You mention medications like buprenorphine- this is a partial agonist at opioid receptors, and thus acts to prevent opioid abuse by reducing the activity of illicit substances at these receptors- by partially activating it prevents full activation. </p>
<p>Opioids have many side effects due to their receptor activity, most famous among them is probably constipation. Consider that one drive to create new opioid medications is to attempt to eliminate the constipating effect of opioids, given the morbidity associated. The receptor activity can also include non-opioid receptors, like the NMDA receptor. Ketamine is probably the best known NMDA receptor antagonist, but methadone has both opioid agonist effects and NMDA receptor antagonist effects. Both ketamine and methadone can be very useful in management of chronic pain (ketamine generally restricted to inpatient use), particularly after major surgical procedures. </p>
<p>The ability to use a medication via various routes is also a rationale to develop new medications. Transitioning from one medication to another (IV to oral medication, for example) can be problematic given the differential effect that individual medications can have on an individual patient- consider that oxycodone is not available in IV formulation in the US, so there is a level of guesswork involved. Additionally, I see some comments are listing oral vs. IV tmax (time to maximum concentration) as leading to different medications- this is primarily related to the route, not the medication. </p>
<p>With regard to intent, opioids used for surgical anesthesia can be very different from those used for postoperative pain management or outpatient pain management. Remifentanil is an extremely useful medication allowing for saturation of opioid receptors at one moment and near absence of the drug 20 minutes later. This is EXTREMELY useful, especially as the half life stays constant regardless of how long the medication is infusing- with other narcotics, the context sensitive half time grows longer and longer- for example a 1 hr case with a fentanyl infusion might take 25 minutes for a half life, a 2 hr case might take 2 hrs. Remifentanil is always around 4 minutes, 1 hr case or 10 hr. For cases where extubation is predicted but blood pressure must be tightly controlled/the surgery is extremely stimulating, this is very useful. </p>
<p>I also notice in the comments many people are bringing this back to opioid overprescription- understand that in the 90s and early 2000s many people thought that we have the opposite issue- in 2002 JCAHO (the joint commission) released information on how to improve pain control and mandated that hospitals have comprehensive pain treatment strategies (they now emphasize NON-pharmacologic). Now, Medicare and Medicaid utilize a survey (HCAHPS) that uses, in part, how well a patient's pain was treated to dictate what physicians and hospitals are reimbursed. It's very popular to blame physicians as a whole for overprescription of pain medications, and in many cases very reasonable, but additional attention must be paid to the societal factors influencing prescription trends. Opioids are useful short term agents, and certainly reasonable in the case of chronic cancer related pain, but that is typically where their utility ends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have said: the various opioid analgesics actually have quite different pharmacokinetics, metabolism, side effects, etc. and are available in different preparations and combinations with other drugs. Of course, some drug choice is based on habit and physician comfort level, in particular outpatient pain management by PCPs is more art and less science, but most choices are based on each drug's unique properties. If morphine was perfect in all situations, why would Pharma have spent the money to synthesize new opioids?</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>-The dosing of morphine is easy, as 10 mg IV is the dose which all other opioid doses are compared to, so many providers default to this in acute situations.</p>
<p>-Morphine can cause vasodilation (and subsequent hypotension) which can be quite a problem in hemodynamically unstable patients, making fentanyl and other similar drugs a much safer choice.</p>
<p>-Morphine relies on renal clearance to a high degree. Other commonly used mid-range PO meds like oxycodone, Percocet, Norco, and Dilaudid are hepatically cleared. This makes them more user-friendly in the inpatient setting where everyone seems to have something wrong with their kidneys: diabetic nephropathy, contrast-induced nephropathy (from getting CT scans with IV contrast), prerenal AKI (kidney injury due to a period of reduced perfusion- usually from hypotension), etc. This is a big reason why these drugs are the inpatient default. However in patients with liver disease the opposite is true.</p>
<p>-Fentanyl and similar drugs such as sufentanil and remifentanil are much more lipid soluble than morphine which make the onset of action quicker due to ease of crossing cell membranes. They also have very short half lives. This makes them ideal for procedural sedation. The patient goes to sleep right away, the medication is dosed periodically to maintain the desired depth of sedation, and they wake up quickly when the procedure is over. Anesthesia is a very calculation based practice and every drug choice is deliberate.</p>
<p>-Fentanyl is not available as a PO formulation. The half life is too short for it to make any sense as a home PO pain med because nobody wants to take a pill every half hour. However it does come in LONG acting transdermal patch form, which is unique, and nasal sprays which are nice for kids as another poster noted.</p>
<p>-Oxycodone has a higher bioavailability (60-85%) than morphine (20-40% per wikipedia) when taken PO due to morphine's first pass metabolism, so it almost feels wasteful to prescribe PO morphine.</p>
<p>-Some PO opioids like Percocet, Norco, and Vicodin also contain acetaminophen for additional pain control via a different mechanism. However, this limits the max dose due to the hepatic toxicity of acetaminophen at fairly low doses.</p>
<p>-OxyContin and MS-Contin are formulated to be long-acting so they can be dosed q12h rather than q4-6h which makes them ideal for home treatment of chronic, predictable pain but not good for first-time treatment of acute pain.</p>
<p>-With regard to meds used in PCA pumps, dilaudid is more water soluble than morphine and therefore can be delivered in a smaller volume of water, which becomes important in fluid overloaded patients.</p>
<p>-Methadone is only used for pain in opioid tolerant patients. I'm not entirely sure why, but it does have a very long duration of action which is not what you want in an acute pain control setting but makes it ideal for daily dosing to prevent withdrawal in recovering addicts.</p>
<p>-Speaking of addiction recovery, buprenophine aka Suboxone is everyone's new favorite drug. It is a combination agonist-antagonist. The receptors are only partially stimulated by it's binding, so the user doesn't get much of a high but it still prevents withdrawal. However, the medication has a high affinity for the receptor, so it will block the binding of other opiates should the user relapse.</p>
<p>-Demerol used to be very frequently used, but has fallen out of favor due to its production of a neurotoxic metabolite and its potential to contribute to serotonin syndrome (Libby Zion anyone?)</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just scratching the surface of the pharmacology, but hopefully gives you an idea of the thought process that goes on in a hospital. Hope this answers your question!</p>
<p>edit: Sorry for the wall of text!</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Different drugs are mostly used for different reasons. Big Pharma has less influence than you think, and most docs prescribe generics when available.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use a variety of opioids in treating post-op patients. Fentanyl is great at taking the white knuckles edge off for a minute so I can get other drugs on board to carry the patient through until they have a block, epidural, Pca or at least oral meds in to serve as a longer acting solution.
Some drugs I avoid specifically depending on the case. dilaudid causes urinary retention- so I never go there for open ab or gyn cases, since monitoring urinary output is key in their recovery.
Fentanyl is a great resp suppressant, so I don't touch it if I have a resp compromised case. But in a case where fluid status is closely monitored? Fentanyl delivers in much smaller volume than other narcs.
For peds good old oralTylenol and morphine IV are the standard. Some will prescribe fentanyl IV, some loratab elixir, depending on the kiddo.
Really, they could all be replaced by morphine in a pinch, but when considering pt status, and other drugs being used, it is helpful to be able to select one drug over another to obtain pain management while avoiding some side effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your skin has a lot of surface area, and sweat acts as a medium that cools when in contact with (usually cooler) air.  Producing more sweat covers more surface area of the body, and therefore becomes more efficient at cooling.  Individuals who are physically fit typically produce sweat because their bodies need to cool more efficiently.  This doesn't exclude individuals who are overweight, however, because moving a lot of mass - whether it be muscle or fat - requires a lot of energy expenditure, produces heat, and requires more efficient cooling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what's already been explained, I'll just pitch in a bit of anecdotal explanation:  </p>
<p>Mother's been in the nail industry for over a decade and owned her own salon for two years, I myself have been involved at the front/in business management for about five years.  </p>
<p>Despite her college education in Korea, her foreign degree amounted to essentially nothing at the time we arrived in the US (2000s). With few roots in the country and therefore almost no connections to get her a stable job, she stumbled upon the nail industry via a fellow church member (Korean churches and other similar monocultural institutions are invaluable resources for new immigrants in the US). The work was relatively easy, obtaining licenses wasn't too difficult (plus she could work unlicensed and learn in a real-time environment), and there were tons of other fellow Koreans in a similar situation, meaning she had coworkers she could communicate clearly with and learn from quickly.  </p>
<p>Time goes on, she gets better at the work and becomes fully licensed with lots of experience, climbs up to a managerial position but still works just as much as other employees. Work starts to get harder, more stressful with managing employees and the inevitable side-eye/dislike that comes with being a boss of sorts. </p>
<p>She gets tired of the talking behind her back and finds herself starting to disagree with the owner, decides that starting her own business may be the best option for herself (to rest her deteriorating wrist because of work and get away from the whole gossip drama thing).  </p>
<p>Buys a pre-existing nail salon from Chinese owners, sets up shop.  </p>
<p>A commenter in here was asking why Asian immigrants seem to be more disposed to this work than others, and as another commenter explained, it seems to be purely because of tradition/a long-established status quo. I have seen a number of black-owned/employed shops and white-owned/employed shops, but they're often associated with higher/lower costs/quality. Guess Asians are just the standard given their long history in the industry?  </p>
<p>Also want to add that because so many salons are Asian, so are salon supply stores -- stronger communication/language compatibility between supply store and salon means possibly better prices and service, so this may deter some non-Asians from utilizing the often cheaper supply stores, raising their costs and so on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So the owners of Korean or Vietnamese owned nail salons will help their friends and family to open more nail salons, South Asian/Middle Eastern bodega owners and taxi drivers will help their friends and family to open more bodegas, or buy more taxis. </p>
<p>Many industries within a city, state or region will become dominated by a single or a few close-knit communities of people helping each other to maintain dominance in that industry. </p>
