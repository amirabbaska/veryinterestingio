		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I posted this in response to the top comment as their explanation was incorrect but just making a separate post to provide an answer to your question. </p>
<p>Your vocal cords, which sit at the top of your airway, are quite sensitive. In dry drowning, water hits the vocal cords which causes spasm - otherwise known as laryngospasm. In basic terms, the vocal cords snap shut in a protective reflex which seals off the airway and lungs. In reality, the victim suffocates rather than drowns - no water enters the lungs. </p>
<p>Many people here are describing secondary drowning, which is an inflammatory condition caused by water entering the lungs and causing irritation. Fluid build up occurs within the inflammatory response causing pulmonary oedema, or fluid filled lungs. </p>
<p>To confuse things however, laryngospasm can also cause pulmonary oedema. Our breathing works via negative pressure - when we open our rib cage, that stretches the lungs open and creates a small vacuum causing air to rush in. This is how we breathe - we don't 'suck' air in per se, we create a negative pressure environment with the muscles in our rib cage and diaphragm and air rushes in to equalise pressure between our lungs and the external environment. </p>
<p>When laryngospasm occurs, the victim may still be using all of those muscles to try to breathe but their airway is sealed shut. So, they are creating a negative pressure environment in their lungs, but with no way for air to get in to equalise the pressure. The victim then ends up drawing fluid from their tissues into their lungs instead, resulting in pulmonary oedema, or fluid filled lungs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there's dry drowning and secondary drowning. They're a bit different. Dry drowning is when your face is submerged in water and your vocal cords slam shut preventing water getting into your lungs but also oxygen. Your body burns through what oxygen it has, your brain eventually​ gets starved of oxygen and you die without ever getting water in your lungs.
Secondary drowning is when you get water in your lungs, enough to wash away the healthy surfactant fluid lubricating your lungs making it much harder to breath. The water also causes damage to the lung tissue causing swelling and inflammation of the lung membranes involved in getting oxygen from the air into your blood stream. So despite you breathing air and oxygen into your lungs, the membrane of your lung is now swollen and too thick for the oxygen to cross to your blood stream. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>YUS I CAN ANSWER THIS! We beach lifeguards call it parking lot drowning as our slang (secondary drowning is the correct term I believe), because people often feel the onset of the symptoms when they are in the parking lot leaving the beach to go home. </p>
<p>Inhaling water is really bad, and when you do your body can over react, like it does when you're stung by a bee. Ocean water is the worst because of the bacteria and crap in it. When your lungs figure out there is water and gunk in them they respond through a couple of ways, for secondary drowning it's called edema, pulmonary edema or wet lung, and it is your body trying to flush out your lungs with mucus and other bodily fluids. There is also inflammation sometimes. </p>
<p>This is similar to the overreaction your body has to a bee sting if you're allergic because the poison (or in this case fluid in lungs) won't kill you, but your body flips out and kills itself. </p>
<p>Treatment is just giving the patient oxygen. Key thing is figuring out whether or not patient inhaled water, a stethoscope can hear gurgling or wheezing in the lungs sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We recently covered this in a linguistics class! It's basically all about intensification. I'm using English as an example, but other languages do this too. When we want to make a statement more intense, we put a word before it to emphasise it:</p>
<p>E.g. Good = very good.</p>
<p>But over time, people overuse the intensifier and it starts to lose its impact. So people use it more:</p>
<p>E.g. Very, very good.</p>
<p>This makes it lose its impact even quicker. So people look for another word to replace the overused word, the stronger, the better! </p>
<p>In the Early Modern English period (c. 1450-1800), people started to use words to describe terrible things for emphasis, such as awfully good, terribly good, etc. These words originally had much stronger meanings than today - terrible meant something more like disastrous. But because we've used them for several hundred years, they are losing their strength too, and so we look for other terms to replace them to get the intense meaning. Using awful, as in OP's post, is sometimes called 'terrible emphasis' in linguistics. </p>
<p>This is the same reason people use 'literally' for things like 'I will literally kill you' when they don't really mean they will kill someone. They are using a strong modifier for emphasis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The adjectives which spring to mind - awfully, terribly, dreadfully, frightfully, fearfully, scarily - all come from words related to fright. And this, I think, is because for many things we fear, that fear is mixed with respect - we both fear and respect the mighty power of nature; we both fear and respect a large predator; we both fear and respect whatever god we happen to believe in.</p>
<p>So the comparison is being made with that - &quot;He is a terribly good footballer&quot; literally implies that he is so good that we must fear and respect his powers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a technique in art and animation actually.   Contrast is not only beautiful but it can act as an amplifier. In Animation, if you want to show a character smiling, you can first move the corners of the mouth down and then spring it back into a smile.  The contrast gives the landing pose more impact.  So my guess is that the contrasting adverb makes the landing adjective more impactful.  </p>
<p>It works both ways by the way:<br />
POSITIVE - Awfully Good<br />
NEGATIVE - Positively Awful</p>
<p>EDIT:
There's a lot of focus on &quot;Awe&quot;, the problem is there are plenty of combinations not using &quot;Awe&quot;, for example:<br />
POSITIVE - Insanely Good<br />
NEGATIVE - Incredibly Bad  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars almost certainly had an ocean worth of water early in the life of the Solar System. However, the planet's low mass means it also has a relatively low escape velocity, and all sorts of escape processes can cause atmosphere to leak out to space. </p>
<p>Water vapor on its own is just a bit too heavy to easily escape Mars (heavier molecules have slower speeds, and thus a harder time reaching escaping velocity). However, Mars has no form of ultraviolet shielding the way that Earth has an ozone layer. Gaseous water vapor that evaporated from the oceans could push high into the atmosphere and be exposed to ultraviolet photons. These are energetic enough to split water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is a very light atom, and can very readily escape Mars out to space. On an early Mars, this would primarily occur through two processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just being warm enough, the fastest moving hydrogen atoms can reach escape velocity.</p>
</li>
<li>Early in the Solar System's there were a lot more impacts from asteroids, and Mars happens to be located very close to the asteroid belt. From our estimates of impact frequency at that time and location, there were more than enough to blow off most of the Martian atmosphere in just the first 100 million years.</li>
</ul>
<p>(A lot of folks might mention the fact that Mars currently doesn't have a magnetic field and thus exposes it to the full force of the solar wind. While that's an important process now, it's likely Mars did have a magnetic field early in its history.)</p>
<p>So that's what happened to the hydrogen that was in all that water...but what about the oxygen? Well, an oxygen atom is 16 times heavier than a hydrogen atom, so it's considerably more difficult for it to reach escape velocity. </p>
<p>However, free oxygen is also very reactive, so most of it likely reacted with surface minerals before it had a chance to escape. After all, the Martian surface was originally black like lava rock; only by getting massively oxidized did it turn red.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about atmospheric escape processes on all the planets, I'd highly recommend <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/Catling2009_SciAm.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF</a> - great layman-level reading material.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Water vapor in the atmosphere was split up by ultraviolet light. The hydrogen was light enough to escape into space, while the oxygen got locked up in rocks on the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It doesn't happen here on earth because strong magnetic waves keep solar winds from stripping our atmosphere away.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add a few points that you may find interesting to the discussion. Cooling is directly related to surface area and inversely to the volume of the planet. As planets get larger their volume increases more in proportion to their surface area. Mars therefor cooled off quicker and lost tectonic activity which had many consequences like the cessation of producing a magnetic field and also the end of volcanic activity both of which contributed to the demise of Mar's atmosphere. Plus being smaller to start with meant that atmosphere was harder to hand onto anyways.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In this sense, when a person was described as late it meant that they had only recently died (i.e. they were a living person up until the recent past).  </p>
<p>And although it no longer fully carries the connotation of the death being in the recent past, it is still only really used for people who were alive in living memory (eg it would sound odd to refer to &quot;the late Ludwig van Beethoven&quot;, just about OK to refer to &quot;the late Jimi Hendrix&quot;, and fine to refer to &quot;the late Chuck Berry&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who's spent 4 years studying, researching and working clinically with eyeballs, here's my guess: </p>
<p>You're likely forcing your focusing system to focus through as much blur as it possibly can, assuming that while you &quot;blink enough&quot; you're concentrating your gaze, at a single object or direction. Both your cornea and your crystalline lens will change shape in order for you to be able to focus; younger people, especially kids, have a much greater dynamic range for focusing then do older folks, so if you're young, that's probably most of it. If you know you have terrible vision, meaning a high prescription in one and or both eyes, you definitely should not do this. In that case, you'll probably get headaches if you do it enough. Just use glasses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because when you blink you momentarily relax your eyes in darkness. During relaxation the eyes are no longer under strain or stress and go back to the shape they are supposed to be, thus proper vision returns.</p>
<p>People get so used to straining their eyes that their vision decreases over time from constant stress. You can actually return your vision closer or all the way back to 20/20 if you do the proper exercises daily. When I got my license I failed the eye tests and was required to wear glasses to drive. I practiced relaxing my eyes and doing exercises and when getting my new license I passed the test and no longer need glasses to drive.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the style. Like manga, you can learn it. The style is quite dated and sketchy, and not terribly artistic. I'm sure it has a historical reason to be like this, almost like graffiti.</p>

<p>How can you ask this question in the first place? (Not trying to give you a hard time, but man! Could you confuse Picasso with DaVinci?) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
