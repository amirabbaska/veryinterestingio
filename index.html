		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason that a choir can sound fuller than a soloist, or an orchestra can sound fuller than a single instrument. It is very difficult for multiple singers or instruments to be perfectly in pitch with each other all the time. These slightly detuned pitches get averaged together when we hear them and this leads to a thick and full sound. </p>
<p>We can produce this artificially by doing the same thing, take a tone and split it into several tones each slightly detuned from the others and we call this a chorus effect. The sound of 1980's pop guitars was heavily influenced by this. </p>
<p>However, when there is just one tone that is out of tune, this causes 'beating' which is when the sound waves sync up in an irregular pattern and it sounds harsh. </p>
<p>When two tones are in tune, they either sound at the same frequency, or at perfect divisions of that frequency. For instance 440hz and 880hz sound good together because the 880 vibrates exactly twice for every vibration of the 440. It adds up. </p>
<p>But 440hz and 450hz do not perfectly match up, and so it causes the sound to fluctuate unharmonically leading to beating. </p>
<p>To put it another way, music is math that we can hear. Chords are fractions and if the fractions divide evenly, it sounds good. If the fractions do not divide evenly, it sounds bad. When you hear about people comparing music to math, this is what they are talking about. Each note has a numeric value in hertz, and chords are formed by taking a root note or root tone in hz and producing complimentary tones that divide well with that root note. Notes that do not divide well will produce chaotic waves that break up the simplicity of the root tone instead of re-inforcing it and we find this displeasing. So music sounds good because math. ;) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Coulomb -&gt; EM force -&gt; EM interaction -&gt; electroweak interaction -&gt; String Theory?</p>
<p>As the velocities, energies and 1/size of the system being analyzed increases you have to move up this scale. The Coulomb force alone is too simple when you start looking at the electron orbitals of an atom, you need to account for magnetic effects. As you reach the nucleus, the combined electromagnetic force is too simple and you need to account for individual effects such as photon emission, pair production, weak decay (radioactivity). As you start accounting for proton vs proton, you need to look at the nuclear force which is roughly modeled as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_interaction" target="_blank">Yukawa interaction</a> between nucleons. As you look inside nucleons, you need to look at the theory of quantum chromodynamics between quarks and gluons.</p>
<p>To demonstrate why the theories fail, think of the Coulomb force of a pair of parallel plates. The force from the E field is constant between the two plates. Clearly, as you get extremely close to one plate, you start feeling the Coulomb force of individual electrons. At that point, the proximity to those electrons will become a strong effect than the combined E field of the rest of them. The &quot;Parallel Plate Force&quot; is just a low energy theory explaining the Coulomb force. When you get to small distances you need to account for more detail. </p>
<p>In the case of the EM interaction, the Coulomb force is described as the combined force of 10^(big number) photons bouncing back and forth. At a large scale, this seems to be 1/r^2 constant force. At close scale, it's important to account for the individual interactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Coulomb force is classical, not quantum. In the same way Newtonian physics is inaccurate at velocities over 0.1c, the Coulomb force doesn't accurately predict the energy of a nucleus. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electron_radius" target="_blank">Classical electron radius</a> is an example of this failure.</p>
<p>So it doesn't go to infinity, but it still exists. The residual strong force between neutrons and protons (caused by one emitting a meson and the other absorbing it) holds them together.</p>
<p>Since mesons decay pretty quickly, so the residual strong force has a short range.</p>
<p>The strong interaction is also known as the color force and is responsible for holding quarks together to make up protons, neutrons, mesons, and other hadrons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually would know because the moon passes in front of the sun (eclipse), but the sun never passes in front of the moon. This is called occlusion and is a monocular depth cue (although it is a relative cue to depth, only telling you that one object is farther than another, and not an absolute cue which would tell you the distance to an object). </p>
<p>You may be asking about the effectiveness of stereopsis. This is the sense of three-dimensionality most normally sighted individuals with binocular vision experience when looking at the world. Stereopsis can arise from several cues including horizontal disparity on your two retinas (objects at different distances relative to your point of focus will project to relatively different areas of your retinas). You can also get the effect monocularly from motion parallax as in <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7P9t0eU_drQ" target="_blank">this</a> cool video. </p>
<p>Traditionally, it has been said that stereopsis is only for near vision and is effective to about 20 feet or so and after that vision is effectively monocular. However this isn't true. There just needs to be more distance between objects in order to achieve the same binocular disparity as they get farther away from you (<a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2191614" target="_blank">Palmisano et al. 2010</a>) up to a resolution limit. This follows from simple geometry. If you know the distance between your two eyes and the angle at which they are rotated inward, you can compute the distance to an object and consequently the distance between two objects. The relative position of objects on your eyes also provides the same information. The closer two objects are to you, the smaller the distance between them has to be to produce the same binocular disparity (see intro in above paper for equation and clarification). Based on the minimum binocular disparity we can resolve, we should have stereopsis for about 1km out. Beyond that, binocular disparities are too small and eventually go to 0 (very distant objects have parallel projections).</p>
<p>Edit: I made a mistake. Corrected now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the distance information we get ends up being from how the way things look to changes as we move, or the difference in how things look to our right and left eyes.  This is called parallax.</p>
<p>Using parallax to calculate distance is a function of a couple of things:  (1) the distance between measurement, (2) the position of the ojbect relative to the displacement,  (3) the angular resolution of the measurements.</p>
<p>The ability to detect depth variations also doesn't stop abruptly, but, instead, becomes less sensitive.  You can notice that something is 1 inch closer one foot away, but you can't detect the same difference at 100 yards.</p>
<p>Given the limits of human vision, and the distance between the eyes, for someone who's standing still, anything more than half a mile away might as well be at infinity.</p>
<p>But better vision and more movement can change that.  Astronomers can detect parallax into the hundreds of light years.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two issues here:</p>
<p>1) You don't just use binocular (two eye) depth cues (the sort that make 3d glasses work) to judge depth. You also use a lot of monocular cues that include all sorts of high level logic on a second by second basis. Such as your brain instantly knowing that a chair is far away not because of optical info, but because you know how big chairs usually are, and the size along + that semantic info = depth. So you cannot separate out the concepts of optics vs. logic and world knowledge. They are deeply intertwined. INCLUDING the knowledge that the sun is far away from your science background. That info is literally part of your depth judging processes itself. So in that sense, <em>&quot;there IS no maximum distance, as long as you have the knowledge that lets you know depth in any way&quot;</em> since knowledge is part of your depth system. You can know the difference in depth between objects you can't even see at all, and in a very real sense, that's the same system at work as the ones you use to navigate a classroom.</p>
<p>2) If you're talking only about binocular cues, then the maximum distance would be based on your retinal neuron precision. Both the precision of individual neural activation levels (they wobble and have noise, so whatever point the noise drowns out the tiny difference in signal beyond whatever confidence level you consider sufficient), and also the non-identical nature of your left vs. your right eye. I.e. unlike a camera sensor, your two eyes don't have perfectly identical photoreceptor layouts, so you could also end up with some noise/confusion about depth when you get down to the individual photoreceptor level of precision, due to differences in layout between the two not aligning helpfully. You also use many cells at once in your brain/retina to gain extra precision by averaging over noise. So..... lots of insanely complicated math would be required for any answer, and it'd probably differ a lot between individuals (also: near-sighted/short-sighted, cataracts... etc.)</p>
<p>But fun answer: &quot;When two objects get far enough away that the amount their images move from one eye to the other falls somewhere in the range of a small fraction of a retinal cell's distance on your retina, you couldn't use that cue anymore&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>From there there's a limit to how much information you can carry in an FM channel of a given band.  It turns out that having channels that are 200 KHz wide gives a good tradeoff between having lots of channels and having good quality, so that's what is used.</p>
<p>To divide the spectrum up into even parts without wasting any you start with 88.0-88.2, then 88.2-88.4, and so on.  This means that they're all even-to-even decimals.</p>
<p>The carrier wave in an FM transmission should be the center of the band, so for 99.6-99.8 you'd choose 99.7.  Since all bands run even-to-even the center is always an odd decimal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine taking a chunk of aluminium: it's grey because it reflects all wavelengths equally, but it's not very shiny if it hasn't been polished, because it reflects light in almost random directions. </p>
<p>If you polish it up a bit, it's still grey, but now it's shinier, because it reflects light mostly at the same angle that it came in.</p>
<p>Keep polishing, and it eventually becomes a mirror.</p>
<p>So there's a continuum between a flat grey object and a mirror.</p>
<p>I guess when your mind is contemplating the mirror as an object, and not what's reflected in it, it's forced to assign an appearance to it, and that appearance is &quot;shiny and without a noticeable colour of its own&quot;, and that's basically a description of what we call &quot;silver coloured&quot;.</p>
<p>A side comment on &quot;silver&quot;: even pure silver is slightly yellow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Image-Metal-reflectance.png" target="_blank">as you can see from its spectrum.</a> - see for example <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fMtD30kx1vg/S_yPePP1GbI/AAAAAAAABPU/aPV6LrnEQmU/s1600/Stainless+vs+sterling.jpg" target="_blank">this comparison</a> of stainless steel next to sterling silver (<a href="https://bridgecitytatting.blogspot.de/2010/05/jons-foldover-bookmark-and-more-maille.html" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Edit - More detail from a reply I gave below:</p>
<p>A piece of white paper reflects most of the light that falls on it in pretty much random directions. That means that it does actually take on the colours of things around it. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/nWYC8" target="_blank">I just took a picture to demonstrate that.</a></p>
<p>If you have an incandescent lightbulb, so one with a hot filament, the light that it gives off is very yellow, and this is obvious if you take a picture with your camera set to &quot;sunlight&quot; white balance. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/wLEpS" target="_blank">A piece of white paper will look yellow in that photograph</a>, but when you look at it in real life your brain still sees it as white, because it corrects for the ambient light.</p>
<p>A chunk of unpolished aluminium also reflects all wavelengths pretty much equally, and in all directions. However, it only reflects a certain fraction of the incoming light. Same if you print &quot;grey&quot; on a laser printer. It's like white, only darker.</p>
<p>I took another picture to show <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/mSRbi" target="_blank">what metal looks like compared to paper.</a> You'll see that this metal, which isn't very highly polished, is pretty much grey unless there's something really close to it. But the shades of grey are interesting. Where it's facing incoming light, it reflects it better than the paper, so it's actually a brighter white, and where it's facing off towards the darker areas of the room, it's a darker grey. For this reason, compared to white paper, it appears overall a bit more grey than white. Interestingly, the paper is a bit bluer than the metal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In most cases, there are so many light sources and objects to reflect light that the <em>specular reflection</em> dominates most of the light reflected towards our eyes.  In this case, the mirror has no color and simply looks like the color of whatever light is being reflected at our eyes.</p>
<p>The only time we notice the color of a mirror as silver is when a portion of the mirror doesn't really have an opposing light source or object to reflect light towards our eyes (i.e. that portion of the mirror has very low specular reflection). In those cases, <em>diffuse reflection</em> will dominate, and diffuse, uniform reflection looks like a dim or imperfect white, which is silver.</p>
<p>The more imperfect a mirror, the more <em>diffuse reflection</em> you will get, and the more silver it will look.  That's why <em>shiny</em> things that aren't necessarily mirrors -- knives, ball bearings, polished aluminum or stainless steel -- are easily recognized as appearing more silver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In photosynthesis there are 3 metabolic pathways for carbon fixation from CO2. In forests and jungles we are concerned with the C3 and C4 pathway (the CAM pathway is only found in arid plants). These pathways impact how a plant responds to elevated CO2 levels.</p>
<p>In the C3 path oxygen competes with CO2 in the presence of the first enzyme, RuBisCO. Meaning that the enzyme can't distinguish between oxygen and CO2.  Incorporating oxygen ultimately results in a toxic compound later on that must be disposed of through photorespiration which uses energy. So the ratio of the gases in contact with RuBisCO matters. More CO2  successfully being bound means less energy lost to photorespirstion.  Increased CO2 can benefit these plants. 85% of plants use this C3 pathway including rice, wheat and trees.</p>
<p>The C4 pathway evolved next and it removes the energy lost to photorespirstion by only allowing RuBisCO to bind CO2. This is accomplished by putting the enzyme in a newly evolved chamber and selectively exposing it to only CO2. These plants are pretty much already maxed out at what they can handle at current CO2 levels. They don't get any benefit from rising CO2 levels. These include plants like corn and grasses.</p>
<p>Forests and jungles contain both C3 and C4 plants. C3 plants have the capability to grow more in the rising levels but climate change also bring along big temperature and rainfall shifts which can negatively impact the health of the C3 and C4 plants alike. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we are talking about saltwater reef fish (generally tropical), there are a number reasons for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many display <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism" target="_blank">aposematism</a>, which is a bright coloration pattern to warn predators of toxicity. Examples of this include the lionfish, trunkfish, moray eels, and pufferfish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some species use mimicry of the toxic ones to ward off predators.  Examples are like the sea breams that mimick fang blennies and marine bettas that mimick spotted morays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reef ecosystem is one of the most crowded biomes on Earth in terms of population density.  Fish use their coloration to signal to individuals of their own species (&quot;we're schooling this direction now&quot;) and others (&quot;back off&quot;).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reef fish have, in addition to visible spectrum light receptors in their eyes, a fourth receptor for UV light.  As a result, what they see is not exactly what we see against the background of a textured (and often colorful) reef.  So some patterns actually aid in camouflage, though they would be obvious against a plain dull background.  Additionally, <a href="https://dtmag.com/thelibrary/reef-fish-colorful-science-behind-beauty/" target="_blank">many big predators are colorblind</a> and rely on rods more than cones, so movement and pattern are more important than color to them.</p>
</li>
<li>Many reef fish change their color patterns from juveniles to adults, or as mating season starts.  Some (like clownfish, wrasses, anthias) even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/04/science/sex-change-in-fish-found-common.html" target="_blank">change sex</a>!  Their color patterns are under endocrine and hormonal control. These different color patterns may serve in mating competition, to attract mates, or to show adults of the same species they are juveniles (noncompetitors).  In the case of the gender-benders, the death of one dominant sex  may trigger the transformation of one individual of the opposite sex (usually the dominant one) to cross over the sexual dichotomy divide and advertise this to other fish of the same species.  Female to male change is protogyny (<a href="http://www.reefcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=972936" target="_blank">anthias</a>) and male to female change is protandry (<a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/08/clownfish-are-all-born-male-a-dominant-male-will-turn-female-when-the-current-female-of-the-group-dies/" target="_blank">clownfish</a>).  </li>
</ul>
<p>In ichthyology, we also learned about some color patterns are due to iridescence textures and some due to specific pigment cells... I don't remember this well, maybe someone else can cover this.  There is also something about countershading when a predator from below tries to see a fish above it, which explains why many fish have a lighter belly (like triggerfish).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no marine biologist,  but I do have plenty of experience in the aquarium hobby. </p>
<p>There are a few reasons why some fish are more colorful than others. It is important to note that warm water fish tend to be  more colourful than cold water fish.  OP,  I trust you mean the colour disparity you see between tropical reef dwelling fish vs one you might catch in the river by your house...</p>
<p>A few of the factors affecting colour intensity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>turbidity of the water.  You don't need to be colourful if no one can see you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>schooling or shoaling behaviours.   Many fish in large groups can have bold patterns to confuse predators. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sexual dimorphism to attract mates for some species </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>need for camouflage.  Ironically,  on the reef,  there are many predator species that hide and ambush rather than prey species. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>presence of bright coloured corals or sponges in your habitat. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>types of predators that hunt you, ie birds swooping down from above vs Other fish. Also important is whether you are predated mainly at night versus daytime. </p>
</li>
<li>biodiversity in specific area.   The number of different species can by itself drive for differences between how fish look.  They need to be able to identify their own kind.  Some even advertise they are poisonous or otherwise not good eating through colour. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these factors can select for or against bright colours or patterns. Evolution has selected for bright colours in some situations and duller colours in others. Clear water,  reef for protection, large schools, warm temperatures, all lead to bright colour.  More solitary fish in cold dark turbid water tend to be duller.      </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fisheries biologist here.  There are some things to clarify and consider here. First, I do not think the dichotomy between freshwater and tropical is exactly what you intended. I am assuming you mean a perceived difference between freshwater and saltwater (marine) fishes. Tropical simply means found in the tropics (~between 30 deg N and S), so there are tropical fishes in both freshwater and saltwater.</p>
<p>Next, as /u/hglaber pointed out, there is probably an issue with selection bias. When people (at least those in temperate climates) tend to think of freshwater vs. saltwater fishes, they think of what they catch locally vs. what they see in an aquarium or on a documentary, which are often tropical reef fishes. This is really an apples and oranges comparison without a smoking gun answer.</p>
<p>So what <strong>does</strong> influence color among (fish) species? Keep in mind that there are over 30,000 fish species worldwide, and therefore many exceptions to any rule. Generally speaking, though, color is used for:</p>
<ol>
<li>camouflage -  mimicking parts of the environment (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafy_seadragon" target="_blank">leafy seadragon</a>, counter-shading (dark on the type, light of the bottom; e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark" target="_blank">great white shark</a>), mirror-siding (think really shiny silver bodies; e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookdown" target="_blank">lookdowns</a>, and disruptive patterns that break up the outline of a fish (like the mottled patterns on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallmouth_bass" target="_blank">smallmouth bass</a>).</li>
<li>mate selection and identification, often associated with sexual dimorphism (the sexes differ, in this case in color; e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulonocara" target="_blank">peacock cichlids</a> in Lake Malawi) </li>
<li>other forms of signalling, including warnings to predators, often because of venomous spines (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterois" target="_blank">Lionfishes</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>I think a better way to ask your question is, <strong>why do brightly colored fishes appear more frequently in the tropics than in cold water environments?</strong> This is not a freshwater vs. saltwater issue. It is remarkable to consider that nearly half of the astounding 30,000 fish species are freshwater, despite this constituting only 0.3% of available global water.  Much of this diversity (in fresh- and saltwater fishes) is concentrated in the tropics. The Amazon river basin, for example, has over 5,000 species of freshwater fishes, many of which are very colorful (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_tetra" target="_blank">cardinal tetras</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discus_(fish)" target="_blank">discus</a>. Tropical reef systems are equally diverse and, as you've noticed, they harbor many colorful species. This sheer abundance of species is at least part of the <strong>answer to your question</strong>. With so many different species crammed into such (relatively) small areas, you are bound to end up with a wide diversity of colors, shapes, and patterns; the most extraordinary of these are the most memorable to us. Another interesting dimension to this is that the way a fish looks relays information to members of its own species as well as other fish species. Bright colors make you stand out not only to a mate, but also make you look different from other closely related species that might also occupy your habitat (which happens a lot in these high-diversity environments). </p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that existing tropical environments, on average, tend to be older than many temperate environments. They have not been repeatedly bull-dozed by glaciers and did not entirely dry out during cooler, drier periods. For example, many freshwater fish genera (and even species) have 10-million-year fossil records indicating that they changed very little during that time, suggesting consistent environmental conditions for long periods of time. These stable environments provide refuges for diversity when environmental conditions are poor elsewhere, thereby preserving much of their diversity, whereas other environments need to &quot;reboot&quot; diversity-wise when conditions improve. Maintaining this inherent diversity may help foster the wide array of forms we find in tropical systems (note that this hypothesis is not without its criticisms; please see the <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/setting-the-record-straight-on-the-refugia-hypothesis" target="_blank">Pleistocene refugia hypothesis</a>).</p>
<p>Certainly, you can find examples that run counter to what I have outlined, like brightly colored, cool-water fish species (e.g., male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_darter" target="_blank">rainbow darters</a>). You can also find very young tropical lakes with high endemic fish diversity (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Victoria" target="_blank">Lake Victoria</a>). As I mentioned previously, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to your question, but I hope I have at least clarified the topic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, you may be looking at some selection bias. </p>
<p>You've already noted the freshwater fish you think of, and they are all game fish - likely to be caught for sport, not for appearance. That's very common. People are often shocked at the number of native fish in temperate climates because they mainly only know those large enough to eat a lure. All of the minnows, darters, sculpins, madtoms, etc. never make it into the boat. Throw some of those darters or sunfish into an intensive breeding program like discus or guppies have had and I'm sure you could get lots of bright colors and patterns. </p>
<p>Conversely, is it safe to assume that most of the tropical fish you're familiar with are in the pet trade? In other words, chosen for their bright colors? Some of which are even the result of years (sometimes <em>hundreds</em> of years) of selective breeding to enhance those colors? </p>
<p>So you end up with small, colorful tropical fish in the pet store, and big, drab, tasty/fun to catch fish in your live well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there, pharmacist here. The most general way to understand the skin, drug absorption, lotions, and so forth is to think about how oil and water don't (easily) mix. To cross the skin barrier from outside of your skin to the inside, generally any molecule has to cross an outer lipophilic layer (which likes fat), then through a hydrophilic layer (which likes water), and then through an inner lipophilic layer. Some transdermal (across the skin) delivery systems can even increase the permeability of the skin, making it easier for molecules to get across. To address your initial question with creams and lotions, remember oil and water. The goal is to increase hydration or rather, to avoid moisture loss. So lotions on a basic level restore water. And if you put something occlusive (a lipophilic barrier like a layer of Vaseline, creams which have oils and fats in them to do the same, a bandage, etc.), you basically trap water in your skin. This is why lotions and creams work better if you put them on when your skin is still damp from a shower or bath - you trap more moisture. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are 2 kinds of moisturizers. The first is occlusive, which is a physical barrier preventing moisture from escaping. (Petroleum jelly, oils, silicones etc.) The second type is humectant, which draws moisture towards itself. (Glycerin, hyaluronic acid etc.) Most moisturizers in the market are composed of a mixture of occlusive and humectant ingredients so that moisture gets actively attracted to the surface of your skin and gets trapped by the occlusive barrier, unable to escape back out into the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the costs of producing gasoline are separate from the price of crude oil, which is the price you are thinking of.  Crude oil is what comes out of the ground.  To get at it, you have to drill.  Drilling costs money.  That cost doesn't really drop based on the value of the crude oil; it is dependent on the costs of labor, machinery, bits, etc...  Once out of the ground, the crude oil has to be transported to a refinery.  Getting it there costs money, either paying trucks or ships or paying for access to pipelines (usually a combination of the two).  The cost of transportation does depend a little on the price of gas, but also depends on the costs of labor/equipment/pipeline access, etc....  Once the crude oil is at the refinery, it gets refined into the various oil products, including gasoline.  That costs money.  That cost doesn't totally depend on the value of crude oil, but rather on the capacity of refining and the supply of oil.  Once it is refined into gasoline, it need to be transported to various gas stations around the world.  That cost depends a little on the price of gas, but also on the cost of labor/equipment.  Finally, governments tax gas like crazy.  Those taxes don't go down when the price of crude oil goes down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
