		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stability of an atom is determined not just by the atom in question, but the atoms that it could decay into as well. If an atom is heavier than another one plus the mass of any emitted radiation needed to get there, then it will be radioactive. This is because mass is energy (E=mc2) so extra mass means energy available to emit.</p>
<p>So the basic answer is &quot;because every Tc atom is heavier than a Mo or Ru atom of the same mass number plus the radiation emitted to turn into it&quot;.</p>
<p>Why that the case? A major part of it is that nuclei are lighter and therefore more stable when they have (separately) even numbers of protons and neutrons, because they like to pair up. Tc has 43 protons, so it's partially screwed on that count. Furthermore, Tc-98 is smack on the line of stability, but has 55 neutrons and is screwed on both counts (and Ru-98 is even-even of course, so that exacerbates the difference in mass). Its neighbors Tc-97 and -99 would have a good shot at being stable having even numbers of neutrons, but nuclear physics just happens to work out to make them barely able to decay to Mo-97 and Ru-99 (both are over the threshold by only about 300 keV, which is around 60% the mass of an electron).  The same concept goes for prometheum.</p>
<p>Why did the masses happen to work out this way for Tc when it doesn't for most other odd-proton elements? I'm a nuclear physicist that used to specialize in measuring nuclear masses, and I have long ago given up trying to understand how nuclear masses work. Nuclear theory is so complicated that it is basically unsolvable, so I can't point to any one effect that caused this. For now we just go out and measure the masses.</p>
<p>I know that's unsatisfying, but so is nuclear physics in the end.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there are radioactive 'elements' all the way down the periodic table, to Hydrogen. Some basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>An atom's nucleus has a collection of protons and neutrons. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, and almost identical chemistry. </li>
<li>whether a nucleus is radioactive or stable depends on the number of protons AND neutrons.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Hydrogen: Usually, a Hydrogen atom has a single proton in its nucleus. A small fraction of the Hydrogen on earth - in water, in our bodies, everywhere - has a proton AND a neutron. It's still stable. </p>
<p>An even tinier fraction, a tiny trace amount, has a proton and TWO neutrons. These &quot;Hydrogen-3&quot; nuclei are unstable - If you had a bottle of it and left it on a shelf, 12 years later you'd have a bottle half-filled with Hydrogen-3, the other half would have turned one of their neutrons onto a proton, becoming Helium-3. </p>
<p>You used to be able to buy little perspex necklace or keyring charms filled with Hydrogen-3 on the internet. The radioactive decay would make the gas glow in the dark.</p>
<p>After hundreds or thousands of years, you'd have no Hydrogen left in the bottle. </p>
<p>If you change the number of neutrons in a nucleus, you get different &quot;isotopes&quot; of the element. Some isotopes are stable, some decay very slowly, some decay very quickly. Some elements have no stable isotopes, such as Technetium, Promethium, but many others also - Uranium, Radium, Californium, for example ... anything beyond Lead on the periodic table.</p>
<p>Technetium and Promethium are special though.</p>
<p>Uranium is radioactive - eventually, a sample of Uranium would completely decay, leaving not a single atom left. However, the most stable isotope of Uranium takes 4.5 billion for just half to decay. That's right, 50% of the U-238 originally on earth is still around. </p>
<p>Hydrogen-3 is found on earth, even though it decays so quickly, because it's continually formed as the atmosphere gets bombarded by cosmic rays. </p>
<p>Other fast-decaying isotopes are found on earth because they are formed as a slow-decaying element decays. Thorium-234 decays in  matter of weeks, but an atom of Th-234 is produced every time a U-238 atom decays. There will always be Th-234 until the U-238 all runs out, billions of years after the sun fades into an inert ball of dark gas. </p>
<p>But Technetium is special. It has no stable isotopes. The only isotope that is produced at all naturally is Tc-99, which is a rare result of fission of U-235. U-235 which is already rare, usually just decays to Thorium-235, and even when it undergoes fission, usually doesn't produce Technetium. For all intents and purposes, Technetium doesn't occur naturally at all, and must be synthesized.</p>
<p>Promethium is similar. </p>
<p>These are not the only synthetic elements, but they are the two lightest, and so are quite special. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elements with odd proton numbers have far fewer stable isotopes than even elements, for reasons of the stability of pairing. Several dozen odd-atomic number elements lighter than lead have only ONE stable isotope (fluorine, sodium, aluminum, phosphorus, etc). Both Pm and Tc are odd elements (43 and 61).</p>
<p>The other instability comes with not having completed or near-completed nucleon quantum energy number &quot;shells&quot; for both neutrons and protons. The &quot;magic numbers&quot; that apply here are at 28, 50, and 82, and are most stable (lowest energy) when filled, or nearly filled. For example, tin, the element with 50 protons, has 10 stable isotopes, the most stable isotopes of any element (the next nearest is xenon with eight).</p>
<p>You can see that both Tc and Pm are in the middle of a magic number gap on proton count, and so is the number of neutrons needed to stabilize their various isotopes, even going up or down a few for different isotopes. </p>
<p>The upshot is that they just barely can't exist on a timescale compatible with being around for 4.6 billion years, and thus making it to the status of primordial elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>North Korea is already doing and has been doing it for the better part of a decade. Iran signed an agreement saying NOT to do it anymore. People said that Iraq <em>might</em> be doing it, and the resulting war is still going on. But a private individual? I would say it approaches 0%. If someone <strong>really</strong> wanted to work on the Manhatten Project, then they would have to join up with a government (like North Korea) to make it possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's simply not possible for a private enterprise to achieve on its own. You need state knowledge and infrastructure to make it work.</p>
<p>First off, it's a lot more expensive than you think. Elon Musk has a lot of money. His net worth is about $16.7 billion dollars. The Manhattan Project, adjusted for inflation, cost about $25 billion dollars, so even if Musk liquidated all of his assets, he still would come up short, and that's not to mention that the only reason SpaceX is successful in the first place is because of huge investments by the US government.</p>
<p>Second, it's lot harder on a technical level than just getting some uranium. Not only do you need the materials and infrastructure, but you also need the scientific knowledge, which is some of the most closely guarded information in the world.</p>
<p>So what would this hypothetical evil genius billionaire have to do? First they would need to obtain vast quantities of uranium. Then build a huge plant of centrifuges to enrich it into a usable form, or alternatively build a reactor to turn it into plutonium. Then he'd have to hire hundreds if not thousands of workers to operate the plants. Then he'd need a team of the best physicists in the world to work out the math, or the best spies in the world to steal it from a nation that already has it. This would all have to be done in <em>complete secret</em>.</p>
<p>How likely would this be in the future? I can't know for sure, but given how much effort it takes, it seems highly unlikely. A more likely (although how <em>much</em> more likely I can't speculate) is for a person or organization to steal a bomb from a nation with lax security, or to steal/buy some weapons-grade material to make a crude device of their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CONTEXT:
During a recent brief discussion with my doctor I asked whether there was a benefit for people who used Ritalin, but aren't diagnosed with ADHD. She responded by saying that there isn't one and that, that's one way specialists are able to tell, besides tests and what not. This comment left me somewhat confused as I'm aware that there is quite a large market around selling Ritalin/Adderall illegally, hence the heavy regulations on prescriptions. On one hand I know it's popular with university students to assist with studying, however, on the other hand I've heard that people abuse it to gain a high. </p>
<p>QUESTION:
Are the people who obtain and use it illegally for the assistance they gain with studying/working, people who have ADHD but haven't sought out a specialist to get a diagnosis. While the people who use it for the purpose of getting high do not have ADHD?</p>
<p>If so, what difference in an individual's brain chemistry causes this drug to react to react differently for people who have it versus the people who don't. </p>
<p>Tl;dr</p>
<p>If someone gains the intended effects of Ritalin/Adderall does this confirm they have ADHD? And that getting a high from taking it, is indicative of not having it? If yes, chemically speaking, why?</p></div></div>

<p><strong>AND NOTHING I'M SAYING BELOW SHOULD BE CONSTRUED TO BE MEDICAL ADVICE. TALK TO YOUR PHYSICIAN IF YOU HAVE PERSONAL QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research says that amphetamine/methylphenidate  stimulants can improve attention/processing speed for everyone. EDIT: THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT ABUSING STIMULANT DRUGS IS OKAY OR EVEN BENEFICIAL. ONLY TAKE ADHD MEDICATION YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBES YOU. PERIOD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved cognition with stimulants does not therefore equal a diagnosis of ADHD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A poor response to stimulants also does not equal the absence of ADHD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The downregulation of dopamine receptors with long term use contributes to both dependency and withdrawal effects upon discontinuation. The research is unclear if this (at least to some degree) is permanent or not. </p>
</li>
<li>There's a big difference between a developing brain and an adult brain with respect to the benefits of stimulant therapy on frontal lobe development. That is, kids with ADHD on stimulants may develop more &quot;normal&quot; brains as they mature and adults with ADHD are likely stuck with lifelong frontal lobe dysfunction. </li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT (and my only edit): Please note that I cannot and will not give any medical advice. For my point #5: ADHD is predominately a frontal lobe disorder (more specifically, a dopaminergic/noradrenergic disorder - and possibly one could add GABA &amp; glutamate to that list as well). As such, if you &quot;have&quot; ADHD as an adult (as defined by your frontal lobe maturation ending), it is a lifelong disorder; however, you can learn how to compensate so well that you no longer experience daily functional problems. </p>
<p>This is why learning to cope/compensate for ADHD is as equally important as pharmacological therapies since the latter may be contraindicated in some folks depending on their health status/comorbid conditions. Finally, just because a kid has ADHD does not mean that stimulant medication is ALWAYS beneficial for frontal lobe development or daily functioning - there are so many factors related to long-term development and daily functioning that any one factor (such as ADHD meds) cannot explain ALL of the developmental trajectory of the frontal lobe. </p>
<p>There are also many many many contraindications to stimulant use and not all ADHD needs to be treated via stimulant medication. IMO, way too many people/kids with ADHD are treated via stimulants instead of first trying behavioral/environmental modification and therapies first. I'll say it again: abusing stimulant compounds is not okay and may be harmful for your health/brain. Lastly, some kids with ADHD (non-medicated) grow out of it (up to 30% in some studies I believe). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People diagnosed with ADHD struggle focusing on singular tasks. Consider a &quot;normal person's&quot; ability to focus as baseline. People with ADHD have a weaker ability to focus so their normal state is below baseline. Stimulants allow them to attain baseline and focus like non-ADHD people can. Non-ADHD people who take the stimulants can become hyper focused. Since we're all already at baseline the drugs increase our focusing ability well beyond it to levels not usually naturally attainable.</p>
<p>As far as the high goes most stimulant prescriptions are tweaks or variations of amphetamine which releases dopamine so of course high doses will cause a high. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spent the last 3 years studying stimulant abuse for my doctorate degree! Finally, my time to shine! Most people in this thread have reasonable answers, but they don't have a complete picture. So let me try to answer your question.</p>
<p>ADHD is caused because the part of your brain that needs to be firing to prevent you from getting distracted is not firing anymore. This is usually caused by a lack of dopamine (among another neurotransmitters). Stimulant medication can increase your dopamine in that part of your brain, thereby helping it control the other parts that keep finding new ways to distract you, thereby helping you focus.</p>
<p>What stimulants do in people without ADHD is a question nobody knows the correct answer to. When the FDA approves a stimulant medication, they base it on evidence collected during a clinical trial on people who have ADHD. There have been no trials conducted on people without ADHD to test efficacy of stimulants. But based on our knowledge of physiology, and pharmacology, we can make some decent guesses as to what will happen.  People who don't have ADHD but take stimulants anyway will experience an effect similar to that of crystal meth, but on a much smaller scale. It will provide temporary improvement in focus, short term memory, and attention. Whether this improvement is as high as among those who have ADHD is a question we don't know the answer to, but we expect that it will be lower. We also expect that there will no long term benefits to stimulant use with regard to memory, and focus. </p>
<p>What we do know is that the illegal market for stimulants make people without ADHD think they have it (because they see benefits from stimulant use) leading to an increase in overdiagnosis of ADHD. ADHD is also very difficult to diagnose and very easy to fake, especially for family or general practitioners. We also know the side effects stimulants cause, which most certainly hold true even among those without ADHD. These include heart palpitations, metabolic effects including loss of hunger, mental illnesses like anxiety or depression, and even addiction.. people who do not have ADHD but are addicted to stimulants will reach a point where there brain will decrease producing dopamine in order to account for all the extra dopamine coming from the drug. That's the brain's way of trying to go back to normal. After a few years of use, your brain will now chronically under-produce dopamine leading to the same symptoms as someone with ADHD. So you could essentially give yourself a version of ADHD by overusing stimulants. </p>
<p>My research, in case anyone's interested, is in trying to identify people who are lying about ADHD symptoms or are trying to doctor shop prescriptions for abuse or resale. If you have any questions, ask away! </p>
<p>EDIT1: Added a few more lines based on the topics discussed elsewhere in this thread. Some very dangerous info is out there in some comments. Please be careful.</p>
<p>EDIT2: TL;DR: There are no published clinical trials looking into stimulant use in people without ADHD. But we expect that there will be some short term attention improvement, with no long term benefits. But long term use of stimulants can cause mental illnesses, metabolic issues, cardiac problems, and addiction. Addiction to stimulants will impair your brain performance, essentially giving you a kind of ADHD itself! Be careful, and stay away from stimulants if you don't have ADHD. If you aren't sure if you have ADHD, go see a psychologist!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your doctor is incorrect, but incorrect in a way that is pretty common.  If you give everyone in a class stimulants, almost everyone will have improved focus and a better ability to attend to and complete tasks.  Basically everyone does better on a little bit of stimulant.  That response doesn't confirm anything about what else might be going on in the person's executive functioning or impulse control.  It most certainly isn't a confirmation of a diagnosis of any behavioral disorder, and, just as importantly, it doesn't have anything at all to do with the mechanism of action of a behavioral disorder.  </p>
<p>It's such a weird logical fallacy that people have bought into regarding the relationship between the actions of a medication and the cause(s) of behavioral disorders.  It's made even stranger because it's predicated on a desire to find biological causes for mental disorders, but the same reasoning would be almost always roundly dismissed in physical medicine.  For instance, my father for months has had substantial pain and swelling in his jaw.  As they have sought to ameliorate that, the doctors have treated those symptoms without ever suggesting that the treatment defined the problem.  They gave him Oxycodone for the pain, but never suggested that his &quot;problem&quot; was a lack of opiates in his body or a lack of dopamine in his brain.  They gave him steroids for the swelling, but never once tried to argue that because the pain was alleviated when the swelling was reduced that must mean that the swelling was the cause of the problem.  Yes, the swelling caused the pain, but it turns out that a bone infection caused the swelling.  The action of the steroids was entirely focused on and defining of the symptoms, and not the cause.</p>
<p>TL; DR:  Everyone does better on low dose stimulants, and doing better based on the understood mechanisms of that class of drugs tells us almost nothing about what is going on with the person in any other way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD and have been on Adderall for a year and a half now. Disclaimer: I don't have a degree in this, I've just been to a lot of doctors and researched a lot on my own.</p>
<p>Background on ADHD: people who have ADHD suffer from what is basically a malfunctioning reward system. Our brains may not reward us with good feelings when we successfully complete a task, or give us an energy boost to finish when the end of a task is in sight. This failure manifests in the person as lack of motivation, inability to pay attention, and inability to finish tasks. While there are of course other facets to ADHD, these are the parts stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin treat.</p>
<p>Background on Adderall: also called amphetamine, or amphetamine salts, Adderall is a stimulant in the same category as (arguably very similar to) methamphetamine. It functions as a dopamine and norepinephrine agonizer; it stimulates your brain to produce more dopamine (used to reward yourself​, think of that satisfied when you have done something well) and norepinephrine (gives you more energy, promotes &quot;vigilance&quot; and focus, aids you in memory formation).</p>
<p>Now, for your questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone gains the intended effects of Ritalin/Adderall does this confirm they have ADHD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly, but it's definitely useful to know. ADHD is a spectrum; many people who do not feel that it affects their lives enough for medication would still feel some focusing effect. Also, even if you do not have ADHD it will still act as a stimulant and theoretically enhance memory formation, so many people will use it to study for tests. I don't recommend this at all, but it could keep you alert long enough to study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that getting a high from taking it, is indicative of not having it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost everyone still gets some sort of high the first time they take it. At medicinal doses it's very mild. Part of the difference is that recreational doses can often be very high. However, you're not wrong in thinking something about the brain chemistry of a person with ADHD causes you to feel less of a high: Adderall often helps us to produce dopamine at the correct time, but if you already do that it may cause your brain to produce it <em>more</em> than necessary and get you high.</p>
<p>I would be happy to answer questions, but my Adderall is kicking in and it's time for me to go to work so I'll have to stop this explanation here. Feel free to comment or message me. I'd be happy to dig up some articles about the various things I've talked about if anyone wants to read further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are.  </p>
<p>The problem with some allergic reactions eg peanuts, is the rate of onset of the reaction.  This is mostly due to either the concentration of the the allergen or the host's sensitivity to a particular allergen.  </p>
<p>Your seasonal allergy medicine is designed to work against a relatively low level of physiological reaction (low concentration of antigen or lower immune response).  Meanwhile, high dose epinephrine (eg. EpiPen) can counter the inflammatory response to a high level allergic reaction. </p>
<p>The main reason that we don't take those medications on a continual preventative basis is that the side effects include all sorts of bad things up to and including cardiac arrest.  So most of the time, people are better off waiting until they start having a reaction and then taking their medicine, if they have a known allergy problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the severity of the allergic reaction and the risk of the allergy that determines whether or not an anti-histamine (allergy medication) can take care of it. If someone has a really mild peanut allergy that only causes itchy eyes or hives, Benadryl can probably take care of it. They still should just avoid peanuts, though, because they are still at risk of an anaphylactic reaction with peanuts, in which blood pressure drops and airways narrow. Anaphylactic reactions are life threatening and is treated with epinephrine since it acts fast enough. An anti-histamine simply does not act fast enough and isn't &quot;strong enough&quot; to handle severe allergic reactions. Seasonal allergies are generally on the milder end of allergic reactions, so anti-histamines can handle them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies in medical parlance are known as hypersensitivity reactions, and there are 4 or 5 different types of these reactions.  This wikipedia page covers it well:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity</a></p>
<p>The core differences between these type of reactions is whether body mounts a systemic (i.e. entire body) response, or localized (i.e. at the site of mosquito bite) response.  A secondary difference is the speed with which the body responds. </p>
<p>For class 1 reactions (a true anaphylaxis to peanuts), the reaction is the entire body and within minutes.  It tends to cause almost immediate swelling of the tongue, airway, esophagus, and can compromise the airway (i.e. choke someone).   Please note, not all people who are allergic to peanuts have a class 1 reaction, any of them are possible.  This can be confusing.</p>
<p>Similarly, a mosquito bite is typically a class 4 reaction; hallmarked by swelling at the site of the bite only and taking minutes to hours to manifest.  That said a mosquito bite can rarely be a class 1 reaction, and immediately life-threatening.  </p>
<p>So, the class of reaction determines which level of medicine(s) should be employed.  For someone having a class 1 reaction they will get a cocktail of epinephrine (adrenaline), diphenhydramine (benadryl), pepcid, and hydrocortisone along with humidified oxygen and intubation (a breathing tube) if necessary.  All of these medicines/ interventions also have side effects - some strong - so should not be utilized for other classes of reactions.  </p>
<p>So for your mosquito bite, the topical cream probably was best.  Most oral or IV medications would effect all parts of your body, rather than only the itchy spot.  Most of these medications would make you sleepy, confused, and even lower your immune system.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Your stomach has stretch receptors that tell your brain you are full. If you drink a lot of water, your stomach is streched out by a 0 calorie drink rather than a high calorie food. That's partly why eating a giant low calorie salad makes you feel as full as a small high calorie baked good. There are other things that contribute to fullness, but the stretch receptors are an important one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you drink cold water, your body has to burn calories to warm it up to body temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You drink water instead of other high calorie beverages. You will swap out water for soda, juice, etc. That keeps those empty calories off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your kidneys have to burn more calories to get rid of all the extra water you drank.</p>
</li>
<li>Water is an important part of many calorie burning chemical reactions in your body. If you don't have enough water, your body stops the less necessary reactions to conserve water.</li>

<p>It keeps us from consuming unnecessary calories. Dehydration and sleep deprivation can both manifest as hunger. By drinking water, we provide the tools for the body to do all the biological things it's already doing (as stated elsewhere) more efficiently and potentially remove the urge to eat unnecessarily. </p>
<p>If you stay hydrated you don't get hungry as often. One of the many weight loss tips is to drink a glass of water if you're hungry. If you're still hungry in 20 minutes, it was hunger and you should eat. If you're not, it was dehydration and you would have consumed extra calories unnecessarily trying to get water. </p>
<p>Many people are chronically dehydrated. Excess consumption of water won't do anything extra besides making you pee more. The tip to drink water is to ensure you're getting adequate amounts, not excessive amounts, and remain hydrated. </p>
<p>TL;DR Thirst is mistaken for hunger. Drinking proper quantities of water helps to prevent unnecessary eating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The &quot;modest&quot; argument tends to a late addition, and it comes from a period which ignores a lot of the sexuality that the Greeks and Romans showed in order to portray something more moral. The &quot;well shit, it's cold&quot; is a bit more on the point. That's not to say modesty isn't involved at all, because it is an important fact, and things like the kynodesme relay this, but: </p>
<p>but what I haven't seen mentioned, at least in the top comments, is that large cock statues DID exist in both Greece and Rome, but for different purposes. The Hermae of Greece had absolutely gigantic cocks, the ones in Athens were cut off on either an act of vandialism, or an act against democracy right before the Sicilian Expedition (there's a lot of debate on this, and as much as I'd like to say it's the latter, there's no definite proof and even the people admitting fault were pressured to do so to save their lives.) </p>
<p>But we do have representations of them in pottery, here's one showing a gigantic cock of a herm (the statue on the right) and the gigantic cock of pan <a href="http://www.cvaonline.org/images/pottery/painters/keypieces/tiverios/23-p161bottom-medium.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.cvaonline.org/images/pottery/painters/keypieces/tiverios/23-p161bottom-medium.jpg</a></p>

<p>And of course, everyone's favourite god: Priapus: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg/800px-Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg/800px-Pompeya_er%C3%B3tica6.jpg</a></p>
<p>These things survive better in frescoes and descriptions because things sticking out a long distance tend to break off easily of statues (this is why a lot of statues also lack arms... same thing going on with erect penises... lack of support, and more likely for something to accidentally rest upon it and break it off -- and while the amount has been exaggerated, there have been crusader types that have purposefully censored works like this.) </p>
<p>But I'm rambling now, so I'll stop. But basically: big cocks did exist, just many didn't survive in the sculptures we have today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Imagine you're in a courtroom, and you're guilty of a crime. You owe an exorbitant fine, and you can't pay it.</p>
<p>Then a man comes along and offers to pay it for you. This is the only man with enough money to pay that fine, and he pays it in your place, satisfying the legal requirement.</p>
<p>That's what Jesus did.</p>
<p>Every human who sins is guilty, and (according to the bible), deserves death. One of us cannot take on the death sentence for another, as we all have our own death sentence. In other words, I can't die for your sins because I have to die for mine.</p>
<p>Jesus is the only human who never sinned, being God in human flesh. Since He had no sin, he could take the place of others. He willingly was tortured and killed, and God placed our sins on Him. His physical death paid the 'fine' for us, freeing us from court and from everlasting death.</p>
<p>Jesus was a perfect scapegoat, without any spot or blemish, and by accepting him and respecting his wishes for what he did, we are saved by his payment.</p>
<p>TL;DR A perfect man died, so that he could pay for the sins of imperfect men. Read Romans 1-6 for the full explanation, as well as how to take advantage of the payment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: I am glad to see the interest, and thanks for the gold and the discussion! A lot of questions that people have are legitimate, and I'm glad to see that some other people helped out while I was sleeping. Since this is the very simple ELI5 version, I left a lot of the details and the whys out of my explanation.</p>
<p>Since the thread is locked, feel free to PM me or one of the others in this thread. I promise, I will respond with civility, and no question is a bad one.</p>
<p>Second edit: I've read the comments, and oh I wish I could respond! Circumcision, God's motives, justice, scapegoats, the possibility of being saved without Jesus, Spiritual death vs. Physical, etc. I'd be happy to answer any questions I can! And hopefully in as simple of terms as I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested in an ELI30, graduate-level answer, you could do worse than to check out the writings of Rene Girard, especially <em>Violence and the Sacred</em>, and <em>Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World</em>. </p>
<p>In his later life he became somewhat of a catholic apologist, although a kind of heretical one, which succeeded in pissing off a lot of people. But he started his career with a fairly scientific/analytical approach towards trying to understand why some myths &quot;took&quot;, while others did not. I.e., why did thousands or millions of people fight and die for this or that idea, and not for this other one. </p>
<p>At the core of his theories is a hypothesis that human societies require an enemy and scapegoat, and periodic sacrifice. I.e., that human organizations are held together by unification against external threat, and by someone to blame for whatever is wrong. He presents no small amount of evidence in support of this theory, from all kinds of primitive and early-historical societies, and ties it into his larger theories of mimetic desire, which gets a lot more complicated. </p>
<p>Skipping over a lot of stuff, Girard theorized that the Christ-myth was unique in making the scapegoat/enemy also the deity, and thereby <em>exposing</em> the mechanism of outward enemy as unifying force, and allowing for new, more sophisticated social structures that did not require opposition, conquest, or war against external tribes, cultures, or supernatural forces. </p>
<p>To grossly over-simplify, Girard saw &quot;primitive&quot; religions as those which imagined vengeful, jealous, capricious gods, who demanded subservience and sacrifice, like a supernatural &quot;boss&quot; or &quot;big man&quot;. Judaism, uniquely among ancient religions, in his view, had a deity which required not just prescriptive behaviors and sacrifices, but also recognized nuances of intention and desires. The Jewish God not only forbade taking another man's wife, he forbade even thinking about or desiring it.  </p>
<p>In Gerard's system, societies always need a sacrificial scapegoat. If they cannot find an external one, they will find an internal one. This mechanism enforces tribalism and small networks. The theory is that the Christ-myth exposes the need to scapegoat, and provides a universal scapegoat, and negates the need for constant supply of new sacrificial victims, by making the deity himself the universal victim. </p>
<p>We all killed God, we are all the enemy of God, and yet he forgives us, and dies for us whenever we sin. The barbarian at the gates is ourselves, and we cannot defeat the enemy except by being better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>The questions is asking according to the Bible, and I do not see to many responses answering in that form.</p>
<p>There are multiple texts which seem to indicate different reasons why Jesus had to die to save humanity. But to answer the question, we must first discuss what we needed saved from. The answer can be found in Genesis 3 where Adam and Eve disobey God. This event is teased out by St. Athanasius in his book &quot;On the Incarnation&quot; where he shows that in Genesis, God said if you eat of this tree, you will surely die. </p>
<p>I would add this to the top comment. The top comment focuses on &quot;forensic&quot; righteousness. Or a righteousness viewed in light of the law/ a legal decree of God. This Biblical position, which complements a forensic righteousness, is called recapitulation. Humanity was under the headship of Adam, the fallen man. </p>
<p>Romans 5:12-21 discusses this, along with any passage that talks of humanity now being under Christ. in summary, Romans says, &quot; For if because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. Therefore as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For as by one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.&quot; (quoting vs 17-29).</p>
<p>These views are not exclusive. I hold to both a forensic and recapitulation view. </p>
<p>Another view which I do not see represented here and has a lot of biblical traction is the idea of Ransom. If you have ever read/watched the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis, then you saw a ransom theory. That God had to &quot;buy&quot; us back from the devil who owns us. This is close to the forensic view, but puts more of an weigh on the cosmic battle between God and the Devil. Biblically, Jesus says it in Mark 10: 45 &quot;the son of man has come to give his life as a ransom for many.&quot;</p>
<p>I gotta run, but hope this is helpful! Lots of great reasons. Sorry I was not able to address the change on earth aspect or the why did he have to die. Each of these perspectives would nuance the reason differently, but all are pretty cool!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are different &quot;atonement theories&quot; that answer this question in different ways.

<ol>
<li>The one I saw most in this thread, (substitutiary atonement) - humans are bad, Jesus is good, we deserve to die, Jesus takes our place and we're forgiven. </li>
<li>&quot;Moral Exemplar&quot; - Jesus teaches us how to be the best people we can be by being a moral example. Why did he have to die? To show us how our sinful society naturally kills the innocent. He makes the earth better by the example he sets. </li>
<li>&quot;Christus Victor&quot; - In the grand battle between God and evil, evil holds humans as slaves. Jesus steps in and by dying and rising defeats evil and opens eternal life.</li>
<li>Eastern Christians have complex beliefs about how God became human (Jesus) to sanctify every stage of human life. He had to die because death is a part of life. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Jewish religion was based around the idea of sacrifice: if you did something wrong, you had to pay for it. You would take a sacrifice to the temple -- depending on how much you had and what you had done wrong, this might be some grain, or perhaps a couple of birds, or something bigger like a lamb or an ox. The idea was that you had to make amends.</p>
<p>If the sacrifice you brought was a live animal, it was slaughtered. In those days, people believed that the life of an animal was contained in its blood (not surprising, given that if you bleed a lot you can die), so it was the blood that somehow made everything work and got you forgiveness from God.</p>
<p>Sacrifices were made on other occasions, too. One of the most important was the festival of Passover, when Jews would slaughter and eat lambs. This goes back to the story of the Exodus, when the Israelites escaped slavery in Egypt: according to the legend, God sent the Angel of Death to kill all the Egyptians' first-born sons, but the Israelites smeared the blood of slaughted lambs on their doorposts so the angel would spare them.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the time of Jesus. According to the Bible, he said some nasty things about the religious authorities, saying that they were exploiting ordinary people. He suggested that there was no need to make sacrifices: God would forgive you anyway. The religious authorities didn't like that, so plotted to have him killed. Of the four Gospels, two of them say he died the day after the Passover, and one (John) says he died at the very moment the Passover lambs were being slaughtered. </p>
<p>A bit later, St. Paul joined the movement Jesus had started, and developed a theory about Jesus's death and why it was necessary. Blood, he said, was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice: as he was &quot;the son of God&quot; (however you interpret that phrase), his blood was enough to grant forgiveness for us all. There was no need to bring any sacrifices to the temple, and no need to convert to Judaism.</p>
<p>It seems a bit weird to us now, but that's because we're not used to a sacrificial cult. It was really St Paul's attempt to give Jesus's death some kind of symbolic meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's not impossible, there's just no profit in it for the amount of work involved. The studio would be selling to a tiny niche who would want such a thing, and they can't possibly charge enough to turn a profit at a price the market will tolerate.</p>
<p>On the technical side, game code for a console is incredibly specific to that console. What you suggest would require a near complete rewrite from scratch of these games, and recreation of all art assets - which would require a full scale dev team to port to a modern platform. That, and not only would the code have to be ported, but redesigned to work with modern graphics on this other, modern platform. And then you would of course require full scale play testing to find and fix bugs and ensure the game experience is faithful to the original.</p>
<p>It costs ~$10m to make a low end AAA title, and these ports will cost at least as much, likely ~$20m per title. And if you're going to improve the video quality, it's inadequate to go with an incremental improvement, you might as well go all the way, so the effort required would be demanding, escalating the price. Anything less than what is expected for an exalted title on a modern platform would be a complete market flop. And again, this is for a niche market. Buyers don't buy the same experience again, unless you're Nintendo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Besides the fact that re-doing the textures takes a lot of effort, you also have to re-create all of the models. The original models were made up of very few polygons- much of the reason modern games look more natural is that they have more precise definitions of the characters, with more articulated joints (like fingers that move independently) and all of that takes a ton of time to create and animate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>9/10 times, they just re-create the game from scratch. And unless the game is super popular and will guarantee tons of sales, the dev won't do it because it won't make enough money.</p>
<p>That's why only super popular games like the Crash series are getting HD remakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's cost prohibitive to do so.</p>
<p>Especially for the old consoles, games weren't as much optimized as they were puzzled together with proprietary api's and even development languages to work uniquely on that specific hardware. Often the hardware itself was very specific and unique for that console which required even more coding gymnastics to suit the code specifically to take advantage of that specific hardware.</p>
<p>The sourcecode is often not something easily converted to the currently used x86 instructrion set or hardware models, without a near 100% rework.</p>
<p>Besides that, textures in old games aren't as simple as you'd imagine. Most of them are so low resolution or sometimes just colors with some wizardry applied to them to look a specific way, that you'd also have to remake all these textures to look similar to the original but more usable in tuned up graphics.</p>
<p>And then there's the problem of sourcecode often no longer existing for quite a few games. Or sourcecode existing for an earlier stage of the game after which they started hacking the code in low level assembly for optimization and debugging.</p>
<p>It comes down to that they'd have to redevelop every part of a game from scratch. Which is time better spent actually creating a game that is new.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Artificial intelligence is a massive field. Asking how AI works is like asking how animals work. Don't let the down votes dissuade you, though. It's an interesting, expanding field.</p>
<p>If you have 25 mins to spare, this is a nice video on the topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILsA4nyG7I0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILsA4nyG7I0</a></p>
<p>Edit: it's worth pointing out that neural networks as discussed in this video are just one field in AI, but I think this a nice introduction to the whole field. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong (with useful links to share!)</p>
<p>Edit 2: might as well throw in a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh" target="_blank">carykh's channel</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that you have a set of marbles that are of different weights from 10 to 50 grams (totally made up values here, no idea what a marble actually weighs).  Now let's suppose that you want to find only the marbles that weight between 18 grams and 20 grams.  Of course, we don't want to do this by hand since we have a lot of marbles so instead what we'll do is make something that can make the decision for us.
In this case, we create a path by cutting a groove into a piece of wood that all of the marbles can fit down.  Now, we put in a trap door that only marbles that weight 18 grams or more can fall through and into a new path.</p>
<p>We're half way there!  Now the problem is that the marbles that are too heavy will fall through so we need another trapdoor to only catch the marbles that weigh 21 grams but allow the others to flow through into a bucket at the end of the path.  This bucket will now contain only marbles weighing between 18 and 20 grams.</p>
<p>We would test it by having a test set of marbles where only red ones should end up in the bucket and any other color is incorrect.  After the testing, we would make adjustments to the trapdoors so that only the correct marbles get through. This is called training.</p>
<p>So, in computers, machine learning is exactly this where the trapdoors are nodes that have certain weights applied to them.  If the input passes a certain threshold (the marble is in the right weight range), then the node passes the value onto a certain pathway for further execution.  If we find out that the output isn't what correct, then we go back in and work on the nodes / weighting (trapdoors) so that it works with values that we know to be correct.</p>
<p>This is a very broad topic and this is a super simplified answer which I hope clarifies it for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two broad categories for AI: Decision problems and search/optimization problems.</p>
<p>Examples of decision problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given this state of a chess game, which of the available moves should white make?</li>
<li>Given this huge body of medical data and this patient's symptoms, what diseases is he likely to have?</li>
<li>Given this huge body of historical weather data and the current weather, what's the weather going to be tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of different systems that are used to try to make these decisions.  For games with turns, like chess, it's usually based around evaluating the state of the game at each move to give a score for each player, exploring all of the possible paths the game could take, and choosing the move that maximizes the score.</p>
<p>For things like the medical example, imagine picking two types of data and plotting them in a scatterplot.  For example, age on one axis and BMI on the other.  People with diabetes are generally older, fatter people, so we expect to see diabetics in the top right.  Of course, there are a lot more variables with medical data, so in reality it would be some 50-dimensional scatterplot or something.  There are then lots of different approaches to try to cluster data or draw lines between different groups.  See: decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and clustering.</p>
<p>Examples of search/optimization problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve this Sudoku puzzle</li>
<li>Given this road data of the entire world, find a good driving route between LA and NYC</li>
<li>Given the entire internet and this search text, find web pages that are relevant</li>
<li>There's going to be a convention with a lot of talks.  Given this convention center and its rooms and their capacities, and all of the talks and their lengths and projected attendances, figure out how to put it all together.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sudoku puzzle is the only one with a definite &quot;right&quot; answer.  You write a search algorithm that methodically tries all numbers in all open boxes, <em>forward propagating</em> to see if what you've done is still possible, and <em>backtracking</em> when there's a conflict.</p>
<p>The driving one is a little fuzzier, but you can still tell that an answer is at least correct.  There are various graph search algorithms, but they're all based around the idea of exploring all possibilities outwards from the start, focusing attention on the ones that are doing &quot;well&quot;, and throwing out ones that are clearly not working.  See: A*, Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
<p>Web search is really complicated. Early search engines just looked for pages containing your search text, which allowed people to put a bunch of invisible text on the page to increase result rank. Google made a key observation: pages relevant to the search don't just contain the text, but other pages link to them as a reference. So when you search &quot;dog&quot;, you're not just looking for pages that contain &quot;dog&quot;, you're looking for pages that sites about dogs link to. And that's why Wikipedia is usually a top hit. Google's full algorithm is much more complicated and a tightly-guarded secret, but that's the gist of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the following: </p>
<p>During soccer practice, we learn to kick balls into a net. Success is getting the ball into that net. Failure is everything else. </p>
<p>How do we learn? </p>
<p>Motivation. A coach celebrates our successes and berates your failures. Other pupils internalize this and behave similarly. Getting cheered on feels good. Getting booed feels bad. </p>
<p>So we keep trying. </p>
<p>We kick at the ball, and look where it lands. And we try again, and again, and again. If we lack progress, our coach will give us tips. If we improve, we get promoted. If not, we get rejected and asked to leave. </p>
<p>The coach's tips are like a computer program: we tell the computer how to score success. Us humans have senses to track the ball: a computer program has similar ways. </p>
<p>Why is this intelligence? </p>
<p>Because we update our behaviour based on evaluating rules we get taught, against a changing situation. </p>
<p>A programmer gives a computer rules, too: if this, then that. Fairly simple, but not intelligent. The program chooses from predefined behaviour based on changing situations: it doesn't change its behaviour. </p>
<p>Allowing a computer program to change its behaviour, is what makes it intelligent. There are 2 ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>allow it to adjust known actions based on its senses; </li>
<li>allow it to create new senses and new actions. </li>
</ul>
<p>For instance: you kick the ball. It lands to the right of the net. You adjust by aiming the next ball further to the left. </p>
<p>A computer can be programmed to do the same. Left and right are input parameters, which the computer remembers and simply increases or decreases. </p>
<p>We must however also give it a way to evaluate the success of the adjustment. Did it aim far enough to the left, or not? Or too far? We have senses; a computer can be given a success function, that does the same. </p>
<p>Evaluating that success function and adjusting input parameters to increase success allows us and a computer to get better at a task, without changing how we perform it. </p>
<p>But there's circumstances that existed before we learned to play soccer: </p>
<ul>
<li>we are human; </li>
<li>we walk upright;</li>
<li>we have working legs and eyes; </li>
<li>we are capable of learning. </li>
</ul>
<p>If any of those doesn't match reality, our soccer game will get played differently. </p>
<p>A computer is not limited in the same way. It is, however, limited. So we program in features like memory, watching, evaluating, etc. But we don't give it legs (unless we're building a walking / running robot). </p>
<p>Those features are set: even a learning program won't change those. It requires them to learn in the first place. </p>
<p>But unlike a human, we don't need to restrict computer programs to walking / running / kicking, using just 2 legs, eyes, and a sense of balance. A computer can be allowed to spice things up: </p>
<ul>
<li>what about just 1 leg? or 3? </li>
<li>what about whiskers instead of eyes? </li>
<li>what about guide rails? </li>
<li>what about a funnel? </li>
</ul>
<p>My examples are limited by my imagination. A computer doesn't have to be limited: we can literally let it try anything, as long as that ball gets into the net. And we can let it continue to try, and discard failures, and improve upon successes, without tiring, for months on end. </p>
<p>We can let programs rewrite parts of their own programming. Not all of it: they'd destroy themselves. But just its actions and its success functions. </p>
<p>See, in some programming languages, a function can be composed from sets of rules and behaviours. Those can be mixed, blindly, like allowing a million monkeys to write books for a million years, and aiming to wind up with Shakespeare's MacBeth. </p>
<p>But just like we can adjust our aim based on our senses, a computer program can be allowed to adjust its function composition based on the success and failures of its attempts.</p>
<p>We just have to give it the tools and let it run. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
