		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, you'd feel very little. This is is actually a fairly common situation that is encountered when sailing. When running with the wind (ie the wind is to the back, and pushing the boat forward), the crew will feel very little breeze. </p>
<p>In the sailing world, though, this is actually when a lot of things can go wrong. Crews become complacent because it feels like there is no wind, but the boat is actually under a lot of strain.. Gybes under that kind of power can seriously damage the rigging.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, my highest rated comment ever, and just about an observation from sailing. Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Riding in a balloon has this effect, too. Since the balloon is driven by the wind with no resistance, it moves exactly with the wind and therefore the passengers experience no wind at all, at least if the wind is rather continuous. You'd still feel gusts of wind, because the balloon's inertia prevents it from following every gust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They'd already mastered telegraph lines on land, so what they needed for underwater cables was a way to waterproof them. Unlike today, when we have all kinds of artificial substances, they could only use natural ingredients. So one of the vitally important substances that allowed them to do this was gutta percha, which allowed them to waterproof the cables. It comes from a tropical tree. Once they learned this waterproofing technique, they used existing tech to lay the cables. It was dicey at first and there was a lot of trial and error. </p>
<p>By the way, if you want to read about this in depth, Neal Stephenson wrote about the history of trans-oceanic cables in his book of essays, <em>Some Remarks</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was very difficult but possible with the level of technology available in the 19th century.  However, the potential payoff of linking continents by near instant communication was huge, big enough to prompt people to do it multiple times.  </p>
<p>The cables were similar to what is used today, a very thick armored sheath covering a few wires (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Piece_of_first_transatlantic_telegraph_cable_at_the_Rupriikki_Media_Museum.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Piece_of_first_transatlantic_telegraph_cable_at_the_Rupriikki_Media_Museum.jpg</a>) (nowadays, fiber optic lines have replaced the signal lines).  Massive reels of this cable were loaded on the biggest available ships and slowly laid down (an early steam powered cable laying vessel: <a href="http://home.bt.com/images/ss-great-eastern-beached-136399284792903901-150716153822.jpg" target="_blank">http://home.bt.com/images/ss-great-eastern-beached-136399284792903901-150716153822.jpg</a>, and an illustration of one of the giant cable reels: <a href="http://atlantic-cable.com/Cables/1857-58Atlantic/Coiling-Cable.jpg" target="_blank">http://atlantic-cable.com/Cables/1857-58Atlantic/Coiling-Cable.jpg</a>).  Cable breaks happened (as they do today).  The earliest ocean cables were laid by sailing ships, but steam powered ships became common not long after.  The break could be roughly located using the electrical &quot;echo&quot; that occurs when sending a signal down a long wire.  A repair ship would sail out and dredge up the cable, where it would be repaired.  </p>
<p>The technology didn't come out of the blue.  Long distance land telegraph lines were already common.  There were some early underwater lines which ran for much shorter distances (like between England and France).  This helped establish the basic technology before ocean crossings were attempted.  </p>
<p>There was  no in-line repeater/amplifier technology at the beginning, so the extremely powerful signal sent on one end of the cable was extremely weak on the other end.  There was no widespread electrical grid.  The telegraph would be powered by large lead acid batteries.  Because of the extremely long distance weak signal, non-standard equipment was used.  A &quot;mirror galvinometer&quot; used a small mirror and magnet hanging from a string, which could be deflected by the tiny signal that made it through the cable to &quot;read&quot; the signal.  Non-standard signals were used as well for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Morse code was not yet the universal standard it became</li>
<li>Many cables linked to non-english speaking countries which didn't use Morse code anyway</li>
<li>The poor signal quality over the extremely long cables made other signal systems more attractive.  </li>
</ol>
<p>The earliest cables could send only one signal at a time.  Each end would have a schedule and would swap &quot;sending&quot; and &quot;receiving&quot; rolls at prearranged intervals.  The code had to be sent slowly as well, since the signal was very weak.  Given the very limited bandwidth, sending a trans-oceanic message was extremely expensive, writing a letter and sending it by ship was much more economical but far slower.  Most signals would have been business or government messages as opposed to personal.  </p>
<p>Technological improvements gradually increased the capability of the trans-oceanic cables:</p>
<ol>
<li>The invention of electrical amplifiers improved signal quality and the speed at which messages could be sent on a cable.</li>
<li>The invention of multiplex technology allowed one cable to send and receive at the same time instead of switching rolls.</li>
<li>Cable design improvements reduced breakages and allowed for more than one wire per cable.  </li>
<li>Human operators initially did all sending and receiving.  Eventually, mechanical punch card reader/writers replaced direct human signalmen and allowed for signal speed increases.  </li>

<p>LiOH can be used in nuclear reactors to increase the pH in the coolant. This change in pH ends up decreasing the corrosion rate in your system which leads to lower output of deposits being released into the coolant. These deposits can affect the plants hydraulic performance, change heat transfer properties of certain components and also can lead to a build up of radioactive material in the coolant created from the neutron activation of the corroded material in the reactor core. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The celery is provided to give a little cleansing and cooling break without introducing a different flavor, as it's a pretty flavorless veggie on its own. It can also be used to scoop some cooling sauce like ranch or bleu cheese or whatever might be served with your wings.</p>

<p>Cloaks are incredibly versatile and depending on the material construction, can be tailored for a variety of uses in many different types of weather.  </p>
<p>In addition, I would imagine that they are cheaper to manufacture than regular coats because of the simple geometry and also easier to fit multiple body types.</p>
<p>Sure, most people think that cloaks are somewhat archaic, but I am sure you can make them fashionable.  So what gives?  Why are coats so much more popular in modern times?  Is it simply a fashion thing or are there a ton of practical benefits to modern coats that I am forgetting?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something I actually read up on a few weeks back. It has to do with textile technology of the times and the limitations of it with respect to rain. </p>
<p>Basically it starts with water proof fabric, or the lack there of. I won't go into the various off shoots like the Innuit animal derived ones and stick to cloaks. During cloaks popularity in the Victorian era, they were usually made from something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oilcloth" target="_blank">oilcloth</a> or oilskin fabric. It was very tightly woven and treated to make it water proof, but when they sewed it to make clothing, the seams were not water proof. So we had to have multiple layers of clothing so that the seems were never exposed. This is similar to how shingles on a roof work, each protecting it's neighbor. </p>
<p>This resulted in the long duster type cloaks but with an additional material covering the shoulders and neckline like overcoats or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_coat" target="_blank">ulster coats</a>. Think 'Sherlock Holmes' </p>
<p>People were aware of rubbers natural water repellent properties but it was fragile and tore easily because natural rubber is quite soft. Eventually we discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanization" target="_blank">vulcanized rubber</a>, where it was treated with sulfur and heated and pressed to make it stiff, hard, and very tough. At that point we could make much lighter and simpler garments like rain coats and because we did not need to worry about the seams or needle holes, it was no longer necessary to layer the clothing and use of cloaks and ulster coats or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_cape" target="_blank">Iverness capes</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My fiance worked in a peanut shelling plant for years and it basically boils down to them wanting to get equal profits from shelled vs. unshelled.</p>
<p>Once the peanuts are shelled, they're graded and sold for different prices. There's splits, jumbos, mediums, #1s, etc. I forget all the names, but there's a few more. Even the hulls and 1416s (aka the smallest bits that fall through the sorting screens) can be sold for things like livestock feed and some other random things.</p>
<p>So basically, if they break the peanuts up and grade them, they can potentially make a lot more money sending them off to different places. If they get sold whole, then they have to set a price that will somewhat match up with what they would be worth sorted and graded.</p>
<p>To add, peanut shelling plants really aren't that different from the plants that sort whole peanuts. They all go through similar sorting machines to grade them by size/weight/color/etc. The main difference is that a shelling plant has to send the nuts through the sheller bars (which is what shells them). So there's really not that much more labor involved between the two.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a very rough transcript of how my fiance explained it to me, as I asked him about it before. Also a friendly note that if you ate anything from Mars that included peanuts in the past few years, he probably touched them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I would imagine nearly all of the peanuts consumed are shelled to be eaten or made into peanut butter. Shelled peanuts are sold in comparatively much smaller volume. When you produce something in very large quantities, you are able to take advantage of &quot;economies of scale&quot; that drive the price way down. This is in part because your fixed costs (e.g. Production equipment) are spread out over much more output. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Man some of these responses are way off base.</p>
<p>First, there's nothing in physics that says you can't have a perpetual motion machine. You just can't extract any energy from it and have it move forever, because whatever you're using to create energy will add resistance to the system. A perfectly frictionless pendulum will have perpetual motion. You can also go into deep space and spin a drumstick like a rock star and that will spin forever (unless act on by another force of course).</p>
<p>In your example, even if you ignore friction and air resistance, you wouldn't have perpetual motion. This is because of something called an eddy current. When you have a conductor moving through a magnetic field, a current develops that creates a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the existing field. The magnets in your example both create the magnetic field and act as conductors. Thus, as soon as you start spinning the magnet, the eddy current will create a magnetic field to counter that movement and stop the motion. Eddy current braking (as it's called) is used as a brake in electric motors, such as in your power drill. </p>
<p>My guess for what would happen in your example is you give the magnet on a string an initial push, it stops almost immediately and bounces around on the string until finding its equilibrium in the repelling magnetic field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's nothing spectacular about making something go forever, just look at the planets orbiting the sun. But this doesn't mean that there's an infinite amout of energy to extract.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses face pressures to survive and replicate like other organisms. In order for a virus to be considered helpful, the damage of the viruses lifecycle (which involves hijacking cellular machinery) would need to be outweighed by some benefit. </p>
<p>Imagine a possible &quot;confidence virus&quot;: the virus would enter a cell type in the brain (similar to rabies) and specifically stimulate the circuitry for confidence, but no others in a negative way. To maintain its label as a useful virus it would need to leave the brain cells unharmed but still replicate itself efficiently and pass itself on to another host. This may be possible by budding and sexual transmission, but it's a little difficult to imagine that this could be done efficiently without negatively disrupting the &quot;confidence circuits&quot;. Viral replication usually disrupts the cells ability to take care of itself (transcription). </p>
<p>Another issue with the confidence virus is specificity. Viruses choose which cells to invade by molecules expressed on the cell surface. The cell surface markers would need to be distinct for the confidence pathway (almost certainly not true). A possible way around this would for the virus to have some sort of dependency on confidence circuit cells once it gets into the cell type (let's assume neurons). Confidence neurons, with cell surface markers indistinguishable from other neurons, would need to provide some specific queue to activate the positive effect. This might be some cellular DNA regulator (transcription factor) that acts together with a viral factor. </p>
<p>I'm still hoping a positive virus will be discovered someday. There was a great episode of Red Dwarf that played with this idea. </p>
<p>Edit: after shower thoughts about confidence virus</p>
<p>ELI5 take 2: Viruses hurt people because they take and use things that cells need to survive. For viruses to be good they would either need to hurt bad cells or have a side effect that makes the cells help the person they are part of more than the virus hurts them. There are some things about viruses that make this difficult to imagine, but not impossible. I'll tell you about them when you're older.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Endogenous retroviruses (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus</a>), have left Viral DNA sequences that now comprise 5-8% of the human genome.  </p>
<p>Theses endogenous retro viral sequences have helped diversify the genome, playing a role in evolution.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off of what everyone else is saying:</p>
<p>Let's just look at the physical constraints of a virus. Despite being the most diverse and omnipresent biological material in the world (there's an estimated 10^31 viral particles floating around - compared to the approximately 10^11 stars in the observable universe), they are also the smallest that we've encountered. This minuscule size means that they can spread far and wide, but it also limits how much information they can encode on their genome. As a reference, the smallest known viral genome is Hepatitis B, at 3.2 kb (3,200 bases or nucleotides); compare that to a human genome, which is which is 3 <em>billion</em> bases, a full six orders of magnitude larger. </p>
<p>With such little genomes, you might wonder why they can't fit more info in them. To answer that, we have to look at the &quot;body&quot; of a virus, called the capsid. Viral capsids are also tiny, but they are also economical. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Jacquet/publication/224708905/figure/fig2/AS:302858718203908@1449218553703/FIG-2-Cryo-electron-microscopy-of-SPP1-capsid-and-phage-particles-A-Images-of-H-12.png" target="_blank">Take a look at this bacterial virus</a>. In section D, you see all those parallel lines? That is the genome of the virus, packed in at about 5 atmospheres of pressure: roughly the same amount in a bottle of champagne. This isn't unique to this virus; many viruses have to stuff their genome into the capsid, and for one main reason: The bigger the capsid, the more genes you need to produce it, and thus the larger the capsid needed to carry those genes. Many of the larger viruses (like Mimiviruses or Poxviruses) actually include &quot;scaffolding proteins&quot; in their genome, which help assemble the capsid since it's too large to assemble spontaneously.</p>
<p>But why aren't there any mutations that may help us? It's possible that there are; however, with so little space to work with, these viruses encode, in general, exclusively genes that help it survive. This includes the capsid genes, genes that help regulate its life cycle in the host cell, and in many cases genes that modulate the cell's defenses. Thus, any gene mutations that appear must benefit the virus first if it's going to survive. And due to the specificity of their genes, the likelihood that the virus will encode for a helpful protein for us is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that viruses can't be helpful. An emerging field is called <em>phage therapy</em>. Like /u/hard_to_lee said, viruses tend to be very specific to a certain cell type. This can mean it only infects skin cells, or it only infects a single species of bacteria. Due to this, we can use viruses specifically tailored for bacteria as an alternative to antibiotics. Since the virus is so specific, we can use them to kill the pathogenic (bad) bacteria without hurting us or the good bacteria inside us (called our microbiome). Phage therapy isn't available for humans yet, but it has been successful in animals.</p>

It's not hard to imagine how bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) could be useful.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometry student here. Your eyes have several stages of accommodation including tonic and proximal accommodation. </p>
<p>When your eyes have nothing to focus on they will relax to tonic accommodation which is the point where muscles rest with minimal nervous innervation.</p>
<p>If you suddenly hit a wall, your eyes will accommodate to the proximal distance of that wall based on previous life experience.</p>
<p>Edit: Accommodation is where the lens in your eye (imagine a magnifying glass) changes power to help bring a near image into focus.</p>
<p>Edit2: A few of you are curious about relaxing your eyes and accommodation to relieve eye strain. You can use the 20/20/20 rule: every 20 minutes stare at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. </p>
<p>Edit3: Accommodation is fully relaxed at 20 feet (6 meters) which is why you're tested at this distance when at the optometrist's office. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I travelled to Belize in 2006 and we explored a few different caves. Our tour guide told us that the few life forms down there were blind due to no light and their eyes having nothing to focus on. At one point while we were deep in the cave with absolutely no natural light, the tour guide had us all turn off our headlamps. Literally could see nothing at all, not even my hand 2 inches away from my face. After about a minute of pure darkness, I started to feel dizzy and felt like I was spinning. I couldn't tell which way was up or down anymore.</p>
<p>So, long story short, in true pitch black darkness, you can't see a damn thing (at least for the first 2 minutes)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
