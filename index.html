		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your retina are &quot;rods&quot; and &quot;cones&quot; that detect light.</p>
<p>Both are spread throughout your retina, but the cones are concentrated more in the middle and they detect colour. The rods are concentrated around the outside and edges and they detect brightness (no colour).</p>
<p>Evolutionary, this makes the center of your vision very good at distinguishing things. One example I like is that this lets us identify colours of forage when we focus on them. We don't need to identify berry colours (and whether they're safe to eat) in our peripheral vision. We have the time to focus on them.</p>
<p>In our peripherals, colour doesn't matter. We don't need to identify things, we just need to be alerted that they're there. Rods are great for this. They detect light level, so anything that changes and affects the brightness of the light reaching our eyes will be detectable. The main evolutionary purpose of this is likely to alert us of danger. If a threat is approaching from your peripheral, you don't need to know what colour it is, you just need to reliably see it. Threats typically come from the side or behind. Just recently the was a TIL about tiger attacks dropping off after masks were distributed to wear on the backs of heads. Many predators have evolved to attack from behind so as to not alert their prey.</p>
<p>The rod and cone distribution helps and hurts us in the dark. In the dark, colour vision is almost useless, which means your cones aren't helping much. This makes the center of our vision really poor in the dark. Our rods though are able to see the subtle differences in light level, which is very useful in the dark.</p>
<p>We don't typically notice this, because your brain is filling in missing information in your vision all the time. Even when you can't see colours well in your peripheral, you might have a few cones picking them up, and your brain sort of extrapolates that information by saying &quot;If that's blue, then the rest of it is probably blue too.&quot; Your brain is effectively taking inventory of all your vision data and using it to fill in the blanks. </p>
<p>If you sit and focus, you might notice that your peripheral vision doesn't have much colour detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your eyes have two types of sensors: rods and cones. Rods are better at seeing in the dark, but only in black and white. OTOH, cones can see colors but don't work so well in the dark.</p>
<p>You have more rods around the edges, so you are better at &quot;just seeing&quot; with your peripheral vision. Also, because there is a certain level of brightness that is too dark to see with cones, but enough for rods, you sometimes see less color in the dark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of cells in your retina that detect light, rod and cone cells. Cone cells are concentrated in the centre of your retina and rod cells are more around the outside i.e your peripheral vision is through your rod cells. When you see your nerves are sending signals to your brain, however to avoid sensing absolutely everything and overloading your brain with information a stimulus has to be strong enough to set off an action potential before a message is sent. Cone cells are each connected to their own neurone so require a larger stimulus to send a signal so do not work as well in low light but have higher resolution, several rod cells are connected to one neurone so the signals add up, meaning a smaller signal can set off a message and rod cells work better in low light, however this means lower resolution. Also while not relevant to your question cone cells see colour and rod cells see black and white. So this is why in low light levels you see better on your peripheral, have slightly worse sight in general, and don’t see colour as much, as in low light you rely more on your rod cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few reasons that all probably have something to do with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Solid blocks of ice don't melt all that fast (relatively speaking). <a href="http://blogs.goaj.org/amoore/2014/01/25/how-long-does-it-take-for-an-ice-cube-to-melt/" target="_blank">This class did an experiment</a> and found that even under a heat lamp it took more than an hour for an ice cube to fully melt! If a storm is strong enough, hail can start at the size of ice cubes or even larger. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The temperature decreases pretty fast as you go up in the atmosphere. In the desert, it is usually close to 5F per 1000 feet, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate#Dry_adiabatic_lapse_rate" target="_blank">dry adiabatic lapse rate</a>. Today in Las Vegas, the freezing level is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5nClWyR.png" target="_blank">pretty close to 15000 feet</a> (3 miles, 4.5 km) above the ground.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fall speed of hail is not all that slow. A hailstone <a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/hail/" target="_blank">only 1 cm (0.4 inches) across</a> falls at around 9 m/s (20 mph). At this speed it would only take 9 minutes to  fall from the freezing level. Large hail will fall even faster.</p>
</li>
<li>Hail falling all together will tend to cool the air around it, especially as it melts. It may have started at well over 100 degrees F near the ground, but I am sure the temperature of the air around the hail began cooling off quickly in just a few minutes.</li>

, its nerves being compressed and cut off . When ever you sit in a position or are in a position for a while that can COMPRESS nerves, they will stop transmitting. The nerve cells themselves will TRY to transmit at first, but when they don't receive feedback, they stop. This is the &quot;numbness&quot; or &quot;this body part fell asleep&quot; that we all experience. When the compression ends, the nerves can sense this and all at once begin a chain of &quot;testing&quot; aka sending out signals to all cells affected down the line, to make sure they are still there. Its like the electrical grid firing back up. It feels painful because our nerves use pain a response. The sensory organs in our brain after about 30 seconds to 120 seconds will shut this test firing pattern off and resume normal operations. But that time in between is pretty painful. It feels like Pins and needles because each sensation is a nerve &quot; thread ending &quot; being tested.

Copy of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/30d61w/when_a_part_of_your_body_falls_asleep_can_it/cprhn58/?st=jjt35mqo&amp;sh=a680b675" target="_blank">this post</a> below.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tingly feeling is usually related more to nerve impingement/entrapment. It's actually pretty hard to completely cut off blood flow to your limbs by compressing/ligating vulnerable vessels. Using the arm as an example, here is the <a href="http://imgur.com/CMtLdm4" target="_blank">blood supply</a>, and the <a href="http://imgur.com/CgykZRR" target="_blank">nerve supply</a> to the upper limb. (Source: Netter's <em>Atlas of Human Anatomy</em>). In the first image, note all the vessels that branch off of the subclavian, sections labelled 1 &amp; 2. The vessels that wrap around the back of the scapula (shoulder blade) and connect with the others around the glenohumeral joint (where the ball of the humerus meets the socket of the shoulder blade) provides <em>collateral circulation</em> even if the subclavian/brachial artery is pinched shut in the axilla (armpit), the most vulnerable point.</p>
<p>Now look at the nerves. With the exception of the musculocutaneous nerve, all the nerves that innervate the upper limb pass through the 'pit' of the axilla that is vulnerable to compression (The MC nerve is also vulnerable, just less so).</p>
<p>The same applies to compression at other vulnerable points, there's almost always better collateral blood supply than there is innervation, since taking out nerve supply upstream cuts off the downstream more effectively than with blood flow.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was a a second (or 1st?) year med student at the time so I'll expand a little - I focused on macro scale blood flow in that answer &amp; waved the rest away as &quot;nerve compression&quot;, but what actually happens with nerve compression? It's likely related to ischemia/impaired flow, but at the <em>microvascular</em> level supplying the nerve. The nerves have tiny blood vessels (vasa <del>vasorum</del> <em>nervorum</em>) that supply them, and compressing the nerve will compress these and can compromise the blood supply to the nerve.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10679707/" target="_blank">This abstract</a> has a decent overview, relevant part quoted below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>while the membrane depolarization produced by ischemia affects both transient and persistent Na(+) channels. Postischemic and posttetanic paresthesias occur when hyperpolarization by the Na(+)/K(+) pump is transiently prevented by raised extracellular K(+). The electrochemical gradient for K(+) is reversed, and inward K(+) currents trigger regenerative depolarization. These mechanisms of paresthesia generation can account for paresthesias in normal subjects and may be relevant in some peripheral nerve disorders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gist of which is that 1) cuteneous &amp; superficial sensory nerves are more likely to have &quot;false&quot; firing (see section above where I quoted) not related to actual stimuli; 2) ischemia (lack of blood flow) causes tissue pH to lower, this is balanced by exchange of Hydrogen ions outside cells for potassium ions inside such that Potassium in the fluid is higher. Then when this hits a tipping point, potassium flows back into the cells - including the nerve. This triggers depolarization (aka firing) of the nerve.</p>
<p>Typing this out between patients, please let me know if you have any questions or want more explanation of something! Hope this answered your question.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As people have already correctly mentioned, the pins and needle feeling is due to external pressure on a nerve.  I wanted to expand on it a little bit.  There are a couple of reasons why the pressure affects the nerves.  The most common reason for it is that the compression on the nerve temporarily cuts off the blood supply to that part of the nerve.  This results in a reversible injury to the nerve.  The numbness as well as the pins and needle sensation is called a paresthesia and the nerve injury is called a neurapraxia. </p>
<p>Now for the reason why you feel pins and needles.  What it actually is is your body's perception of pain from the nerve.  Nerves themselves are actually composed of a group of axons and a bunch of supporting cells.  An axon is an offshoot of the nerve cell (the neuron) and this axon is what brings the signal from one neuron to another.  These axons all send different signals.  There are certain axons that come from neurons that control movement.  There are other axons that come from neurons that control normal sensation and other axons that conduct the signal for pain.  When injured, these axons all recover at different rates.  The rate of recovery is dependent on a number of factors including the number of supporting cells and the axon's size.  It just so turns out that the axons that recover from the compression the fastest are the pain fibers and this is why you get the sensation of pins and needles first before you get any other sensation back.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the limb that fell asleep is temporary and harmless but if the pressure is on for an extended period of time, it can cause a long lasting or even permanent injury.  This is why, when a person undergoes surgery, the people working in the operating room take a lot of care in ensuring that no part of the body is being compressed too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fine. Low quality answers... Ha!  </p>
<p>The medical term for pins and needles is &quot;paresthesias&quot;. They usually occur when there is pressure on a nerve. Pressure on a nerve blocks conduction of neural activity in large diameter axons (nerve fibers) selectively, which leaves only conduction in small diameter fibers.  </p>
<p>The large diameter fibers in a sensory nerve are responsible for light touch and perceptions of length and force in muscles (proprioception). The small diameter fibers are responsible for crude touch, thermal sensation and nociception (responses to stimuli that cause pain in a conscious person).  </p>
<p>So, when there is pressure on a nerve, you lose light touch and proprioception, and you retain crude touch, thermal sensation, and pain. This results in the paresthesias feeling people report as numbness and tingling, or pins and needles. It usually means a nerve is partially blocked. </p>
<p>If a nerve is actually partially blocked, a doctor is instructed to map out the body region containing the paresthesias, and use their anatomical training to assign it to the location of the pressure block. Nerve root blocks in the back are common paresthesias (like sciaticia), but so is the paresthesia leading to Tommy John surgery (ulnar at the elbow), and Guion's canal (pinkie numb). </p>
<p>If you haven't fallen asleep yet in my lecture, the next segment will cover the Gate Control theory of Pain Perception, and how spinal cord stimulators achieve their analgesic effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see this Q has been answered but I’m too excited to not put in my two sense. This is actually my field! I work in neurophysiology interpreting nervous signals during surgeries that put the nervous system at risk. Mostly, they are spine procedures. Depending upon the position you’ll be laying in for surgery (particularly the prone “Superman” position) a system of nerves near your armpit is susceptible to discomfort of your arms are positioned awkwardly. In every day situations, if you are laying uncomfortably, you can feel the pins and needle sensation and adjust your position to relieve it. But for surgery, you won’t be able to wake up and adjust yourself. </p>
<p>What I do is attach electrodes to different parts of the body and interpret neurophysiological signals from your body that I detect. I can see the effects of mal-position and adjust your position for you so you don’t wake up with a paresthesia (which can last for quite a while). </p>
<p>Imagine going in for a back surgery and losing strength and sensation in your arms! That’s just one of the many reasons I might be on your OR team- to reduce the chance of you experiencing this post-op :) </p>

<p>The layer of cooled rock that covers the caldera is like the cap on the soda bottle.  Open it, even a little bit, and a bunch of gas will spew out, along with some magma (called lava when it comes out).  It’ll almost certainly tear the hole wider as it comes out, releasing more gas and lava.</p>

I know that today they use ion thrusters or they shoot fuel out the back to accelerate in space but I don’t get how that’s possible. From what I understand, space tries to “suck” everything from the spacecraft so if that space craft ejects fuel, wouldn’t the fuel be “sucked” from every direction once it exits the tail, therefore not providing an efficient thrust? The videos that explain this show that the fuel travels In a straight line directly opposite from the direction the spacecraft is going. </p></div></div>

<p>That said you are right. Since the stuff ejected is at higher pressure than the near perfect vacuum of space the rocket plume tend to expend quite a bit. This is what you see on <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1712/SpaceXLaunch_Bobchin_960.jpg" target="_blank">that picture</a>, as the rocket rises and the pressure decrease the jet gets wider and wider, and this is a source of lost energy.</p>
<p>Usually for propulsion system you try to have the pressure at the exit of the thruster as close as possible as the pressure outside to have a max efficiency. Another way of looking at it is that instead of having the gas molecules going in all directions and bumping into each other you want them to all go in the same direction. This is what the nozzle (bell shaped thing) of a rocket engine does. It lower the pressure of the plume and redirect it in the right direction. On <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Nozzle_de_Laval_diagram.svg/250px-Nozzle_de_Laval_diagram.svg.png" target="_blank">this schematic</a> you can see the pressure P and the temperature T decreasing as the gas goes through the nozzle and as a result the velocity V increases. The larger ratio between the wide part of the nozzle and the narrow part of the nozzle (what we call the throat) the lower the pressure will be and the more efficient the thruster will be in vacuum. The issue is that at some point the engine bell gets impractically large. So in practice you always have some energy lost to the residual pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's the weight of the column of air above the milkshake, extending into space pushing down on top of the milk shake as air pressure.  All you did by sucking was remove the weight of air on top of the milkshake straw that was holding it down.</p>
<p>Rockets use a concept called momentum conservation.  The best way to explain it is to get in something that can roll very easily, like a chair on coasters or a skateboard or on ice skates, and throw something heavy in one direction.  You should move in the opposite direction.  Usually we don't notice this while throwing because our feet have enough traction with the ground to push the other way.</p>
<p>Since momentum is conserved, if you push mass in one direction, your body should move in the opposite direction.  So all Rockets are doing is taking fuel and oxidizer, burning it, and using that energy to push it out the bottom as fast as possible, which makes the rocket go in the other direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Something people tend to forget is that after the propellant leaves the rocket, it doesn't contribute to propulsion.  At a middle school science level, remember when they were telling you about Newton's &quot;Every action has an equal and opposite reaction&quot;?  The examples they likely gave were propelling a rowboat using a paddle and propelling it by throwing bricks as hard as you can in the opposite direction.  Rockets are more like the brick throwing example, and the amount of air resistance the brick gets <em>after leaving your hand</em> doesn't affect how much the throw propels the boat.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the bricks are molecules of superexcited gas leaving a rocket.  The last time a molecule interacts with the rocket is the last time it affects the rocket.*  So whether those gas molecules run into air molecules after exiting the rocket or not isn't a factor.</p>
<p>* Actually, the last time a molecule affects the rocket is the last time it interacts with <em>another molecule</em> that subsequently interacts with the rocket, which is why atmosphere affects efficiency, but these interactions are small compared to the amount of molecules being expelled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Once the exhaust leaves the combustion chamber, the bell nozzle directs it mostly in the correct direction.

<p>[here](is a comparison between atmosphere optimized merlin engines, and vacuum optimized).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on other people's answers, while we don't know all the functions physiological sleep serves, there is good amount of evidence supporting the <em>two-process model of sleep</em> consisting of two parts.</p>
<p><strong>Process S</strong> is a sleep-dependent. It is caused by multiple factors, such as build-up of different compounds in the neurons. These include, for example, activity-related genes and molecules of adenosine. The feeling of restfulness comes from the clearing of these compounds during sleep. The role of adenosine can be easily seen in your daily life using coffee, which blocks the reseptors sensing the build up of adenosine, thus tricking your body to think there isn't as much sleep need built up. I also mentioned gene build up, which includes immediate early genes such as Homer1a, c-Fos, etc. These serve variety of functions, including the downscaling of synapses during sleep, driving plastic changes, conserving energy, and building up more resources for the next wake period. They are expressed in neurons in response to functional activity: for example high amount of planning and mental work builds up these genes in prefrontal cortex, leading the person to feel tired faster and the brain region to undergo synaptic reorganization during subsequent sleep period. The accumulation of Homer1a can be seen electrophysiologically using electroencephalogram (EEG). High accumulation of sleep need results in increased slow wave activity in the non-REM sleep early on during night. As the molecular correlates of sleep need are cleared from cells during the sleep, subsequent sleep cycles produce less and less slow wave activity. If the sleep is of insufficient depth or duration, some sleep need remains and you will wake up feeling unrested. </p>
<p><strong>Process C</strong> is a sleep-independent process. This side of sleep doesn't care about the activity the organism encounters during day or how much it has slept, it's essentially a clock. Certain genes in brain regions related to sleep-wake regulation flip in a timed manner during the day. They can be slightly modulated by environmental factors and affect the &quot;mental energy&quot; levels of a person, but they are mostly involved in subconscious functions, like time-dependent release of hormones during the day. The clock genes are unfortunately not fully adapted to 24hour day cycles, and if all natural light cycle is removed, the period of wakefulness starts to shift later and later.</p>
<p>There are also other factors regulating sleep, but the process S should answer to your question. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! I apologize in advance, I'm on mobile, so it's not as in-depth as it perhaps should be.</p>

Humans will start to hallucinate and eventually die if they don't sleep for a very long period of time, but we don't know why that happens either.</p>
<p>So yes, humans spend a third of their lifespan unconscious and hallucinating things that they'll likely forget before waking, and no one really understands why.</p>
<p>But we do know it is important.</p>
<p>We know that some things happen in the body when you sleep, but we don't quite understand the significance of sleep vs wakefulness. We know that sleep has some restorative effects, but we don't know what makes sleep special, as many of them are also accomplished while awake, but seem to progress more slowly.</p>
<p>The core question you asked does not have a very good answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies are valued based on their potential future earnings, not based on their past performance. If Company X is chugging along making $10 million in earnings every year, we might for example value that company at $50 million, or roughly 5 years earnings (beyond 5 years we would heavily discount any earnings because there is a lot of uncertainty and earnings 5 years out are less valuable to investors today).</p>
<p>If all of a sudden Company X has a bad year and makes only $9 million in earnings, even though it is still profitable it is going to influence our entire valuation model. Best case we would now be valuing the company at $45 million ($9m x 5), but worst case we might suspect that there is a strongly negative trend with the company and yearly earnings will continue to decrease, further depressing the company's value. That is when investors start to panic.</p>
<p>Edit: Valuation methods vary from industry to industry and from firm to firm, and I did not mean to suggest 5-year earnings was standard. However, pretty much all valuation methods will be doing some form of discounting of future cash flows similar to what I described.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In a healthy, expanding, inflationary economy, earnings should grow a little bit each year.  If they shrink, that can be a sign something is going wrong, something you want to try to fix before the company actually starts to lose money.</p>
<p>Also, most companies are investing profits into growth, opening new stores, increasing production, expanding to new product lines, thing than usually lose money for the first few years.  This is always a balancing act between growing fast enough to keep up with the competition and not growing so fast you become overextended.  Often reduced profits means they misjudged their growth strategy or the economy can no longer support it, and the way to correct that is scaling back the growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If a company makes less profit, the amount of money they pay shareholders for owning shares goes down.  This also means the value of the shares goes down.</p>
<p>This makes the shareholders angry.  They yell at the board and ceo, who yells at all the employees, and everybody gets very anxious and angry.</p>
<p>If the company cant stop their earnings getting smaller each year, the shareholders get so upset they sell their shares.  Because more people want to sell the shares then buy them, this makes the sharss worth even less.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies' value comes from roughly 10-20 years of earnings (so today people are buying and selling stocks based on their expectations of the company's earnings from now to 2028 or 2038).  Most of the time earnings are fairly precisely forecast for about 2 years, then a growth rate is applied.  </p>
<p>When a company announces earnings dropping by some amount, it usually means both less earnings now, but more importantly less earnings for the next two years of forecasts, and a growth rate that's closer to the inflation rate for the rest of the forecast.  Further, because earnings are one of the primary sources of corporate cash, reducing earnings expectations means the company will have less money to expand, develop products and other business activities.  </p>
<p>Because all these changes happen pretty rapidly after a disappointing earnings is announced, a tiny change now can mean a huge reduction in investors expectations for earnings over the next 10-20 years, which means the company's value can drop pretty dramatically.  </p>
<p>It's sort of like a huge ship turning a few degrees as it leaves port.  It's a small change now, but after the ship travels a few thousand miles, it means a large change in their ending location.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons.  First, a lot of congestion is caused by mucus.  Your nostrils don't stay separate for long: they merge into one big passage at the back of the nose called the &quot;nasopharynx&quot;. The nasopharynx opens right over your mouth and throat.  Gravity will make fluid run downward, so if you put the stuffy side up, any blocking fluid may run out of the way eventually.</p>
<p>Second, your body is about 60% water by weight. Because fluids including water and blood naturally follow gravity, any part of your body placed lower than another will have extra.  If your nose is low compared to the rest of you, or one part is lower than another, you might get some congestion because there is extra fluid in the blood vessels and tissue around the nose. This is more pronounced in the nose than elsewhere, too, because you have a lot of blood vessels in some parts of your nose.  (Your body works hard against gravity to keep fluid from pooling in places by pumping blood, but it isn't always perfectly successful).</p>
<p>Finally, your nose has something called a &quot;nasal cycle.&quot;  If you google a cross-section of the inside of your nose, you would see curled shelves of bone on the outer wall, called &quot;conchae&quot; or &quot;turbinates.&quot;  These shelves are covered in tissue that can fill with blood when activated by a nerve, just like the penis or clitoris.  This cycle moves from one nostril to the other every couple of hours, so if you stay on one side for long enough, eventually the top side will unblock.  Not because of gravity, but simply because it was time to switch.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that very small changes in the size of a tube, like your nose, can cause big changes in the ability for air (or water, or whatever) to pass through it. This is denser than necessary by ELI5, but Poiseuille's Law tells us that the radius of a tube increases or decreases flow by a power of four- that means small decreases in the space in your nose can have a huge effect on air flow.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your nose is blocked, it's more often than not nothing to do with a blockage in the nasal cavity, but rather a buildup of fluid in the sinuses that 'pinch off' the airflow. When you lie on the opposite side, gravity redistributes these fluids, and the other side becomes blocked instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Out of consideration for clinical sleeping disorders, most of the time your body is responding to a process called 'homeostasis' where your body wants to maintain balance. This can take form as a response to several preemptive symptoms like: muscle relief due to spasming, cramping, temperature regulation, and other contributing factors (including stress, medication and diet).</p>
<p>Also, your circadian rhythm, or the cycle in which your body operates to maintain homeostasis, may be off due to different situations. Some situations can include heavy / lack of exercise, postponing your normal sleep time, or experiencing light (artificial or solar) at too close of a time point of your planned deep sleep time. </p>
<p>Your circadian rhythm greatly impacts a lot of hormones, chemicals, metabolic and neurological processes in your body, so it's understandable how if you get out of a routine, you may have trouble sleeping, comfortably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
