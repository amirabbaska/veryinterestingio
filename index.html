		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar engineer here. Let me explain some of this that's been covered by some people already.</p>
<p><strong>Why Not Solar In Deserts?</strong>
If we are talking a new array away from people, someone has to lay out all of the infrastructure for it to deliver power to the grid. At the same time, someone also needs to figure out how to shut it down when the largest source of power on that power grid fails because pumping electricity into a powered down grid can have disastrous results. This is typically solved in home solar with a fast disconnect, in which if power to the home stops the array ceases function to help the main power company in the area get things going again.</p>
<p>Next is maintenance on the panels. The thing about large constructions in remote areas or even out of the way spaces is that most companies that put something out there intend not to have to come back to it unless they absolutely have to. The issue with this and solar is panels may die, panels need cleaning, sun tracking mountings are expensive as fuck, and you'd have to pay for all the equipment and people to facilitate taking care of all this. The same fast disconnect isn't a great solution at this kind of scale either. Large power systems like this require a lot of extra engineering and planning and sometimes implementing solutions that don't even exist or cannot just be found off the shelf. (Gonna also drop that you'd have to landscape the desert unless you find a really nice flat spot and even then, you may want to have a leveler come through anyways.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a lot that needs to be managed that just aren't realistic to manage. At the same time, anyone who puts an array out somewhere needs a way to make money off it. They probably aren't going to be able to get the power company to pay for large sums of solar power without it being discounted a lot. After all, if I was a power company I don't need to buy power from someone else. The city may not because they are already getting power from the already existing grid owner. Leaving you only able to sell to new developments and offer power along side the power company to homeowners, at which point, why aren't you just an extension of the power company? And the power company does not have an industry interest in solar because fossil fuel is a bigger money industry. (This statement is wrong, check out /u/Halfway_Bayesian <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5woe50/eli5_why_cant_we_just_cover_a_proportion_of_the/decu3tf/" target="_blank">post</a>.) At the same time, your power needs to be as always available as a regular power company for emergencies and panels do not produce much at night.</p>
<p><strong>Future of Solar then?</strong>
I honestly think that the future of solar right now is in residential. Most homes can hold enough panels on their roof to offset all of their electrical costs and for a pretty fair price (about the cost of a car, between $10,000 to $40,000. Consider pricing is on average, $3.50 per watt on a panel.) I've seen in just the last two or three years alone panels going from 225w panels to 290w along side batteries and even solar shingles. The technology is improving fast and we will see a lot more of it in the next few years. However keep in mind too, not every place in the world is geographically suitable for solar power. Locations too far North and too far South won't get great benefits from solar power. Neither would a place that you could essentially call a forest. Solar I don't believe sells well in Canada or states and countries along the same latitude as Washington or Oregon state. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5woe50/eli5_why_cant_we_just_cover_a_proportion_of_the/dect48o/" target="_blank">Check out Huppie's post here.</a> where they discuss solar at these more northern latitudes, I learned something new.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, if you live in Utah with a good South facing roof, 8 modules of 290w are enough to offset 3,000-4,000 kWh of usage at your home. For a lot of small homes, this can be all you use for a year. A lot of solar companies offer their own maintenance services or even equipping an array with other necessities like &quot;critter cages&quot; to keep birds and squirrels out from under your panels. Otherwise, you may have a ton of fried birds under your panels. They get hot.</p>
<p><strong>Problems that Face Solar</strong>
The biggest issue with the solar industry for individuals is electrical companies because they are virtually untouchable. The reason is that they technically own the power grid and if the entire city depends on it, there is nothing that can really be done. A lot of power companies lobby to keep solar out as well. If you do some research, Nevada was a booming industry. Then Warren Buffet's Pacificorp, changed how solar customers pay their bill for having solar. Essentially, they put up a premium that brings your power bill to, still less than before, but not as much savings. On top of that, you're now also buying power from a solar company or paying for panels under a loan or lease. Pacificorp, claims that they lose millions of dollars per year on administrative fees and are recouping that cost from solar customers with this premium. Some electrical companies won't even allow residents they service to have a solar panel system.</p>
<p>There needs to be more policies for solar friendly developments and incentives for the industry. There are some, but there are also powers in the world that are cornering the market on power and do not want solar coming around because so far, solar companies are already undercutting profits from the grid owning electric company. I think there needs to be a lot more cooperation between power companies and solar companies rather than the electrical companies governing and restricting how power is being provided to consumers in an area.</p>
<p>Tldr: <strong>Solar panels require a lot of maintenance, the idea itself has a lot of business and municipal policy issues, and these same issues extend to the entire solar industry. Its much more feasible for residential solar to be happening for society as these same problems tend to be cheaper when costs can be levied on a private customer.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be the one to do that though, do it.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So electricity. It needs to be moved and can only be used as generated without significant infrastructure. So lets just look at moving Electricity from Arizona to say Maine.</p>
<p>Line losses. Electricity needs to be at high voltages to move it. that is why AC won out over DC. Not because Tesla rocked and Edison was a jackwad, but because DC has a limited transmission range. Literally in the couple miles range. </p>
<p>So we need AC. Solar generally makes DC. So the DC needs to be put into a converter that makes the DC into AC. Because we live in reality and not theory or make-believe there will be losses in converting the DC to AC. </p>
<p>Also a line 100 miles (160 kilometres) at 765 kV carrying 1000 MW of power can have losses of 1.1% to 0.5%. A 345 kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%. So if we ran 765KV line from Arizona to Maine is like 2800 miles long. That is a considerable amount of losses. That comes out to about a 25% or better loss in the transmission of that power. </p>
<p>So to combine the losses in the generation and swap to AC and the line losses you end up losing a huge amount. Additionally at the beginning and the end you have to step up and then step down the voltages. That incurs more losses. So overall the losses from the Sun hitting the PV panels to someone turning on their TV in maine incurs a huge efficiency penalty.</p>
<p>So while the solar source is free, the transmission equipment, transformers, and all the other equipment is not. So now if you take the standard that solar runs at: about 10-25% and apply that and the losses you get huge generation numbers for what would need installed. 11 million MW hours of power were consumed. </p>
<p>So to math this 11,000,000 MWh of power needed. So we need to up the production to account for the losses. So let's divide that up into 365 days of use and 24 hours per day. That comes out to needing an average of 1255 MW of production. Now we add the losses we have to make up for. That comes out to 1794 MW of production. Then we have to throw in the Capacity factor of solar. The industry runs low compared to other power systems. But a plant in Arizona has been hitting 29% so we can use that. that means we need to start with 6185 MW of faceplate capacity. </p>
<p>And we need to be able to store that power. We haven't added storage in yet. Since the solar must be stored some place for when the sun is down. That will add in more losses and therefore more base capacity to meet the needs of the end user. </p>
<p>Agua Caliente is 84 MW of faceplate capacity on 2400 acres. So we need to multiple and we come up with 176,735 acres give or take. That is about 276 sq. miles of solar. </p>
<p>The problem is not with the production of solar electricity. The problem is with storing and moving the solar electricity. The other thing we have not talked about is maintaining grid stability. Thousands of small PV site feeding into a huge grid with nothing to anchor the grid will make it unstable. When a large industrial plant starts a bug line up or a aluminum recycler starts the induction heating process that load has to be absorbed and these small PV suppliers cant handle it. </p>
<p>There are vast engineering problems that need to be solved here. NO it is not impossible, but it needs to be looked at as a whole, not just little pieces. Too many people assume the only thing that needs power is homes and basic lighting and ignore the rest of the grid and the businesses and industry we have in this country. We need a grid they can rely on. The problems are solvable, but not by activists pushing their favorite flavor of solution or the neat product of the day. </p>
<p>Power walls are great. Except for all the drawbacks they have that we ignore. Solar is great except for some of the drawbacks. nuclear is great except for some of the drawbacks. </p>
<p>Ask your self why we are shutting down already operational and carbon free nuclear plants, but are willing to pay extra in taxes to build carbon free NEW renewables. It is stupid. And it ignores the facts of the grid and engineering. Solar cannot be used as abase load. And the technology for storage is more in its infancy than renewables are. And before we can really have any chance of renewables really supplying the whole of the grid, storage has to be solved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who would be doing it? If you're doing it for the public good that's a government project and you need to convince stubborn politicians that it's a good idea. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>If you're expecting to make money you need to deal with ongoing maintenance costs as well as the initial setup (even if initial setup is relatively cheap these days). And then you need to make they money back by selling the power, but what if the price of power goes down because you're providing it in such large amounts?</p>
<p>There are some practical concerns though.</p>
<p>Moving electricity is not free or completely efficient. Distributing power around an entire country ends up wasting a lot of it and requiring strong infrastructure and these problems would be even worse with one central source a far distance from where the power is used.</p>
<p>And what about nighttime? Storing electricity is a problem that has NOT been solved on the type of large scale such as &quot;powering a whole country&quot;. And solar panels on opposite sides of the world somehow covering for each other when one side is in the dark increases the problem of distribution even further. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You can keep a barrel of oil for months and it will still be good.<br />
You can cart a barrel of oil halfway across the world and it will still be good. And we do this. A lot.<br />
A barrel also doesn't cost much to make and can be made out of cheap materials.  </p>
<p>Getting solar power from the Sahara to Stuttgart is going to be difficult.<br />
Once it's electricity it has to be used immediately.<br />
Batteries are really expensive and made out of things that are bad for the environment.<br />
Other cheaper things like boiling salt lose energy very quickly.<br />
Building power lines that far will cause a lot of power to be lost on the way.  </p>
<p>Some scientist are working of a way to turn the energy into oil and burn it later, but it's still in the experimental phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cost, maintenance.</p>
<p>And the real kicker:  transfer losses and storage.</p>
<p>Not enough people would live near by to be able to maintain it cost effectively.</p>
<p>Sand can cause wear and tear on &quot;things&quot; so you would have to engineer around that.</p>
<p>And no major population centers nearby deserts, typicall, so the amount of power lost on the wire would be very high.</p>
<p>And storage:  would still need to produce power at night.</p>
<p>So a hybrid approach would be cool.</p>
<p>I don't know why they don't put solar collectors on the outsides of the windmills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye movement is controlled by a couple different mechanisms that are essentially reflex mediated. The first is saccadic movement. This is the fast, voluntary movement you use to 'lock onto' an object. The movement of the eye is so fast that there is a phenomenon called saccadic masking where the brain ignores visual input during the saccade to avoid blurring of the vision during eye movement. Yes, you go temporarily blind when you move your eyes with saccadic motion. Saccades are controlled by the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus allowing for fixation of the eyes on a point. Saccades can rotate the eye up to 500^o per second. </p>
<p>The next type of reflex/eye movement is called smooth pursuit. The exact neuronal circuitry for this is still up for debate, but we do know that the cerebral cortex, cerebelleum, and superior colliculus are involved. This eye movement allows you to track a moving object without the need for saccades. This reflex also requires input from the pre-frontal cortex, and is often suppressed under the effects of alcohol. This is why a sobriety test involves tracking a finger across the visual field; under the influence of alcohol the brain cannot perform smooth pursuit so the brain resorts to saccades, resulting in what looks like nystagmus. </p>
<p>The next type of eye reflex is the vestibular-occular reflex. This mechanism takes orientation/acceleration input from the inner ear and processes the data so that as your head moves, your eyes move in the opposite direction. This is why your vision doesn't jump around when you walk or move. You can try it by nodding your head up and down: your head moves, but your eyes move opposite, so the resulting visual image appears stationary. It even works with eyes closed.</p>
<p>So in summary, there are three main control mechanisms for eye movement, saccades, smooth pursuit, and the vestibulo-occular reflex. Saccades allow for precise fixation, smooth pursuit allows for tracking a moving object, and the V-O reflex reduces signal noise from head movement. </p>
<p>E: Thanks for the gold, really cool. I just got home and saw this, I'll try answer the unanswered questions.</p>
<p>Just a couple points of clarification: saccadic masking takes the blur out and replaces it with the end image after the saccade. You don't actually go blind, your brain still 'sees something'. This is why if you saccade onto the second hand of a clock it can seem to pause longer than a second. Apologies for the unclear wording above. And to everyone asking about 'why' vs 'how' these reflexes work/exist I'll just leave you with the words of <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=0h0m4s&amp;v=MO0r930Sn_8" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Up until the 18th century, the common word used for adult members of Oryctolagus cuniculus was “coney,” which was pronounced “cunny.” Eventually, that word fell out of favor because of its similarity to a word that was becoming increasingly more commonly used as a vulgarity. So timid souls along the way chose a rhyming alternative, and “coney” became “bunny.”</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something that is still debated. First, some people insist they only need 5 or 6 hours of sleep a night and then survive off sugar and coffee to stay awake. Very few people can actually do this healthily, but some can. Scientists have linked a gene to most of the people who survive on extremely little sleep, but it's still unsure what exactly does. But ignoring extremes, its probably mostly a matter of efficiency. </p>
<p>For example. Given the exact same lifestyle otherwise, some people need around 2000 calories a day while another needs 2500 for the same lifestyle. So that is a matter of how efficiently their body processes calories. The same can be true of sleep. Someone whose body falls into deeper sleep more quickly and who has fewer periods of wakefulness might need less sleep than someone whose body needs a while longer to achieve the same depth of sleep. It also could be their brain just more effectively using the sleep. Some may be caused by personal sleep habits and some genetics. It would be more strange if everyone needed identical amounts of sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As is the simple answer for most questions pertaining to biology: genetics. </p>
<p>Sleep has a number of hypothesized functions, but it is clearly intended as a restorative period for the body to recover from stress, injury, and exertion. </p>
<p>Your tissues heal quicker.  There is evidence that sleep literally cleans your brains of toxins accumulated during the day: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/18/236211811/brains-sweep-themselves-clean-of-toxins-during-sleep" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/18/236211811/brains-sweep-themselves-clean-of-toxins-during-sleep</a></p>
<p>The reasons for why someone may need less sleep than someone else are myriad.  Perhaps they produce <em>less</em> toxins while awake, and thus need less sleep to recover.  Or perhaps they produce the same amount of toxins, but are simply <em>more efficient at clearing them out</em>.  </p>
<p>As it goes with genetics, there is likely no single &quot;right answer&quot;.  Two people who both only need 4 hours of sleep per night may have very different genetic reasons for only needing 4 hours of sleep. </p>
<p>One man, Dean Karnazes (<a href="http://www.storypick.com/the-man-who-can-run-forever/" target="_blank">http://www.storypick.com/the-man-who-can-run-forever/</a>) has a rare genetic mutation that essentially gives him abnormally fast healing, so fast, in fact, that he can run and his body <em>recovers faster that it breaks down while running</em>. </p>
<p>Life is full of these little quirks.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The long and short of it is mental discipline allows a sleep deprived person to perform better than a less disciplined tired person. They do not perform 'the same' as a person who got good sleep, but they can minimize the problems the lack of sleep can cause so their performance suffers less than it could have if they were not disciplined. </p>
<p>I sleep on average 4 to 5 hours a night for most of my adult life. When I was younger I would need 12-16 hours on the weekend in order to make up the sleep debt of doing that during the week. I'm in my early 40's now and I only need 8 hours of sleep on the weekends to feel refreshed with 4-6 hours typical during the week. </p>
<p>I feel as tired I think as anyone else who slept only a few hours over several days so it's not that I don't need the sleep, it's just that sometimes I can't, and by sometimes I mean most of the time. However, my ability to be productive even being so tired is a learned ability that took time to develop. So for me it has less to do with me not needing the sleep, because I do, and more to do with me being able to stay productive even dead on my feet, which is a learned skill and not a physical attribute. </p>
<p>I am a bright person in general, and I can cruise control my way through most demanding situations so this helps a lot. When I am tired I am not thinking very clearly, but because things tend to come easy for me, it helps make up for this so that I'm just average on very little sleep instead of a zombie. When I get really good sleep for a few days by comparison, I feel like life takes on a clarity I seldom see and it feels like I'm finally awake and thinking clearly. IE normal, but I'm abnormal so much, normal seems weird. </p>
<p>There are some tricks to being productive when you're tired. The first and foremost is strong mental stamina. You have to have enough self control to not drift or doze off while driving, when bored, when listening to a lecture or attending a meeting. You have to force yourself to concentrate, and catch yourself when you begin to drift and mentally slap yourself awake. This is probably the skill I have the most development in. I can sleep 4 hours a night for a week straight, yet read boring technical articles at my desk without falling asleep at work. I have different thought exercises I do to maintain focus and re-invigorate my mind. Sometimes I do allow myself a few minutes to day dream say during a break or lunch. This re-invigorates me for the next few hours. </p>
<p>Ironically the less I sleep, the harder it is for me to sleep. I am tired, but wide awake, and falling asleep is difficult. However, the better rested I am, the easier it is to rest. So if I am not careful, I tend to get worse and worse, sleeping less and less, until I reach a crisis point where my performance degrades too far and I am exhausted yet still unable to sleep. And alternatively if I'm on vacation or something, and allow myself to sleep as much as I want, I could literally sleep the day away as the more rested I become, the more drowsy and sleepy I am. </p>
<p>I work in a demanding technical field and my ability to recognize and troubleshoot problems, and to communicate and reason in clear and articulate ways is important. I enjoy a frappacino every morning, but otherwise do not drink coffee or soda. I don't use stimulants to wake up or stay alert as they would make me jittery which I don't like. I tend to be awake at all hours of the night which has lead  to some people wondering if I ever sleep since they see facebook and reddit comments from me all through the night and day. I am able to sleep soundly and stay asleep most of the time even if woken. But I have struggled to fall asleep most of my life. My ability to sleep and hold a sleep schedule is my biggest challenge in life and the one that has the greatest impact on my quality of life and happiness. It's a problem I struggle with continuously. I don't really drink other than a cider every so often, and I don't do drugs. I'm also not an energetic and hyper person. I'm laid back and kind of introverted but friendly socially. I am just this way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Practice plays a big part in this. We are programmed to sleep 8-10 hours a night.
With various stages occurring during sleep. </p>
<p>Evolutionarily, it is highly advantageous for us to be asleep, immobile all night long so that we would not be out wandering with the wolves, and other such predators which we likely will be unable to see before it's too late. Therefore, the long period of darkness allowed this to occur at a slow leisurely rate.</p>
<p>Our natural sleep habits reflect this. However, for the same reasons it is pretty inefficient, and with enough practice, you can acclimate your body to function on less sleep, through a concept known as sleep compression. How much compression can occur varies, dependant on genetics. For some, little can occur-perhaps they have a more wild genome. For a lucky few, it can be compressed down to 2 hours a night. Generally, the limit is around 6.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine for a moment that no matter how long you slept, you did not feel refreshed after sleeping. Instead you felt like you only slept about an hour. Yet, you still have to get up and go to work and do all the other things you would do.</p>
<p>This was the case for me. I had fibromyalgia and didn't know it. Basically I never get into REM sleep where recovery of the mind and body happen. So no matter how much I sleep, I never feel rested. 2 hours, or 12 hours of sleep feel exactly the same to me. So I spent 5 years only sleeping 5-6 hours a night, followed by 10 years of only sleeping 2-3 hours a night.</p>
<p>All the while I worked as an Electrician and Electrical contractor. while playing in band and coaching little league football. To say I was burning the candle at both ends really don't describe it, it was more like I threw my candle into a blast furnace.</p>
<p>In 2002 I started suffering from severe anxiety and felt my body getting weaker and weaker all the while. By mid June it was all I could do to go to work and lay down on my couch. I stopped going to the kids practices and games for sports. Stopped visiting people. Pretty much just laid on my couch and worked.</p>
<p>In November of that year after jillions of tests, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and told my working career was over. Three years later I had a heart attack at age 44. I have high blood pressure, liver disease, diabetes, asthma, and widespread pain, every day of my life.</p>
<p>So my answer is, while some people can apparently get by with very little sleep, it can have long term consequences beyond just feeling tired at work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first time someone thought to try and answer this was sometime in the 50s and the paper was called 'the cocktail party problem' they basically posed the question 'how is it, when I'm in a room full of 100 people at a cocktail party, that I can easily ignore many other voices and focus in on my target conversation?' </p>
<p>Since that time hundreds of studies have tried to pinpoint how it is possible for the human ear to cut through all the stimulation and information that is constantly bombarding the auditory system in order to hear the desired source of sound. </p>
<p>If we start from Outside the ear and go in I think it will it will. Make the most sense. </p>
<p>Ever noticed how when someone calls your name and you can immediately turn your head pretty much by reflex and be looking at the source of that sound?
The way each individuals ear is shaped 'bounces' the wave made by the sound and as it enters the ear and through years of practice (perfected Thru our development as a child) our brain has essentially figured out that if a wave has hit the timpanic membrane (ear drum) in a certain way it is most likely coming from a specific location. A study I recall changed the contours of people's ears and found that they were now terrible at locating specific sound sources. </p>
<p>So that's how we can separate a stream in space, it becomes more complex when there are competing noises, but already we have one way of separating that stream and hearing it over other noises by knowing where it's coming from. </p>
<p>Now focussing in a bit more on the guitar stream which you can now easily separate from the bass, drums and vocalist or whatever other distractions there are. With headphones on, your unique ear shape is now taken out of the equation - so how do we do it? </p>
<p>Luckily, many people have asked a similar question and it's mainly based upon the properties of the waveform of the sound (frequency, amplitude etc) and how loud the noise is (decibel lvl) </p>
<p>I've just arrived at work though so will have to defer until later, if you guys want me to keep going, I'll hit it up later in the afternoon. </p>
<p>OK, I'm back. </p>
<p>From many many studies we have realised that humans are incredibly well adapted to hear sound in a specific range of frequency, but not very good outside of this (think dog whistle, or mosquito tones). The advantage of this for example is when you talk on the telephone, decibel levels are low and overall quality of sound is pretty terrible (especially back in the day!) but we still usually hear with ease on the phone. This is because of something called attenuation. So in the case of the telephone, the speech is battling against white noise or static. Static has a pretty specific frequency which is not really at all close to the frequency of human speech which makes it easy for our well adapted systems to essentially find the noise that has excited the finely tuned 'hair like' fibres in our inner ear that tickle our nervous system and then increase the amount of excitation of the desired stream whilst decreasing the excitement caused by the undesired or static stream of noise. </p>
<p>Taking this Thru to the sound in your headphones, it's pretty much the exact same process. The guitar has a different frequency  and amplitude compared to the bas compared to the drums etc etc. However it's not as straight forward as say human speech vs static because the frequencies are all sitting in a similar zone. </p>
<p>So how do we differentiate similar sounds?
This is where it starts to get a LOT more complicated and there is a lot of 'top down' higher processing in the brain where we combine visual cues, learned experiences and pattern recognition (just to name a few). To take it back to you being able to separate the guitar and focus in on that after listening to the song, you have essentially learned how to fine tune your top down processes through experience, concentration and pattern recognition (for example learning the melody of the riff) and combining this tune up with the basic information or cues that your ear is delivering to the brain. </p>
<p>I think thats probably enough detail for an ELI5 haha! </p>
<p>But for a quick addit because I do find it interesting:</p>
<p>Were best at differentiating one voice from static.
Then a little worse at differentiating a voice from a tonal noise (singular frequency - like a droning beep)
A little worse again for beeping tones
Worse again for differentiating a female to a male voice
Worse again for differentiating same sex to same sex voice
Worst at differentiating the same voice from the same voice. </p>
<p>Extrapolate from that as you will! </p>
<p>The cocktail party problem paper should be easy to source online in the meantime, it's a godly paper!</p>
<p>The above only touches the surface of how complex the whole thing actually gets, this is why siri and other voice recognition programs still have absolutely NOTHING on the marvel that is our own, grown auditory system! </p>
<p>Edit: realised I didn't answer the why can't we stop hearing the breathing noises etc once we've clued onto them. </p>
<p>My memory on this one is hazy, nonetheless.. </p>
<p>Most natural noises that we hear (birds, monkeys, crickets, geckos for example)are at the basic level, single tone, repetitive noises - much like the breathing in a song, or someone continually saying 'umm' during a speech. This next bit is a stretch because I can't recall studying papers that specifically looked at this, but basically, evolutionarily it has been beneficial for us to be able to hear natural noises for reasons of survival or safety. Think monkeys or birds fleeing from danger, they're noisy, the caveman wakes up because we are hard-wired to attenuate and increase the excitement of the hairs (like above) that are being hit by the repetition of nature giving us the heads up that danger is about. </p>
<p>Try playing with your top down processing and see if you can modulate the annoying breath of the singer to make it a less dominant stream - change from focussing in on guitar to bass to drums - practice makes perfect, see musicians for evidence of the finely tuned ear. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because right from the moment we're born, we're becoming pattern matchers. That's really at the core of what the brain does - it's a pattern matcher.</p>
<p>Someone blind from birth, whose eyesight is suddenly fixed - they're now, at age whatever, seeing for the first time - can't make sense of what they're looking at. It's just noise. Their brain has never had to deal with incoming visual information, so it has to learn how to recognise things.</p>
<p>And when we're born, our senses, particularly sight and sound, are just streams of input our brains don't know what to do with. But gradually, our brains spot patterns in the data - repeated chunks - and from then on we can start to at least acknowledge that &quot;ahh - that's a pattern I've got previous experience of&quot;. </p>
<p>It happens consciously at first - we <em>notice</em> the pattern, even if we don't know what it means, and then as the pattern starts to become more frequent and familiar, our brain thankfully starts to do it without requiring our conscious attention, and we can start dealing with higher-level things. Instead of thinking &quot;that pattern of sounds is familiar, and in the past that pattern has coincided with Mum handing me something to eat&quot; we can let the subconscious brain do that for us and just consider the sound, consciously, as meaning &quot;Food!&quot;</p>
<p>This starts to happen at higher and higher levels.</p>
<p>Think of the way we learn to walk. It starts with a conscious effort to move this muscle, then that one, to move our foot; after a while the brain has learnt the pattern - these kinds of patterns we may consider more as <em>habits</em>, but they're still just patterns - and we stop having to think about which muscles to contract in which order, and we can concentrate on the higher level tasks. <em>I need to move my foot forward</em> then <em>I need to move my body-weight forward</em> and then <em>I need to swing the other leg forward</em>. After a while, even that pattern of tasks can be left to the subconscious, and we can eventually just start thinking <em>I need to walk over to the table</em> - the brain now having layer upon layer of task management in place to break that high level desire down into which muscles need to be triggered.</p>
<p>Eventually we stop even needing to think &quot;I need to walk over there&quot; and we can just think &quot;I'm going to get a drink from the fridge&quot; and lo and behold, a whole complex set of tasks gets broken down by the brain, further and further, subtask into subtasks, right down to which muscle to trigger, which senses need to be monitored so we know when to stop triggering the muscles.</p>
<p>So when you hear the guitar riff, it's because your brain has built up this enormous hierarchy of logic that lets it handle the stream of  vibrations coming in, organising it into frequencies and timbres, determining that those particular ones are recognisable as &quot;guitar&quot;, letting us separate them out from the jumble.</p>
<p>It's useful to understand this, because it informs how we <em>learn</em> stuff - if you want to play the piano, start slowly enough to <em>get it right</em>, and after you've got it right enough times, your brain can do it for you and you'll find you can play it faster without having to consciously think about it. And it explains why we sometimes need to unlearn stuff that we got wrong - the brain's trying to hive off these tasks for us, and if we keep getting <em>that difficult bit</em> wrong, our brain will have (un)helpfully turned the mistake into a habit. So if you're learning a tune and you keep getting a bit wrong - stop! <em>Get it right</em> before going on. If that means slowing down to a crawl so you can consciously move this finger onto that note, then this finger onto this note, then that's what you must do. Don't just start the piece again and hope you'll thunder through getting it right next time.</p>
<p>And all this pattern matching / habit forming stuff is so important to understand because it's how our emotions work too. </p>
<p>Happy people are in the habit of being happy, and unhappy people are in the habit of being unhappy. That's not to say you can just choose to be happy if you're not, but you <em>do</em> have a level of control over it. Just like playing the piano, you can, if you notice your brain making emotional mistakes - like saying to yourself &quot;I'm just an idiot&quot; or &quot;I'll never get over <em>x</em>&quot; - stop! <em>Consciously</em> correct the error: tell yourself (whether it seems believable or not) &quot;I may have done an idiotic thing, but that does not mean I'm set in stone as an idiot&quot; or &quot;I'm having difficulty getting over <em>x</em> but that's to be expected right now and I <em>will</em> recover, given time&quot;.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether you feel deep down that it's true; if you correct the error enough times, after a while your brain will do it for you. You'll stop telling yourself you're an idiot. Your brain's habits - your internal monologue - will change. Your outlook will change. </p>
<p>We are just pattern-matching habit-forming creatures, and it's a blessing as it lets us think about, and do, higher level, more abstract things. But it's easy to get into bad habits, physically (getting that fingering wrong) and emotionally (letting our internal monologue get into cycles of negativity). Just never forget that every habit can be changed, and it always happens in small steps. Carpe diem.</p>
<p>(and since this has gone off on a bit of a tangent, man, I wish I'd never learnt to spot bad kerning. It's the first thing my brain screams at me now, before I've even read the <em>words</em> I'm looking at)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our ability to focus on a sound or an image is our mind ability to perform real time pattern recognition. Once you have a mental model of what you are looking for, your mind then listens for that pattern and draws your attention to anything fitting that pattern. It's all mental. For instance when you play a &quot;Wheres Waldo&quot; game and look at the big complicated picture, you are looking for a pattern of red and white to find his hat. Your mind ignores most of the other input and searches for the pattern in your mind. You might not even notice something like a person with 6 fingers, or wearing their hat upside down, because it doesn't match the pattern. When you listen to a song and hear a guitar, you perceive what the guitar is doing, the melody, timing, etc. Then you can remember that pattern, and look for it again easier the 2nd time. </p>
<p>Everything we see, hear, taste, and feel is perceived by us after a considerable amount of processing in the brain. Your senses are not a direct way of experiencing the world. In other words when you look at something, you aren't seeing the unfiltered 'direct' view of it. For instance we all have blind spots in our eyes, we lose focus towards the outside, we have veins and liquid in our eyes causing lines and spots in our vision. The mind filters out this background level of sensation, and highlights the things we need to see, like the edges of objects, motion, bright colors, etc. </p>
<p>Your sense of hearing is similar in that the actual sounds around you are not what you hear, but instead you hear your brains interpretation of those sounds. And much like the eyes, the brain makes up for deficiencies in our hearing organs, and filters out noise and other things we don't need to hear. Instead it can pick out sounds through mental filtering and draw attention to them by frequency, position, and loudness. </p>
<p>For instance you can listen to a box fan and tune it out so you don't pay attention to it. Yet the very quiet sound of a bee flying close to your head instantly grabs your attention even though it's not as loud as the fan. </p>
<p>Much like the way we can look at things to examine them more closely, our sense of hearing can focus and be selective to concentrate on different parts of a sound. </p>
<p>All things being equal, most of the difference in hearing between somebody like a recording engineer or audiophile, versus a person who doesn't care about sound isn't that they have better ears. It's that they have a very good system of splitting sound up mentally, and examining different parts of it. Basically the same hardware of 2 ears, ear canals, cartilage to direct the sound into our ear canals, etc but different 'software' or processing of the sound. </p>
<p>When you focus your attention on part of a song, it isn't changing what your ears hear, it is changing your attention and focusing it. If we could move our ears like cats and dogs, we might be doing that as well, but we can't so most of our attention is done in the brain instead of with our ears swiveling about. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is kind of quirky way to ask the question.  I would phrase it as &quot;Why is the government more willing to help get me a 100K for a student loan than 100K loan to start a business?&quot;  That is because the government does not provide loans to individuals, just guarantees to lender on behalf of private borrowers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slower Escalation</strong> A typical business is going to need most or all of that 100K upfront, while a college student will get it over time.  Because it takes time, if you are not fit for the degree you are more likely to drop out before you ever get remotely close to the 100 K amount. </li>
<li><strong>Student Loans are Self Sorting</strong>  Racking up 100K in student loans is not easy.  To get that much in debt you likely went to an excellent school, you are close to graduating from college, or you are working on a post graduate degree.  You would not be in that school or graduate program unless you were already a well above average person.  If youare asking for 100K in student loans, I know you have already jumped through a lot of evaluation and passed it to reach the point that you can ask for it.  </li>
<li><strong>Business Loans Require a LOT of Customization</strong>  As someone who worked as credit analyst of small businesses at a community bank, I can tell you that a small time business loan involves a lot of custom agreements and custom evaluation.  So for every business loan the lender is going to have evaluate it and assure to the government that it will be repaid for the loan to promote the economy as intended.</li>
<li><strong>College Education has Great Returns</strong> On average a 4 year degree earned at age 22 has something the realm of a 12% return.  That is more than enough to cover the interest on a loan.  Additionally College Education has a host of non-monetary benefits to them and society.  College educated people tend to have better health, better child rearing, and more stable income.  That means that government has to spend less on medicare, less on crime, and less on welfare programs.  So a college education pays for itself, increases taxes, and reduces government expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Public Assistance is not necessary to insure the creation of a market.</strong>  For a loan to be worthwhile to make it has to be repaid.  And for a lender to borrow, they have to prove that they can repay a loan.  If you could prove to the government you could repay your business loan, you could prove to a bank that you could repay your business loan.  The government has no role in this market.  But what sucks about education is that while it has great a rate of return for the recipient and society, for it to be worthwhile you have make the loan to people who have been adults for just a few months or years.  These people have no way of proving that they have a good plan for how they will use the funds. Plus part of the process of going to college is figuring out what you are good at.  </li>
<li><strong>Business Loans do not have a clear link to a better society</strong>  In general there is no guarantee of external benefits (benefits that go to someone else) from a business like with college education.  This is why when the government does guarantee loans it is because it perceives a way to benefit society as whole with them.  Like for example, home loans allow people to buy homes.  These homes provide people with equity and more stability.  This reduces their burden on welfare programs and makes them more invested in their communities (in theory).  The agenda of a government loan program is make sure more loans of a beneficial type are provided more than the market would normally want to provide.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>EDIT 1:  Some people have correctly pointed out that some government agencies do make loans directly and that is how they do it since I taught a class on this subject.  </p>
<p>But they are only technically correct (the best kind of correct).  Most of these agencies will bundle the loans into a ABS or similar security and sell it in the private market.  At the end of the day the government is not the ultimate lender, just a conduit that provides a guarantee.  From a economic point of view, it doesn't really matter where the guarantee comes in the funding stream, just that it happens.  The effect is the same.  The government is guaranteeing your loan to the ultimate lender.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, a college education is seen as more beneficial to society in general, regardless of whether or not you end up getting a career in your field. Knowledge is good! There's also the fact that the vast majority of businesses fail within the first few years - and it takes a ton of knowledge (usually learned in school) to successfully run a business, not to mention a solid plan, good market research, a service or product people both need and want to buy, and a bit of luck.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you take out a 100k student loan, even if you don't get a career in your field there's a high likelihood you'll be able to pay back at least some of the loan. If you get paid 100k to start a small business and that business dies after a year, all of a sudden you have nothing to show for it at all and possibly will declare bankruptcy, costing the government even more money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A student loan is a double investment to government. There is interest paid back on the loan and you are more employable in the workforce and will have a greater economic benefit to the country. For the US this applies world wide as their tax laws apply to citizens anywhere.</p>
<p>A business is riskier. The government is more likely to give money to a business than a bank, but it's more likely given as grants than loans and it's still not easy. Most businesses fail in the first few years and they need the 100k usually during start up. Student loans are given out on a per semester basis, spreading it out over years. So a student who drops out after a year will have had less investment from the gov't than a full graduate, the longer you're in school, the more employable you are. A business that fails will have a far larger debt burden due to startup costs and will no longer be contributing to the economy.</p>
<p>Finally you have elections. You'll get far more votes from parents and newly voting students by helping them out than refusing. Which is why it's hard to declare bankruptcy from a student loan, because there needed to be more security in the programs so the election promised could be kept.</p>
<p>Canada had a situation in 2000 where the banks used to handle student loans with gov't guaranteeing them, but they would no longer agree to that risk. Knowing that ending or substantially changing the student loan program would be political suicide, the gov't took over the program entirely which allowed them to completely eliminate the ability to discharge a student loan through bankruptcy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy lawyer here. The answer has been stated herein by others, but it bears repeating. Federally backed student loans are an explicit exception to discharge within the Bankruptcy Code. The Brunner Test has developed to determine whether undue hardship exists that should justify the discharge of other student loans, but these are typically privately held student loans, not federally backed. On the other hand, go set up an LLC, borrow a bunch of cash, personally guarantee it, default on the note, liquidate the business and give all proceeds to the lender, then file a chapter 7 and you are off and down the road to start your next venture. The treatment in bankruptcy is where the answer lies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The angular momentum of a black hole is a property of the spacetime and needn't have anything to do with what is happening inside the horizon.</p>
<p>The singularity is never a 0-dimensional point. In Schwarzschild it is an &quot;instant of time&quot;. In Kerr it is a ring. I don't think the shape of the singularity in a real black hole is known.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) the singularity is not a 0-dimensional point. That's true of non-rotating black holes. Rotating black holes probably don't even have a singularity (aka as ringularity since it would be a ring) even at a semi-classical level: the singularity lies in an interior region of the solution which we know cannot be trusted to model actual rotating black holes.</p>
<p>2) the singularity does not &quot;carry&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; the properties of the black hole such as the mass, the linear and angular momentum, the charge... it will just lead to confusion to think in these terms. How/where exactly a black hole &quot;keeps&quot; these things is a subtle and counterintuitive matter. </p>
<p>The technical answer is these properties are sort of &quot;delocalized&quot; in the case of a black hole and the black hole itself is essentially a type of topological defect. That would be a very agnostic, strictly classical answer. But that's close to impossible to explain for me.</p>
<p>A simple, bizzarre and not really that wrong at all way to imagine a black hole is as a very thin 2-dimensional membrane lying above the horizon. This membrane is hot and has energy, so mass; when stuff falls in it gets burnt by the membrane and adds to its energy/mass. When charges fall onto the membrane, the membrane (which has a sort of electrical conductivity) absorbs and dissolves charges and become charged itself. And finally, it can acquire linear or angular momentum when it's provided by falling objects, and can start moving, or rotating (and become flattened). This is a quantum-gravity- (and string-theory-) inspired picture, but for what regards classical gravitation it gives the same answers as the &quot;standard&quot; one, and might help clarify a lot of the trickiness of black holes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are infinitely displaced from the singularity in terms of how much our space/time is warped. </p>
<p>Meaning if something falls into the event horizon, if we could see inside, from our point of view theoretically it should never reach the singularity. </p>
<p>Imagine the ship in interstellar that goes to the planet where 1 hour there is 7 years on Earth. </p>
<p>Ok, imagine it goes a bunch closer to the black hole. So 1 hour = 70 years on earth. </p>
<p>Now, imagine it keeps going closer, </p>
<p>it will hit 1 hour on the ship = 700 years
1 hour on the ship = 7000 years
1 hour on the ship = 70000 years</p>
<p>up and up and up forever before reaching the singularity.....</p>
<p>From the point of view of an observer outside of the event horizon the behavior can be totally different from the point of view from inside the event horizon. The black hole may have a singularity by it's own internal math and view point - but from our point of view outside it doesn't seem to me like it can have a singularity. </p>
<p>It's called a dual nature. Anything infinitely displaced by relativity aught to have a dual nature. Light is another example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black Holes are not necessarily singularities. We know that an event horizon is where the escape velocity reaches the speed of light. That's pretty much it. The rest is theory, some of it very well reasoned, but we can't really verify any of it experimentally (although we can verify other parts of those theories in certain ways, such as at the LHC). That does not necessarily mean there is no internal structure.</p>
<p>For one, spacetime itself could retain some sort of structure as we do not know what happens to it in such a situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more interesting, is that if matter has structure below the quark, or perhaps at a scale below the Planck length, then it's possible there are iterations of black holes. Let me elaborate:</p>
<p>Neutron stars are extremely dense objects made when the &quot;pressure&quot; becomes enough to crush electrons and protons together. Then they are held apart by neutron degeneracy pressure (again, not really pressure but an outward force resisting gravity). When/if the gravity becomes strong enough the neutron star can then collapse further.</p>
<p>The main idea seems to be that neutron stars collapse into black holes. Pulsars (a type of neutron star) can occasionally spin so fast they resist collapse until their spin slows down enough, we think. This does not mean they collapse into a singularity; there is no complete explanation for exactly what happens at this point.</p>
<p>Another thought is that the step beyond neutron stars is a quark star, which would be incredibly dense (10cm across or so).</p>
<p>I wonder if maybe quark stars aren't a type of black hole, or perhaps matter has structure more fundamental than quarks and will resist being crushed at a certain point. We simply do not know so it's all speculation.</p>
<p>I do find it interesting, however, that the external effects of a stellar-mass black hole and a supermassive black hole are generally the same if radically different in scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
