		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me preface this question by saying I have always been a firm believer of evolution. However, I've puzzled over many strange results of evolution and how they got to be where they are. Carnivorous plants are one example. How can a plant GRADUALLY evolve the ability to trap insects and absorb them without use of its roots? Did it just start out as a mutation that made a plant kind of sticky? It seems like such a radical change and the intermediate steps don't necessarily seem beneficial enough to ensure greater than average reproductive success.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for all your informative responses! This was my first reddit post since the 4 years I've been lurking, and it is very encouraging.</p></div></div>

They could hav evolved to simply inhibit  the movement  of insects with a sticky surface and gradually moved toward movement themselves. Once movement was common, natural selection picked the most efficient animal. Ones with the best energy efficiency survive and yield todays carniverous plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The carnivorous trait did not happen at a single event, but rather occurred multiple times. Theory for enzymes: plants needed to develop chitinase and proteases to destroy fungus pathogens from invading their tissue. The enzymes and the glands producing them ended up being used in carnivorous plants to breakdown insect exoskeletons.</p>
<p>The viscous liquid in certain Nepenthes species are nearly identical to the mucilage of drosera, iirc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most plants are capable of absorbing at least some nutrients through their leaves, which is why foliar feeding works. There are also many plants that evolved the ability to stick insects to them as a defense mechanism, and in areas with low nutrient levels such as sphagnum bogs or up in trees the plants that were able to trap and absorb insects most efficiently survived very well compared to their cousins who could not.</p>
<p>This is why carnivorous behavior has evolved in several different kinds of plants that are not that closely related to each other, such as Cephalotus and Nepenthes looking very similar despite not being related, Pinguicula using a similar mechanism to Drosera, and Byblis, and so on. There's even an orchid that's debateably carnivorous, but it needs more study to confirm or deny this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing you have to remember is that the &quot;adaptation&quot; is what causes the advantage, unlike Lamar's theory. </p>
<p>The ancestor of the Venus flytrap was probably a plant like any other, but down the line one of it developed a sticky substance around her &quot;flower&quot;, by a conjunct of &quot;random mutations&quot;. Some did something similar, but one that wasn't too sticky let the fly flew away, other was too sticky, and not even one fly got away, preventing it from polimerazing. Others had leaves that close when touched, something other plants can do actually, and when a fly was trapped by this it died and feed the plant. With the past of time, whatever change was tested, and the &quot;better suited&quot; (wrote on the broad spectrum) had descendants that could have a new change. This is a very simplistic explanation though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It’s produced in the adrenal cortex in response to stress (physical or emotional) and to natural cycles that tend to correlate to circadian rhythms. Cortisol makes the body respond more to normal levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, and can therefore cause vasoconstriction which in turn can cause chest pains (which can mimic angina). </p>

I had surgery done back in November, and it had been healing without a peep the whole time, until someone I used to know suddenly popped back into my life in early January. It had been years since we last spoke, so I welcomed him back, hoping we might be able to get along. Unfortunately, it soon became evident that nothing had changed, and we started arguing over the same stupid crap we always used to. Sometimes the arguments would become so escalated, I could feel the area where my surgery had been done starting to feel sore. That freaked me out to the point where I knew this person and I needed to stop communicating again. Things have been fine ever since, but I'd never experienced anything like it before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

After a bad relationship breakup I realised (again) that a broken heart actually really hurts physically, as well as chills and body aching. Worse than flu or dengue fever. Foetal position, ocasional soup, basically. You can even die from a broken heart

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MD with significant clinical experience with pain and close relations with world renowned pain researchers here.  The simplest answer I can gave that it's very complex and any answer on Reddit will be at best incomplete if not totally wrong.  The simplest &quot;wrong&quot; answer is that there is a process that can be simply termed hyperalgesia, which means noxious stimuli that causes pain in a &quot;normal&quot; person causes more pain in a person that has undergone a hyperalgesic process.  So my pain score is 2 and yours is 8.  The process can be so significant that non-noxious stimuli can be interpreted as pain (allodynia).  This process is complex and has a lot to do with central (nervous system) and peripheral sensitization of the nervous system.  Another element of hyperalgesia can come from mood disorders (such as depression).  The biological framework of this is extremely complex and cannot be simply explained by any single process.  To be even more simplistic and incorrect, but kinda true, is that when you feel emotionally down you are more aware of noxious stimuli that was always there but now your threshold for experiencing this as pain decreases.  On top of all this is pain is subjective and placebo effects in treatments are far higher than that of other medications, again tying emotional cognitive aspects to the experience of pain. Hope that helps.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>1) older people generally have more stress and things to juggle. In the west at least, most adult are chronically sleep deprived. So the body is more vulnerable in general to alcohol's assault on its system.</p>
<p>2) older people often have commitments that prevent 'sleeping it off'. Personally, it's been more than a decade since I've slept past 8am...much less sleeping til noon. So even if you feel bad, you're getting up anyway. </p>
<p>3) the downside of routine: many older people often have set routines. That's normally good. But once the body is acclimated to a certain routine, deviation is more difficult to take. Talk to anyone who is a frequent flyer across large time zones. They don't get hit as hard by jet lag as infrequent fliers. Why? Their body is accustomed to regular and bizarre changes to sleep patterns and they've just learned to deal. Just like a college kid that parties and pulls all nighter study sessions. The very lack of routine is helpful. On the flip side, anyone who has cared for a baby with routine nap times knows how bad things can get when you miss nap time altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The answer is heat flux. Water transmits heat 20 times faster than air, meaning that you would be losing heat faster in water than air. To give you an example of this, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDbMEdLiCs" target="_blank">watch this video</a>.

<p>Edit: <a href="https://extremephysiolmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2046-7648-3-12" target="_blank">this article</a> is a great source. It mentions that air is thermoneutral (i.e. neither raises nor lowers your body temperature) only up to ~28 degrees (because it can't carry heat as well as water), while water is thermoneutral to 35.5 degrees.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey Redditor!</p>
<p>My degree background is in Psycholinguistics, which is basically put: understanding how language functions in the brain. </p>
<p>I actually did a research project on dyslexia and hope I can be a help explaining it.</p>
<p>So, symbol languages, in linguistic terms, is called a logographic system. This basically means that the language is communicate (in writing systems) through logos, or symbols, representing - usually - a &quot;chunk&quot; or what is called a morpheme. A combination of these morphemes in a particular pattern and combination represent a word or phrase.</p>
<p>Languages like English are considered alphabetic (cause - you know - the alphabet).</p>
<p>There's a lot of different things to consider you'd need more information from studying to field, but basically our ability to read has mapped on to previously developed parts of the brain, utilizing their functions to process language. For alphabetic system, they are usually called &quot;t-junctions&quot; meaning before modern times, letter like the &quot;o&quot; weren't actually round, but were a series of lines making almost a diamond shape that has altered over the years to the circular &quot;o&quot; we all know and love.</p>
<p>Alphabetic languages actually access a part of the brain (which I can't currently recall) that has to do with your lexical phonetic storage system - meaning you link the letter to a specific sound (with has its variations between words in English... but that's a different topic all together). That is how it is simply organized.</p>
<p>Logographic systems actually activate parts of the visual cortex not activated in alphabetic systems (or only activated minimally). There are actually MRI testing that has been done on this demonstrating the results.</p>
<p>What's really cool is the fact that because these two systems of writing/reading don't full connect, a person who is dyslexic in one system, such as English, could be fully able to read and write with easy in another system, like Japanese, because of this lack of overlap between logographic and alphabet systems (you can find case studies on this which are actually pretty rad!) </p>
<p>There is much debate as to why dyslexia happens in the first place, but some of the best journal articles dispute that it has to do with the fact that writing and reading is a relatively new systems to our brains, and might have to do with the fact we are utilizing previous skills for other task that have evolved in our brain, to map the ability to read and write and make it accessible.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about it, or want me to send some academic literature your way, PLEASE reach out! I nerd out over stuff like this &lt;3</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that dyslexia is primarily (in about 80% of cases) a disorder of phonemic processing; i.e. the capacity of the brain to order sounds into meaningful chunks. I assume that languages which represent <em>meaning</em> with characters such as Chinese and Japanese take some of this work out the equation: for example the Japanese character for fire (火) can be pronounced a few different ways, but it always has the meaning &quot;fire.&quot; This versus English and other languages whose writing only carries meaning <em>after</em> you've done the phonemic assembly required, meaning that &quot;f.i.r.e.&quot; means nothing until you've put the letters together and translated them mentally into a sound. I would assume that what you would see in languages like Chinese and Japanese is people with dyslexia having an easier time unless something was written in the phonetic Pinyin or Kana (for Chinese and Japanese, respectively) at which point presumably some of the phonemic processing issues would emerge. </p>
<p>There is also a small subset of dyslexics (20% or so) where the issue lies in visual/spatial processing, and has to do with the brain not being able to correctly mentally orient letters. I imagine for these folks Chinese might be a little easier because the complexity of the characters would help you to find the meaning regardless of its perceived orientation, but you would probably still have a hard time. </p>
<p>Source: I'm a pediatric occupational therapist who has read some books and articles in addition to working with lots of kiddos with language-based learning disabilities. The piece about dyslexia being based in phonemic and sometimes spatial processing is well-established neuroscience. The piece about why it might be different in pictographic languages is my educated speculation, so let the reader beware. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have dyslexia and have studied about dyslexia previously. Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty similar to dyspraxia, dyscalculia and ADHD. All of the overlap and it is extremely common to have more than one (I have dyslexia and dyspraxia). </p>
<p>Dyslexia has a lot more to it than just have difficulty reading and writing, it come with difficulties in memory, attention, word finding, organisation, time management and so many other areas. Other language difficulties can include difficulties knowing which sentence particles to use, confusing similar or opposite words (e.g. Left and right), difficulty structuring sentences so that they make sense, and knowing which tense to use and the different conjugation of words (e.g. What is the past tense of 'write'). These are all things that would be experienced regardless of the language you speak/read. </p>
<p>As an adult my main difficulties are not to do with reading and writing, they are to do with memory and organising my though processes. I make a lot of speech errors, I find it very hard to explain things in a logical way even though they make perfect sense in my head. In terms of writing my difficulties are in structuring my ideas. I do still have difficulty with reading and writing but I've learned to manage this over the years. </p>
<p>TL;DR there is a lot more to dyslexia that spelling and reading, most of which would happen regardless of the language used. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in dyslexia but am a Chinese speaker.</p>
<p>Written Chinese is not an alphabetic or syllabic language so dyslexia in Chinese is not really related with how sounds are represented but how the symbols are written. You know, Chinese characters are actually made up of components put in specific positions and written using a specific stroke order. If any of those components/strokes are <strong>1)</strong> missing or superfluous (e.g. 天 &quot;sky&quot; vs 大 &quot;big&quot;, 日 &quot;sun&quot; vs 目 &quot;eye&quot;), <strong>2)</strong> put in the wrong place (e.g. 太 &quot;very&quot; vs 犬 &quot;dog&quot;, 本 &quot;book/root&quot; vs 未 &quot;not yet&quot; vs 末 &quot;end&quot;), or <strong>3)</strong> wrongly written (e.g. 田 vs 由 vs 甲), it could cause problems for the readers.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/jB7ZX81.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/jB7ZX81.jpg</a>
In the the circled character above, some strokes are missing. (The correct form would be 麗 )</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tyqyfm1.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/tyqyfm1.jpg</a>
Here the upper part of the character is horizontally mirrored.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/fWXeril.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/fWXeril.jpg</a>
In image 1.9, the second character (夫) has an extra horizontal stroke.</p>
<p>In image 1.11, the characters are supposed to be 唱歌 , which means in this case the left and right of the first character got reversed, and the wrong component is used in the right hand side of the second word.</p>
<p>Apart from the mistakes in how a character is written, there are also problems with the mixing up of characters similar in form or related in meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/lNnGoN1.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/lNnGoN1.jpg</a>
In image 1.1, 橾 (ancient wheel hub) is used instead of 澡 (bath).
In image 1.2, 炮 (a cannon) is used instead of 跑 (to run).</p>
<p>In image 1.3, 回學 should be 回校 . This happens because 學 and 校 are often used together. (學校 means school)</p>
<p>Of course there are a host of other symptoms but I guess the above are several of the more obvious.</p>

In 2011 if you where a refugee or requesting asylum in the U.S while in Iraq you could apply but none of the info would be process for during a six month time period. This was brought on by 2 terrorist found in the united states that most likely came in as refugees.</p>
<p>Trumps ban pretty much restricts all non-u.s citizens coming from several middle eastern countries. The original order actually calls for the deportation of people coming from the specified countries that are in transit or already hold visas, however this was denied by several judges. Basically the key difference here is that during Obama's you couldn't get a visa to get into the states. during trumps it doesn't matter you just cant get in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember that happening because there was a connected story about an an interpreter who had helped the US in Iraq being killed because his visa application was delayed by the action.</p>
<p>Carter apparently did a similar thing during the Iran crisis. There are, apparently, similar precedences in history.</p>
<p>The obvious objectionable (it seems) difference is that these were enacted in response to specific incidences and somewhat limited in scope.
Trump's targets several countries and city states but excludes certain religious minorities . This gives it the definite quality of his fulfillment of tge &quot;Muslim ban&quot; promised in his campaign. </p>
<p>If it were backed up with a credible intelligence report on a specific threat it might go down easier. But as it is it's a pretty blatantly discriminatory fulfillment of divisive and fear mongering rhetoric and only part of a larger agenda. </p>
<p>So people who oppose that are reacting powerfully to try and nip it all in the bud... So to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's extremely different. The claim your buddy is making is one that is a Republican talking point voiced by Spicer this morning and also echoed by various republican operatives on the news today, which is why it seemed to erupt all at once from every Republican talking head and any supporter who watched the news at all on TV in the past day. There's really no truth to it, it was just designed as a response to basically blame Obama for the things that Trump has done, or else to make it seem like democrats are hypocrites for not protesting it then, but protesting it now. Here's why it's not a valid criticism but really more resembles propaganda and is a gross misrepresentation of what has happened:</p>
<p>Trump's executive order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bans entry to the US for people born in seven majority Muslim countries - Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - including holders of legal green cards and visas - for 90 days.</strong> It's almost unprecedented to ban people with green cards and other legal visas on a blanket basis with no cause against them, and against people who had <em>already</em> gone through the &quot;extreme vetting&quot; that Trump claims he wants to institute (but that is already being done). Obama did nothing remotely like this. No other president in living memory has done anything remotely like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspending the Syrian refugee plan indefinitely</strong> -- this is a humanitarian disaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspending entire refugee plan for 120 days</strong> -- this is a humanitarian disaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bans entry to the US for dual-nationality passport holders - meaning citizens of the above countries who also hold, for example, a British passport, are also banned for 90 days.</strong> Obama did nothing like this. What he did do was require people who meet these criteria to have to apply for a visa (rather than be automatically allowed into the US), but only if they had been to any of the listed countries in the last few years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize Christian refugees over Muslims</strong> -- this is very likely unconstitutional, as there's not supposed to be a religious test of this kind. And incidentally, Trump lied when he said that it was &quot;impossible&quot; to get a visa if  you were a Christian refugee from these countries, but if you were a Muslim, you could get a visa.  In fact, overall for these countries, a larger percentage of Christians got visas than Muslims. That is, Christians make up a tiny percentage of the population, but a larger percentage than that got visas. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He capped the refugee total to 50,000.</strong> This wasn't done by Obama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He did it out of the blue.</strong> Not done by Obama, as explained below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Did it via executive order</strong>, with no consultation/input with other departments or experts, and without any (or almost no) warning to any agencies who handle these things, like Homeland Security. Bannon and Trump overruled things like having this not apply to people with green cards.</p>
</li>
<li>There's a smoking gun, in that <strong>Giuliani says that Trump asked him how to ban Muslims, but legally</strong>, so any denial that this is a Muslim ban, is clearly false. And a commission was assembled to figure out how to do that. This is distinct from a commission of experts figuring out how best to detect terrorists and keep them out as described below as having been done by Obama. The commission Giuliani described as having assembled for Trump was of lawyers to figure out how to ban Muslims in general, but legally.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, Obama: </p>
<p>Paused approvals of refugee applications from Iraq for a period of six months after two Iraqi al-Qaeda terrorists were discovered living as refugees in Kentucky. So it was a very particular and narrow ban based on a hard evidence example, not a blanket ban and not targeted at Muslims in general with a specified preference for people of a certain religion. Also, it was done after careful consultation with the security experts in these matters to see how best to screen people to find potential terrorists. Trump banned all refugees for a certain period of time and severely limited the number we'd take in. This is quite cruel as a huge number of refugees have been created recently.</p>
<p>Another thing Obama did was put several countries on the list of countries that wouldn't get automatic visa waivers. That is, suppose you're from Japan and you want to go to the USA for a visit. You can just come--get on the plane with your passport, land in the US, get the passport stamped, done. It's easy, as a courtesy for two countries that trust each other and have friendly relations. You don't need to go to the US embassy in Tokyo and fill out an application and send in your passport and money and then get a stamp that allows you one entry and one exit to the US during a particular time period and for a certain number of days.  But with some other countries, you do need to go to the embassy and fill out a form, etc., for a tourist visa (you have to fill out forms and apply for almost all countries if you want a non-tourist visa to work or something). And Americans need to do that when in turn going to those other countries. So Obama put a few countries, responding to events occurring at that time, on a list of the many countries where they don't get the easy way to get a visa--they have to apply at the embassy, etc. Not <em>everybody</em> from those countries (Somalia, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen, but just people who have passports from those countries and have visited those countries <em>recently</em>. </p>
<p>The concern is that terrorists living in, say, Britain, might get radicalized on-line and then visit those countries or a few other countries we are watching, and take terrorist training camps and make plans with enemy groups for terrorist activities. So people with those specific characteristics need extra vetting by our security forces to make sure they're not going to be a problem. </p>
<p>But newborn babies and 5 year old kids and disabled 85 year old women in wheelchairs who have lived in the US for decades and doctors who have lived in the US for decades didn't end up, with Obama's action, getting trapped at the airport without food or water for many hours, not allowed to see a lawyer or, in the case of the 5 year old, alone and not allowed to see a parent or guardian. Nor did anyone have green cards confiscated. That's what happened with Trump's plan. And Obama's thing wasn't an executive order--it was in a much larger bill proposed by congress and signed by Obama. So there are numerous very specific and very nasty reasons why Trump's Executive Order is a nightmarish abuse of power, unconstitutional, as well as cruel, and none of those reasons apply to Obama's actions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some ways, this is a meaningless question.</p>
<p>The term &quot;noble gas&quot; refers to chemical properties, and element 118 doesn't exist long enough to really do chemistry (in a real, macroscopic sense). Secondly, as you go down the periodic table to heavier atoms, all of the &quot;rules&quot; that terms like &quot;noble gas&quot; and &quot;halogen&quot; are based off of become a lot less fixed. For example, the noble gasses go from &quot;doesn't react&quot; to &quot;yeah, you can make stable compounds of this and put it in a bottle&quot;. By that point, the term itself doesn't mean a heck of a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other commenters have said, it is too unstable to really have chemical properties. Another issue is that with these very large electron clouds, the highest energy electrons begin to behave differently due to relativistic effects and instability. If you have a rock on a hill, it is in a high energy state and &quot;wants&quot; to go to a low energy state, and will do this by rolling down the hill of possible. A small force on the rock causes its position to become unstable and the rock falls down the hill. The taller and steeper the hill, the smaller the force required to destabilize the rock. </p>
<p>The same thing happens (kind of. Quantum effects make it a bit harder to explain) with electron clouds. High energy electrons want to go to a low energy state. However, the lower energy states are already filled in a big atom, so the electrons tend to transfer to other atoms instead. Because of this, it is very possible that oganesson would actually be reactive if it were not so radioactive. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that even with more familiar so-called noble gasses, the distinction is more of a suggestion than a rule. Xenon can be made to react with fluorine, for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by noble gas. If you mean that it's p-orbital is completely filled with electrons, then yes, it would be. The reason most noble gases are not as reactive as the elements near to them is because they are electronically &quot;comfortable&quot; because their p-orbital orbital is completely filled. Conversely, that is why halogens are so reactive. They only need to take one electron away from some other element to become &quot;comfortable&quot; and they really really really wanna become comfortable.</p>
<p>Despite this, as you move down the periodic table, the characteristics that define groups of elements become less concrete. This is because electronic orbitals form father and father away from atomic nuclei as the elements get heavier and heavier. Because of this, the electrons are more able to interact with, and be taken away by, other reactive elements. This is why noble gases like xenon can form compounds with some very reactive elements like flouride.</p>
<p>Due to the reasons stated above, whole element 118 will technically be a noble gas because it's p-orbital orbital will probably be filled, it will be most likely be pretty highly reactive, giving it's classification as a noble gas very little meaning. </p>
<p>Also as some others have pointed out, there's some speculation that it might not even be a gas at STP, so I guess you could call it a noble metal at that point?</p>
<p>P.S. I typed this on mobile, so excuse typos.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: heavy element chemistry is weird and doesn't follow periodic trends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Curious why my answer rec'd 3 negative votes given that it is correct. Note that I do not  assume that the &quot;last&quot; p orbital is filled, or even, crucially, that it makes any sense to put them in order; and am saying that the system that we've arranged the periodic table makes assumptions based on observations that we've made of existing elements of low atomic number. There could be an extension to atomic numbers of any integer, including atoms that have not been observed,  it wouldl be interesting to do this, but it is not likely that the 'aufbau' extends in the combinatorial way it is now sometimes understood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if we compare  the artifically excited states 5g186f147d108p59s versus 5g186f147d108p6  of of Cadmium (or more correctly actual excited states of Cadmium 71) we see that the one with the filled p orbital has higher energy, not lower, than if a 9s  electron is allowed <a href="http://spectrograph.uk/index.html?domults.checked=true&dofine.checked=true&autocorrect.checked=false&finecorrect.checked=false&doConfig("5g186f147d108p59s;5g186f147d108p6",1,0" target="_blank">http://spectrograph.uk/index.html?domults.checked=true&dofine.checked=true&autocorrect.checked=false&finecorrect.checked=false&doConfig("5g186f147d108p59s;5g186f147d108p6",1,0</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Unbilinium has atomic number 120= 8 choose 3 so would be an alkaline earth metal, and atomic number 118 being two less would be a noble gas if the periodic table continued its system...
It also is true, however, that this structure in the periodic table depends on not only Schroedinger's equation (which implies the Hund rule), but also the Aufbau including some aspects of it which are unproven/unexplained. That is, the order in which orbitals tend to be filled as far as we can observe follows a pattern consistent with Schroedinger's equation, but not logically deducible from it, nor are the precise solutions of the equation known.  One can also try Hartree-Fock, but the ground state configuration of atomic number 118 is likely unknown still.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>But seriously, there's a lot less CG in Jurassic Park than most people think.  Today, it's quite common for the only live action element in many shots to be the actors.  If JJ Abrams (hardly the most CG reliant director currently working) were to remake Jurassic Park today, he'd probably feel forced to engage in a full-on CG fuckathon for sequences where Spielberg simply did not have that option.  Spielberg was, instead, forced to use every cinematic trick in the book to hide the short-comings of the comparatively awful CG elements he had available to him.  Dark lighting, practical effects (models and animatronics), clever cutting...  Jurassic Park is a tour de force in all of these things because the CG was still quite primitive.  There are only a couple of full-CG shots that take place in brightly-lit daylight (e.g. the Brontosauraus reveal) and these are probably the weakest shots in the film.  </p>
<p>People today watch Jurassic Park and think they're seeing flawless, state-of-the-art CG, but what they're really seeing is mostly models and animatronics with only flashes of CG to tie the shots together.  The CG was weak, but Spielberg hid it's weaknesses like the master he is.  </p>
<p>Bonus example:  Consider the cup of water in the Jeep when the T-Rex is first approaching. </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One other issue that was initially seen as very small turned into a big puzzling problem. As the T-Rex approaches our main characters, we hear it before we see it. In particular, we see a cup of water start to form “rings” from the T-Rex’s approaching footsteps. Spielberg got the idea after listening to loud music in his car and seeing his rear-view mirror vibrate from the heavy bass. He quotes, “I was on my way to do storyboards for Jurassic Park and I never forgot what it looked like when the bass rhythm went off. I thought in the middle of storyboarding ‘hey wouldn’t it be cool if, when the T-Rex began to approach, the low-end vibration of all that tonnage hitting the ground was causing these little concentric circles.’” The crew thought the gag would be really simple to pull off. As it turned out, however, forming these “concentric circles” proved to be much more arduous than anticipated. Everyone on the production team was puzzled. Sound engineers, physics specialists, and wave tank generators were called in and used to try to achieve the circles, but to no avail. Finally, a solution was found. Michael Lantieri, who was part of the special effects team, quotes, “The night before the shot, I’m at home and I’m still playing around and I took a guitar that I had at home and set a glass of water on the guitar and plucked the string, and it vibrated and did it.” So in the end, the gag was achieved by feeding a guitar string from the cup through the tour car down to the ground, where a guy laying under the vehicle plucked the guitar string (Jurassic Park DVD).</p>

<p>Directors often have a vision and go to great lengths to see it realized.  However, I guarantee you that Michael Bay isn't going to call in physicists to help him make concentric rings in a cup of water (or to make realistic action scenes, apparently).  He's just going to CG that shit and, most of the time, people won't even notice.  CG has gotten really good at fixing seemingly small things that cause great pain for the production crew.  I don't point this out to denigrate CG or directors today (except maybe Michael Bay), but rather, to illustrate how impressive it was for a director like Spielberg to pull off a film like Jurassic Park that still holds up so well, in spite of the technical limitations of his day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of a number of factors. For starters, there was a great lack of faith in CGI's ability to produce realistic creature effects. CGI had been used in movies since at least the 70s but never to create convincing lifelike creatures. As a result an extraordinary amount of care was taken to hide the imperfections in the CGI.</p>
<p>Secondly, Jurassic Park had a big name director and a big budget. It could afford to take the best from both worlds. It used physical effects for the shots where those would work best. In a lot of the close ups where you can't see the entire animal but just snapping jaws, lunging claws and stomping legs, animatronics were used. They have a real world presence which means they reflect real light, have real texture, real fluids and give the actors and environment something real to interact with.</p>
<p>Vice versa, animatronics tend to be bad at convincing and lifelike motion. So for the full body shots where dinosaurs are walking, jumping and running in full view, CGI animation is used where the animator has much more control than someone using a mechanical puppet.</p>
<p>And because the effects team was very concerned about making sure neither type of effect didn't stuck out like a sore thumb, a lot of care was taken to try and mask the way the effects blended with the environment. That's why the T-rex escapes it's paddock at night in the pouring rain for instance. Rain, fog, refracted light, shadows, lots of stuff to help hide any imperfection in the effects.</p>
<p>But more than anything, what helps sell the effects is 'movie magic', nothing more than basic psychology. Jurassic Park went to incredible lengths to convince you that the dinosaurs are real animals both before the fx works starts and during. Let's look at the T-rex for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your first introduction to the T-rex is... nothing. The characters sitting bored in the car while the rex hides in the jungle. A very recognisable feeling for anyone who has visited the zoo.</li>
<li>There's a lot of minor interaction between the dinosaurs and their environment that isn't relevant to the story but extremely relevant in convincing the viewer that they're real. For example...</li>
<li>The T-rex eats, like any other animal. It eats a goat and just for good measure it drops a goat leg on the car. Physical interaction between the rex and it's environment.</li>
<li>You see the rex's little forearms testing the fence, pulling on the wires before you see the wires snap one by one as he pushes his body against it out of view. Again physical interaction with it's environment.</li>
<li>And they do this over and over. The vibration of it's step makes the glass of water ripple. It's feet sink into the soaked mud when it walks, leaving footprints that fill with water. It's pupils dilate when Timmy shines the flashlight into it's eyes. It's breath blows off Grant's hat.</li>
<li>The rex acts like an animal too. It get's distracted by the tire on the wrecked car. It follows the dominant motion of Ian's flare. It's not a monster, it's an animal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over and over Jurassic Park reinforces the appearance that these animals are having a real physical impact on the world around them. It makes the viewer want to believe. Looking at monster movies in the decades after, most movies simply don't take this much work to establish their creatures are real. Occasionally monsters fight the protagonists and that's it, none of the build up.</p>
<p>And part of movie magic is also that if you convince the viewer once, he'll want to believe later. Stan Winston once pointed out that in the gallimimus scene in broad daylight, the rex looks like a rubber toy. But after the amount of work put into the rain storm escape scene of the rex, the viewers already believed it was real and they didn't notice it looks a lot worse in the daylight scenes later in the movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the big primary factors that makes a CGI effect look real to the human eye is the way that light reflects off the generated object. The human eye is really good at noticing when an object is CGI when there is a lot of light illuminating it. </p>
<p>The visual effects team working on Jurassic Park understood this, so to compensate for the issue they tried to put their CGI characters in the dark. </p>
<p>Additionally, many of the scenes switch between puppet and CGI. For example, the T Rex scene switches between a giant T Rex puppet and a CGI object.  The Raptors in the Kitchen scene is the best example. It's harder to notice the raptors are CGI because the room is dimly lit. And the character switches between CGI and puppet at different camera angles. </p>
<p>The fast switching between the puppet raptors and the CGI raptors in the kitchen is very deliberate. Because it tricks your brain into not noticing the CGI character as much. </p>
<p>The visual effects team was so cautious with CGI at the time that they avoided using it only in cases where a puppet character would be impossible. The hydraulic T Rex they built was supposed to be impossible to make, as no one had made hydraulics that could respond as quickly as they needed the character to move. </p>
<p>But they were able to overcome some engineering hurdles by using a special fluid in the hydraulics. </p>
<p>So that should be some indication of just how much effort went into producing puppet characters, before resorting to CGI. </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>Woke up this morning and found my top comment of all time is about Jurassic Park. I'm really super ok with this. Apparently some people think I sounded smart. </p>
<p>I've never worked in the film or visual effects industry. I'm just a nerd with a huge love for Jurassic Park. And I've watched a LOT of behind the scenes for the movie.  </p>
<p>Many people have pointed out that there are obviously scenes where dinosaurs are in the broad day light. I didn't mention these because I don't feel like they hold up nearly as well. And I hadn't given those scenes as much thought. </p>
<p>But as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rlr3Lzvqog" target="_blank">Kaptain Kristian</a> points out in his nice little video, Spielberg had a lot of other ways to hide the weaknesses in Jurassic Park. He used cinematography to give the dinosaurs perspective and dimension so that they would seem believable. Not to mention that seeing the actors on screen react to seeing the dinosaurs makes us see them as more believable creatures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the computer graphics, Spielberg originally wanted to avoid them and use stop motion and puppetry instead.  It took a lot to convince him.</p>
<p>Even so, most of the dinos you see are puppetry, models, and robotics. Most of the CG dinos were intentionally kept in conditions that were difficult to see. Dinos in the rain, dinos in the distance, dinos running quickly or jumping out.  </p>
<p>There were very few scenes where the CG dinos were up close and personal.  Thanks to that, those few scenes had the dedication of the entire crew.  Modern movies have an enormous budget for computer graphics, but the cost per second is rather low because they are everywhere in the movie.  Jurassic Park spent a fortune on computer graphics, but because they had so few scenes of them the investment per second is quite high.  Each brief scene was meticulously reviewed and brought to exacting standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You only notice CGI when it's bad. Or when it's the focus. </p>
<p>Take a look here: <a href="https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/movies-before-after-green-screen-cgi/" target="_blank">https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/movies-before-after-green-screen-cgi/</a></p>
<p>The Boardwalk Empire one with the boats, looks really well done. But it still seems a bit off. Because it's a major focal point. </p>
<p>Take a look at the Life of Pi set. The one where he's standing on the boat seems a bit off, but that's from the tiger. The sky and sea look well done. That's because they're not the focus of the shot.</p>
<p>Now, for Jurassic Park. There's some scenes where the cgi does fall flat. And falls just to the bad side of the uncanny valley. The brontosaurus in particular. But, the night scene with the trex looks great. But, if you look close there's not too much separating the quality of the cgi. What separates the two scenes is the intent behind the use of the cg. With the bronto meaning to wow the audience and the TRex showing us the fear of the characters. Also, the dim lighting helps.</p>
<p>Another things Jurassic Park has going for it is the uncanny valley point is so shallow. We've never seen (at least most of us, looking at you roswell) a dinosaur in real life. So we can accept it more readily. However, faces, tigers, boats, water, etc. we've all seen at least video of. So the valley is set much deeper. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Quantum mechanics tells us that an object with such a mass would have a Compton wavelength greater than its Schwarzschild radius, which would make it not possible to constrain this mass to be in a small enough region to form a black hole.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/ramblingnonsense has a good ELI5 explinaton <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5289p0/time_crystals_objects_whose_structure_would/" target="_blank">HERE</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is about what happens to things when you take all their energy away. Think of it like dropping something on floor.</p>
<p>Many things fall down on one side or the other when you drop them. The way that the thing falls is called its resting or ground state. Figuring out what makes these things fall on one side or the other can help you learn about the object as well as the floor.
Sometimes things don't literally fall, but still have ground states. Magnets sort of pick one side to be north and the other side to be south. That's their ground state. Learning why they do this is hard and has taken a long time. Because magnets always have a north and a south pole, they are called asymmetrical, which just means they don't look the same on both sides.</p>
<p>Crystals also have asymmetrical ground states. As a crystal reaches its ground state it always has some bits that are pointy and some bits that are smooth. It's not the same on all sides, so it's asymmetrical, just like the magnets.</p>
<p>Lots of things in nature have asymmetrical ground states, but they all have one thing in common: they don't move. You have to give them some energy to make them move or to change their ground state.</p>
<p>Now some people think that there might be some weird objects that have asymmetrical ground states across time rather than space. That's what they mean by time crystals. An object like that would be interesting because, to us, they would look like they are moving in their ground state without any extra energy! Imagine if you dropped a die on the ground but instead of landing on a side, it landed on one corner and just spun forever. That's how weird these things are!</p>
<p>Because this is so hard to explain, these scientists spent most of their time just trying to define what such a weird object would look like and how you would know it when you found one. Once they did that, they used supercomputers to predict where you might find them, if they exist.</p>
<p>So far, no one has actually seen one and a lot of people think they can't exist. But now we might know where to look to see who is right!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Had I realized how fast this was going to blow up I'd chosen my words a bit more carefully! The bit about the die landing on its corner and spinning isn't meant to be a literal representation of what a time &quot;crystal&quot; would do. The article states that the ground state of such an object might be something that moves in a circle rather than sitting still. The other example they give is of a particle that oscillates despite not receiving any additional energy. I suspect (although I don't know) that classical physics probably prevents &quot;broken time-translation symmetry&quot; from working at scales big enough to see and interact with; we're talking about quantum properties here. The example with the die was merely to demonstrate the counter-intuitive nature of the phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I see a lot of people are confused about the ramifications of this concept. <strong>This is not a perpetual motion machine.</strong> This is a ground state; by definition, <strong>there is no energy in the system to extract.</strong> You couldn't get energy out of it any more than you could get energy out of a rock sitting on the floor.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i think i am oversimplyfing to the point is wrong, but i will give it a shot. Normal matter in his ''ground state'' (AKA doesn't release any kind of energy) don't really move at all. however, time crystals can move without releasing energy in unique ways on his ground state. and no, it doesn't violate the laws of thermodynamics, because that's how is supposed to behave a time crystal on that state. basically a weird rule of nature that may look illogical if we don't go deeper into the subject</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain how the law of conservation of energy is not getting violated here? If the ground state is perpetual motion then to maintain that state some energy needs to be spent to counteract gravity, or other energy fields.
