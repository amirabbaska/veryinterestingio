A six foot tall person, for example would weigh something like 180 lbs normally. A 9 foot talk person would easily be in the thousand lb range of properly proportioned. A 50% increase in height leads to a way more than 50% increase in weight and that's not sustainable because bone can only be so strong. At some point, the weight would be too much to carry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat counterintuitively, as an object gets bigger, its properties don't all get bigger at the same rate.  10 feet is twice as long as 5 feet, but a 10x10 square is four times as big as 5x5, and and 10x10x10 cube is eight times as big.</p>
<p>The weight of an object is determined by its volume, but strength is determined by area, the thickness of the objects cross section.  So if you take a bone or a steel beam, and double its size, it will become twice as long, four times as strong, but eight times as heavy.  Weight, in this case, increases twice as much as strength, so eventually you get to a point where the weight can no longer be supported.</p>
<p>And isn't just a matter of strength.  Blood vessels, digestive tracts, airways, they are all limited by the area of the cross section but must supply a volume.  All these systems start to break down as size increases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This topic is <strong>amazingly interesting</strong>. It has to do with scale, efficiency, and<strong> an extra dimension</strong></p>
<p>Another poster did a great job of answering your question directly, so I thought I'd expand on the subject. </p>
<p>Yes, the square cubed law shows how some features of the animal grow in 3 dimensions but did you know we can predict an animal's lifespan based on the specie's weight?</p>
<p>Lifespan will scale to WEIGHT^(1/4). That's the one-quarter power. Remember that (1/4) power for later. It's not just lifespan but you can use weight to predict:</p>
<ul>
<li>metabolism (how many calories the animal needs per day)</li>
<li>resting heat rate</li>
<li>brain size compared to intelligence</li>
<li>required oxygen</li>
<li>number of offspring over lifespan</li>
</ul>
<p>All for the average animal of that given size. </p>
<p>But it isn't only true of animals. It works for trees. It's true of similar features of organizations like ant colonies or publicly traded corporations. It even true of cities. The pace of life is faster in larger cities and you can predict by how much and the lifespan of a company based on size of organization. They are both exponential on average. </p>
<h2>So... <strong>why does this happen</strong>?</h2>
<p>What's common between mice, elephants, humans, trees, and even cities to some degree?</p>
<p>They all need resources delivered to every part of their structure.
As mass scales up, you have to deliver blood (oxygen and nutrients) to every single cell in the body. Once you have a <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>, you have a branching series of tubes that have to go to every single cell, the same way that every road has to be able to deliver a piece of mail to every single address. Each road (including driveways) has to meet or end in a house. This is basically a fractal - a repeating self-similar structure that looks the same at every scale (like the branches of a tree). </p>
<p>As animals scale up, this structure gets more efficient. There is a 25% savings that you get with scale (1/4 power). Highways can go faster than local roads and the more highways you can build the better you are at delivering things. </p>
<p>This 4 from the 1/4 power is better described as 3+1. 3 for the three spatial dimensions we scale in and 1 for the fractal nature of the structure.
Animals scale in 3-Dimensions and the fractal nature of our cardiovascular system scales in 4. We end up with a 1/4 extra bonus efficiency at scale. </p>
<h2>Extra dimensions</h2>
<p><strong>Wait what? 4 dimensions?</strong> Yeah <em>sort of</em>... This is gonna get deep. Fractals are <em>weird</em>. They sort behave as if they add an extra dimension, mathematically. </p>
<p>The best way I can help you to understand this is with coastlines and weird questions about 4D spheres. </p>
<p>What is the length of the coastline of Iceland? Which country in Europe has the largest coastline? These seem like questions with straightforward answers but for centuries, mapmakers got different answers and couldn't explain why. The issue is that coastlines are fractals and asking about there length is asking a 1D question (length) about something that behaves as though it has an extra dimension. </p>
<p>Imagine a sphere. Now let's ask a question that makes sense about a sphere what's the volume? What's the surface area? We can find formulas to answer these questions. </p>
<p>Now let's ask a question that doesn't seem like it makes sense about a sphere. What is the <strong>total area of the interior?</strong> this doesn't seem like it makes sense because there can't be an area of a three-dimensional object could there?</p>
<p>If we imagine the sphere as a infinite series of two dimensional circles in three-dimensional space, in other words, as slices of a sphere sitting on top of each other, then we can say what the area of each of these slices and add them together.</p>
<p>Since there's an infinite number of these circles the surface area is infinite. Sometimes when you ask a question that applies to an object of a higher number of Dimensions you end up with infinity as the answer. Area is a 2-D question and I asked about a 3D shape, so I got infinity. </p>
<p>What if I told you that there was a real two dimensional shape that can be no wider than a quarter but has an infinite perimeter? The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake" target="_blank">Koch snowflake</a> is a fractal that can be defined so that the perimeter is infinite, just as if we were asking a 1D question about a property of a 2D object. </p>
<p>This is very similar to the discovery of the coastline problem in map making. Depending on how small you let your smallest measurement be, the coastline gets longer. </p>
<p>The branching nature of our cardiovascular system is similar. It isn't infinite but it is almost like an extra dimension. Even though we're only a couple of metres tall, our cardiovascular system has a surface area larger than a tennis court. <strong>We're bigger on the inside. </strong></p>
<h2>Where <em>is</em> the Extra Dimension?</h2>
<p><strong>it is a what not a where </strong>
Some dimensions are <em>where</em> dimensions like left, right, up and down. Some are what dimensions like pressure, time (sort of) or volume. The thing being increased in a fractal is information over scale. In order to define a fractal, I need to cheat. The information for the fractal isn't stored in the shape, it is in the definition. I need to give you an algorithm. And the shape actually changes depending on the resolution that you choose to measure it. If you change the scale or resolution, you change the shape because the shape is defined <em>in terms</em> or its resolution or scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A really cool side to this is the cellular level. The way that a cell channels energy into a usable form is by pumping ions across a membrane. A membrane is the surface area of the cell and is proportional to x squared. It's also common to see many infoldings of the membrane (similar to cilia) to increase surface area. Despite these infoldings, the volume of a cell, which is proportional to X cubed, increases much faster than X squared. Basically the exact same concept as considering giant mammals, but on a tiny scale.</p>
<p>The reason cells like ours, which are much bigger than bacteria, can exist is because we have mitochondria, lots of tiny little membrane pockets that do the membrane pumping thing on their own. There's storing evidence to suggest that mitochondria are actually descended from a primitive bacteria themselves. If our cells need to get bigger, we can just increase the number of mitochondria in them (which is relatively simple; muscles and liver cells have high energy demands and therefore have many mitochondria in them).</p>
<p>Bacteria can't expand their membrane area any way other than just growing, but increasing their volume increases their energy demands even more. It's like if you were thirsty and you needed to run through a hot desert to get a small amount of water; you'll make yourself thirstier by running, it might not even be worth it to go get the water at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The strength of an animal is generally a function of area (the surface area of a muscle or bone), not volume. Weight is a function of volume. Since area increases exponentially slower than volume, hence the &quot;square-cube&quot; name, muscles and bones can't &quot;catch up&quot; to support the weight of giant organisms if the proportions would have to be the same: if you double the size/height while keeping the same shape you end up with four times the muscle power moving eight times the mass. </p>
<p>The bigger the increase the, worse the problem. Make something 3 times bigger and you have 9 times the muscle power moving <em>27 times</em> the weight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

As for the listening to music part: it's very easy for Snapchat to tell if you're running a music-streaming app. If you start the app <em>or</em> play music, Snapchat can change your avatar in the background simultaniously.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one knows for sure, but there are some theorys that are more likely than others.  The one that seems most sensible to me has to do with the infant being prone face down.</p>
<p>An infant does not have the strength yet to completely lift her head and turn it if she can't breath.  This may happen when a baby is placed face-down to go to sleep.  It's super difficult to prove if someone has died from suffocation when there has been no violent incident.  That makes it that much harder to diagnose.</p>
<p>There are no doubt other causes as well.  Basically SIDS is just a term for any mysterious death of an infant that can't be explained.  Babies are vulnerable and we may never know what every infant death is from.  Babies just die sometimes and it has always been that way.  SIDS is not a new phenomena, its just a new term.  We can try to eliminate some reasons for infant mortality as they become obvious to medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<hr />
<p>We usually hear the term &quot;SIDS&quot; when discussing safe sleeping habits with our labor and delivery nurses before we take our babies home and from our child's pediatricians. There's a lot of fear and anxiety surrounding Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and a lot of misinformation.</p>
<p>What is SIDS?</p>
<pre><code>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old. SIDS is sometimes known as crib death because the infants often die in their cribs.

Source: MayoClinic</code></pre>
<p>SIDS is not the cause of every sudden infant death. Each year in the United States, thousands of babies die suddenly and unexpectedly. These deaths are called SUID, which stands for “Sudden Unexpected Infant Death.”</p>
<p>SUID includes all unexpected deaths: those without a clear cause, such as SIDS, and those from a known cause, such as suffocation. One-half of all SUID cases are SIDS. Many unexpected infant deaths are accidents, but a disease or something done on purpose can also cause a baby to die suddenly and unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“Sleep-related causes of infant death” are those linked to how or where a baby sleeps or slept. These deaths are due to accidental causes, such as suffocation, entrapment, or strangulation. Entrapment is when the baby gets trapped between two objects, such as a mattress and a wall, and can’t breathe. Strangulation is when something presses on or wraps around the baby’s neck, blocking the baby’s airway. These deaths are not SIDS.</p>
<p>Other things that SIDS is not:</p>
<pre><code>SIDS is not the same as suffocation and is not caused by suffocation.
SIDS is not caused by vaccines, immunizations, or shots.
SIDS is not contagious.
SIDS is not the result of neglect or child abuse.
SIDS is not caused by cribs.
SIDS is not caused by vomiting or choking.
SIDS is not completely preventable, but there are ways to reduce the risk.</code></pre>
<p>How can I reduce the risk of SIDS?
There's no way to prevent SIDS, but there are ways to reduce your child's risk.</p>
<pre><code>Always place your baby on his or her back to sleep, for naps and at night, to reduce the risk of SIDS.
Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib, covered by a fitted sheet.
Keep soft objects, toys, crib bumpers, and loose bedding out of your baby's sleep area to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related causes of infant death. (Disclaimer: this is a blanket statement, use your best judgement to decide when your baby is ready to have a thin blanket or stuffed animal in their sleep space.)
Keeping your home or child's room at a comfortable temperature has been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS.
Consider using a pacifier for naps and bedtime.
Room sharing (not bedsharing) for the first 6 months of your baby's life.
Breastfeeding (about 60% less likely to die from SIDS than infants who didn't receive any breast milk).
Avoid products marketed as reducing the risk of SIDS.</code></pre>
<p>The FDA has never cleared or approved a baby product to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS, but a lot of baby products have unproven claims to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS, such as:</p>
<pre><code>heart rate and breathing monitors
mattresses
crib tents
pillows
crib bedding, including bumpers and blankets, and infant positions.</code></pre>
<p>This is not to say to avoid all of these things all together, but to avoid items that have false claims of preventing or reducing the SIDS risk with the expectation that it WILL reduce or prevent SIDS. Most baby items (such as mattresses) have to meet certain safety standards defined by the CPSC.</p>
<p>For example: Infant positioners can be recommended by a pediatrician for a number of reasons but should be used under the guidance of a pediatrician based on circumstance.</p>
<p>Can I use a home heart or breathing monitors to reduce the risk of SIDS?
I'm sure I'm not the only parent who has hovered over my newborn wondering, &quot;Is he breathing?&quot; According to Dr. David King, a pediatric researcher at the University of Sheffield, there's no research to suggest that the information provided by these new devices provides a reliable indicator of danger, or indeed any reliable information about your child. &quot;It's not registered as a medical device.&quot; His findings were published in The British Medical Journal - April 2014.</p>
<p>Home heart rate or breathing monitors can't reduce the risk of SIDS in a healthy child and having additional items/wires in your baby's crib can actually increase the risk of strangulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The procedures proved to reduce the rate of SIDS include placing an infant near the bottom of a cot, on their back, no pillow at all, and if using a blanket, have it made so it is tucked in securely at the bottom of the cot and rises only just high enough to reach the baby's upper chest as they lay with their feet almost touching the end of the cot.</p>
<p>Also: ban cigarette smoke from the house.  No indoor smoking.</p>
<p>Lastly, breastfeeding helps.   The combination of these three techniques dropped the incidence of SIDS by 83% in Australia between 1985 to 2005.</p>

<p>There are some theories what might be the cause and there seem to be risk factors (sleeping on the belly) that increase the likeliness of a child dying in that fashion, but in the end we just don't know yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, the exact cause is not known. Several studies have noted that there appears to be abnormalities in the brain stems of infants who died with no known cause that suggests they may have issues with arousing during distress while sleeping. Normally if an infant's breathing in obstructed while sleeping (ex. If they have sleep apnea or a pillow is to close too their face), they will wake up and gasp for air, move their head, etc. to reset their breathing. It's possible these babies with abnormalities may not be able to wake themselves up to correct the situation. This may explain risk factors such as sleeping on stomachs and breathing in cigarette smoke. </p>
<p>This article mentions several studies that corroborate this theory: <a href="http://www.parentingscience.com/what-is-SIDS.html" target="_blank">http://www.parentingscience.com/what-is-SIDS.html</a>  </p>

A lithium ion physically exists and interacts with other molecules to provide or absorb electrons. It takes up space and weighs some amount. We can improve the tech of the battery to allow more of the useful chemical and fewer metal walls for example, but revolutionizing the battery requires a new chemistry entirely.</p>
<p>With computer chips, we make functional pieces smaller so the same chunk of silicon can hold more of them. But we haven't necessarily made the chunk of silicon cheaper or more power-efficient, we can just use a smaller one.</p>
<p>There is no similar analogy for batteries, what we want to do <em>is</em> to make it cheaper or more efficient for the same size. Something we've never been great at with other pieces of electronics either. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others are addressing this from a technological perspective so I will approach the economic angle.</p>
<p>The mainstream demand for improved battery technology really did not exist to the same extent as it does today.  Before miniaturisation and widespread adoption of pocket computers (mobile phones etc) batteries were simply good enough for most consumers.  The idea of a pocket pc was still in the realm of scifi for many. Batteries were for things like torches, cars, radios, toys etc and a few extra grams and a slightly bulkier form factor really wasn't a problem for these items.</p>
<p>Once consumers saw value in newer technologies and began to demand smaller, faster, longer lasting and more powerful mobile computing devices, battery technology quickly became a limitation and thus more heavily researched as having better battery tech would give a competitive edge to hi tech manufacturers.</p>
<p>Now that we have mainstream mass produced high density batteries, we are starting to find applications in a wide range of industries, for example electric vehicles which have become more viable as a result.</p>
<p>There was nothing stopping the research and advancement of battery technology sooner, it just wasn't a priority compared to other major research.</p>
<p>Parallel streams of technology often behave in this way, feeding into each other and moving in fits and bursts based on new discoveries and market forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The problem is modern devices like smart phones are designed to last about 18 hours on a charge.  You plug them in overnight, use them during the day, then plug them in again at bedtime.  As battery life improves, new features, like bright screens, GPS, wireless, 4G, and GPS are squeezed into phone, bringing the life back down to 18 hours or so.</p>
<p>Old Nokia 3000 series phones got about 100 hours standby on a 500 maH battery, and that was with the old, power hungry AMPS anology signals.  You put a modern 3000+ maH battery in one of those, and you would be charging it once a month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Some people simply have less of a response trigger to capsaicin than others. The other part is something you can get used to with practice (to a point). If you have a want for handling spicy, eat a bit of hot as you can stand stuff every day. You become accustomed to it, and may learn to really enjoy it, but like a muscle, if you stop training it, you will start to lose it. Going a week without eating anything really spicy will leave you unable to handle super spicy food again. </p>
<p>Also, as an added note: when you try one of those record breaking hot peppers, like the 1.4 million shu ghost peppers, you aren't eating a pepper with 1.4 million shu's.  Record breaking peppers are grown in very special conditions and selectively bred to get that hot. Your ghost pepper you got a hold of is likely closer to just 600k shu.  Jalapenos can range anywhere from 6k to 300k shu's. </p>
<p>A good sauce to start with is Da Bomb: Ground Zero. 321,000 shu's .</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From  <a href="https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/radioluminescent/radioluminescentinfo.htm" target="_blank">https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/radioluminescent/radioluminescentinfo.htm</a> (Oak Ridge Associated Universities)</p>
<p>&quot;Quoting Ed Landa: &quot;zinc sulfide was mixed with a radium salt to yield products containing about 25 to 300 ug [one ug is essentially the same as one uCi] of radium element per gram. The more concentrated preparations (generally containing 215 ug of radium per gram to meet British Admiralty standards) were used on aircraft and ship instrument dials, while lower-grade materials containing about 50 to 100 ug of radium per gram of mixture were used on watches, switch markings, and other devices requiring less critical reading.&quot;  According to a Department of Commerce Information Circular from 1930, the paint might contain &quot;from 0.7 to 3 and even 4 milligrams of radium element to 100 grams of zinc sulfide. Impurities may be added to the zinc sulfide as follows: Cadmium, 0.05 per cent; copper, 0.001 per cent; manganese, 0.0002 per cent.&quot; </p>
<p>As from the cited text, making radium paint required only micrograms to milligrams of elemental radium. So you could paint thousands to millions of dials and watches with just a gram of radium. The glow is actually caused by the zinc sulfide fluorescing in response to the radioactivity of the radium salt additive, which is so radioactive it can provide sufficient amount for radioluminescence at such low concentrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a pastor for 16 years.  I have an undergrad degree in social work and purposefully worked in an area that served poorer communities for 8 of those years where I made less than $25k per year plus a small parsonage. The vast majority of people who work as ministers don't make much money at all and many denominations require a graduate degree. Now days I serve a church in a much wealthier area and make a middle class wage but our church still spends about 25% of our gross income on helping the poor and homeless. Most pastors work 60+ hours a week and don't make much money. This is pretty typical in my experience for most ministers and churches. Just like teachers or social workers we don't go into this work for money. I've do it because we love it. </p>
<p>Those ministers who you see on tv who have jets and make millions of dollars are probably less than 1%. I think they're scoundrels who manipulate people with fear and promises of future wealth if they just give in faith. They use all kinds of schemes - selling &quot;blessed&quot; handkerchiefs, tickets to healing rallies etc. It's a bunch of nonsense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I once saw a video of a woman calling in to The 700 Club. She said, even though she'd given more than half the recommended tithe for the last several months, her financial situation still hadn't improved, as the purveryors of the prosperity gospel claimed that it would. </p>
<p>She said she couldn't afford to pay her rent, or to buy food for her kids. I could be imagining this part, but I seem to recall her also suggesting that her boyfriend was even becoming violent, and the money problems were the trigger.</p>
<p>Pat Robertson told her the problem was she was not giving enough. She should be giving more of her money to his organization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ones who live in luxury are mismanaging church funds. Basically all of the money comes from church members donating weekly or monthly. Many churches preach and pressure along the lines that if you donate 10% of your income and do good deeds great unexpected things will happen. </p>
<p>With that being said we go to a large church with great programs and facilities. They have a full staff and band and put on a really good service every weekend. The head pastor drives an old SUV and is a regular guy. This church is very transparent about their budget and how the money is being spent and they don't pressure for donations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one here has really answered the question for most &quot;rich&quot; pastors. the majority of the wealthy pastors are writers of books, magazines, or they run conferences, or church literature, or non-church donation based funding.</p>
<p>Joel Osteen is worth millions based on books. My understanding is he doesn't even take a salary from the church.(not to defend him). People like Rick Warren is open that he donates 90% of his annual income from is writing to charity/church/christian causes. He doesn't take a salary from the church.</p>
<p>These people are incredibly dynamic, engaging personalities. They are the .1% in their field. Not all are the televangelists that get the bad press.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it has something to do with R.E.M. Sleep Cycles. Essentially, you're waking up during the lighter stage of your sleep cycle, which means you don't feel the groggy effects of waking during deep sleep. </p>
<p>I'm sure someone smarter can expand on hormone release during the cycle that also has an effect. </p>
<p>TLDR: You're not in as much of a deep sleep as you would be following a full nights sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body goes through sleep cycles that last average around 90 minutes each. More or less depending on how long you've been asleep. I started setting my alarm to wake me up at exactly the end of a cycle and you'd be surprised to see hoe much easier it is to get up. Besides lack of sleep, most people feel froggy in the morning because they wake up in the middle of a cycle. </p>
<p>So for example if you go to bed at 10 (if you are a person tbat normally falls asleep within a few minutes) you would have to get up at either 5:30, 7 or 8:30. Waking up at 6 would interrupt a cycle and disrupt your morning.</p>
<p>I use a sleep app that tells me when is the best time to wake up based on what time Im going to bed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
