		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speed of sound really isn't the limiting factor here. No matter what the speed, if it never dies down (attenuates) it will all travel infinitely.</p>
<p>Attenuation of sound varies greatly by a variety of variables, one of the most important actually being the frequency of the sound in question. And they behave incredibly weirdly. At low frequencies, for example, higher humidity is better. At higher frequencies, lower humidity is better. At middle frequencies, no humidity is best, but if there is humidity, higher is better. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Atmospheric_sound_absorption_coefficient_2.svg" target="_blank">Attenuation per meter per atmosphere by frequency and humidity</a> [and <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Engineering_Acoustics/Outdoor_Sound_Propagation#Attenuation_by_atmospheric_absorption.5B5.5D_.5B6.5D_.5B7.5D" target="_blank">source</a>]. </p>
<p>However, attenuation always increases with atmospheric pressure as the chart is in attenuation per atmosphere. And since it's per meter, the speed of sound shouldn't affect it. So going by the atmospheric attenuation, sound travels furthest in low pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of sound is the square root of the pressure divided by the mass density. Now since in an ideal gas the pressure is equal to the nkT where n is the number density, T the absolute temperature and k the Boltzmann constant. So to answer your question, assuming the air is homogeneous i.e. the same everywhere and your question relates to the distance travelled in a certain amount of time, it will depend quite how the air pressure is higher. If the air is hotter with the same density, then yes it will travel further. If the air is more dense but the same temperature, it will cover less distance in a given time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey all, little late to the party, but I thought I'd talk a little about the way sound works.</p>
<p>One key element to having a good understanding of how sound propagates is being aware that sound's fundamental form is vibration: specifically, compression and rarefaction (expansion). In a wave representation of sound the crest correlates to the point of greatest compression and the trough to the point of greatest rarefaction. Imagine a caterpillar moving along (compress, relax, compress, relax) and you'll have the basic idea. Sound <em>can</em> travel in &quot;waves&quot; but when it does it's due to environmental factors; given an entirely static environment, sound will propagate through perfectly spherical pulses of expansion and compression.</p>
<p>There are a number of elements that affect sound travel through a medium (density, rigidity, salinity if it's traveling through water) and unfortunately without a lot of math it's difficult to predict how sound will act in a given environment. A rule of thumb that may help is that &quot;sound is lazy&quot; and will escape/avoid/attenuate in an environment where the sound speed is high. The ocean is a great example of this. In a column of water the speed of sound varies constantly due to three main elements: temperature, salinity, and pressure. (I'm assuming that we're in the middle of an ocean in this example so salinity is close enough to constant to not be a factor) Close to the surface, there's a layer of water where the sound speed is high due to temperature and then further down, in layers of water that are never warmed by the sun, there's another layer where sound reaches the same speed due to pressure. These two layers of water form the upper and lower borders of a &quot;duct&quot; through which sound can propagate without losing energy to the surface or bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>If you're curious about how sound works in water, I'd suggest googling &quot;RP 33 navy&quot; (<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=rp%2033%20navy" target="_blank">here</a>) and checking out the top link. One of the primary references for sonar techs in the US Navy is this document and it has a lot of good information for those of you who can stomach some really dry reading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the volume of air is constant, yes</p>
<p>The speed of sound is defined as:
V_air = sqrt(y <em> R </em> T) with &quot;y&quot; the specific heat ratio of air, &quot;R&quot; the molecular gas constant for air, and &quot;T&quot; the temperature of the air in either kelvin or rankines. </p>
<p>So if the air pressure is higher, then the ideal gas law tells us that the air temperature would be higher too, as long as the volume of air is constant</p>
<p>So going back to the speed of sound equation, y and R don't change with temperature ideally (y actually changes a lot with temperature at supersonic flow conditions and faster). So the speed of sound equation is just a function of temperature.</p>
<p>So air pressure going up causing air temp goes up, which in terms increases the speed of sound </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &quot;What would happen if...&quot;, &quot;How will the future...&quot;, &quot;If all the rules for 'X' were different...&quot;, &quot;Why does my...&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Asking Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.</p>
<p>The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.</p>
<p><strong>Answering Questions:</strong></p>

To move a mass back and forth you have to push it with another mass, and that second mass has exactly the opposite dipole motion because it's experiencing equal and opposite forces, so the total dipole movement is always zero. Electricity doesn't have this feature because you can push on charged objects with neutral objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Special little machines in your cells can read these three letter words and mix the proper amino acid ingredients together to cook proteins. In doing so, they make new machines and building blocks for your body's cells to use.</p>
<p>When we say we have &quot;mapped the genome&quot;, we mean that we have read the entire cook book of several individuals, and written down the recipes in the correct order. </p>
<p>However, just because we know how to cook something does not mean we know how it works or what every recipe is for. A lot of current research is focused on understanding what the function of a lot of the recipes is. This is important for several reasons. One is that recipes sometimes become damaged. A lot of times you hear about a genetic illness, it is because the recipe for a particular mini-machine or protein has become damaged, and then your body loses some function.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the kind words, all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anyone with a child's microscope and a steady hand can see that there are 46 human chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs, and that they look like striped, knotted skeins of yarn when stained; anyone with a child's chemistry set can determine that these chromosomes are made of phosphorous, a modified (deoxygenated) version of a sugar called &quot;ribose&quot;, and four nitrogen-containing, high-pH chemicals (or <em>bases</em>): guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine. (These all rhyme with <em>ween</em>.) Given that we isolate these base-containing molecules as acids, and given that we isolate them from the cell's nucleus, we call these molecules &quot;Deoxyribonucleic acid.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyone with a sophomore's biochemistry kit can determine that different, <em>ordered</em> combinations of DNA's four bases results in different proteins, when exposed to the enzymes and chemical environment of the cell; ask a doctor, and you can easily learn that many human traits (especially diseases) can be diagnosed by whether your body synthesizes a normal, altered, or degenerate form of a particular protein.</p>
<p>Those with the altered <em>protein</em> must have altered <em>DNA</em> producing it; since such traits are heritable by one's offspring, chromosomes must be the mechanism of heredity. (There's other evidence for this, of course - this isn't the order that these things were discovered.) Given that the traits are passed on to new <em>generations</em>, we call the part of the DNA that produces a particular protein the <em>gene</em> for that protein.</p>
<p>What remains is to know <em>where</em> on each chromosome each gene is located - how far from the beginning or the end, and how much of the chromosome each gene takes up. The view of the chromosomes from the microscopes could only go so far down, and the view of the bases from chemistry could only go so far up. For decades there as an enormous gap in between into which we could not see.</p>
<p>That was really hard to figure out, and it took a lot of chemistry and new machines and new computer algorithms, but once we did it, we had an arrangement of a human's chromosomes and what they contained and where they contained it, and when you <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&amp;lastVirtModeType=default&amp;lastVirtModeExtraState=&amp;virtModeType=default&amp;virtMode=0&amp;nonVirtPosition=&amp;position=chr9%3A133252000-133280861&amp;hgsid=575792781_de5JNIJAbFGOTd3LP5n43ljEill1" target="_blank">plot it out to look at it</a> you can think of it as a <em>map</em>. So when we say we've mapped the human genome, we mean the same thing almost as if we'd said &quot;we've mapped Toledo, OH&quot; - we've gone there and figured out what's there and where it's located relative to everything else. Which is not to say that we know <em>everything about it</em>, just like how a map of Toledo doesn't tell you everything there is to know about Toledo, either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Mountains here, a bay over there, a desert down there, etc. That is a map. Similarly with chromosomes, with a whole bunch of markers on each chromosome, specific genes can be located between point &quot;A&quot; and point &quot;B&quot; on chromosome &quot;12&quot;, say. </p>
<p>There is another century of work figuring out what it all means. But now there is a latitude/longitude system of sorts for the chromosomes. The map is 20 years old, they've been sequenced as well now, so we have a very good idea of what chromosomes look like. </p>
<p>For context, it was discovered long ago that human genomes are 99.9% the same between people. A high level map of one person's genome works pretty well on another person. The differences between people show up in the remaining 0.1%. </p>

A square object &quot;rolling&quot; would have four big impacts, while a bowling ball would have tons of tiny ones, which add up to the smooth rolling noise.</p>
<p>Source: It makes sense in my head so I hope that's how it is</p>
<p>Edit: think of the atoms. As the ball rolls, the object itself stays on the ground, but each surface atom is constantly going up and down, taking turns hitting the ground and then getting rolled back up. That's what makes up all the tiny impacts that cause the sound</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because humans have evolved what basically is two systems of thinking.<br />
System 1 is the instinctual, intuitive process that all animals have.  It is fast, has access to nearly all of your memories, and brings quick information based on heuristic shortcuts.  Part of this is is an individual-recognizing system that automatically says &quot;this is Bob.&quot;  Almost all animals have it, though it is not always based on vision of faces.
System 2 is the conscious, intentional thought.  This is slower, and you have a limited amount at a time (focus or attention), but it allows you to assess things in a more ordered detailed way.  This is thought to be what we call sentience.<br />
When you intentionally study a face, you are calling on system 2 and suppressing system 1, so you can view features and not &quot;Bob.&quot;  This throws off your automatic pattern recognition that is the default.  It creates some dissonance in your mind, and the face without the automatic intuition seems strange or alien.<br />
This topic interests me a lot because being aware of your conscious vs automatic thought processes can be really useful, because system 1 is usually working with more information, but it has a tendency to jump to conclusions and have a lot of biases.  Awareness of when and when not to rely on the things that automatically pop into your head can make your decision making much better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Judaism is what's called an &quot;ethno-religious group&quot;. Thousands of years ago, that was pretty common. If you were Egyptian, you almost certainly also followed the Ancient Egyptian religion. If you were Jewish, you almost certainly also followed the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>This was to the point that it was almost &quot;by definition&quot;. The Egyptians didn't expect non-Egyptians to follow the Egyptian religion, and the Jews didn't expect the non-Jews to follow the Jewish religion. There are writings from antiquity talking about how whenever someone traveled to a different place or married into a different tribe/nation, they'd sacrifice to the local gods of the area, not worrying about the ones back home until they got home. During times of war, there would be attempts to lure the other side's god(s) to your side with offers of better sacrifices or whatever.</p>
<p>Again, this was the common state of humanity and its various groups for thousands of years. It was generally assumed that there were many gods of many nations, each set of god(s) looking out for their respective nations. Pantheons were fluid, with gods in different pantheons being identified with each other (oh, you have a thunder god too? It's probably the same guy, you just call him Bob instead of Spencer, next time I sacrifice I'll call out to Bob too...).</p>
<p>Where the Jews and Judaism differed from most others is that they became strict monotheists (there's evidence that at the beginning of the Jewish religion they were more accurately &quot;henotheists&quot;, meaning they recognized that other gods existed, but only theirs was the best/most powerful/chief).</p>
<p>(EDIT: Above I originally said that henotheism meant that they felt it was only right to worship one, not that one was the most powerful/chief/best. The correct term for thinking it's right to worship only one is &quot;monolatry&quot;, which is a difference that I swear I knew before. Props to u/Zorro_Darksauce for the correction.)</p>
<p>This monotheism gave rise to the idea that non-Jewish gods didn't exist. While they shed polytheism, they didn't shed the nation-god association, meaning that God was <em>their</em> God and while He was also everyone else's God, everyone else had a lesser role in His plan and weren't required to do as much and/or were denied His special favor.</p>
<p>The other way in which Judaism differed from many others is that this dynamic continued until today. The other major examples that I can think of would be Shinto and Hinduism, but there are countless religions of equal pedigree and age around the world that are often lump under the generic &quot;folk religion&quot; tag.</p>
<p>This is contrasted with religions like Christianity and Islam, which were founded as religions not for a particular people, but for <em>all</em> people. As a result, they had an imperative to go out and convert others to their religion that was lacking in the earlier dynamic (and would even have been viewed as kind of silly...&quot;they're not Japanese, why would they practice Shinto?&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I answer your question, I have to note that most of the answers here, even those with hundreds of upvotes, are in part or even wholly wrong. I don't know why there is so much ignorance about Judaism - it is not exactly a secret religion and there is plenty of fairly authoritative information about who we are and what we believe on the Internet (well, I guess a lot of BS written by non-Jews and even anti-Semites, too, so maybe it is difficult separating truth from reality here).</p>
<p>To dispel some of the myths I've read so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Judaism does accept converts and has so since ancient times. It is only frowned upon because Jews see the obligations incumbent on Jewish people alone (613 commandments) is an unnecessary burden for Gentiles to take on (who are obligated to follow 7 commandments). Jews believe that Gentiles who follow that tiny subset of obligations to be just as righteous as Jews who follow the full set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Judaism doesn't stress the afterlife like Christianity and Islam do, what's clear from our tradition is that it is not reserved for Jews. Everyone (everyone) ends up in the same place: &quot;the world to come&quot; (which is ambiguously defined since, well, no one has ever come back to tell us about it...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sincerity is important for conversion, so the idea that converts are only allowed to take in spouses is diametrically wrong. Prospective converts are routinely denied if they are found to be doing so just to appease future in-laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only are converts considered as Jewish as someone born Jewish, there is actually a commandment that Jews can not treat converts differently, and can not even draw attention to the fact that a convert wasn't born Jewish. A convert is as Jewish as Moses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;God's chosen people&quot; is completely misinterpreted. Among Jews familiar with our religious tradition, it has always meant the obligations of Torah and the fact that the Jewish nation chose to accept them. It has never meant we believe God loves us more than Gentiles; this is a strawman invented by Catholic authorities ages ago in order to demonize us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Judaism, there is no concept of race. It is meaningless. There are and have been Jews of all sorts of national origin since ancient times, not least due to the fact that conversion has always existed (the book of Ruth is literally about Judaism's first convert). As for how we feel about treating people who are different based on their looks/national origin: in the Bible, Moses's sister Miriam is struck with a sort of disease when she makes fun of Moses's (African) wife, and God doesn't release her from the disease until she repents for days.</p>
</li>
<li>There is no concept of a &quot;racial Jew&quot; or &quot;partial Jew.&quot; You're either Jewish or you're not; you were either born to a Jewish mother or a convert, or you're not Jewish. Period. Someone with a Jewish father but a Gentile mother is not Jewish (unless s/he converts). And since both mother &amp; father contribute the same amount of DNA to a child, the idea that Judaism cares about how much &quot;Jewish DNA&quot; you have is simply not true.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to answer your question: </p>
<p>Judaism is only a religion. The reason that, in certain locations in the world, Jews look broadly similar to one another is that those groups historically didn't intermarry (they followed the religious commandment to marry another Jew) and conversion was either frowned upon or outright forbidden (sometimes under penalty of death or punishment of the Jewish community) by the surrounding population, or there was so little contact between Jews and their Gentile neighbors that each population evolved separately.</p>
<p>It might be helpful, though, to think of the Jewish people as a nation. You can either be born to a nation automatically and have all the obligations incumbent on you automatically by virtue of your birth, or you can join the nation (&quot;naturalize&quot;) by agreeing to follow rules and being accepted by a designated authority.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are several different ethnic groups of Jewish people that wouldn't have similar features. Your average Ashkenazi Jewish person isn't going to look exactly like your average Sephardic Jewish person isn't going to look your average Bukharan Jewish person isn't going to look like your average Cochin Jewish person, because during the several Jewish diaspora, the Jewish peoples moved into other nations, fell in love with and had children with local ethnic groups, but also had a significant degree of intermarriage and unique customs that each of these groups became distinct ethnically.</p>
<p>With regard to Catholicism/early Christianity/orthodox faiths, remember that during its spread, the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, etc., spread them by force and conquest, and sent missionaries out to every land under the sun. &quot;Catholic,&quot; as an adjective, literally means &quot;universal.&quot; The idea was that everyone was obligated to convert to Christianity. Some iterations of the faith took this to mean &quot;... or die!&quot; while others did not. So the reason why there is no strong ethnic association with Catholicism (there are weak associations; the Irish, Italians, Latin Americans, etc.) is because Catholicism never envisioned itself as the faith of any particular ethnic group. It was always practiced by multi-ethnic groups of early Christians. </p>
<p>Judaism, on the other hand, was the ethnic religion of the Hebrews, much like all of the Indo-European groups had some version of the PIE religion. Catholicism, for the most part, wiped out folk religions of Indo-Europeans, to the point today where all attempts at reconstructing those folk religions for worship are at best copies of copies of what we think someone eight hundred years dead thought about those religions. But there are always movements within ethnic groups to practice that group's traditional religion. It's just that the Jewish peoples, like a few others (Zoroastrians, for example), have managed to maintain and preserve their ethnic folk religion in a way few others have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And there are plenty of people whose fathers were the Jewish ones but they were still raised (or at least partially) Jewish, like Carrie Fisher. Thing is, it's basically in the realm of ethnicity and community. And converts ARE accepted, there's just a prohibition on proselytism and a conversion process is long to make sure that people really want to go through it. There are also many types of Jews (Kaifeng, Ashkenazi, Mountain, Beta, Mizrahim, etc) but we're united by the faith (even if many aren't religious), common family ties and the fact that we're around 1% of the world's population.</p>

There is sufficient genetic diversity within the Jewish population, if nothing else, across the Ashkenazi/Sephardi divide. There's a Jewish diaspora all over the world.

For example in humans it's about 1.2*10^(-8) per base pair per generation. This can vary even within the human population though -- older fathers have more mutated sperm, which is why paternal age correlates to health problems. It can certainly vary between species, though I don't know by how much.</p>
<p>In particular, bacteria reproduce asexually (mitosis) while humans reproduce sexually (meiosis). The latter is a more error-prone process than the former. [EDIT: not the full story, see /u/EasySeven 's reply]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution and mutation rate are two dfferent things. If a species only produces &quot;bad&quot; mutations, then selection just weeds those bad mutations out. But what a &quot;bad&quot; mutation is, depends on the environment, so the same mutation can be bad in one environment and good in another.</p>
<p>Then there is also the population size. A larger population produces more mutations than a smaller population (seems logical of you think about it). A larger population is also likely to have more genetic diversity. </p>
<p>Evolution works on selection pressure on genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is created by mutations. </p>
<p>To answer you question: bacteria tend to have a larger population size than multi-cellular organisms, even than humans. It is hard to generalize, but I guess selection pressure is also higher in bacteria. So, yes, bacteria are probably evolving faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First things first, the rate of evolution is not the same as the rate of mutation. Evolution refers to how individuals adapt to their environment while mutation is just changes in genetic sequence. </p>
<p>Now, the human body is remarkable at preventing mutations. Mutations primarily happen during replication (the process where DNA is copied). In this process the DNA double helix is opened up by various proteins, and then an enzyme latches onto the DNA string and slides across it, while catalyzing the reaction that adds the complimentary Nucleotide. </p>
<p>A core feature of DNA is that it's reverse complimentary, meaning that every single nucleotide compliments another one. There are four nucleotides in DNA, Adenine and Thymine always bond, and Guanine and Cytosine always bond. So DNA is copied by splitting the DNA double helix, and having an enzyme catalyze the addition of the complimentary nucleotides to the DNA string, which ends in two copies of the original DNA strand.</p>
<p>So already that enzyme which catalyzes the addition makes it so that  only complimentary nucleotides can be added. But in one out of every thousand additions, a wrong nucleotide is added. But another enzyme checks the additions, and removes wrongly added nucleotides. Together these two mechanisms makes it so that only 1 in a 1,000,000 nucleotides is a wrong one. And finally another repair system &quot;The mismatch repair system&quot; checks the newly synthesized DNA  strand one final time after the synthesis is done, and cuts out any wrongly synthesised parts. In total these three mechanisms make is so that only 1 in 10^9 mistakes are made when synthesising DNA. </p>
<p>This mechanism is present in both bacteria and humans, thus the two mutate at rougly mutate at the same rate. </p>
<p>Now the reason that Bacteria can evolve more quickly than humans is because of something called horizontal gene transfer, which is a way in which different bacteria exchange DNA in the form of plasmids (DNA pieces seperate form the circular DNA in bacteria) that can be exchanged between bacteria. This mechanism does so that Bacteria are incredibly efficient at exchanging DNA, and it is through these exchanges that something like antibiotic resistance can quickly spread through an entire bacterial population in a very short amount of time. </p>
<p>Naturally this discounts the environmental factors, to which bacteria are much more exposed, which also cause mutations.</p>
<p>So in short, bacteria and human cells mutate at the same rate, but bacteria are much more efficient at transfering any beneficial mutations between one another and thus &quot;evolve&quot; faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  Depending on &quot;how good&quot; the molecular mechanics is, and how long (i.e. how many potential places there are to have a mutation), the mutation rate will vary between species.  A couple other people have mentioned those numbers and compared humans to other species.</p>
<p>I'm going to also add that it can vary with position in the genome, and environmental conditions.  For example, your immune system has some cells that produce antibodies, and the antibodies are coded for in their DNA.  However, when the immune system senses that it's under attack, some of these specific cells undergo what is called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation" target="_blank">Somatic Hypermutation</a>&quot; -- there is a special mechanism that makes the particular regions of DNA that codes for antibodies mutate up to a million times faster than everything else.  This results in many different cells with different antibodies; the ones that work get used (they divide <em>without</em> the mutation system turned on), while the ones that don't don't.</p>
<hr />
<p>E: Another example: HIV is known for it's very high mutation rate: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26375597" target="_blank">(4.1 ± 1.7) × 10^(-3) per base per cell</a>.  That's on the order of 100k times faster than other things, and is part of the reason it's so hard to fight off.  That number is high enough that in a &quot;full-scale&quot; HIV infection, the virus can experiment with changing every base pair in its genome <em>every day</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only is the rate different between species, it can be different between genes within the same species.  Some organisms have mechanisms that selectively increase the mutation rate of targeted portions of their genome.  For example, our immune systems recognize pathogens by their surface proteins, so it is advantageous to mutate these proteins more rapidly than ones in their metabolic pathways.  This is a naturally occurring version of site-directed mutagenesis.</p>
<p>One way this is achieved is by carrying broken copies or fragments of the genes near the functional copy.  These can incorrectly bind to the functional gene and increase the chance of a copy error.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you go to bed at night, you've been moving around all day and your muscles are still prepped and active for movement, and weaker as you've been using them all day. As you're laying in bed, unless you're utterly exhausted, you have to find a position where your muscles can relax best. Once you fall asleep, you stop moving completely for a few hours on end which causes your muscles to stiffen. When you wake up in the morning, you generally feel amazing as you've begun moving again and stretching. Stretching makes your muscles relax and stiffness of sleep go away, which is why it feels so awesome to lay in bed after waking up and moving a bit. Your muscles are so relaxed after a morning stretch that any position is comfortable.</p>
<p>This is also why it's so much easier to fall asleep at night if you do proper stretches throughout the day.</p>
<p>It could also be a psychological thing either caused by the warmness of the blanket vs coldness of the morning, or having to do with getting up and going to work</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
