		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Preschool teacher here, with a masters  in education. Simply put, babies and animals like high pitched cooing. It feels safe and comforting to them. The high pitched baby talk portrays a positive emotion to babies, while grumbling or yelling would likely make a baby upset. That explains tone, but the type of language we use demands further explanation.</p>
<p>We tend to say things like, &quot;woooooooooow, what a big girl, playing with the choo choo train! Chooooo Chooooo!&quot; Talking to an adult, we would never extend the vowel sounds or ask about the Choo Choo, we would just say train. Adults say these types of things, in short, to help children understand vocabulary and assign words to objects and actions. We exaggerate vowel sounds to encourage them to start imitating and speaking. We offer a play-by-play of what we are doing (&quot;you are playing with the train&quot;) and state the obvious, (&quot;the train is blue, the train has wheels&quot;) just to let the kid know what's going on. </p>
<p>But, if we are trying to teach them to talk, why not just say train? Isn't Choo Choo train harder to say than train? Yes, but we like to offer the child basically an adjective and a noun. &quot;This is a train and it makes the Choo Choo sound, so it's a Choo Choo train&quot; or &quot;this is a cow and it says moo, so it's a moo cow&quot;. It basically provides a scaffold for the children; if they forgot cow, maybe they will remember the moo part. Or they can learn to associate the sound with the object, the color, the shape, size, etc. All about vocab building and recognition.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is also because it helps us bond with the babies. We as adults feel the need to &quot;get into character&quot;, to shift our speech patterns to acknowledge to ourselves and others the special relationship we have with the baby. Our nurturing, loving, never swearing, always teaching side kicks into gear and we babble and coo away. It's a learned social behavior that conveys to both the adult and baby that they are in a loving relationship. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be some confusion regarding what &quot;baby talk&quot; constitutes. See /u/sippy_cup 's response to get a good summary of some of the features of what has been referred to by linguists and speech-language pathologists as &quot;motherese,&quot; or more recently &quot;infant-directed speech&quot; (IDS). </p>
<p>Many of the comments seem to be objecting to the use of vocabulary that people associate with kids (i.e., &quot;doggy&quot; and &quot;kitty&quot;) and modifying grammar in ways that are not associated with adult-like speech. That is not what IDS is. IDS refers to the exaggerated prosody, hyperarticulation, and higher pitch that tends to feature in the vast majority of cultures' speech to pre-lingual infants. Older children do benefit greatly from being exposed to more complex sentences and a wide vocabulary, but that is not mutually exclusive with parents using infant-directed speech to their babies while they are pre-lingual.</p>
<p>There is actually plenty of evidence pointing to benefits from IDS. To quickly add a few sources for the curious:</p>
<p>facilitates word segmentation:

<p>babies prefer to listen to motherese (and getting babies to listen is crucial for language acquisition):

<p>…similarly, babies respond better to IDS, and there is neural imaging evidence for it. Improved response even when it’s a stranger.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I studied language acquisition in college.</p>
<p>I just wanted to note that child-directed speech (motherese) is not universal among all human cultures. Some cultures do not use motherese (such as Samoa and Papua New Guinea) and just speak to children the same as they speak to anyone else. I remember studying about one culture (I can't remember which culture it is) that does not even speak to a baby (child) until the baby starts speaking. The babies in that culture learn the language by hearing it, not by being spoken to.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether child-directed speech is used or not, or even if the child is not spoken to at all, children all pretty much learn and progress in their language development in similar steps and at similar ages.</p>
<p>To sum up, we talk weirdly to babies because it is what is normal in our culture, not because it benefits the baby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cancer is basically uncontrolled reproduction of cells. The cells in your body all have a job and a timeline. So for example, and this is not an actual number, but a bone cell will replicate itself 10 times and then it dies. Or if it gets damaged it sends out a signal to other cells &quot;hey! I'm not going to make it!&quot; And it's broken down and absorbed by the body.</p>
<p>Cancer starts with a single mutated cell that replicates and replicates and now you have a tumor. It's a damaged cell but it doesn't send the &quot;kill me now!&quot; signal. And that tumor just grows and grows and develops more mutations that allow it to get nice and cozy where it's at. At a certain point it gets the body to send it blood with it's own system of vessels. Then pieces of it travel through the blood or lymphatic system and nestle in and grow more. This is called a metastasis. These growths put pressure on the tissue, organs, etc around it. They also steal blood from the surrounding tissue. </p>
<p>And it's completely unregulated because the body thinks it belongs there. Because it's made of your own cells. So it just takes the resources your body needs and pushes your organs and tissue out of the way to make more room and takes more blood and more nutrients while destroying functional tissue in making room for itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the beginning stages of many breast cancers, the cancer cells are contained in a limited area like the milk ducts. If left undiagnosed and untreated though, the cancer can spread. </p>
<p>In an ideal treatment, there would be a single tumor in a non vital area that could be easily removed. In an un-ideal situation there are many tumors spread throughout the body and manually removing could kill the patient, or is otherwise not possible.</p>
<p>In the case of breast cancer, the cancer cells can spread to the rest of the body (Metastatic breast cancer), growing new tumors. This not only makes it harder to treat, but depending on where those tumors grow, it can be deadly. For instance imagine one growing in your liver or lungs, or even your brain. It could damage the organ and cause organ failure. The organ failure in turn leads to a painful death as the organs shut down and the body slowly dies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not really the <em>cancer</em> that kills you, per se. If breast cancer remained confined to the breast, it would be a problem, but it (probably) wouldn't be lethal. The problem arises when cancer decides to venture out into the big, wide world of your body (aka metastasis). </p>
<p>If the cancer undergoes metastasis, odds are it's going to create a new cancer somewhere really important (stomach, brain, lung, etc). THOSE cancers can be really deadly (do YOU want something growing out of control on your brain? Thought not.) Alternatively, if the newly metastasized cancers are pushing up on something important, that can lead to impaired function and eventual death as well. </p>
<p>Another way that cancer can create problems is something called paraneoplastic syndrome. This basically happens when the hormones and chemicals the body uses to fight off cancer results in new problems, which might easily be fatal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They are formed along with the rest of the epidermis around 14 weeks.Birthmarks are areas of discolored skin that are on a baby's body at birth or that show up within a few months after delivery. Over 80 percent of babies have some kind of birthmark. Some endure for life, while others fade away over time.</p>
<p>Most birthmarks fall into one of two categories: vascular or pigmented. Vascular birthmarks are caused by blood vessels that have accumulated below the surface of the skin. They range in color from pink to red to bluish, depending on the depth of the blood vessels. Pigmented birthmarks — usually brown, gray, bluish, or black — result from an abnormal development of pigment cells. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are libraries of information on this topic! So interesting!</p>
<p>This is my favorite topic in psychology, but I'm not at home, or I would end up taking two days to reply!</p>
<p>This is a subject that actually predates psychology. Darwin says that facial expressions are universal (he tested this by having missionaries conduct surveys all over the world). All cultures share a core group of expressions.
Some psychologists say there are six universals: Ekman/Friesen/Shaver, some say three-Field; Plutchik says eight, Izard says ten, Feleky says 86 universal emotional expressions!</p>
<p>Darwin also said that emotional expressions fulfill an evolutionary purpose. When you smell something disgusting, you open your mouth and stick your tongue out in a wide manner--like a spout. Even though you are smelling something gross--you automatically react physically like you are spitting out something gross. As we get older, we can control it better by not sticking our tongue out or opening our mouths--but we still flare our nostrils--like we're preparing to make that face.</p>
<p>Blind children do these expressions, as well as isolated cultures--this indicates that facial expressions are native.</p>
<p>The trembling of the lip is associated with sadness or often pouting. Native children were studied by Darwin (his savages) and he found, that just like his own children, they protrude their bottom lip when they're sad--but as they grow up--stop doing this.</p>
<p>The evolutionary need, it has been speculated, is that the child is signaling the need for a breast to feed! So when our lip trembles, it may be a remnant of that response. </p>
<p>But of course--some believe the total opposite. Zajonc (and Waynbaum) believed that expression actually CAUSED the emotion by manipulating facial nerves and cranial blood flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Up to a certain point, you have to start making educated guesses, based both on modern-day descendants and modern-day analogues. So, say we had absolutely no images or depictions of anything even vaguely &quot;mammoth-y&quot; from prehistory, we'd be able to tell that it probably had a very elephant-like trunk based on comparison with modern-day elephant skulls and knowledge of how the animal could physically be built.</p>
<p>But, I mean, after a certain point you do slightly have to start making educated guesses. It varies from fossil to fossil though, and paleontologists are clever people. We're pretty good at guessing this stuff, and our guesses usually turn out to be right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm on my phone and can't get a nice link, but look at how particle detectors like Pierre Auger Observatory or Gamma-ray observatories like VERITAS work.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Graphics aren't everything in an engine. Keep this in mind, as it'll be important throughout the explanation. </p>
<p>First off there's the licensing and cost of running an engine that isn't yours. In the contracts, some companies can charge a % of what you make past x amount. You can imagine the publishers, shareholders, and other such people won't be too keen on losing money the put in. </p>
<p>The next bit is the physics requirements. Each game has different physics. Granted the projectile motion might WORK the same, but you might not get the same distances and etc.</p>
<p>Another issue is how game mechanics can tie in with the engine. UE might not support levelution on the scale that Frostbite can in Battlefield. UE might have issues working Halo's balance of movement, vehicles, and gunplay. There's also necessity. The engine may have stuff you don't need, which has to be cut out or else it just adds to the end file size.</p>
<p>Now we reach the grapics argument. In a sense, why do you WANT realistic graphics in every game? Look at Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch. Both have this cartoon feel to them. Borderlands focuses on their cell shaded approach to their style. Telltale games also do this too. Minecraft is self-explanatory as to why it's not necessary. Graphics and realism is nice, but the art style is where it's at. I can go and make a copy of real life, but where's the enjoyment to it? Where's the flair that separates it from all the other realistic copies? Now that real life copy I made won't sell as it's basically the same as everything else. Now if I accent something, distort the realism to something aesthetic, and capitalize on it, I can sell my copy. It's no longer copy of real life, but rather a copy of life that I see and enjoy.</p>
<p>Another argument is developer preference. It's similar to cost, but this time focusing in on the actual makers, not the investors. You may have guys that are killers with one language, but less so with another. UE4 can force this to happen, instead of just making an engine with what you need. </p>
<p>The last thing is what others are doing. If you just fall in with all the others, you can't set yourself apart. Setting yourself away from others and innovating with your own engine can boost marketing potential. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games" target="_blank">Here's</a> a list of all UE made games. You can see a lot of devs have been using it. You can also see that a lot of popular games don't use it at the same time. DICE has Frostbie, Crytek has Cryengine, 343 has...whatever they call theirs, Bungie has... also whatever they call theirs, Valve has Source, Alien: Isolation was made with a separate engine, Planetside 2 uses Forgelight, CoD games run on the IW Engine, Rainbow Six: Siege runs on the Anvil engine, and there are many other games running other engines.</p>
<p>The reason we hear about UE and its use is that it's publicly marketed to indie developers. You won't get a copy of Forgelight, IW, or Frostbite all that easily like you can with UE or Unity. </p>
<p>Now why did I say to remember that graphics aren't everything? Just look at this mini-essay. The best way to do this is to basically say &quot;Do I REALLY need a superpowered Formula1 engine in my Jeep? It's a great engine, but does it do what I need it to do effectively? Does it fit into my Jeep right? Can it help me with what I do with the Jeep, or is it just for the cool factor? Is this a smart, economically wise, thought out idea?&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR (Lazy copy/paste of quote above this, but this'll make it easier for y'all)</p>
<p>&quot;Do I REALLY need a superpowered Formula1 engine in my Jeep? It's a great engine, but does it do what I need it to do effectively? Does it fit into my Jeep right? Can it help me with what I do with the Jeep, or is it just for the cool factor? Is this a smart, economically wise, thought out idea?&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a game dev, and though I am not an engineer, I'd generally answer something like this...</p>
<p>A game engine is a lot more than just a way to put graphics on the screen. It is a development environment for artists, level designers, animators, programmers, etc. It also manages all the data structures, netcode, etc. of the game and defines their most basic capabilities and functionality. Unreal is great at a lot of things (it has extremely good art and level design tools), but it has some quirks and weaknesses too that don't necessarily mean everything is a win (you wouldn't say, want to make an MMO with it).</p>
<p>Even if we're talking about sheer graphical capabilities alone, Unreal is starting to get beat out on that front by other engines in the last few years. The new Tomb Raider, Metal Gear Solid, Doom, Dishonored, etc. all look just as good if not better than anything you could do in Unreal, and in large part because the engine developers are working directly in tandem with the game developers rather than doing everything &quot;off the shelf&quot;.</p>
<p>There's quite a few other good reasons Unreal has been feeling the squeeze in recent years, too.</p>
<p>For one, the third party publisher-developer behemoths like EA, Activision, Square Enix, etc., the ones who used to keep Unreal afloat, have started pouring massive resources (hundreds of millions of dollars of development) into their own engine tech. About 5-7 years ago they began to realize it was better to do their own tech and have consistent communications, development and engine support structure across all their games and studios, than to depend on a separate company who would <em>maybe</em> get something they really need in for the next release in 6 months. Unreal is great, but if the engine doesn't do what you need it to, or has a critical bug, it can often cause massive stalls and headaches in development.</p>
<p>Then, the competition available from other third parties has got way better too. Unity, especially, has become extremely popular in recent years. That is not a surprise. It might not have the sheer graphical grunt out of the box as other engines. However, it has a well-designed development environment, its generally rapid release rollout often means faster engine bug fixes, the asset store means you don't have to necessarily hire artists and programmers to make everything in your game (VFX is one place this is extremely useful), and of course, there is a massive developer community to turn to for support, and as it's being taught a lot in schools, there are <em>tons</em> of people familiar with Unity out there to help make your game.</p>
<p>What else explains Unreal's decline and Unity's rise? A big part of it is simply that it's cheap, which helps a <em>lot</em> more than most gamers realize, as often game development is, for most studios, more about budget (time/money) limitations than it is technological ones. Unreal also gained a lot of traction because it was one of the first big engines to make its dev tools available to modders - many got their starts doing maps for Unreal and Unreal Tournament, which informed the tastes and needs of an entire generation of game companies. But, that modding culture has since dried up (or at least moved on), so there's less familiarity with and desire to use Unreal among developers. Last, Unity is also very versatile - everything from first-person games, to simulators, to racing games, to RPGs can run on Unity. It doesn't really excel at one particular genre, which on paper sounds bad, but in actuality means a dev team can hop from game to game much more easily.</p>
<p>On the lower end, Game Maker is actually pretty capable, though I don't have a lot of experience with it. But, if you are an indie dev looking to make a 2D game, it's one of the more appealing options out there, and the games likewise will run on tons of target platforms with few if no modifications. There's just no reason for someone like this to even consider Unreal, yet games like Shovel Knight and Hyper Light Drifter have done <em>very</em> well lately. It turns out that 2D games are still awesome, and you don't need to have cutting-edge tech to be successful.</p>
<p>There's two final things I would keep in mind that inform all this:</p>
<p>1) The goal of most game developers is primarily and above all else <em>to ship a product</em>. Anything not in service of that is very liable to get their business killed. Relentless pursuit of tech that is not in service of that goal is wasted time and money. And...</p>
<p>2) Game development is extremely hard, and takes a long time. You are working for years on projects which you <em>hope</em> on paper are going to be good, yet for about 85% or more of a game's life, it's actually a smoldering wreck. There are a <em>million</em> more variables in creating a game - questions like &quot;does the build even start?&quot; or &quot;did the Perforce server go down for the third time this week?&quot; or &quot;shit, we failed cert because someone forgot to test what happens if we leave the Xbox running for 12 hours straight on the main menu, and we have 6 weeks until our ship date, and Microsoft has no remaining cert slots for the next 4 weeks, we're so fucked&quot;, are usually far more important concerns than &quot;does it do graphics good?&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost is a big issue. The engine is free to start using, but you have to pay royalties if you make over a certain amount of money. So for big companies that expect to sell a lot of copies, the price may not be worth it. Admittedly big companies might be able to get a better deal, but they might still find other options make more sense financially.</p>
<p>Being dependent on another company's technology also has some risks. What if Epic go out of business? Or they get bought out and stop selling their engine? Or they change the licensing deals? If those things happen you might find your company left without a tech base to make games with. So some companies prefer to invest in making their own engines so they don't have to worry about what might happen to that other company. Also that means their own staff have in depth knowledge of it instead of needing support from a different company. This also has the advantage that you can build the engine to your own specifications, you have complete freedom to optimise it for the games you want to make.</p>
<p>Unreal isn't perfect either. Its very good, but maybe its just not a good fit for what you want to do. Maybe its easier to make your game in Unity or some other engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to approach your question.</p>
<p>The pedantic answer is that engines can't really &quot;look realistic&quot;, since a game engine doesn't look like anything. They offer features and tools for artists and programmers to realize their vision, but they don't look like anything without the assets the artists create for the game. While games created with the same engine can share some similarities (due to built in assets and effects), most engines are flexible enough to support any kind of art style, realistic or non-realistic. For instance, Dota 2 and Titanfall 2 run on the same engine (Source Engine ^(though heavily modified in both cases)), as do Hearthstone and Cities: Skylines (Unity Engine).</p>
<p>While a good game engine helps with creating believable and realistic-looking environments, it's not the most important factor. The assets (models, textures, animations) are arguably far more important. Creating high quality assets is very time consuming and therefore very expensive. Even though a single developer or a very small team can create a game using Unreal Engine 4 or CryEngine, the game will not look nearly as good (meaning realistic in this context) as one created by an AAA-developer, since they lack the manpower required to create enough high quality assets. The game engine is not the bottleneck, the budget is.</p>
<p>As far as I know for big budget AAA-games Unreal Engine is <em>the</em> most used game engine of all time, and has been extremely popular for the past 15 years. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games" target="_blank">an incomplete list of games built with UE in Wikipedia</a>, and it's absolutely massive. However, the most popular version of the engine is the 3rd version, which is still used for some recently released and upcoming games. While the 3rd version was very advanced at the time, it's over a decade old at this point. The engine's 4th major version was released in 2014, offering a huge leap in graphical fidelity due to several new advanced features. Quite a lot of games have been released on it already, and more are coming in the near future. Games can take a lot of time to develop; a game started in 2014 might take 4 or 5 years to finish it.</p>
<p>Even though it's pretty popular, why isn't it even more popular? Many AAA publishers have their own internal game engines, which they use for multiple different franchises. For instance, EA uses DICE's Frostbite engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frostbite_games" target="_blank">for most of their high-profile titles</a>. Additionally, some games wouldn't necessarily work that well on UE4 in terms of technology and design, at least without changing their scope or making large modifications to the engine. </p>
<p>For indie developers, Unity has a larger market share. While UE4 has no upfront licensing costs at the moment, it used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars just a few years ago. Unity on the other hand has been available for free since 2009. It offers less control for developers compared to UE4, but it's arguably easier to use and has a larger community. Unity also has lower system requirements, which makes it a better platform for mobile games. It's arguably less powerful in terms of sheer performance and graphical features out of the box, but since indies lack the budget to create photorealistic assets anyway, it's not a huge issue. For indies, speed of development, the community and portability are far more important than the maximum attainable graphical quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For indie dev: Game development is really, really hard already. If you don't need hyperrealistic graphics, why bother spending the extra hundreds of hours making detailed models, rigging them, creating animations, fine-tuning light sources, adjusting shader settings...?</p>
<p>For established studios: Oftentimes, a studio will already have an engine they like to use, which they may have written themselves or bought from someplace else. Why bother learning a new engine and editor when you've already got experience with one that'll do the job fine?</p>
<p>In general: It doesn't really make sense to say that the Unreal Engine, or any particular engine, is &quot;one of the most realistic and better looking&quot;. That judgment is entirely subjective, not to mention massively in the developers' hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Noise-cancelling equipment is able to produce a sound that creates a 'peak' where the heard wave is a valley, and a 'valley' where the heard wave is a peak, as in this diagram (ignore titles) <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/f/ff/Destructive_interference_.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/f/ff/Destructive_interference_.png</a></p>
<p>This results in no sound being heard, because waves that are perfectly out of phase will cancel themselves.</p>
<p>Noise cancelling equipment eliminates droning white noise, not loud noise. The sound itself wouldn't damage your ears, and neither will the equipment that can cancel the sound. Only loud sounds can hurt your ears, so wear ear protection where there is loud white noise, not noise-cancelling equipment </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other responders explained the first part of your question better than I could, so I'll defer to them. I'd like to address the second half about whether or not adding more sounds and decibels can hurt your hearing.</p>
<p>While active noise canceling headphones add sound waves, they do not increase decibels to your ears. In fact, they decrease them. Think of sound waves like ripples in a pool or pond. The height of the waves (amplitude) is how loud the sound waves are. So if you have something at one end of the pool causing waves 10cm high that might represent a loud sound. </p>
<p>Now let's say you have another mechanism that creates waves, but times them in such a way that it adds a peak when the other wave is in a trough and adds a trough when the other wave is a peak. The peaks and troughs of both waves cancel each other out and you get waves with smaller amplitudes. You added waves, but decreased the height of the original wave through interference. This is how noise canceling technology works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound waves are sinusoidal.  Think of a [sine wave] (<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg/1024px-Simple_sine_wave.svg.png" target="_blank">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg/1024px-Simple_sine_wave.svg.png</a>), it varies between a peak and a valley.    </p>
<p>Noise cancelling produces a sound wave that is exactly the same, but 180 degrees out of phase... meaning at the same time that the original sound produces a peak, the noise cancelling system produces a valley and instead of a valley, it produces a peak.  When you combine the two waves that are 180 degrees out of phase, the amplitude cancels out to zero.    </p>
<p>It's the same as how adding +1 and -1 = 0.    </p>
<p>Does it hurt your ears?  No, because the level of the sound is actually reduced.  This isn't tricking you into thinking that it's reduced, it really is.  The amplitude of the noise reaching your ear drum is much lower, which is why you don't hear it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

On the other hand, doesn't it take fractions of a second for the incoming noise to be detected and for the noise-cancelling device to produce the corresponding inverse wave?</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if slight imperfections in detection and cancellation can create even bigger waves than the original (e.g. a high-frequency sine wave and negative sine wave sum to zero, but if displaced just by a <strong>tiny bit</strong>, they can sum to be twice the original).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers about how sound comes in waves and those waves can cancel, but to put it in more &quot;real&quot; terms those &quot;waves&quot; are actually pockets of air with either higher or lower pressure. So think of a guitar string, when you strum it it hits the air a pushes it closer to other air, creating a pocket of higher pressure. That pocket pushes into the air next to it, and then that pushes into the air next to it, etc., so the pocket travels. </p>
<p>When you cancel noise, you're eliminating those pockets of high and low pressure so at your ears the air is exactly how it is if they was no noise, and thus it doesn't hurt your ears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Actually, fresh out of the oven the &quot;air&quot; inside a hot cookie is possibly steam. When this hot pieces fall into a cold liquid (like milk) the hot air contracts (or the steam is quenched) and a large fraction of the void space is filled with milk.   The cookie sinks.</p>
<p>When the cookies are not longer hot out of the oven, all of those spaces are already filled with relatively cooler air, so there is a smaller fraction of void space to fill with milk.  The cookie floats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing about physics, but I have read a lot about baking. When coating a cake with a flavoured syrup that you want to sink into the crumb, I've read that it works best if the cake and syrup are different temperatures - either a still-hot cake with room-temperature syrup, or a cooled cake with heated syrup. I haven't been able to find any proof or spelled-out scientific explanation, but perhaps the hot cookies are drawing in the cold milk faster than the cooled cookies would? </p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how when you pour water on soil that is completely parched, a lot of it runs right out the bottom of the pot without seeming to wet the soil at all (I kill a lot of plants...)? But soil that's only a little dry will suck up water like a sponge. I don't know the reason for that either, but maybe it has something to do with things shrinking as they dry out so the openings water could seep into are narrower. Maybe also a similar effect? I would have thought pockets of steam within the crumb of the cookie would make it more buoyant, not less, but maybe the steam is also keeping those little pores open? Cold cookies are definitely more dense than ones fresh out of the oven (you can see them shrink as they cool), so better moisture-resistance is the only thing I can come up with that would explain the floating.</p>
<p>I'd be very interested to hear corrections from anyone with some real physics knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Hot cookies are still moist, while cold cookies are dry? A dry cookie has cavities containing air that are hard to reach by milk, and thus float. My guess is that if you cool down your cookies in a humid environment, they would not float. And be all mushy...</p>

<p>This is called a signature.  They can be as small as 4 pages, or much larger.  A book is typically made up of several signatures.</p>
<p>The result is, I can take two 4 page signatures and make an 8 page book, but I have no way to make a 9 page book.  If I add one page, I have no way to attach it.  You can imagine if I stick the page in and just glue the end, it will easily fall out.  I might be forced to make it fit in a 7 page book, or maybe print a 12 page book with some blank pages (some print methods can use 2 page signatures).</p>
<p>The short answer is that when making books its usually easiest to make them a certain way, and blank pages may be the result.  A children's book might be 30 pages, but the publisher finds that one 32 page signature is the cheapest method of production.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different reason depending upon if the book is machine or hand bound. I'll mention the handbound reason, which is the original reason for having these blank pages.
The opening blank pages are called fly leaves. The pages with writing/art is called the textblock. These pages, if loaded with art (illuminated) sometimes took days to create. The &quot;pages&quot; were vellum (calf skin) and as you can imagine were expensive to make. You want to protect this investment.
When books were bound in leather, the tanned leathers would leak and damage the textblock, so the fly leaves were to protect the writing/art from damage. You would use the minimum amount to protect the text block because vellum was expensive to produce. With the advent of fiber paper, you could increase the number of fly leaves. Depending upon on the binding technique used there would a different number of these fly papers.
Also, fly leaves are constructed to add structural strength to the book. A book opens and closes and making the hinge strong and durable are important, especially when you consider a town would save up just to buy one book. So there are numerous different construction methods in hand binding that is reflected on the type and number of fly leaves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
