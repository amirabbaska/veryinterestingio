		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's different ways that our brains control what we do, very roughly we could break them up as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instincts - stuff we're born knowing how to do</li>
<li>Learning - stuff we figure out through repeated exposure</li>
<li>Conscious control - we can choose to override some actions</li>
</ul>
<p>So for example pulling your hand back from a hot stove is instinct, walking is learned, and you can choose to walk backwards (which requires thinking about to happen).</p>
<p>Breathing is something that can and does fall in to any of the categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone's born knowing how to breath</li>
<li>If we practice breathing (say for swimming or yoga) we can learn to do it differently sometimes</li>
<li>We can choose to stop breathing, for example if we smell something bad</li>
</ul>
<p>In stressful situations, especially ones we haven't practiced alot, we're paying a lot of attention to everything we do and consciously trying to avoid doing anything incorrectly. We can go overboard trying to control everything and control our breathing by just holding it during tense moments. If it's a situation we've practiced then our breathing will probably be fine, and even if we hold our breath a long time our instincts will eventually kick in.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> our brains aren't a single unified system always working in a rational way, a lot of behavior is a bunch of <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2016/11/learning-and-intelligence-typical.html" target="_blank">different systems trying to figure out what's best.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This intrigues me. I've been married for 18 years. My husband has a CPAP (EDIT: a C-flex CPAP) machine to sleep, and has had one for about 17 of those years. He's done sleep studies and been to doctors, and apparently it's his brain. When he sleeps, it just forgets to breathe. As a result, he would stop breathing for up to a minute at night and semi-wake up (not fully, as he wasn't aware he was doing it) with a gasp, breathe a few times, rinse and repeat. When he got his CPAP, he woke the next morning absolutely amazed, as he had no idea how badly he'd been sleeping. </p>
<p>Recently, I noticed he does this during the day too. It's always been there, but I'd become so used to it, I stopped noticing. When he's semi or fully reclined AND distracted (playing on the computer, reading, watching tv) his breathing gets really weird, just like before he had his machine. He'll stop breathing a few seconds; inhale....hold breath.... exhale long. It's almost maddening when I start noticing it. I asked him why that happens and he said, &quot;I don't know. It's just hard to breath in that position.&quot;  </p>
<p>I only just now realized, writing this, that it's the distraction in common. If he's laying in bed and we're talking, I don't seem to notice the weird breathing. HOWEVER, at the same time, I don't seem to recall the weird breathing when he's sitting upright at the table and reading either. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how this helps OP, but it does seem to go along with the idea that when distracted (or asleep), it's possible the brain just forgets in some people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do this. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_sleep_apnea" target="_blank">central apnea</a>.</p>
<p>I've ADD and growing up in the 80s, there was a lot of concern among parents at the time about the drugs used to treat ADD. My parents refused to treat me and I was a very early adopter of computers (I got my first at the age of 5) and we lived in the country away from anyone to play with. So I was likely one of the pioneers when it comes to reinforcing my ADD with technology. </p>
<p>According to my shrink it's common to learn coping mechanisms for ADD that are a bit counter intuitive. Because I have trouble focusing and I'm easily distracted, I learned to be able to &quot;hyper focus&quot; on tasks. Meaning, I kind of go into a zen-like state where I literally ignore all outside stimuli. This results in situations where I'll be doing something (like typing this message) and if my wife is asking me what I want for dinner I'll not hear her. She'll eventually come up to me, tap me on the shoulder and the shock of getting yanked back to reality is so jarring I'll jump &quot;WHAT?!?!&quot; etc... Now that I'm older I can decide to take my own medication, learn to deal with my focus issues but 40 years of coping mechanisms are hard to unlearn.</p>
<p>But, getting back to your question, this focus issue includes breathing. When I hyper focus like this, I often start breathing <em>very</em> shallowly, sometimes stopping all together. I'm doing it somewhat unconsciously. For example, while I'm typing this I have to remember to breath when I get to a period. (breath) I recently had some fairly major surgery and they had me hooked up to all the monitoring equipment... every time they brought in some paperwork for me to sign, while reading it I'd set off all their alarms because it wouldn't register me breathing anymore. If I did not slow down like that, I would have had trouble reading the document. The ADD just wont let me concentrate that long on something. </p>
<p>TL;DR: It's like a meditation I do when concentrating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In military Chem warfare training you're taught that when you hear &quot;gas gas gas&quot; you stop breathing (not hold your breath because people tend to take a deep inhale before holding, and if there's gas around, that's bad) and get your mask out. Except I was getting my mask out for a yearly fit check. For no reason I stopped breathing as I pulled it from the carrier and fumbled with the straps (it is stowed different for long term storage vs. an imminent chemical death situation) and by the time I got it on I was lightheaded and couldn't catch my breath through the restriction of the filter. I almost fell over. Very embarrassing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure they know precisely why. I have catathrenia, which is a form of sleep apnea where I hold my breath for long durations during sleep and then when I can't any more I let it out in a slow groan. As it gets further on in my life I find this reaching into my waking hours. When working out, staring into space, or concentrating on something, I sometimes realize i've been holding my breath for a minute or more. If I try, however, I can never hold my breath for as long as I do when catathrenia kicks in. Outside a CPAP machine that basically breathes for you, they have no cure for these sorts of apneas. Marijuana has been shown to relax the body and lessen the frequency and severity of apneas, but otherwise they just can't figure it out as far as I know.</p>
<p>But if somebody does know, I'll be trolling this thread hoping for more info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Degeneracy pressure is supposedly a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle: if you try to push two electrons into the same state, degeneracy pressure pushes back. It's relevant in for example the r^12 term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential#Explanation" target="_blank">Lennard Jones potential</a> and it supposedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle#Stability_of_matter" target="_blank">explains</a> why solid objects &quot;contact&quot; eachother in every day life. Pauli also explains <a href="https://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/where-does-magnetism-come-from/" target="_blank">fucking magnets and how do they work</a>, but I still have no idea what &quot;force&quot; is there to prevent electrons occupying the same state.</p>
<p>So what on earth is going on??</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks everyone for some brilliant responses. It seems to me there are really two parts of this answer:</p>
<p>1) The higher energy states for the particle are simply the only ones &quot;left over&quot; in that same position of two electrons tried to occupy the same space. It's a statistical thing, not an actual force. Comments to this effect have helped me &quot;grok&quot; this at last.</p>
<p>By the way this one gives me new appreciation for why for example matter starts heating up once gravity has brought it closer together in planet formation / stars / etc. Which is quit interesting.</p>
<p>2) The spin-statistics theorem is the more fundamental &quot;reason&quot; the pauli exclusion principle gets observed. So I guess thats my next thing to read up on and try to understand.</p>
<p>context: never studied physics explicitly as a subject, but studied chemistry to a reasonably high level. I like searching for deeper reasons behind why things happen in my subject, and of course it's all down to physics. Like this, it usually turns out to be really interesing.</p>
<p>Thanks all!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not due to <em>any</em> of them. Like you said, it's just the Pauli exclusion principle, which has nothing to do with any of the four fundamental interactions.</p>
<p>You just can't put two identical fermions into the same quantum state, that is not a possibility. And when you have a thermodynamic system of identical fermions, that inability, or <em>lack</em> of available states manifests as a macroscopic pressure.</p>
<p>You mentioned the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, and there's also <a href="http://cdn.iopscience.com/images/1749-4699/1/1/015009/Full/csd280936fig1.jpg" target="_blank">effective nucleon-nucleon potentials</a> which have very hard &quot;cores&quot; attributed to Pauli exclusion of the underlying constituent particles. But that doesn't indicate that the Pauli repulsion is due to these forces, that would be thinking about it in the wrong order. In reality Pauli exclusion is what forces the particles not to come too close to each other, and the way we model that in our effective interaction potentials is to put a hard core into it. The L-J potential and the NN potentials I showed are not fundamental interactions, they're effective descriptions of interactions between many-body systems which are too hard to model from first principles. In very simplified terms, these potentials are &quot;made up&quot; by us to describe what we observe (and fit to data or something so they actually work). And what we physically observe is strongly repulsive behavior at small relative coordinates because of Pauli exclusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Mediated by a gauge boson&quot; </p>
<p>However in my opinion this is too restrictive. One could argue we already know of a fifth fundamental force which is the result of Higgs exchange. It just happens to be very short-range and mediated by a spin-zero boson. </p>
<p>Similarly I think you can talk about the PEP as a force, it just happens to be a force with really weird properties. It also doesn't have an obvious classical analogue, but in my opinion that is just fine. Nothing wrong with calling it a force. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, others have mentioned that none of the &quot;four fundamental forces&quot; are responsible for the repulsive effect of the Pauli exclusion principle (in fermions).</p>
<p>But I haven't yet seen anyone at least link to the very relevant Wikipedia article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_interaction" target="_blank">exchange interaction</a>, which is essentially a more canonical name for the &quot;force&quot; caused by Pauli exclusion.</p>
<p>Note that the exchange interaction is not a &quot;force&quot; in the way the other fundamental interactions are forces ... but it is definitely still a sort of &quot;fundamental interaction.&quot;  So you might say that there are five fundamental interactions: four of them can be described as forces in the classical limit while one of them is a purely quantum effect and has no classical analogue (though in certain cases the net effect can resemble a classical force, such as the neutron degeneracy pressure in neutron stars).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To bring two electrons together, you need energy. At a certain separation, the wavefunctions of the electrons start to significantly overlap. For the electrons to get closer, they'd need to be in different states. Until you push harder (supply more energy), the electrons are at their maximum spatial density. If you do push harder, you will supply enough energy to push one of the electrons to a higher energy state, which will allow the electrons to get closer together. </p>
<p>Think of a carbon atom. It has six electrons. Why aren't they all 1s electrons? Electromagnetism creates the bound states and pulls all the electrons towards the nucleus, but some electrons hang out farther away from the nucleus in 2s and 2p orbitals. The fact that these higher orbitals are occupied in the ground state of the atom is, in effect, degeneracy pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you try to put a bunch of fermions in some sort of potential well, they cannot all go in the ground state, every new fermion will need to go in some excited state, with corresponding higher energies and momentums. You can see this as more of a statistical phenomenon, arising from the confining force. In the case of the &quot;repulsion&quot; between electrons keeping matter stable, that's the electromagnetic force. In case of neutrons in a neutron star, it's gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They do this by uniform number (one reason they exist).</p>
<p>Of course, it gets relayed to the PA announcer in the stadium and the play-by-play guys so they can talk stats (&quot;Jones has 12 points so far&quot;).  Now, the PA/play-by-play can see enough to relay whose taking shots and the like, but anything else gets fed to them by people who do nothing but count that stuff or research records/history of players (last time Jones played against Michigan he had 23 points), and the like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. This is a crystallization from a supersaturated solution. </p>
<p>How this works... a liquid can dissolve different amounts of material depending on the temperature. By boiling the water, you are able to increase the water's ability to dissolve material. What is happening in the gif is the water is brought to a boil and the maximum amount of material (in this case sodium acetate) is dissolved. This hot solution of water and sodium acetate is transferred to the glass container to cool down. Once the solution has cooled down it contains more sodium acetate than it normally would be able to dissolve while at room temperature. This is called &quot;supersaturated.&quot; Supersaturated solutions are really good at growing crystals. Once a small amount of sodium acetate left over from the bottom of the pan is placed in the supersaturated solution (in the gif this is a small crystal on the end of the wooden dowel) the sodium acetate in solution begins to crystalize. </p>
<p>TLDR: Boiling water can dissolve more material than cold water. Boil water, add max amount of material. Cool water down and there is &quot;too much&quot; material in the water. This &quot;too much&quot; material will form crystals in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The clear liquid is known as a supersaturated solution. In this case, of sodium acetate. By using only a little water, the maximum amount of solid is dissolved when it's hot.  When it cools down, it ought to crystalize out but it can't because there's nothing to start the them off.  When some crystals are added they act as centres for more molecules to form round.</p>
<p>But there's something else too.  Sodium acetate, like many substances, incorporates molecules of water in its crystals - in this case three per molecule, a trihydrate. So when it crystalizes it uses up all the water in the mix so the whole thing goes solid instead of forming a slush.  That's why the second demo forms a solid pillar as you pour the solution onto the stuff that's crystalized already.</p>
<p>ETA
If you try it yourself make sure that the equipment is clean, particularly the jar you pour the hot solution into to cool.  Dust, or even scratches on the glass, can be places where crystalization can start before you're ready to put the &quot;seed&quot; in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a big fan of pro-wrestling. It's easier to understand if you think of it as real-life super heroes. Pretty much everyone who is a fan knows it's scripted (trust me, we condescendingly hear it every time we mention it's an interest). </p>
<p>The appeal of wrestling vs. 'real' fighting (MMA, UFC, Boxing, etc.,) is that it's a year-long affair. For instance, WWE has two televised weekly events and 1 monthly pay per view. This allows for long-term character developments and for there to be a battle of good vs. evil. Good vs. evil is huge in wrestling - WWE usually pits the boss against the small guy who has to 'overcome' the evil bosses continued harassment - like handicap matches, backstage attacks, new powerful signees etc., </p>
<p>Of course, the 'promos'/interviews are all scripted. And, you have a variety of styles. Some will take on the role of a super athlete, some will be a comedy routine, some will mimic B-Roll horror movies, some act like royalty/celebrities, etc., All of that leads to Saturday Night Live-esque skits (some jokes, some serious) that fans like myself find quite entertaining. </p>
<p>If you doubt the acting talent, just remember that The Rock started his career in wrestling and is now Hollywoods top paid actor. I'm not saying that everyone will love the Rock, but that seems to suggest that the WWE has an emphasis on getting genuinely interesting people on the microphone. </p>
<p>Lastly, you have the wrestling itself. I like to think of it like a mix between amatuer wrestling, UFC, and gymnastics. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh22y0T-2O0" target="_blank">Here's my best attempt to convince you</a> that wrestling has some pretty cool stunts. In wrestling terminology, this is what's called a &quot;spot.&quot; It's one of the 'big sequences' of moves in a match. Most of the match is normally ad-libbed - but some sequences are planned out before hand, usually the riskier/more dangerous shit. If you watch wrestling 'critically', you can quite easily see/hear moves being called out between the guys in the match. Great wrestlers can make the ad-libbed part move smoothly. Bad/inexperienced ones botch it. A fan appreciates both the good and the bad and aren't exactly looking for every match to be a 5* match. It's like watching something like American Idol and expecting everyone to not suck. So watching the poorly done matches can be just as interesting as a great one. </p>
<p>Also: plenty of these guys have martial arts/amateur wrestling experience. So while they're not actually making the holds be damaging, they're doing semi-real moves that if they put a little more pressure on <em>could break someones arm.</em> A good pro-wrestler can make it look a lot like an actual hold - it's the bad ones that you usually see in &quot;LOL WRESTLING!!!&quot; videos on youtube. </p>
<p>EDIT: Saw a few recommendations from fellow fans that I thought that I'd add to the comment</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYvMOf3hsGA" target="_blank">Wrestling isn't Wrestling</a> a well-done/humourous explanation of the development of a wrestling character. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmMRBnU-Vac&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m49s" target="_blank">Awesome sequence by Sami Zayn &amp; Cesaro</a>. </p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgSzYxmQDqA" target="_blank">A quality full-length match between two of the best in the business, Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Sami Zayn</a>. It's a more 'technical match' with nods to fighting sports. I'd argue it's more of a pro-wrestling fans wet dream than a casual fans, but since it's what a pro-wrestling fan sees as a quality match it's worth posting. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100 or so years ago, pro wrestling was real sport, but beginning to become fixed. Now originally, that just meant more and more fixed fights, to avoid boring lengthy draws that were all too common and which the crowd didn't like (to explain: at that point pro wrestling, at least in the USA, had close ties to carnival wrestling and the associated chicanery). </p>
<p>Once it became sufficiently fixed, however, since the wrestlers were often &quot;in the know&quot;, outlandish things could be introduced to further titillate the crowd, for example, a wrestler who would jump off the ropes and land on his opponent. No one would have seen it done before, because it wouldn't have worked in a real match. So how would the crowd know it wouldn't work &quot;for real&quot; if they'd never seen it tried? They wouldn't, and were thus amazed at the display of athleticism and gymnastics and how it devastated the opponent. The people in charge of the show didn't care about authenticity, they wanted to sell tickets!</p>
<p>The pro wrestling you see today in the WWE is the culmination of 100-odd years of steadily less and less realistic wrestling (with the purpose of selling tickets), which has got to the point that it makes no claim whatsoever to be, or attempt to resemble, legitimate competition, and nor does its viewer base desire it to. Since it was so gradual, instead of a mass exodus in disgust, the wrestling savvy fans who wanted to see something real, or at least resembling real sport, were by degrees slowly replaced by people who cared less and less about sporting competition or the art of wrestling, and more and more about excitement and drama. It's now got its own enclave, its own place in our culture, somewhere between sport and theatre, but is still constantly evolving, so who knows what it might look like in another century!</p>
<p>I hope that helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Professional wrestling. The question you have to ask yourself about professional wrestling is a simple one. If professional wrestling did not exist, could you come up with this idea? Could you envision the popularity of huge men in tiny bathing suits pretending to fight? Could you sell this to a promoter? &quot;I'm telling you, Sid, millions of people will enjoy watching this. The guys'll be huge, we'll put them in little suits, and they won't really fight.&quot; </p>
<p>Professional wrestling is the only sport where participants are just thrown right out into the audience, and no one in the crowd thinks anything unusual is happening. If you're watching a golf tournament and Jack Nicklaus goes flying over your head - first of all, I would say you're watching a very competitive tournament.</p>
<p>And how about the professional wrestling referee? There's a great job. You're a referee in a sport with no rules of any kind. How do you screw that up? The referee is kinda like Larry of the Three Stooges. You don't really need him, but it just wouldn't be the same without him. They must get these guys from the same place the Harlem Globetrotters get their refs. There must be this whole school where they teach you to just kind of run around and not notice anything. They sit you down, show you a film of the rub-out scene from St. Valentine's Day Massacre, and if you don't see anything illegal going on, you're hired.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to everything you listed, but shaking your leg is a matter of tricking your body into thinking things are moving along.</p>
<p>Your body often takes simple input signals to mean specific things, even if they seem useless or irrelevant. E.g. if you have a stomach ache, putting your hand on your stomach seems to help with the discomfort even if it doesn't actually do anything to help with the ache. This is because it <em>does</em> help when you're covering an open wound on your skin; and your body isn't smart enough to figure out which aches can be helped by putting your hand on them and which cannot. It only knows that &quot;covering a painful area&quot; is a good thing to do.<br />
Result: giving physical attention to a part of your body that aches will generally cause your brain to register less pain.</p>
<p>Shaking your leg (or alternating both legs, which I tend to do more), pacing in a circle, ... all give your brain the signal that we are running or walking.<br />
A classic example is people tapping their feet when they are queueing somewhere. They want to move along, so their mind is urging their body to start walking and making progress.  (Similar to how your instincts can override your conscious mind when starving and near food; your body can urge you to do something that addresses a current issue. Hunger, thirst, violent outbursts when threatened, the urge to walk, ...)<br />
Instead of ignoring that impulse; your body diverts it into &quot;fake walking&quot; instead. You move your leg like your brain tells you to, but you do it in a way that you don't physically move forward.<br />
Regardless, because your body feels your leg being used, the urge to move along is lessened because your brain thinks you're already handling the issue. </p>
<p>It's a way of lying to yourself. The reasons to not move (e.g. you'll be in trouble if you try to walk through a TSA checkpoint instead of queueing in line) can outweigh the benefits of moving (making progress), but your instincts aren't smart enough to comprehend the complexities of all of these consequences.<br />
So to prevent your mind from wrongly urging your body to walk; we instead choose to trick our mind into thinking we're doing what it wants us to do; without actually doing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many studies on fidgeting and mindfulness. </p>
<p>One theory suggests that fidgeting is a coping strategy for stress and that it's a sign that one is attempting to reduce stress in order to maintain attention.</p>
<p>Other studies propose that mind wandering is either a default state of mind where fidgeting will occur naturally as your mind wanders and attention diminishes or that mind wandering utilizes executive resources which will diminish those available for the primary objective. Fidgeting may occupy the floating attention, the part of your brain that gets bored and help you focus.</p>
<p>There is research that shows fidgeting increasing as a function of time throughout a lecture which indicates that fidgeting is either an indication of boredom or an attempt to maintain attention by stimulating the brain with sensory information. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any specific studies or articles to back this up, but I think the general idea is that pretty much all animals, including humans, all naturally move around quite a lot in the wild.  Before civilizations, humans were hunter gatherers for 10s (100s?) of thousands of years.  You were pretty much a child, so naturally moving around a lot, raising a child, foraging, or tracking/hunting animals.  Everyone was doing their part for the group.  All the time.  Once all of your needs were taken care of, you probably just dicked around for the rest of the time.  But, you didn't have any modern things.  Basic tools.  That's it.  So that dicking around would have all been physical activity.  Wrestling.  Just running around.  Training for hunting or foraging.</p>
<p>The only time you would be still would be to deliberately rest or to sleep.</p>
<p>Even with the advent of society, most people would have been workers or artisans and farming or making things all day.  Still pretty much active at all times, and still doing very active leisure activities.</p>
<p>Now, since the inudstrial revolution, and more specifically, with the advent of electronics, society has pretty much told you to stop, sit down, and don't move.  For the majority of your day.  This is going against millions of years of biological programming that has made it beneficial for you to always be moving.</p>
<p>You shouldn't find it very surprising that a lot of people get very uncomfortable when they sit still for long periods of time.  They have millions of years of programming telling them not to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For one the address space is bigger, so you aren't limited to using only 4 gigs (in practice closer to 2 gigs) of ram and can use up to terabytes of ram for a single process if you want. For another the 64 bit instruction set is a bit better and more &quot;powerful&quot; in general. There are more registers, for example, and this enables 64-bit programs to achieve higher performance on the same cpu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Today some CPU architectures offer backwards compatibility with 32-bit instruction sets. amd64 is binary-compatible with x86, AARCH64 (ARMv8-A) offers AARCH32 compatibility via exception level switching, MIPS64 also offers a compatibility mode with MIPS32, etc.</p>
<p>An application developer has the choice of supporting only 64-bit or 32-bit environments. Doing so loses a market chunk, because people still own 32-bit computers, and can't (or won't) transition overnight. Therefore it's not a decision that makes market sense, but could be motivated by other reasons.</p>
<p>A library developer has the choice of supporting only 64-bit or 32-bit applications. Doing so might prevent applications from using it, but this is somewhat contrary to what we develop libraries for: providing useful abstractions to application developers. What's more, if a library developer suddenly decides to discontinue their 32-bit library version, they create maintenance problems for applications which can't move to 64-bit environments, because they have 32-bit users they want to support.</p>
<p>So, since we have CPUs which can execute 32-bit and 64-bit code, why do we distinguish between binary &quot;versions&quot;?</p>
<p>The answer is the application binary interface (ABI). The ABI specifies how applications handle their low-level interaction, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>how are values encoded,</li>
<li>what types are natively supported, what are their formats and the sizes of values of each type</li>
<li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions" target="_blank">calling conventions</a> - how are functions called, who saves state where, who cleans up after whom...</li>
<li>in what way the programs need to be set up in memory to be executed</li>
<li>how loaders resolve symbols (and by extension, how compilers generate symbol references), which in turn defines how libraries work</li>
<li>and many more</li>
</ul>
<p>So is there a reason ABIs for 32-bit and 64-bit applications differ so much as to be different? I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>One reason we want(ed) to leverage 64-bit architectures is to increase word sizes. Generally, that helps us process more data per unit of time, and thus increasing throughput for CPU intensive operations. To take advantage of this usefulness in user programs, we have to specify this change in type's width in the ABI, thus changing it.</p>
<p>Another reason is to leverage a greater amount of addressable memory. As the range of possible memory values increases, our programs' symbol references have to be adjusted from a maximum of 32-bit width. Thus, the format of symbol references in binaries change drastically, and so must the ABI.</p>
<p>There many more reasons which also reflect changes in the various ABIs, but I fear we may be getting too technical. I could go into depth for those interested, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically with x86-64?</p>
<p>x86-64 still implements the full 32 bit and 16 bit instruction set, so the CPU can run 32 bit code natively.</p>
<p>The reason to recompile for x86-64 is to take advantage of the new 64 bit functions, bigger general purpose registers (64 bit), increased number of registers, larger address space, enhanced SSE instructions and NX bit.</p>
<p>Not all of those features are strictly 64 bit, but were introduced at the same time. In a similar way to the SIMD enhancements have been introduced over time.</p>
<p>What this means is that code can be optimised to run faster on x64, and programs can (more easily) address memory larger than 4GiB. For software that deals with large datasets (eg video, images, database), the increased virtual address space is very useful.</p>
<p>The end result is, like code that has been optimised for SIMD, it runs faster if compiled for x86-64, and potentially makes some operations with large data feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens to be exactly what I'm currently up to, converting a <em>horrifyingly</em> convoluted and poorly-written 32-bit code base to 64-bit.</p>
<p>The main issue is greatly-improved performance. Modern CPUs have optimized 64-bit instructions and registers that can run much faster than their older 32-bit counterparts.</p>
<p>And then there's the memory issue. In 32-bit programs, the size of a pointer is 32 bits, so the largest amount of memory that can be addressed is 4 GB (from 0 to 2^32 - 1). In the Windows world, each process gets its own <em>virtual</em> 4 GB address space, but only a little under 2 GB of that is available for the program writer to use, the rest is reserved for the OS.</p>
<p>In 64-bit, pointers can theoretically address a whopping 16 EXAbytes. However, current versions of Windows restrict that to a 32 TB virtual memory space per process, with 16 TB available for the user.</p>
<p>Right now, our code base is bashing right up against that 32-bit 2 GB memory barrier, and there's nothing that can be done to fix that, aside from using external storage as memory, which is many orders of magnitude slower than RAM. So, we're converting to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Microsoft is said to be currently working on 128-bit Windows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you compile a program, a LARGE bunch of stuff gets hard coded inside your resulting binary. Most of it takes form of relative addresses. For example, when you call function <code>foo</code>, the compiler knows that function <code>foo</code> is at that specific location inside your binary so execution flow can proceed correctly. This would be a problem if your binary gets very large. A 64 bits compiler would handle things smoothly, but how would it work when you &quot;downgrade&quot; to 32 bits?
Then there is the problem of managing memory within the application. What if your program allocates huge chunks of memory, larger than 4GB? A 64 bits compiler would ok this operation, but once you execute that in a 32 bits environment, it will fail.</p>
<p>Another problem is that the 64 bits architecture also creates new CPU instructions, because manipulating 64 bits at a time is now possible. </p>
<p>This leads us to the problem of linking with 64 bits libraries. What if the 64 bits libraries need those operations? How can you tell from your program how an external library will use its memory and its instruction set?</p>
<p>Long story short, 64 bits programs can do a lot more than 32 bits programs. Sure, it would probably be possible to add at least one layer of emulation to check / redirect those operations everywhere at run time, but it is rather complex, error prone and slow. Another solution would be to tell the compiler to avoid those situations, but it would result in creating a 32 bits program with a 64 bits compiler. Making those checks at compile time is much much easier and creates hard guarantees about your program behavior. This is why running 16 bits programs in a 32 bits environment is possible and likewise, running 32 bits programs in a 64 bits environment is also possible, but downgrading the architecture is not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tax lawyer here. I do pro bono work for poverty-level tax payers before the IRS. One of the programs available if you owe a shit ton of money to the IRS and you're hella broke is something called an Offer in Compromise (&quot;OIC&quot;).</p>
<p>An OIC is where you owe a bunch of money to the IRS and you don't have either the income or the assets to pay it so the IRS is like, &quot;ok, we'll settle it with you. How much can you afford to pay?&quot; A settlement amount is determined based on your financial situation, and you pay what you can afford to settle the whole tax debt.</p>
<p>I haven't seen what these companies can do, but I can only imagine that this is what they're doing. They must be filing OIC's on behalf of tax payers. There isn't any other option offered by the IRS to settle high tax debt.</p>
<p>My guess is that these companies charge people a percentage of the amount of debt that is being relieved in this process. So if you owed $20,000 in tax debt and your financials say you can only pay $5,000 (there's a standard formula that everyone under OIC consideration must follow), then you &quot;save&quot; $15,000. If the company files the paperwork on your behalf, then they appear to be the ones who magically saved you $15,000. So they probably have some sort of deal where, &quot;you pay us up front 20% of the amount we can save you ($3,000 in this case. 20% of $15,000 = $3,000), and then we'll make the rest go away.&quot; Then the clients are thrilled because they only pay $8,000 ($5,000 tax settlement amount + $3,000 company fee) to settle a $20,000 debt. &quot;What a savings!&quot;</p>
<p>But what people don't know is that they can file an OIC by themselves. It isn't anything particularly special. If you qualify, you qualify. If you don't, you don't. There isn't some insider secret. So these places are likely a scam.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
