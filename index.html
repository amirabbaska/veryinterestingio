		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radio frequency spectrum is a finite resource. If we &quot;run out of space&quot;, we're out of luck. But certain <em>portions</em> of the spectrum, allocated by agreement to specific purposes can and do &quot;fill up&quot;.  In that case, new national and possibly international regulations have to be written to reallocate portions of the spectrum involved.</p>
<p>Each portion of the [Radio Frequency Spectrum] (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum</a>) from 3 Hz. to 3000 GHz. (3 THz.) is allocated for use (or non-use) international agreement under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union.</p>
<p>Each parts of the radio spectrum is apportioned by the ITU for different radio technologies and applications; some 40 radiocommunication services are defined in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_Radio_Regulations" target="_blank">ITU's Radio Regulations</a>.</p>
<p>The drafting, revision and adoption of the Radio Regulations is the responsibility of the World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) of the ITU, meetings of which are typically held every three or four years, most recently in Geneva in 2012.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We would suffer congestion, that's all.  If it got  bad enough, we'd adjust something, as usual.  </p>
<p>Spectrum is sort of finite, but not all communications have to be wireless.  And because of propagation, a lot of spectrum can be geographically repeated....  we did this (and still do) with the AM radio and FM radio bands.  We did it with cellular radio in the AMPS mobile phone strategy.  </p>
<p>A lot of data is low bandwidth.  A lot of data is carried on wires or can be shifted to wires and have only short distances covered by wireless.    There's directional methods, too, where antenna polarization is used to send separate signals on the same carrier frequency, as was done (and still is) on satellites.  </p>
<p>The  spectrum keeps getting bigger, and more efficient, too.   Digital signal processing (DSP) lets us put thousands of digital carriers on a single signal, and signals can co-exist on the same frequency using spread spectrum techniques.  </p>
<p>A lot depends on a lot, so to get better responses, maybe expand your question a little?  What's your concern?  Did you read somewhere that we're running out of spectrum?   Or is this just a general question?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We won't ever run out of space on the radio frequency spectrum, per se.  Instead, the radio frequency spectrum, or parts of it, will become over-saturated with signals.  Over-saturation causes the fidelity of the signals to decrease - i.e. what is received matches what was sent less and less.</p>
<p>There is a band of frequencies where this has sort of happened and there are a TON of things that are done to work around it.  That band of frequencies is around 2.4 GHZ which can be used without a license.  Here's just a few of the things in that band: </p>
<ul>
<li>Microwave ovens</li>
<li>Wireless Home Phones</li>
<li>Wifi</li>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we can't see radio signals, the best way to visualize everything is to think of light.  A basic radio signal is like an incandescent light bulb - casting light in all directions a short distance.  Saturation would be like having too many light bulbs on in one place.</p>
<p>One method of dealing with saturation is shielding.  Microwave ovens so that it can cook your food better.  In our light analogy, this would be like putting the light bulb in a room so that we can see the light when in the room but not outside the room.</p>
<p>Another method is limiting power to what is needed.  Your wireless home phone only needs to work within the confines of your home.  Your bluetooth devices only needs to work within the confines of your person.  For both devices, the power is set to work well in the expected range and that's it.  In the light analogy, this would be like having a dimmer switch so that you can adjust the amount of light to what you need and no more.</p>
<p>Modulation of frequency, amplitude, and/or phase.  Wifi makes use of all these type of modulation.  When the signal is good (little/no interference), it can combine these to deliver information faster.  When the signal is not a good (minor/major interference), it can use these to deliver information with more fidelity.  The reason these method can work better with interference is because the signal is encoded in the modulation rather than the radio wave itself.  In our light analogy, this would be like everyone having white flashlights and using colored flashlights for communication.</p>
<p>Directional transmission is another way of handling saturation.  Cell phone towers typically have 3 directional antennas that each cover 120 degrees.  The main reason to do this was to handle 3 times the signal with each tower.  The other reason was that directional antennas can transmit further because they are more focused.  In our light analogy, this would be like using flashlights instead of incandescent bulbs or lasers instead of flashlights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question, because in the U.S. we are about to have a major restructuring of the band of frequencies between 600 and 698 MHz, mandated by Congress. This affects primarily television broadcasters and wireless microphone users. What is most likely to happen is that more efficient digital technologies will be developed &amp; used for each type of service, meaning each type of service used (individual tv channels, microphones, etc) will require a significantly smaller slice of spectrum than prior technologies. For instance, wireless mic manufacturer Shure has developed a technology that will allow you to run 47 (wow!) digital wireless microphones in just 6 MHz of radio spectrum. That's an impossible number-vs-spectrum with traditional analog wireless microphones. The trade-off is distance: it's short-range, i.e. ~30 meters, IIRC. But that's plenty for most applications. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What doping does in those systems is create conditions under which a junction between two semiconductors can be made to conduct electricity. In other words, it can be switched between a zero state, or a one state. But without the doping, the materials used, like silicon, are semiconductors on their own. Being a semiconductor means simply that the electrons living inside those materials can never have certain values of their energy. Imagine they can have any value between 0 and 1 (in some unit of energy), or any value between 2 and 3, but they can't have values between 1 and 2. That part of the energy spectrum is known as the energy gap. Basically, if you put electrons in all states from 0 to 1, you cannot put another one in a state of energy 1.0001, for example. The next available energy for that extra electron is 2, so you have to provide one entire unit of energy to bring that electron into your material.</p>
<p>That's precisely what happens when you transport electricity: you connect metallic cables to your sample, and you apply a voltage to bring electrons from your battery, through one cable, into the sample, then out through the other cable and back to the battery. But if you need to provide 1 unit of energy, and your battery can only provide, say, half a unit, then you cannot bring electrons into the sample (there are no states for those energies!), and current can't pass through it. That's what being a semiconductor is all about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't necessarily have to be doped. Doping allows the creation of diodes, certain types of transistors and devices. A semiconductor is defined by having a specific bandgap. Insulators are materials that have a large separation between the valence and conduction band so it would be difficult for electrons to get excited and move into the conduction band. Conductors usually have lots of electrons in the conduction band and the valence band can overlap the conduction band meaning it'll easily be conductive. For semiconductor it's somewhere in between and a few electrons can reach the conduction band.
The most basic is semiconductor is silicon based and you can manipulate its behavior by adding dopants such as in the diode or silicon mosfet.
One example is a transistor that doesn't have to use doped material is a Gallium Nitride High electron mobility transistor (HEMT). Essentially you have a small layer of AlGaN on top of GaN and due to the lattice mismatch it causes a stress on the interface which causes a piezoelectric polarization thereby creating a 2 dimensional electron gas channel like with regular silicon mosfets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semiconductors are simply materials which <em>can</em> be doped to make Electronic Devices based off of those materials. Usually doping(in Silicon based devices) involves using Silicon which has been laced with impurities to produce the pn junctions you speak of. Silicon by itself is an intrinsic semiconductor and it's not capable of being used as is in devices. </p>
<p>Nowadays, for MOSFETs(Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), we use Compound Semiconductors which are made out of different materials altogether. For example Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is used because it can give us better conduction characteristics and produce faster devices. Another one, as has been pointed out below is AlGaN(Aluminum Gallium Nitride) which is used in cases where we need extremely high mobility (speed of movement) of electrons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that MOSFETs form the basis of Very Large Scale Integrated circuits which are the basis of chip fabrication technology today.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be an intrinsic semiconductor?</p>
<p>You can take a pure silicon wafer and it's still considered a semiconductor. Mostly this regular silicon can't be used as it is because we need a charge imbalance to induce current flow. This is done by doping two pieces of silicon and joining them to form the pn junction you talked about. I hope the internal process of doping is something you've understood well already.</p>
<p>A device with only 1 pn junction is a diode. We can alter the doping concentrations of the p and n type substrates (surfaces) to produce different devices. For example Zener diodes use imbalances in doping concentrations to produce the reverse breakdown characteristics they use to control voltage.</p>
<p>We can keep adding these junctions and tweaking their doping to form more intricate and useful devices. A common purpose device with 2 pn junctions is a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). An SCR(silicon controlled rectifier) is a device which has 3 pn junctions. These are old devices compared to the technology we have today. I'm currently doing my undergrad in Ee so these are the devices I'm mostly familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can short-pay a company.  I worked for a firm that installed, tested and serviced security systems, fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, etc.  We regularly had some of our regular customers contest bills and simply not pay if they weren't satisfied with the service, install or testing... and because they were regular customers who otherwise had contracts for testing and installs... we let them short-change certain things at their discretion because it meant keeping them for other projects in the long term. </p>
<p>We could have taken them to small claims court and gotten our money... we could have reclaimed our installed items... we could have put a lien on their property... but in the long run we made more by letting some things slide, giving discounts, and keeping them happy - because we got to keep their other projects and contracts.</p>
<p>This was also terribly frustrating because the most ignorant, assholish, objectively douche-baggiest people in the tri-state area got five fingered discounts on tons of stuff while good customers paid their bills in full. </p>
<p>So you, as a consumer, could short change your service providers  so long as they don't have the balls to call you out on it and so long as they value your long-term patronage more-so than your short-term short-changing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course it works the other way around!  The only difference is that a business' ability to charge you late fees is governed by the terms of service you agree to, and your ability to charge them &quot;late fees&quot; is governed by contract law.  </p>
<p>I had UPS automatically charge me a brokerage fee of about $1500 on an item I self-cleared and picked up the depot.  </p>
<p>It took them 6 months to return the money to me.  After the first month of getting no where by calling and escalating, I served them with a notice of claim for the $1500 plus interest at 1.5% monthly after the first 30 days (industry standard).  </p>
<p>3 days before the small claims trial date I got a call from someone at UPS offering me the $1500.  I told them I want interest and my filing fee, or we go to court.  They put me on hold for about 5 minutes, and then came back asked me where I wanted the settlement agreement and cheque couriered to.  </p>
<p>Usually businesses can get away with not paying late fees on their mistakes because customers don't take a business like approach to keeping records.<br />
If a business kept their credit ledger on post-it notes by the phone, they wouldn't be collecting much interest on their overdue accounts either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Used to run a computer repair company. If this was a thing it would have killed us. Repair were often late because of unforeseen circumstances. Best possible intentions, skilled staff, great suppliers. Airtight workflow. Even with all that in place shit happens that you have no control over. That's why t&amp;c is a must. The way it works from a business perspective is, if you have to spend more time on a repair, you are losing money anyway. The reason is because your labour resource is tied up on costs that can't be recouped by the charges and that resource then is not available to work on something that would earn. It's just the cost of doing business, and is factored in. However, if you put additional 'fines' on this systemically, one of two things would have to happen. 1 the business would not be profitable any longer and have to close. Or, 2, the business would have to raise their charges on all services to cover the shortfall, and I'm talking by a lot. In the first instance, everyone loses, because no service. In the second instance, consumers lose because it costs them a fuck ton more money for the same thing UNLESS there is a problem. So if you see where this is going, in the problem scenario the customer might end up only having to pay what they would have paid anyway in the system where the fines didn't exist, while all the other customers are paying via additional fees for getting work done on time. Either way you look at it it's unsustainable because the money has to come from somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regular matter is made of atoms. And every atom has a nucleus, made of protons and neutrons. Some nuclei are <em>unstable</em>, meaning that they decay. When a nucleus decays, it emits radiation.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of nuclear radiation. Some examples are alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, protons, neutrons, conversion electrons, fission fragments, clusters, and more. These are generally <em>ionizing</em> radiation, which means that the particles have enough energy to break chemical bonds or knock electrons out of atoms. This is the kind of radiation that can cause cancer. The radiation emitted by a phone or a WiFi router is <strong>not</strong> ionizing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is happening to our body when radiation gives us cancer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a very basic level, ionizing radiation damages your DNA. This causes mutations which can lead to cancer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we use radiation therapy to cure cancer when it also gives us cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ionizing radiation can be used to kill cells. If you point your beam of radiation at cancerous cell, it will kill them. We have sophisticated techniques to specifically target the cancerous tissue with beams of radiation. The treatment kills cancerous tissue while delivering a much smaller dose to the surrounding healthy tissue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It also seems a property of it is that you can't really stop it - it seems like putting up walls or barriers is not effective unless they are ridiculously thick, and even then it seems like we just do that because we don't really know what else to do and it's better than nothing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't stop radioactive nuclei from decaying, but you can certainly shield against radiation. Different types of radiation are easier to stop than others. For example, alpha particles are very easy to stop with a piece of paper, or even just a few inches of air. On the other hand, fast neutrons are much harder to stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit to /u/RobusEtCeleritas's nice coverage:</p>
<p>The reason some types of radiation are so penetrating is that those types have no electric charge, so they don't interact very often with matter.  This includes x-rays and gamma rays, which are just high-energy forms of light, and neutrons, which are one of the particles that make the nuclei of atoms.</p>
<p>To focus on the x-rays and gamma rays, while they don't interact very often with matter, when they do interact they tend to dump most of their energy into it at once.  So we just need to make the shielding thick enough so that most of the radiation will hit something.</p>
<p>As an example: for the high-energy x-rays used in radiation therapy, about 40 cm of concrete will stop 90% of x-rays.  Another 40 cm will beef that up to 99%, another 40 cm 99.9%, and so on.  Usually in radiation therapy vaults, the main shielding is concrete about 200 cm (6 feet) thick, which will stop 99.999% of the radiation, which is enough to make working outside the vaults quite safe.</p>
<p>This is all a very well-understood science, and experts such as Health Physicists and Medical Physicists exist to make sure radiation can be used safely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with nuclear radiation is neither bad nor good it simply is. </p>
<p>Radiation is a natural phenomenon that happens in the universe it powers the stars, and thus the plants and and all life on earth. </p>
<p>Radiation can come from many sources through natural decay, everything decays you me, the air, that rock over there everything. What that means is that some parts of the core of an atom called the nucleus breaks apart from the atom and escapes. This for most element doesn't happen very often, we however know that half of will decay in the same amount of time as the rest of it. </p>
<p>We consider something radioactive when it decays at a rate which is high. </p>
<p>What radiation is, is complicated. But as you assumed there are different types of radiation out there. </p>
<p>Let talk about the major different kinds of radiation. </p>
<p>Alpha radiation means a helium core (consisting of two protons and two neutrons) escapes a larger atom. Notice how I say the core because alpha particles have no electrons, and thus have a charge. </p>
<p>Beta radiation is a type of decay inside the protons or neutrons that release a electron (or a positron) and neutrino (elementary particle) in essence it what's happens when a neutron and proton change into one another they release a beta wave. </p>
<p>A Gamma ray is electromagnetic discharge from excited atoms coming back to normal States, they have very high energy. Gamma rays also tend to penetrate most objects they are the rays that the large walls are really protecting you from as almost anything can block an alpha ray and it takes very little to block a beta rays. </p>
<p>Now what does all this mean? It means that radiation comes from processes that are changing the core and thus element of an atom. When atoms changes into one another, they use fusion (two small make one big) or they fission (one big makes two small). It also means that these radiations at certain levels are capable of marking other atoms decay. </p>
<p>Now when we are talking about nuclear energy we are talking about controlling this decay. Because these things have a weird property, when you add all the mass from before the decay and then add up all the mass after they don't equal each other, some of the mass was turned into energy this energy is carried by the alpha, beta or gamma ray (and many times all three). We can use this energy to turns a magnet which creates electricity in a turbine. Basically we take elements that are already have a high rate of decay and then we send in some focused rays to cause them to start decaying enough that it creates a chain reaction of atoms splitting and there splitting parts being used to make more of the split and so on. </p>
<p>When we are talking about bombs we means we cause a lot of decay to happen as close to instantaneously as we can and thus making the release of energy high and explosive. We basically crush the particles so that they end up so compact they have no other choice but to run into each other, which causes the chain reaction in much more spectacular and less controlled form. </p>
<p>Radiation is dangerous because they can change the structures of other atoms, through enough radiation at a nuclear cell and some of the cells will start to have serious problem because the atoms and molecules will have changed structure, which means they won't act the way the cell wants them to anymore, they will decay. </p>
<p>One should mention nothing is going to make you or anything else more radioactive. You won't become suddenly start b OMG radioactive more because you experience radiation (the radiation may affect you in a certain way but not in that way), you are already giving off radiation just at a rate so small it doesn't matter. You however can become contaminated, meaning cover in a radioactive material (usually meaning in a fine dust or somehow soaked in it) you are not radioactive you are contaminated with radioactive elements. So no you won't start flowing and nor will anything else. </p>
<p>Now certain types of tissue for various reason are more affected than others and some are most affected by certain types of radiation rather than others.</p>
<p>This is much more complicated than this and is meant to be an introduction there are whole courses on the affects, causes and sources of just alpha radiation. And so a reddit post isn't exactly going to explain everything or truly explain it accurately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some nuclei are unstable, which means they have a probability of disintegrating, and thus some natural rate of disintegrating. When they disintegrate there tends to be energy &quot;left over&quot; which results in highly energetic decay products. If a nucleus is excited then it can release gamma rays (high energy photons) as it settles down. Or, the nucleus might emit a high energy electron (beta particle) or anti-electron (positron) in the decay. Or it might release an alpha particle, or a neutron, or a proton, or something else. <em>That</em> is radiation. Particles or photons &quot;radiating&quot; out of matter containing unstable nuclei.</p>
<p>Due to the extraordinary number of atoms in even mundane amounts of matter even an incredibly low probability of disintegration can translate to a rate of disintegrations and an amount of &quot;radiation&quot; generated that can range from merely detectable to hazardous. When a particle or photon of &quot;radiation&quot; hits other matter it can deposit its energy into an atom/molecule that it hits. This can ionize atoms (which is where it gains the name &quot;ionizing radiation&quot;), break atomic bonds, and effectively destroy molecules. Because organisms are based on molecular machinery and molecular media for genetic information storage the destruction of molecules can wreak havoc on the proper functioning of a cell.</p>
<p>Radiation can kill you outright by effectively killing enough of the cells in organs you need to live. It can also cause mutations across a huge number of cells, one of which might result in a cell becoming dangerously cancerous, which may or may not kill you years in the future. Non-lethal levels of radiation can also potentially be used beneficially. The basic concept is twofold. One is that by moving a radiation beam around it's possible to sweep it over healthy areas of the body (reducing the individual exposure levels there) while at the same time keeping it held on cancerous areas (increasing the exposure levels there). The other is that because cancerous cells are abnormal they are potentially more vulnerable to being killed through damage than healthy cells, so by damaging both it's hoped that the cancerous cells will be killed off while the healthy cells and organs will be able to recover (this is the same basic principle as chemotherapy, to some degree).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will probably be burried, but here it is.
I have a studio art degree from a public university with an emphasis in oils. I was in school just a few years ago.
When we began our photorealism classes, the professors taught us the  technique of copying pictures, detail for detail.
Painting from life and painting from image, are very different.
Now, I hope this captures the spirit of ELI5, because I havent studied the human eye or how image transfer works in the human brain.
We see in three dimensions, right? So when we look at a real life model we see every detail of the light against that three dimensional form. But to capture all of that in a TWO dimensional form is rather difficult. So I was taught to &quot;cheat&quot; at first. By painting from a photo, technology that didnt exist during the Renaissance, my eye is now translating a two dimensional figure into another two dimensional figure. Why this is easier for the human eye, I don't know. But from experience, it's definitely much easier to paint a convincingly photorealistic image from a picture over doing it from a real life person. </p>
<p>And in response to the comment about the paintings not necessarily looking photorealistic, and instead just looking like &quot;Renaissance&quot;...you're half right.</p>
<p>The masters of the Renaissance respected the human form and got as close to life-like as possible. Photorealism (a term coined much later, at the turn of the century) was the holy grail. It meant more money, the more life-like the commissions became. In their minds, there was nothing better than the natural human form, nothing more beautiful, save perhaps their paintings of it. But they also glorified the human form much like the Greeks did before them. So the human figure was made to look much more lavish, much more exquisite, than it really was. (Some masters admittedly added more musculature to their sculptures and paintings than was anatomically correct.) And there were many iterations of this concept, a noteable contributer being Sir Reubens (the one that painted his ladies nice, rosy, robust, and chubby.)
So yeah, it was supposed to look even more beautiful than the natural form, but photorealism was absolutely a goal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern artists can achieve photorealism because they are copying from photos.</p>
<p>Photographs are images captured by a device. The capabilities and settings on the device determine how the image will appear - change the settings slightly and you'll get a very different image. Therefore, a photograph is not explicit reality but a version of it captured in a certain moment, under certain conditions, at a certain angle, by a certain device with certain settings (selected by a human, which is why you should reconsider photos/video as a kind of objective reality in the first place - think about this when watching the news or Youtube).</p>
<p>Go outside and take a photo. Now look at the scene with your eye and compare it to the photo. You should be able to notice differences.</p>
<p>Now come back an hour later and look at the same scene with your eye. At minimum the light has changed, objects might have moved, cloud cover changed, etc.</p>
<p>Consider that creating a detailed painting takes many hours. </p>
<p>Consider that while the artist is working, the conditions of the scene will change.</p>
<p>Consider that when working from a photo, nothing changes. Even the conditions under which the artist views the photo itself do not change since we have the luxury of electronic artificial light.</p>
<p>When working from a photograph, the artist is copying a vision captured by a machine; when working from reality, the image produced is built directly from the impressions of a human without the mechanical middle-man.</p>
<p>So: which method represents reality more accurately as a <em>human perceives it</em>? Of course, the question itself only leads to more questions ;)</p>
<p>My background: I have a degree in fine arts and prefer to paint in oils. I use photographs as a reference for anatomy, proportion, colour but build the image according to whatever imagination inspired it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A lot of renaissance work - particularly in portraits has the hallmarks of using a camera obscura (basically an image projected in a lightbox) which has a few issues in terms of scale (often the person's head is in focus but their shoulders aren't, also head looks giant compared to torso). Don't forget as well that painter in that time was much more of a craft than an art - painters needed to earn enough to eat and sometimes that meant fudging things to suit the vanity of the subject/comissioner which necessarily adds some distortion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your comparison with trompe l'oeil masterpieces is not comparing like for like really. You can't compare a pencil drawing to oil painting as the medium affects the end result and oil paint is quite a thick viscous material that does not really lend itself to fine details in the way that a pencil or ballpoint does.</p>
<p>I also think the increase in realism over the centuries has two causes, one is that as technique improves the next &quot;great&quot; artist has to up their technique to be successful in the same way that Olympic records are broken for a more mundane example.</p>
<p>The second change is technology and scientific discovery, as human knowledge and technology changes human perception changes too.   As printing improved and photography appeared peoples perception of realism changed to match the level of detail these new techniques brought with them. For us in the modern age it is for example quite normal to think of a picture being made up of small dots or pixels but if someone were to think in that way in the 17th century would of been quite unique.</p>
<p>On another level it is debatable if level of detail equates to quality, a high level of detail at worst is only a indication of a certain level of craftsmanship and not a automatic indication of artistic merit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, indeed, define trig functions using ordinary arithmetic operations. The catch, as you can see, is that we have to use imaginary numbers. In particular, we have to use imaginary <em>exponents</em>, which behave weirdly compared to real exponents.</p>
<p>The reason that these functions seem so strange is that when you first encounter them, you don't about imaginary numbers, so you can't put them in terms of something you already understand. In fact, trigonometry as a whole long predates the formal idea of imaginary numbers.</p>
<p>However these functions were treated historically, I personally find that the usual definition in terms of triangles is needlessly opaque. I prefer to define them in terms of <em>circles</em>.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Unit_circle.svg" target="_blank">This</a></em> is what the sine and cosine mean.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Circle_cos_sin.gif" target="_blank">Animated version</a>.</p>
<p>Now, what is the connection to imaginary numbers? Take the function f(t) = e^(i·t). This looks rather abstruse^([difficult to understand; obscure]) — what does it mean to raise something to an <em>imaginary</em> power? Well, it turns out that it means <em>rotating</em> it! The function e^(i·t), when t is a real number (so that i·t is imaginary) always produces a point on the unit circle. When t=0, e^(i·t) = 1. But as t increases, e^(i·t) rotates around the unit circle counterclockwise. When t = 2π, e^(i·t) has gone all the way around and is back at 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity#/media/File:Euler%27s_formula.svg" target="_blank">Picture</a>.</p>
<p>You can see that this is almost exactly the same picture as the one defining sine and cosine. In fact, there is an even simpler way of defining sine and cosine:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b39d354fe272ab3508576234f99f9884115e1fa9" target="_blank">Image</a></p>
<p>In these equations, “Im(x)” means the imaginary part of x and “Re(x)” is the real part of x. For instance, Re(2 + 3i) = 2, and Im(2 + 3i) = 3. The real part and imaginary part functions are not ordinary arithmetic functions — they're more like the absolute value function. But using these definitions, we can indeed define sine and cosine using ordinary arithmetic functions:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54c9315ebec2cf4de2424c145441ec2cd3e43ca5" target="_blank">Image</a>.</p>
<p>A little fiddling will result in “Euler's formula”:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b55e28219a34ac40f8f4a92e22302abb83c53bb" target="_blank">Image</a></p>
<p>And so we have an explicit definition of the sine and cosine in terms of familiar functions. The trade-off, obviously, is that now we have imaginary numbers to contend with! But imaginary numbers aren't so bad, and they really do make other things simpler. I find that explaining things <em>without</em> imaginary numbers is often more difficulty and complicated than just explaining imaginary numbers first. I've always wondered how much easier high school trig would be if you started with imaginary numbers and proceeded from there. Sure, it's not the way the ancients did it, but so what?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thought about removing “abstruse”, but instead added a definition because I really like that word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are the three basic <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions" target="_blank">trigonometric functions</a>.</p>
<p>Look at a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Trigonometry_triangle.svg" target="_blank">right triangle</a> (&quot;right&quot; means that one angle is 90 degrees). Specifically, look at the angle A. There are three sides to the triangle: the hypotenuse (which is opposite the right angle), the side opposite the angle A, and the side adjacent to the angle A. The three trigonometric functions are defined as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>sin(A) = a/h = the ratio between the side of the triangle <em>opposite</em> the angle, and the <em>hypotenuse</em>.</li>
<li>cos(A) = b/h = the ratio between the side of the triangle <em>adjacent</em> the angle, and the <em>hypotenuse</em>.</li>
<li>tan(A) = sin(A) / cos(A) = a/b = the ratio between the side <em>opposite</em> the angle and the side <em>adjacent</em> to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this defines sin/cos/tan for any value between 0 and 90 degrees. There's a more complex definition using a circle which extends this for every number (instead if just 0 - 90), which you can read about in the wiki page I linked to. Also, instead of using degrees, we normally use <em>radians</em>, which are a way to express degrees using the constant pi, such that 360 degrees = 2*pi (so 90 degrees = pi/2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obviously, as others have stated, there are very precise definitions of what the trigonometric functions are. However, it seems like you're asking for a more intuitive or less technical way to think about what they do to a number. </p>
<p>Consider first, for simplicity and without loss of generalization, that you're not going to feed your Trigonometric function numbers in the form of radians, which would just be some partition of the irrational number pi (pi/2, 2pi, pi/6, etc). Again, right now we aren't talking about that specifically. You're going to feed your function numbers in the form of degrees.</p>
<p>To be more concise and concrete, consider that you're walking along a circular path in a garden. Your path has a diameter of 2 meters. As you walk around the garden from your start point, you are taking more steps until you come back around to where you started. You've walked in a circle or 360 degrees. What if you notice that <a href="http://sculptures.bethelartsct.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/homeimage.jpg" target="_blank">the path has lines in it from pouring the concrete?</a> You stand on one line and look to the opposite side of the circle, you then count the number of lines between your line and that line directly across from you. <a href="https://www.studenthandouts.com/01-Web-Pages/2013-03/8-section-pie-chart.gif" target="_blank">In our example you count 3 in between that line and your line. 1 halfway between your position and the other side, creating two compartments, and then one in the middle of each compartment creating 4 compartments of path between you and exactly opposite the circle from you.</a></p>
<p>What would you think the angles you've made if you stop at one of those lines on your way over to the opposite side? You start at angle zero, and begin to walk over and every time you stop at a line you've added 45 degrees to your previous angle.</p>
<p>Now consider you wanted to set a number line between you and the spot directly across from you with respect to the center of the circle. You then declare the line you're standing at is 1, because with your 2 meter diameter, on your path you're standing 1 meter from the center (at all times actually!). So, as you walk towards the opposite line from where you're standing what if you stopped at your favorite spot, say 1 line from where you started - 45 degrees - and then decided you didn't like being on the path so you walked directly back to the number line you laid out between your 0 degree spot and the 180 degree spot? Would you be further than 1 meter from the center or less? Hopefully you think less! As you walked around your path to the other side, if you look at the number line you set up between you and the line directly across from <a href="http://solarenergyengineering.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/data/Journals/JSEEDO/935368/sol_138_05_051005_f005.png" target="_blank">you and walked directly to it, you'd be closer to the center than if you had stayed at 1.</a> As you keep walking towards the line opposite your original spot your angle grows bigger and your number line number keeps decreasing to -1 at the opposite side. </p>
<p>Now maybe you're seeing a relationship here. I know this was a little verbose and maybe tricky for you, the 5 year old, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/cBzeLOo.gifv?forcedesktop=1" target="_blank">ultimately I hope you see that the trigonometric functions help translate your angle to the position on the line.</a> Specifically, in our example, we were talking about cosine. You give it your angle and it will give you your number line distance from the center. However, sine works the same way but reads out the vertical distance. When you're standing at 0 degrees, you're actually 0 meters above or below the center of the circle with respect to where you started. </p>
<p>Hopefully this helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, there's a way to define them.  Suppose I choose a point on the unit circle (circle of radius one) about the origin, and I look at the angle that point makes with the (positive) horizontal axis.</p>
<p>Then the sine of the angle is the height (or vertical distance) of the point, the cosine is the horizontal distance (and is the same as the sine of the complementary angle, which is why it's called co-sine), and the tangent... well, that's the ratio of the sine and the cosine, never mind that one. :)</p>
<p>That's enough to define a function, we don't need to define it in terms of multiplying and adding things.  But if we need a number, we can use a Taylor series to approximate it.  This is what a calculator uses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in saying that wavelengths shorter than the Planck length are possible simply because you now Lorentz boosts (changes of reference frame) are symmetries, so you can always boost into a frame where any given photon has a post-Planckian momentum, wavelength, period, etc.</p>
<p>However, a sub-Planckian wavelength λ is &quot;not observable&quot; to you because it cannot be used to locate an object with accuracy λ like you would be able with a normal wavelength, because your photon would create a black hole as soon as it interacts with anything (anything with a &quot;normal&quot; wavelength)*. The smaller λ, the bigger the black hole.</p>
<p>Moreover, the photon is not necessarily a point particle all the way down. In string theory, being a string, it has a minimum size which more or less is a Planck length. So when the wavelength gets smaller than Planck, it's not really a good measure of the photon's localization since its own structural size is larger.</p>
<p>So this should give an intuition into the subtleties of the Planck length works as a minimum length scale. It's not like a grid size or anything of the sort, but it is still a minimum length in some very unconventional sense. I've discussed this a bit more in detail <a href="https://hologrammata.wordpress.com/2017/02/20/is-the-planck-length-the-minimum-possible-length/" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested. </p>
<p>* actually, this is not strictly correct, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5xg3wi/if_photons_have_a_minimum_wavelength_what_happens/dei3mjj/" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Physics is unclear about what's going on at around the Planck Length.  Interestingly, this is actually a feature of an alternate theory of black holes by Pawel Mazur and Emil Mottola :</p>
<p>&quot;Quantum theory says that any scale smaller than the Planck length is unobservable and meaningless to physics and physicists. This limit can be imposed on the wavelength of a beam of light so as to obtain a limit of blue shift that the light can undergo. This becomes important for the structure of a gravastar because general relativity says that a gravitational well blue-shifts incoming light, so around the extremely large mass of a gravastar there is a region of &quot;immeasurability&quot; to the outside universe as the wavelength of the light approaches, and then passes, the Planck length. This region is called a &quot;gravitational vacuum&quot;, because it is a void in the fabric of space and time.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, bleach is a mixture of 1 to 25% of NaClO (sodium hypochlorite) and water. Now, let's look at the formula: you can see we have sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl) and oxygen.</p>
<p>In reactions, NaClO is highly likely to oxydize things, which means that it is prone to give his oxygen to something else. </p>
<p>Now, colours are given by a wide category of compounds, the chromophores (from latin: bringers of colours). Bleach oxydizes these compounds (it gives them tha oxygen), which changes their behaviour and change their properties, destroying colour basically.</p>
<p>Now, there are 3 possible explanations to your couch colour:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The green compund turns yellow when oxydized. Instead of going from &quot;reflect only green AKA look green&quot; to &quot;reflect everything AKA look white&quot;, this compund goes to &quot;reflect only yellow&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green can be made by yellow + blue. The blue compound reacts with bleach and goes white, the yellow doesn't. You now have a pale shade of yellow.</p>
</li>
<li>You haven't used enough bleach.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, oxydation is what destroys colours. Some stains can be removed with oxygenated water (H2O2), which has lot of oxygen and so oxygenates things well (most notably, fresh blood stains which are otherwise har to remove). </p>
<p>Colours of old things are faded because exposure to the oxygen in the air.</p>
<p>Sun makes colours fade (think about clothes you use a lot in the sun or your own hair during summer, unless you have black or platinum blonde hair) because it heats things, speeding up the reaction with oxygen in the air and there are several more examples like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bleach is a really intense base. It oxidizes the materials it comes in contact with. Chromophores are the parts of molecules that reflect light and give color to those molecules. When bleach is introduced to material, the oxidation process alters the chromophores in such a way that they no longer reflect only the light that gives color to the material. This is how bleach essentially strips away color. However, different materials, colors, and amounts of bleach can affect the oxidation process enough to produce a range of shades from white to yellow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sometimes this means your fabric comes out white. Depending on how much bleach you use, and what was used to make the fabric colorful, it may come out yellow, or even a light green.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are able to exclusively hire people of one ethnicity because of a loophole called most qualified; if they are actually trying to discriminate based on race. The only ethnic restaurant, I personally know, that tried to racially discriminate hires had a language requirement. It was a language which one only learns if they're from that ethnicity.</p>
<p>The realistic reason is because of how they hire. Most ethnic restaurants hire through networks they have and in most cases the owners are immigrants. Their networks are typically limited to only their ethnic group which results in their staff being primarily whatever their network is made of. In addition, they often hire family members which also happen to be homogeneous in the ethnic spectrum. It's not like most owners are actively trying to discriminate but rather their methods of hiring has a side effect of discriminating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many restaurants, particularly ethnic restaurants, are family run. The people who work there are related to or are friends with the owners, and that means they are likely to be of the same ethnicity.</p>
<p>Apart from that, people of the same ethnicity are likely to be more qualified, as they know the cuisine better.  They also might prefer to work in an environment that supports the ethnicity, and preferentially seek jobs there.</p>
<p>Finally, a lot of ethnic restaurants are run by immigrants, who will actively seek employees within their immigrant communities.</p>
<p>Legally speaking, in most cases they are not allowed to specifically discriminate on the basis of race.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can't exclude people that are protected under the law, but they are rarely in the position of having to decide between candidates when openings occur. Most of the time in an environment where English is not the first language, there will be a list of candidates waiting for an opening. This isn't because of racism or anything nefarious, but simply due to friends and family getting word around. </p>
<p>In certain circumstances, I'd also bet that they can require a certain level of proficiency in a language to be considered viable. A fancy restaurant, or one serving international customers, might need their wait staff to speak a language other than English simply for appearances or customer convenience </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these restaurants are actually hiring family or friends of family. I know one such Chinese restaurant in my hometown is run entirely by Chinese people, who are all part of one family. So to really answer your question about how they get away with it, it's usually just because they're family owned and ran. So they strictly hire family members. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My fiancé was in an asian interest sorority and I've made friends with a few of them. Essentially, they tend to hire family members into the business. The same applies to other businesses such as nail salons. They tend to be family owned and help each other out. </p>
<p>But in larger chain restaurants such as buffets, I've noticed that only the front-end staff (waiters, hostess, cashier) will be of the same ethnicity while the back end (cooks) are much more diverse. I'd imagine that's to maintain a certain atmosphere for the clientele. I went to an Indian Bazzar and an Honduran was behind the counter and it was a bit jarring lol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
