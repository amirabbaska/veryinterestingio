It's likely that your camera also has red eye reducing software in it too and uses this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some phone cameras automatically remove it.  A lot of cameras have a pre-flash, minimizing the effect the true flash has on your pupils.  And a big one, digital photography technology has evolved to be very high quality in lower and lower lighting, so we need a flash less and less these days, meaning we never see the red-eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in the storage industry, though not specifically on this type of device, so I might be missing a few minor details. Hopefully this will help, though.</p>
<p>A quick search found <a href="http://codecapsule.com/2014/02/12/coding-for-ssds-part-6-a-summary-what-every-programmer-should-know-about-solid-state-drives/" target="_blank">this</a> article which is focused on high-performance programming. SSDs are very similar in relevant ways to USB sticks.</p>
<p>In general, there are 3 major components to a flash drive (or even SSD).  There's the raw flash chip(s) themselves. There's the flash translation layer which is what makes the flash chips look and act like a drive. And then there's the interface controller which provides USB connectivity (or SATA connectivity, or whatever).</p>
<p>When it comes to the engineering of these devices, there are lots of things to be considered including assembling costs, defect rates, market desire and willingness to pay.</p>
<p>Using more than 1 flash chip means you have to pay more for additional assembly costs, if only the extra machine time to install it.</p>
<p>The flash translation layer is also designed to handle a certain number of flash chips. (I'm assuming it's a separate IC, but SoC design keeps changing things). In general, supporting more chips means more connections which means more silicon and a larger packaging. If you can support a lot of flash chips you are likely able to support higher throughput (which is why SSDs are usually much faster than flash drives even for similar capacities). But if you're trying to go for cost minimization, you might use a shared bus if the flash chips support it and you're willing to take on additional debugging headaches.</p>
<p>The interface layer probably isn't that interesting.</p>
<p>If I was tasked with designing a USB memory stick of a particular capacity, I'd probably check to see if the cost of two smaller flash chips plus the cost of a translation-layer chip which supported two flash chips, plus costs of manufacturing, etc., were more or less than the cost of a single larger flash chip with the simpler translation layer, etc. And then do that. Because in this space customers seem to care almost exclusively about price and capacity to the exclusion of all else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a limit to the largest module of RAM that can be produced.  And that is limited by the largest individual DRAM chip and the largest &quot;rank&quot; that a system can handle.  The largest DDR modules <em>are</em> simply two smaller modules packed together onto the same PCB.</p>
<p>The only 128GB DDR4 modules I could find are &quot;octal-ranked.&quot;  I.e. they are 8 individual modules placed on the same PCB.  64GB modules are commonly &quot;quad-ranked,&quot; however, older ones could also be octal-ranked.</p>
<p>So, why don't we have 16-ranked modules? Because the systems that this RAM runs on is generally limited to 8 ranks per memory channel.  So, if you use a 128GB module, you cannot put any other modules in that memory channel.  Server systems frequently have 3-4 memory slots per channel.  So, you could either configure your system with a single 128GB module or with two 64GB modules, or with four 32GB modules.  The 32GB modules will be the cheaper option and therefore in servers where space is not limited the multiple module approach would be preferred.</p>
<p>But, not all systems are large enough to allow for 4 modules/channel.  Which is why we have an octal-ranked 128GB DDR4 RAM module.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A memory stick can be made in several ways.</p>
<p>1- It can be a single or multiple chips. If you open some usb keys you can see that only one side have a chip, the other may only have solder pads. For example, a 32GB could have one side used while the 64GB will have both.</p>
<p>2- Some other will stack vertically some chips.</p>
<p>3- You can take two or more dies (that's the internal of the chip) and put it in the same package.</p>
<p>4- you can take the circuitry and double it then produce the die.</p>
<p>5- you can stack the circuitry in the die (which is basically what 'vertical NAND' is).</p>
<p>6- you can use a smaller process and shrink each cells, and fit more in the same space.</p>
<p>And you can also use more than one of those. Each have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, adding two chip allow for a single design, single bill of material, but two sizes. You order in bigger quantity and get a better price on some parts, get a single setup for everything. All you have to do is tell the machine to not install the second chip. The overall price however is slightly higher as you now have 2 chips, and a single smaller one may be cheaper. A two chip solution can be faster (you can spread the read/write across both, and adding the speed), which also cause the smaller capacity to be slower.</p>
<p>A smaller process is initially more costly, and there is more reject initially. Eventually it become cheaper as they fine tune as they use less materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answering your question about the stick being so much bigger than the actual chip inside. Many things to consider there. 1) that's not always true. There are some wickedly small and still high capacity memory sticks. 2) you have to consider that it's not just the memory chip inside. There is some power cirquitry and a controller chip also. The more actual memory modules you stick in there the more complicated control gets (you may need a bigger control chip) and also power cirquitry gets more complicated. For this reason a single higher capacity memory module is better but it's more costly. 3) I think this is done for ergonomic reasons as well. You could make the physical stick smaller but should you? It becomes easier to lose and harder to unplug/plug. So it will cost more and ultimately not actually be better, potentially worse actually, from a usability point of view</p>
<p>Edit: to answer the original question about gluing modules together. Yes this happens all the time. Look at a ram stick. It says &quot;8 gb&quot; but has like... 12? Ish chips on it that make up 8gb total. Look at a video card. It says it has 4gb of memory but that too is spread across multiple memory chips. Ssds do the same. So yes you can make &quot;the biggest memory stick ever&quot; exactly how you Invision it. Just unlikely that it will be that small. Also memory sticks (unlike other things I've mentioned here) draw their power form the USB port which will very much limit how much &quot;things&quot; you can have on the stick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You cannot develop cancer cells in the teeth, despite teeth being organs  like your liver and lungs.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is something really interesting: there are cells in the body that are sort of “dead end” products. They live a short while to do very specific jobs, then die off. The best example I can give is very specialized intestinal cells right at the tips of the little villi, the fingerlike projections that carpet your intestines.</p>
<p>There was a study done in mice where oncogenic mutations were expressed specifically in adult intestinal stem cells at the base of the villi, or only in the tip-top “dead end” cells. Even though the very powerful cancer-causing mutations were the same in both cases, only the mice in which the mutations were in the intestinal stem cells got cancer.</p>
<p>We call these dead end cells “terminally differentiated”. The hypothesis is that these cells don’t divide enough to turn into cancer and may also just die too soon. The corollary is that we think there’s something about the way adult stem cells stay alive for a long time and in a state where they can become many different types of cells lends it to getting cancer much more easily. </p>
<p>Edit: I should add that maybe if we forced them enough, they could turn into cancer. Terminally differentiated cells can be turned into embryonic stem cells by the iPS process. But at the very least, it would be very difficult to make it happen in an actual animal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Minutes is actually quite a tricky timescale - primordial black holes could conceivably have formed before that, around 1 second after the big bang. About 3 minutes to 20 minutes in, the universe is cool enough for nucleons (protons, neutrons) to form, and dense enough to fuse them into heavier elements, but it's still opaque to light. After 20 mins, it's no longer dense enough to support fusion, but remains opaque for basically the next 377,000 years.</p>
<p>Why am I going on about opacity? Well, to get something that is still, subjectively, minutes after the big bang, we need something travelling at so close to lightspeed that it basically has to be a massless particle, but they're all being absorbed and reemitted, so I don't think they cut it.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is to assume primordial black holes exist, and have a photons orbit at the event horizon without being eaten until the black hole evaporates slightly after the 377,000 year mark, then it can begin its timeless journey across the newly transparent universe. With luck, it wouldn't hit anything, and would still be flying now, a particle whose perspective has the big bang mere minutes ago.</p>
<p>Edit: the Cosmic Microwave Background, the earliest photons we're aware of, are the legacy of the process that made the universe transparent at 377000 years in - neutral atoms forming rather than plasma. The neutral atoms were still carrying a lot of energy, which they shed as photons in what must have been an incredible show. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a practicing psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s possible. There are case reports of people developing mania due to intracranial disruption, but it is quite rare. In these cases the patients described were euthymic - in other words, they were not depressed - but it illustrates the point that both extremes of mood can develop as a response to intracranial injury, whether it be due to mass effect (tumor), stroke, or traumatic injury. I don’t know of any cases that fit exactly your hypothetical case - someone who is pre-morbidly depressed and subsequently becomes euthymic or even hypomanic/manic as a result of intracranial mass - but it is presumably true in theory if specific areas of the brain are disrupted. I actually saw a case in medical school of a woman with a chronic history of treatment-resistant depression who was found to have a massive meningioma - a type of relatively benign brain tumor - in her frontal lobe. After the mass was (mostly) resected, her mood improved almost immediately though with the downside that she became much more impulsive and irritable - not unexpected effects given the area of the brain that was being operated on.</p>
<p>I’m a little unsatisfied with some of the answers here as some are flat-out incorrect while others do not accurately describe the state of the science. It is quite clear that depression is not due to a “serotonin deficiency.” Disruption in serotonin signaling is sufficient but not necessary to cause depression - the antidepressant Wellbutrin (bupropion) has essentially zero serotonergic activity but is fairly effective as an antidepressant. Further, researchers have created markedly serotonin-deficient strains of mice and they do not reliably develop the symptoms of depression typically observed in mouse models. Instead, it is more likely that there is generalized disruption in the monoamine system, which includes serotonin but also norepinephrine and dopamine. Apart from the SSRIs, most other antidepressants act on multiple components of the monoamine system. It’s also possible that disruptions in monoamine signaling are simply a downstream effect of dysregulation. We just don’t know based on the science. What is quite clear, however, is that the overly simplified explanation  popular in the lay media and our culture broadly of a “chemical imbalance” due to serotonin is not correct. </p>
<p>Further, while the neuroscientific basis of mood is not known exactly, there are pretty clear circuits and neuroanatomical structures that are involved in mood regulation, and disruption of these structures - either intentionally in animal models or accidentally in human patients - reliably results in mood symptoms. These structures largely include specific areas of the frontal lobes but there are others. I’m reminded of another case that I saw in residency while working on the epilepsy monitoring unit when a guy was being worked up for possible resection of an epileptogenic focus, basically a part of the brain that was not correctly regulated and would occasionally become hyperactive, resulting in a spread of electrical activity across the brain that caused a seizure. As part of this work-up, neurosurgeons place a bunch of very small electrodes within the brain to very precisely locate the epileptogenic focus. The electrodes can discharge a minute amount of electric charge, resulting in stimulation of a very specific part of the brain. This is done to see what the function of that specific area of the brain is and, thus, determine whether it can be safely resected or not. Anyway, as the team was doing this testing, activation of one of electrodes resulted in a marked and sudden change in the man’s mood. He immediately became acutely depressed: he had no interest in doing anything, his voice became monotone and soft, and he just looked depressed (what we call a flat affect). This effect disappeared after a few minutes with stimulation of other areas of the brain using other electrodes. While anecdotal, this is the most clear demonstration of the fact that our experience of mood is dependent entirely on the functioning of the physical brain. </p>
<p>So, the short answer to your question is that I would say that it’s possible, but I know of no cases that have specifically described this phenomenon. The long answer is that our experience of mood, and consciousness broadly, is based on the functioning of the brain, so it should be unsurprising that disruptions in the structure of the brain can result in changes in your mood state. While we may not know the exact mechanisms by which regulation and generation occurs, they are better described and less mysterious than other answers provided here.</p>

Theoretically, the disruption a tumour causes could well lead to changes which improve emotional wellbeing, seeing as we couldn't say for certain what disruption causes the opposite.

<p>A tumor causing or reversing depression would be very rare. Generally people who have brain tumors are depressed because of their potentially life threatening disease and the anxiety that comes with impending mortality. The prevalence is around 27% and can differ significantly based on tumor size and even country (Oncotarget. 2017 Aug 3;8(55):94932-94943. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.19843. eCollection 2017 Nov 7.)</p>
<p>However there is some data suggesting that if certain white matter tracts are disrupted, it can lead to affective changes (World Neurosurg. 2015 Oct;84(4):927-32. doi: 10.1016/j.wneu.2015.05.031.). Generally that's not a presenting symptom. Tumors are typically found because of seizures, headaches, visual changes, weakness or abnormal sensation.</p>
<p>In terms of structural changes reversing depression, there is some home that deep brain stimulation may help. However, the large trials have not yet showed a significant benefit and it is still considered investigational. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First, as others have mentioned, if you're in a state of mind to refuse an ambulance, you can go ahead and do that. </p>
<p>Now, I don't care what country you live in, if you get taken somewhere by ambulance, <em>someone</em> is paying for it. If you're in a country with socialised healthcare, it's the government. </p>
<p>The US is thought by most people (including Americans) not to have socialised healthcare, but this is only partially true. There are many government programs that pay for healthcare. More now than a decade ago, imperfect as the new ones are and hobbled as they re becoming. So there's a decent chance that if you are an American and someone called you an ambulance, the government (federal or local) is paying for it.</p>
<p>Barring that, you probably have private insurance, and <em>they</em> are the ones who will pay for it. Now, many private insurance programs will have various fees and copays for services, including ambulance service, <strong>but this is not uncommon in countries with socialised medicine</strong>, either. Your insurance might be charged a few thousand dollars, and you'll have to pay $100 out of that (or more, or less -- depending on the program you chose). </p>
<p>Only if you have <em>no</em> insurance will you be billed directly yourself. </p>
<p>And when that happens, that's when it makes a huge noise and people outside the US hear about how someone in the US is now $100,000 in debt because of medical costs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some medications will collect in a specific organ and won't need to be increased to account for the extra mass, others spread throughout the body and will need an increased dosage.</p>
<p>Some drugs are actually &quot;fat-soluble&quot; and will concentrate in the fatty tissue itself, making doseage difficult for very obese people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn’t a really cut and dry answer to this one...  it depends on the medication.</p>
<p>Many medications are titrated to effect or lab values (ie meds for cholesterol, anti depressants, epilepsy meds). We don’t start overweight patients on doses any higher for these medications. We will just increase doses based on what their labs say or how the patient feels. I can’t say for certain, but I don’t believe anyone has taken time to gather data and find if overweight persons require a higher “effective” dose.</p>
<p>Other medications, like oral antibiotics, are a flat dose regardless of weight. Oral antibiotics are dosed based on indication and not patient weight.  Because of how these drugs act in the body despite the persons weight, they will effectively eliminate an infection without increasing the dose (which could then lead to toxic side effects).</p>
<p>Intravenous antibiotics are a totally different scenario where the dosing is predominately weight based (with a max dose ceiling). In the case of IV antibiotics, overweight individuals do indeed need larger doses. </p>
<p>TL;DR it just depends what types of drug we’re talking about</p>
<p>As a reference, I am a Pharmacist in a hospital.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most often, when a person gets fat, most of the extra bulk is literally fat, adipose cells. There are some other increases, like in bone mass and skin, but not a lot of stuff inside the body gets bigger. Lots of drugs dont really target fat or skin, so it doesnt really matter too much...though you do adjust somewhat for certain things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how the medication distributes throughout your body, yes an overweight person might need a higher dose.<br />
To think of it easily, there are two ways a drug distributes through your body, it can either stay in your blood (body weight does not matter) or it can move into your tissue and fat (body weight does matter).<br />
To address this, there are different calculation that can be used:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Acutal Body Weight (ABW) = Your weight with no adjustments </li>
<li>Ideal Body Weight (IBW) = An approximation of what you 'should' weigh that takes in to consideration height, age, gender, and a population based muscle mass average </li>
<li>Dosing Body Weight (DBW) = an adjustment to IBW for people with an ABW that is 30% or more above their ideal body weight</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, but it might be underwhelming. You're probably already familiar with it, in fact.</p>
<p>First off, you need to wrap your mind around what it means to illustrate something in a lower dimension: it's a bit counterintuitive, but what you're really doing is understanding that the shapes you see represent something other than the shapes they are. Look at <a href="http://delinear.info/images/th3n04h/cube-clipart-cube.gif" target="_blank">this cube</a>, for example. See it? Well, yeah... except you don't. You can't -- not really, anyway, because it's <em>not</em> a cube. It's some trapezoids and a square and two triangles. You just understand that the angle of those shapes is a funky representation of what is, if you built it in 3D, a perfect square.</p>
<p>So now let's move up to the fourth dimension, and the tesseract: a four-dimensional cube. If a square is a shape where every angle has <strong>two</strong> lines coming off it at ninety degrees, and a cube is a shape where every angle has <strong>three</strong> lines coming off it at ninety degrees, then a tesseract is a shape where every angle has <strong>four</strong> lines coming off it at ninety degrees. We know what a tesseract <em>is</em>, then... but what would it look like? What would a shape that had those properties <em>be</em>?</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Schlegel_wireframe_8-cell.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is a tesseract, represented in 2D. You could imagine building that in 3D as a wireframe, ball-and-stick model, right? That's your simulation -- but the weird part is, all of the 'gaps' between the wires (we call them 'cells') is distorted as a result of showing it in a lesser dimension. The six outer sides that look like truncated pyramids in your wireframe -- as well as the small inner cube and the big outer cube -- are actually all identically-sized perfect cubes in a real tesseract (in the same way the trapezoids in the cube drawing are actually identically-sized perfect squares). Additionally, all of the lines coming off each corner would be at right angles in a 'true' tesseract, and all of those lines would be the same length. Every single one of them, and all of the lines would be the same length. Every single one of them.</p>
<p>It's trippy stuff, but mathematically it works out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A tesseract is essentially a 4D cube. It would look like a cube with another cube farther away, connected by the corners. Farther away in a direction perpendicular to 3D space. That is not easy to think about.</p>

<li>
<p>99.99% of patent applications aren't worth stealing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patent examiners, at least in the United States, can't file for patents.</p>
</li>
<li>Everything is scanned into electronic databases, assigned sequential application numbers based on filing date, and opened up for public inspection during the entire prosecution process so there's a huge papertrail and it's pretty much impossible to create a phony application and backdate it to establish prior invention.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would take a grand conspiracy to pull that one off, you would need a number of people working at multiple levels within the patent office with the highest levels of network administrative privileges, and you would have to file dummy applications with the sole intentions of swapping them out at a later date with inventions lifted from patent applications that haven't even been filed yet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
