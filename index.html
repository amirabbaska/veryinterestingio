		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so first thing to note is that light is an electromagnetic wave, the photon is the carrier particle for the electromagnetic force. When we're talking about optical effects, we are talking about electromagnetism, which means there are only three (mostly two) particles we have to consider: Electrons, Protons, and Photons.</p>
<p>Electrons and Protons both respond to the electromagnetic force, but Protons are almost always shielded by an atom's electron shell, so they almost never interact with light. Electrons inhabit orbitals, which are basically imaginary shells that surround the nucleus of an atom. They can move from one orbital to another by gaining or losing energy, but they have to gain or lose enough energy to move a while number of orbitals. For example, an electron could jump 2 or 3 orbitals, but not 1.5 orbitals. </p>
<p>When a photon approaches an atom, if the photon can excite an electron into a higher orbital, that photon is absorbed, then the electron jumps back down to its original state (electrons always want to be in the lowest available orbital) and releases a photon of slightly lower energy as the atom recoils, having absorbed some of the photon's momentum as heat (heat is just kinetic energy at tiny scales). If a photon doesn't have the right energy to excite an electron, it passes right on by, if it hits an atom directly, it is deflected rather than absorbed, which lengthens the path the light takes through the material, which is what causes the speed of light to appear to change in different materials. This is why glass is transparent to visible light.</p>
<p>A reflective surface has a lot of free electrons, which are not in orbitals and thus don't have to absorb specific photons to be excited (though they will have trouble with very high energy photons because they just knock electrons right out of the metal, or fly right through them via quantum tunneling), so they take all comers and and reflect them according to the same rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics rather than chem, and it's subatomic/wave rather than atomic.</p>
<p>Light is a wave (or a particle, or both, but we'll stick to wave) of electromagnetic radiation which travels through a variety of media (air, vacuum, water etc.).  Visible light is made up of several different wavelengths which we see as colours.  The important thing here is that, as a wave, it is carrying energy.</p>
<p>When light hits an object, it can be pass through, be absorbed, reflect or scatter, or any combination of these.</p>
<p>When the light wave hits the mirror, the energy from the lightwave is absorbed by the atoms.  This pushes electrons into higher energy states.  This isn't a stable condition, and so the electrons release the energy.  In a perfectly reflective surface, all of the absorbed energy is spat back out, perfectly mirroring the incoming energy.</p>
<p>Across the entire surface of the mirror, this leads to the light being absorbed and then spat back out in a way that produces a &quot;good&quot; reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What everyone else has said is correct; photons (light) being absorbed by electrons (subatomic particles) will excite them, and then they emit their own photon of equal wavelength. You can see <a href="http://s298.photobucket.com/user/msimmond/media/Absorption-1.gif.html" target="_blank">this</a> diagram for a visual aid. What this doesn't explain is why <em>metals</em> (which are basically mirrors without glass in front) are so good at reflecting light.</p>
<p>I would like to go into the Chemistry aspect of this, though, if it's not too late -- since that is the study of atoms, after all. Note: it may help to have a periodic table open in another tab. &quot;Free electrons&quot; is a term I saw in another answer. This basically means that the atom has a lot of electrons not strongly attracted to the parent atom. Can you guess which atoms have the most free electrons?</p>
<p>The answer is metals! Check out a periodic table, and the whole middle section will be the transition metals. If you think about some of the characteristics of metals, they can be explained by their electron structure. First, they're good conductors of electricity, something that directly deals with electron exchange, and second, they're shiny, which relates to what we're talking about. They're also strong at oxidizing, which is part of why batteries work the way they do. Hell, their electron structure is the reason that when you breathe, oxygen gets transported around your body the way it does.</p>
<p>This is where the Chemistry begins. Again, I recommend a <a href="http://www.ptable.com/Images/periodic%20table.png" target="_blank">periodic table</a> if you're reading this. I'm going to try and put this into ELI5. I'd be happy to explain if I don't do it justice.</p>
<p>Basically, around every atom, there are electrons. These are separated into orbitals, named <em>s</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>f</em> orbitals (don't worry about <em>f</em>, that's some Nuclear Chemistry shit). Only the outermost orbital contains electrons usable in reactions, and these are known as valence electrons located in a valence shell; the other ones are tucked away for the most part. Obviously, as the orbitals grow and grow in diameter, they get further and further from the nucleus of the atom, and are less attracted to it. This is what that &quot;free electron&quot; reference meant; these really far-out electrons are only barely associated with the nucleus and are pretty much free to do whatever they want. Metals have valence electrons in the <em>d</em> orbital (which is the middle chunk of the periodic table), and so have plenty of free electrons when compared to an atom with valence electrons in the <em>p</em> orbital or <em>s</em> orbital.</p>
<p>Metals are, to conclude, what makes mirrors shiny. As long as the surface is very, very flat, metals will reflect light very well. I hope I have explained why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Visible light is on the order of nanometers (nm; 10^-9 meters), and a silver atom is on the order of picometers (pm; 10^-12 meters). You could guess that the light is much larger than a single atom. This is why we cannot see individual atoms or molecules with regular optical microscopes - the light wave just goes around the atom. <strong>But</strong> if you pile up those atoms by length, width, and depth, eventually the large area will be big enough to intercept the light wave and bounce it back. I couldn't tell you though if a single atom is responsible for bouncing it back by chance or if multiple atoms can bounce light back, that's out of my jurisdiction</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Photons do not exist.
Not before the radiation is emitted, not during emission, not after during transmission and not during radiation absorption.
They are a convenience of explanation of a quantum physics process.

Energy can act as if it were a particle when interacting with matter that collapses the wave function.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason why peoples faces get really shiny while their arms and legs don't. Your face (and chest, back, shoulders) has pores. In these pores are things called sebaceous glands, which produce sebum. Sebum is the bodies natural waxy substance which lubricates the skin and keeps it healthy. Some people produce a lot of it, and their faces shine like a diamond. Some people produce little of it and get dry skin. It itself is not a bad thing. Acne comes from when the pores get clogged. </p>
<p>Most people have the bacteria that causes acne on their skin already. But it doesn't do anything on healthy skin with healthy pores. Acne happens when these pores get clogged up. The bacteria consumes the sebum in our pores and releases its waste. Something to note is that the bacteria are anaerobic, meaning they thrive in low oxygen environments. So these bacteria are in your pores, eating your sebum, releasing waste, and your pores gets clogged. This is the start of a pimple. If the clog is deep, and the top of the pore is still open, a blackhead forms. If the clog is near the surface and a thin layer of skin forms over it, a whitehead forms.</p>
<p>So the face produces the most sebum and has a lot of pores, making it prime breakout territory. Your forearms and legs have much less sebum so they don't really get acne.</p>
<p>Edit: as I am the top comment, I'm going to plug /r/skincareaddiction as a prime knowledge center with very helpful people. First things first, don't pop whiteheads if you can avoid it, and if you have to, do it gently and cleanly. Popping acne and picking at pores is how you get scarring, and you don't want facial scarring. Secondly, daily sunscreen is how you look 30 when you're 50. Sun damage causes wrinkles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have the largest concentration of sebaceous (oil producing) glands in your face, back and chest. The sebaceous glands enlarge at puberty due to an influx of a testosterone hormone called DHEA. That over-stimulates the production of oil in these glands. Acne is an inflamed pore filled with oil, bacteria, and dead skin cells. The oil, dead skin, and bacteria get &quot;stuck&quot; in your pore and when your immune system tries to get rid of it, it causes the pus and inflammation we call acne.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think these established facts answer your question pretty well? Sure, no direct answer to &quot;why face in particular&quot;, but it's easy enough for me to infer that helping to literally keep one's head cool (overheating can lead to heat stroke) has been evolutionary helpful, and so has some added handling of germs in your face given the closeness to how they are digested or breathed in? Hell it could even have sexual reasons given that well lubricated skin has obvious and well known properties in making it stay young (thus a huge part of the and our face is the most important body part in sexual selection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I noticed is that these areas are also washed and rewashed aggressively more than the &quot;clear and beautiful&quot; areas. </p>
<p>When I finally &quot;gave up&quot; and stopped washing my face so much my acne eventually cleared up. I would use the Acid soaps, special creams, tanning, picking, not picking, everything and anything. It wasn't until I just stopped that my face finally started healing. I won't lie, it did get worse before it got better. And it was hard.</p>
<p>Perhaps my experience was one of reaching adult age and it just going away, I dont know. My wife swears by the Charcoal Soap. It's black, has almost only charcoal in it and does seem to create nicer skin.</p>
<p>There is a bit of feeding the beast that happens when one washes their face. It starts with a break out, some hard cleaning, acid pads, feeling good, then waking up to a face that looks like it slept face down in pizza grease. The facial skin is like most parts, a self organized system. It knows all the oil had been stripped off and over produces. Hence the ever increasing oily face. If that's someone's experience then just stoo washing your face. A towel pat down once a day will work. Perhaps a light water rinse once a day.</p>
<p>Then we have the other cases where the face is infected, and each time something is popped it spreads. This requires antibiotics. And the will power to stop picking. Acne IS different then pimples. Sometimes we will get pimples with white heads that just go bloop when touched. Then there are the omg this hurts so much bumps that are swollen and red and full of crap. That's acne and it's a special kind of bacteria that shouldn't really be concentrated like that. It may require a good dermatologist. Acne needs medicine, break outs from Mensi can be dealt with by not over washing. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the beginning there was energy, then the universe expanded (and cooled) and energy condensed into matter (protons, neutrons, electrons, ...), then universe expanded even more (and cooled) and electrons and protons formed hydrogen. Hydrogen clumped together because of gravity and started to fuse into more complex atoms (helium, carbon, oxygen, iron, and so on, not necessarily in this order). Those large balls of fusing hydrogen are called stars. When stars start running out of hydrogen to fuse they explode as supernova and expel their newly created elements into the void. Those elements lump together because of gravity. Left over hydrogen forms stars again rest of the dust can form planets. Given enough time and favorable conditions this dust starts to react in complex reactions and these reactions can spark life. Life evolves into all shapes and forms until one peculiar shape realizes it is alive and starts to ask questions. It asks: &quot;what I am made of?&quot; and after thousands of years it figures out: &quot;Star dust.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to weigh in here since this subject relates closely with my area of research and there are many misconceptions (or rather partial truths) even among my fellow astrophysicists. </p>
<p>Stars are essentially element factories. They take lighter elements (hydrogen) and create heavier ones (helium, carbon, oxygen, etc....). This mostly happens in two different ways: Fusion and Neutron Capture.</p>
<p>Fusion is when two (or more) atomic nuclei fuse together to form a heavier nucleus. Our Sun is currently fusing hydrogen into helium. This process releases a lot of energy and is the source of all of our Sun's light. Once the hydrogen in the core is used up, it will start fusing the helium left over into carbon and oxygen. When this begins, the star will swell up into a red giant. Depending on the initial mass of the star, subsequent fusions may follow: H &gt; He &gt; C &gt; O &gt; Ne &gt; Si &gt; Fe. The more mass the star has, the further down the chain it can proceed. All the way up to iron. If a star was massive enough to fuse iron, it will then supernova once that fusion is complete. </p>
<p>Neutron Capture is the process by which a nucleus becomes heavier by the addition of neutrons creating an unstable isotope. This new unstable isotope then decays into a new, more stable element. This process can happen very rapidly when there are many neutrons available (r-process) or much slower when there are less neutrons available (s-process). During a supernova event, the abundance of neutrons allows the r-process to create a multitude of elements heavier than iron in its wake. However, this is where the misconceptions arise. This is not the only way to get elements heavier than iron. In old lower mass stars, the s-process is continuously chugging away creating heavier elements as well. About half the heavy elements are thought to be from the s-process. </p>
<p>Now that we have created all these new elements, how do they get out of the star? A supernova is one way. However, supernovae are quite rare since only the most massive stars die in such a way. The majority of stars die in a much less violent manner. Stars like our Sun will never supernova. Instead, they gently blow themselves apart during their late years. In the final red giant phase, these stars grow so big and unstable that material is blown off of the surface into space. This redistributes the new elements back into the galaxy, the result of which we call a planetary nebula (see Helix nebula for example). </p>
<p>The by-products of these dead stars (both supernovae remnants and planetary nebulae) eventually get dispersed through out the galaxy and will one day condense into a new forming solar system. Our solar system is estimated to contain elements created from over 60 different stars which came and died before us. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Someone calls about your credit card, hang up without an explanation and call the number printed on the back of your card.
Someone &quot;from the IRS&quot; calls you, hang up the IRS doesn't call you.
If the utility is threatening your service unless you pay up immediately, hang up and look up the number for the utility and call directly.
If you are actually in trouble with local law enforcement they'll be at your door not on your phone. Hung up.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Musk talks about there being 2 layers to the human mind at the moment, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system#Function" target="_blank">limbic system</a> (dealing with emotions, spatial awareness, regulating bodily functions etc), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex#Function" target="_blank">prefrontal cortex</a> (dealing with abstract thoughts and decision making).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He suggests a 3rd layer, plugged directly into your cortical neurons, to allow faster information transfer between your thoughts and the technology you use.</p>
</li>
<li>This doesn't necessarily require major brain surgery with your skull being sawed open. Musk suggests that, since neurons require a lot of blood flow, they are all connected to blood vessels which are in turn branching out from the blood vessels running through your neck. So in principle, a small procedure entering the jugular could open a highway to all your cortical neurons. There's not much detail beyond this in terms of how the link would actually be implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Musk says we already have access to a huge amount of information and abilities via the internet, but we're limited on bandwidth, especially our output speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can take in text/images/video with our eyes relatively quickly, but our ability to output data is severely limited to the speed at which we can type or click using our fingers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 3rd technological layer above the cortex which can communicate directly with a computer would allow us to greatly increase the connection speed between our thoughts and technology.</p>
</li>
<li>Musk says this will greatly improve humans' ability to think and communicate, and allow us to keep up better with AI in the future. Without such a neural interface, we will inevitably become so inferior to AI that we'll be basically a &quot;pet&quot;.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, I'd say don't think about practical applications now, think about what the world might be like in 20 or 50 years, and what the practical applications will be like <em>then</em>.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2017/02/post-scarcity.html" target="_blank">inevitable march of technological progress</a> eventually almost everything a human can do that's 'productive' is going to be automated. Our machines will do these jobs faster and better than we can, and for a lot of people who have spent their entire lives thinking of their job as a key part of their identity, that can be very scary. So, there's two ways we can approach this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;jobs are important&quot; way - Humans interacting with technology through things like typing or talking is incredibly slow, if we want to be able to &quot;compete&quot; with AI we're going to have to be able to interact a lot faster than that. If we can there's even a chance that human intelligence and machine intelligence will compliment each other and we can work together.</li>
<li>The &quot;jobs aren't important&quot; way - Think of yourself not as your body, and not even as your brain (which uses a lot of capacity just to move your body around and keep it alive), <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2017/01/probable-facts-about-human-consciousness.html" target="_blank">but as your conscious mind</a>. The world that we've evolved in and built for ourselves is great for the bodies we have, but we're also building entirely digital worlds where our biological bodies don't really fit in, but our conscious selves might fit right in. We just need to make that connection be our &quot;true selves&quot; and this new world we're building without letting all the slow messy bits of our body get in the way.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it comes down to three major differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unambiguous Clarity</strong> - Programming is very similar to the arts, like music is used to express what we hear, paintings are used to express what we see, programming is used to express behavior. Programmers are forced to produce lines that express instructions that cannot be interpreted any other way. This helps in other thinking because it ensures precise language and programmers tend to focus on detail others wouldn't (which you can say is either good or bad, but different definitely).</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction</strong> - In programming you are constantly using this concept of abstraction, or the ability to figure out the &quot;overall pattern&quot; from a few concrete examples. The ELI5 example of abstraction is if you show someone how to tie a shoe, they now can use the knot to tie any two strings together, they have abstracted the idea of the knot to apply in other situations. Programmers do this all the time with the creation of functions, things to help them do their job more efficiently. This skill allows programmers to think about the world differently, and usually they can pull from their past experiences in other disciplines to help them in entirely unrelated areas.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence to overcome difficult tasks</strong> - This is the trait I look for the most when finding who is teachable at work. Most people draw a line in the sand when it comes to technology that they are willing to learn and what they think is too challenging for themselves. For some people, it's as soon as you talk about math, for the general population the line is as soon as you look at something called &quot;code,&quot; for some programmers, it becomes what people call &quot;back-end code,&quot; etc. What I think separates most programmers from the general population is the willingness to cross that line of what you feel comfortable with, and get deeper and deeper into technology. A lot of people quit at the moment when technology becomes challenging. Back when I went to college at a respected school for programming (about 10 years ago), the first year drop out rate for Computer Science was over 50%. That's half of the people who considered themselves programmers decided it wasn't for them because they couldn't overcome the first hurdles. But for those that have stuck with it, this is what I find the most common among us, we all have some internal drive to constantly push ourselves out of the realm of problems we've solved before to new problems that might be difficult, but we have the confidence to know we can solve the problems.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing is break down problems and do things step by step.  When people ask me how to program I ask them to explain to me how to make a cup of tea.</p>
<p>They start with put tea bag in cup.  Boil water.  Pour water in cup.  Add milk and sugar (the filthy animals).</p>
<p>I ask them to break it down more.  This is where some people get confused.  </p>
<p>Take tea bag out of box.  Take cup out of cupboard.  Place Tea bag in cup.  Fill kettle with water.  Boil water.  Pour water into cup.  Wait.  Get milk from fridge.  Pour milk into cup.  Get sugar.   Get tea spoon.  Put tea spoon of sugar into cup.  Still cup with tea spoon.</p>
<p>Now things get interesting.  I ask them to describe it in more detail again.  Eventually they cant think of anything but I'll ask them to describe what muscles they use, to press the button on the kettle, to turn the tap on after placing the kettle under it etc etc.  At this stage you can also describe differences with programming languages.  Assembly code describes each muscle, each exact location of the objects.  C/C++ describes the draws and objects to get and where to place them, Java less items, Python even less etc etc.   </p>
<p>Some people say things like boil water while putting tea bag in cup.  This is a great analogy to multithreading.  However its best to describe the process in the most singular way.  Sure you can boil the water while putting a tea bag in the cup but you don't know exactly when it has boiled.  So you need to insert waiting times etc.</p>
<p>I firmly believe anyone can learn to program but then I look at how some people make tea.  If they haven't made that process even remotely efficient after 30 years I doubt their code would be much good either.  Still, its just thinking every step through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest lesson in thinking differently comes from debugging. It really humbles you.</p>
<p>A common scenario is going over the same piece of code that is creating a bug, but being absolutely certain that everything you wrote is correct. <em>There is no bug in my code. The computer is messed up somehow</em> is a thought I have over and over again even though I know it's crazy.</p>
<p>Then after staring for ages, you have this epiphany feeling when you realize where the problem was. When it's not a typo, it's usually due to a subtle assumption you made about how a function works that wasn't true, but totally changed everything.</p>
<p>Nowadays when I'm SURE I'm right about something, but someone disagrees with me (a moral or political opinion, for example), I'm very suspicious of that feeling of certainty. Instead, just as when I code, I learned to view my understanding of topics as provisional (especially when there are a lot of moving parts) and aware of the fact that there might be <em>unknown unknowns</em> - problems in my reasoning that I didn't think to check, maybe didn't even realize could exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main difference is in problem solving; I believe coding is more deconstructionist than any other profession. Coding forces two things on you; organising an action into its basic individual movements, and writing them down with excruciating precision. That gives you the view that a lot of dynamics can be explained in chains of understandable parts. But the main part of time spent coding is actually not writing the code. That is maybe a third of it. The main part is debugging; trying to understand how what you wrote works with its environment and where that goes wrong. It is extremely detail-oriented. When the car of a programmer breaks, he will never stop at 'the engine doesn't run well', figuratively speaking. He will persist until he had found out which spark plug has a bent lead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans rely heavily on something called heuristics. Basically, if you solved a problem before using a set of actions, then using those set of actions again on a similar problem would probably work. It's not precise, but it's quick. For hunter-gatherer animals, thinking quick is the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Computers do not use heuristics. They use algorithms. Algorithms are slower than heuristics, they are more specific in scope than heuristics, and they always give you the right solution (so long as the parameters given are accurate). </p>
<p>So, coming up with an algorithm (a solution that works every time, and encompasses all reasonable use cases) is much harder than coming up with a heuristic. The advantage, however, is that you only have to solve the problem once. Once it's solved, the computer can execute it fast and repeatedly. In computer science, we have a saying: &quot;You either do a task one time, or many times.&quot; This means that if you're going to do something more than once, then you build it in such a way that it can be re-used an indefinite number of times.</p>
<p>A computer scientist has to think like a computer. Basically, we have to break every action, no matter how simple, into its basic atomic parts. Then, when we code it, we have to test it extensively from different angles. Can it handle these special exception cases? What if the user does something so stupid we can't even fathom it? </p>
<p>Most programmers today use frameworks, which are basically libraries of code that allow us to not have to reinvent the wheel. Such as using AJAX to dynamically populate a table of data. It's something that can actually be quite exhausting to do in code if you're just using straight JavaScript, but using a framework like VueJS lets you do it with just a few commands. Problem with that approach, however, is that the programmer still needs to know what is happening &quot;under the hood,&quot; or else fall prey to unintended bugs.</p>
<p>So, basically, what a few other people said: a good computer scientist is required to deconstruct even the simplest task in order to tell the computer how to do things. We have to think consistently logically, and that effects how we think outside of our coding, as well. The jury is definitely out on whether people are just born with the types of brains needed to think like a computer scientist or if it is learned (or how it is learned). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brain isn't &quot;doing&quot; anything in that sense besides sending and receiving neural signals. Let's take the bending of your arm for example. An overly simplified explanation of how that works is the brain fires a signal down the nerve that is connected to the muscle. At the nerve-muscle connection, various processes occur that cause the muscle to contract and raise your arm (depolarization of cellular membranes, release of calcium ions from the the sarcoplasmic reticulum, attachment of myosin to actin, etc.). All your brain had to do though is fire a signal. It doesn't need to know or understand the steps that happen downstream. </p>
<p>An analogy would be to turning on a television. You control the power for the television. When you want to turn it on, you press the power button. Does the fact that you push the power button mean you intrinsically know exactly how the TV is turning on? Just because you know &quot;to turn the TV on I push this button&quot; doesn't mean you understand all of the computers, wires, and electrical signals that actually cause the TV to turn on.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The map is able to represent roads and mountains fairly accurately, and you know how to use the map to get somewhere, but the map doesn't tell you what mountains are made of or how roads are made, or what these actually look like in reality - it's just a tool you can use to navigate.
Similarly, your brain doesn't represent true reality, it just takes a select few stimuli and creates a map of the world that you experience as consciousness and it allows you to move limbs and think so that you can survive. There is no need for the brain to inherently understand what an atom is or how muscle contraction works in order to survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're missing is the difference between automatic and voluntary processes. You don't consciously tell your heart to beat or your eyes to focus or your stomach to digest food. All of that happens adjacent to human consciousness. If you do force your body to act outside of its normal happy place, it simply cuts you out of the equation. Hold your breath or otherwise screw up your breathing on purpose, and you will just pass out while normal automatic processes take over. In a sense, we are piloting a plane on autopilot, not moving every single part needed to maintain safe flight. We might tell the flight computer where we want to go, but we don't make the adjustments it takes to change course.</p>
<p>We are our brains. We are every automatic process that makes up alive. But how we know what we are is as much philosophical as it is scientific.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, our brain does &quot;know&quot; how our bodies work, its just that we aren't consciously aware of that knowledge at all times. The brain is not a monolith, there are different regions of the brain which engage in different functions. The parts of the brain which control bodily functions are predominantly the lower brain, which is no more advanced than the neural networks we see in primitive creatures like worms and crabs. It simply does not operate on a conscious level and is automatic and reflexive in nature. Most higher order thinking occurs in the upper regions of the brain, which operates in a much different manner than the lower brain. </p>
<p>Think of it this way, say the regions of the brain each have their own language. The lower brain deals with an entirely different subject matter than the upper brain and speaks an entirely different language. The signals being sent out by the lower brain are so different from the ones in the upper brain that the upper brain is unable to &quot;translate&quot; them to a form in which it could be fully conscious of.  And the upper brain is unable to send signals to the lower brain which would fully translate in a way to significantly alter their function. They just operate differently. That is why your body doesn't shut down if you pass out or fall asleep. </p>
<p>And if you want another explanation, the lower brain really doesn't &quot;know&quot; all of what it does. It is mostly automatic, kind of like when a moth is attracted to light. It is something which is beyond its own control, a reflex that occurs naturally. It is simply wired differently from the other parts of your brain which control consciousness. It's the same reason why your toaster can't play video games on it and why your smart phone can't heat up pop tarts. Even though they are both machines, they are wired in entirely different ways and perform entirely different functions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In most cases bleeding can be managed with administration of fluids, blood transfusions and correction of any underlying coagulopathy. However, some organs can bleed profusely if injured. If the spleen and its capsule are ruptured we do a splenectomy. If a lobe of the liver is lacerated we do a hepatic lobectomy. If a major vessel (aorta or vena cava) is bleeding we do an exploratory laparotomy and ligate/suture the bleed. If a non-vital organ like the urterus is bleeding they can also do embolization. This is where they go in with a catheter and artificially induce a clot upstream from the bleed. It leads to necrosis of the tissue and isn't ideal, but it can save the patient from bleeding to death. Surgery and other invasive procedures are not without risk, and at the end of the day it's a risk/benefit calculation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They also use staples that are non toxic and are designed to have tissue grow over them. Sometimes if bowl is affected by the penetrating injury then they follow all 20+ feet of it, called running the bowel, cut what is torn (messed up jagged edges;hard to line up for healing) so they cut the part that is affected then bring them side by side like so (II) then they staple them together so it looks like PI then the cut a hole at the bottom section to rest a new opening and then they suture it. Sometimes if the bleeding can not be controlled but the patient is stable then they irrigate the abdomen and will pack it with gauze at the bleeding site waiting for a clot to form. Then a big plastic film is placed on the opening (kind of like Saran Wrap but it's sterile) and the patient is taken to the ICU. There he will stay until its stable enough to bring the patient back in to the OR to go back in and hope the clot formed and they can close him (by close I mean bring his chest/abdomen cavity together). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to assume you are talking about something like school workstations or business/office laptops. </p>
<p>While true that there is a factor to defending against brute force attacks. These computers also tend to be part of a network where a single server has all the username and password stored. When you login, it will connect to the network and check with this server if your password is valid. Once confirms that it is a match, it stores this password temporarily on your computer. Now you're able to use the computer.</p>
<p>So the next time you login with the <strong>correct password</strong>, it doesn't connect to the network, it just quickly checks if it matches the locally stored copy of the password. If it matches, you're good to use the computer. Because the speed it takes to check for a match on the computer is essentially processing speed, it feels almost instant.</p>
<p>Now, lets say you type in the <strong>wrong password</strong>, what happens next? Well, it <em>still</em> checks with the locally stored copy, except this time, it <strong>doesn't match</strong>. So, since it doesn't match, <strong>one of two things must be true</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your password is truly wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>Your password is actually correct, but the temporary copy stored on the computer is not up to date since the last time it connected.</li>
</ol>
<p>So it connects to the network server and checks. This extra step is what most people associate with the wrong password taking much longer, and especially exaggerated when the quality of the connection is slow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For username/password pairs stored in databases, a common (although inefficient) way to check for correct username/password is to send a query to the database like this: &quot;get me the record where username is 'x' AND password is 'y'&quot;. (For those familiar with SQL: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?) The database first searches for usernames that match 'x' until one is found, then checks if the password for that record is equal to 'y'. The problem is that if the username matches, but password doesn't, it will continue looking for another username/password combo that does match, until it runs out of records in the database. For databases with TONS of records, this takes a long time.</p>
<p>To cover my ass on this comment, let me reiterate that this situation applies to poorly coded applications and poor database configurations, but lets face it, there are a TON of those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
