		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is both kind of yes and kind of no.</p>
<p>Compared to electricity, the answer is generally a &quot;no&quot;, since with electricity it's not really a technology limitation but rather just girth of the wire, insulation, heat tolerance, and stuff like that.</p>
<p>That said, Ethernet cable has improved over time. You can look at this wikipedia page for an example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair</a> . Also note that while that Ethernet technology has improved over time, that is not really the bottleneck for what has increased internet speeds. It's more-so general infrastructure and routing stations themselves that route all the traffic, and/or their use of a technology like fiber optic cables and switches.</p>
<p>Generally speaking the cable visually looks the same since it's still almost always Ethernet (although some providers may provide it via a coaxial cable line), but it does have better noise isolation and other stuff improving the speed it can operate at. The computers itself also need to support the faster speed, and is actually the most critical component in the line; while even very old computers have the same Ethernet ports as the newest computers, their network controllers will only tolerate a much slower max speed (this is the same sort of principle in ISPs having faster/slower service). This even applies to routers/switches/hubs, which means if you have an old router but a new PC, the router could be the bottleneck. Usually the ISP is the bottleneck though (aside from wireless scenarios) since their speeds are frequently 10–1000 times slower than the speed that your Ethernet cable can operate at.</p>
<p>In addition, fiber-optic cables can transfer data much faster than Ethernet, but generally that's only used between data centers, and/or distribution hubs, not to the end user.</p>
<p>The two things they do both generally have in common is rating/capability for the end-devices themselves. For power this is frequently a voltage requirement (which is both a min and a max), and potentially also it's ability to dissipate heat such that it doesn't overheat (which really isn't an input spec, but it will still change the amount of power it can take). For network, as was already mentioned different devices support different speeds, such as 1 gigabit per second (common but not especially new specification, been around for a good 15 years for consumers) or 10 megabits per second (really old)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dont like a lot of the answers already given, so ill give it a shot... </p>
<p>There are 4 main types of carriers for internet. Coax, fiber, copper (what most people have in their walls for internet), and wireless. each of these has standards and limitations. I will order this in the order that most people use.</p>
<p>So, first off we have wireless. There have already been many wifi standards (802.11-b,g,n, and now different flavors of 802.11-ac). Each came with a speed or range increase, as well as more advance technologies such as channel hopping, beam forming antennas, and different algorithms to handle higher traffic and interference. Each subsequent upgrade to wifi constituted a different type of cable as you put it. often times a card that was designed for 802.11-g will not work with newer standards such as 802.11-n, unless it was made RIGHT before the standard was finalized. Wifi also utilizes two frequency ranges. 2.4ghz and 5ghz. if b,g,n, and AC are different amperage rated cables, than 2.4 and 5 ghz are like having different wall plugs. Even if a vendor released firmware to upgrade a 2.4 ghz wifi card to work with a newer 2.4ghz standard, there would be no way to release an update to make a 2.4 ghz card work with 5ghz, since the hardware just isnt there. (as a side note, a firmware upgrade is theoretically possible, but i have never seen it done. most of the time the wifi cards use a chip that is only meant for certain standards)</p>
<p>wifi has a lot of info about it. i will pass on it here since you asked specifically for internet <em>cables</em>. if your interested, reply and ill expand.</p>
<hr />
<p>next up we have good old copper. most of the time the copper is terminated with rj-45 connectors, however this is not always the case. ill touch on that at the end of this section. when you buy an ethernet cable, it normally has an associated standard with it. You might be familiar with cat5, cat5e, cat6, or cat6a (though they continue to go higher to cat7 and cat8). Each of these standards defines characteristics about the cable that the network ports care about, and ultimately define the throughput that is possible. this includes the inductance and impedance at a certain frequency, as well as dc resistance, and capacitance. The most important ones though are going to be the impedance at the desired frequency, and the twists per inch on the cable. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable#/media/File:CAT5e_Cable.jpg" target="_blank">twists</a> in the cable help to remove noise from other electronics, since having a long straight cable acts like an antenna. The frequency the transmitter and receiver operate at ultimately dictates the throughput, since a higher frequency means more data is possible to send. (for more on this, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem" target="_blank">Shannon Hartley theorem</a>). now, lets cover the standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cat5 had a terribly low frequency of 100mhz, and a similar data throughput of 100mbps.  cat5e reduced the crosstalk more, and kept the 100mhz frequency, and was able to achieve 1000mbps speed (1gbps). this is what most older homes built after late 2001 are wired with, normally for phone as well! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cat6 now brings us the ability to transmit at 10gbps for 55m runs and gigabit for 100m runs. to achieve this the frequency that the transmission is done at was raised to 250mhz. later a slightly different standards called cat6a was brought out that increased the frequency to 500mhz and allows 10gbps transmissions at 100m runs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cat 7 and cat 8 are a mess... originally cat7 was specced out to support 10gbps at 100m runs, however the cat6a standard was introduced that supported this. cat 7 required wrapping each twisted pair with shielding, which increased the cost, as well as defining a different connector to be used optionally (the gg45, or the TERA connector). the cable was specced to run at 600mhz. Later cat7a came out which was meant to up the throughput to 40gbps, however by that time a standard for 40gbps over copper came out, which defined 2000mhz as the transmission frequency, so cat 7a was scrapped in favor of cat8. </p>
<ul>
<li>cat 7 was never really used, other than maybe if someone pushed hard to wire a home for future proofing... cat 8 isnt used in home of office installs, and is mainly used in data centers for short run cables*.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you will probably never touch ethernet cables beyond cat6a. I would bet money that all the equipment in your home maxes out at 1gbps. if you bought an expensive router or switch that does support 10gbps copper, and put a pci 10gbps network card in your computer, you could probably achieve 10gbps over the wiring you have, assuming its cat6 / cat6a though. also, the footnote for cat 8... the articles i read in fact checking myself specified that cat8 has two classes, one for the 8 pin 'rj45' connector, as well as a class for the TERA / gg45 connector. i personally have never seen these. most data centers will use sfp+ for 10gbps and qsfp for 40gbps. these are normally used for fiber, however you CAN get very short run (&lt;5ft) copper patch cables that are terminated with sfp+ / qsfp connectors that can hit 10 or 40 gbps throughput. if i had to take a guess i would assume they are using cat8 cable for this.</p>
<hr />
<p>next up is coax. this is most likely what you have coming in from your ISP and going into your modem. coax allows for longer runs of cable without repeaters compared to rj45... but fiber takes the cake. ill get to that next. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable#/media/File:RG-59.jpg" target="_blank">heres an example of coax</a>. coax uses that inner copper wire for transmission, the white plastic is called a dialectric and acts to insulate the inner data cable from the outer copper jacket. that acts as the ground, but also as shielding to reduce the noise on the signal wire. lastly there is isolation on the outside of the cable. The biggest factor for coax is the wire impedance. In the US, most coax is rg-6 and uses 75 ohm impedance. for ethernet over coax, there are 5 standards called docsis that were defined. docsis1, 1.1, 2, 3, 3.1, and 3.1 with full duplex. the following table from wikipedia defines out what the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1.0   1997    40 Mbit/s(down)     10 Mbit/s(up)   Initial release</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.1   2001    40 Mbit/s(down)     10 Mbit/s(up)   Added VOIP capabilities, standardized the DOCSIS 1.0 QoS mechanisms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.0   2002    40 Mbit/s(down)     30 Mbit/s(up)   Enhanced upstream data rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3.0   2006    1.2 Gbit/s(down)    200 Mbit/s(up)  Significantly increased downstream/upstream data rates, introduced support for IPv6, introduced channel bonding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3.1   2013    10 Gbit/s(down)     1–2 Gbit/s(up)  Significantly increased downstream/upstream data rates, restructured channel specifications</p>
</li>
<li>3.1 Full Duplex   2017    10 Gbit/s(down)     10 Gbit/s(up)   Introduces support for fully symmetrical speeds</li>
</ul>
<p>The speed increases, like with copper, came from higher frequency channels that narrowed in their bandwidth, allowing for more channels to be carried over one wire. The current docsis standard still uses rj-45 however higher frequency signaling can increase throughput beyond what is currently supported. in doing so, one would need to utilize a  cable that is better suited for higher frequencies (such as lmr-195). I dont see this happening though, since most infrastructure is going to fiber now.</p>
<hr />
<p>alright, last one, fiber optics. Fiber is the only cable that doesn't need to be upgraded assuming you go with the right one. there are two main types of fiber, single mode and multi mode. Multi mode is cheaper, and uses a larger diameter optical channel. this allows the light to bounce around more, so there is more loss. multi mode is normally used in short runs in data centers, since the cabling and transmitter / receiver modules can be cheaper. single mode is utilized for very long runs, its much smaller optical channel allows the light to go a lot further without bouncing, reducing the signal attenuation. once you have single mode fiber ran, to increase your throughput, you just have to replace the sending and receiving equipment on both ends to accommodate a new standard. Most fiber is rated with OC-n specification, where the n is some number that represents the throughput as (51.84Mbps * n). This is mainly used from a telcom stand point. in most data centers its just refereed to as single mode or multi mode... or more commonly by its end connector and color, since the color denotes the cable standard (such as OM1, 2, 3, or 4 for multi mode fiber) for instance, all my fiber is aqua lc-lc cable (OM4, with lc connectors on both ends). Fiber is surprisingly cost effective. To do a 10gbps home network, it would be more cost effective to run multi mode fiber, if the cat6/a is not already ran. This is mainly due to the price of the pci cards and switch gear in comparison to 10gbps copper. OM4 multi mode can support 10 Gigabit Ethernet at lengths up 550 meters and it supports 100 Gigabit Ethernet at lengths up to 150 meters. The only tricky thing about fiber is there is an extra piece of equipment in line. You might have noticed i mentioned SFP+ and qsfp previously, but did not mention that at all when talking about fiber. a fiber switch has holes in it for modules (such as sfp, sfp+, or qsfp). you can then buy a module for that switch that has the right connector for the fiber on it. you plug the fiber into that. <a href="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1ozK_HVXXXXXYXFXXq6xXFXXXs/2-sfp-port-4-ethernet-port-poe-fiber-switch.jpg" target="_blank">here is an example image</a></p>
<p>feel free to ask any questions. im currently running 10gbps sfp+ fiber in my apartment, so i have a good bit of hands on experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most internet traffic travels over fiber optic cables, using lasers.  They keep finding ways to send more data over these fiber optic links.  The amount of data they send depend upon the method used and length of the link.  Some travel thousand of kilometers.  The highest commercially available now is 600Gbps for a given wavelength of light, and they send many wavelengths in a fiber to increase capacity. </p>
<p>Most people then get their internet access in their homes via copper wire pairs (DSL) or coax (DOCSIS, or cable) which carries internet the last mile or so.  Even here, they find ways to increase capacity every couple of years.  If your lucky you'll get fiber to your home, but this is expensive (ask Google about that).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NO, while often electricity is involved cables that deliver power and &quot;internet&quot; accomplish much different tasks. </p>
<p>Data lines and power lines are designed to accomplish different tasks. Power cables are designed to send electrons to and from a source and destination.  The major issues with power is that the higher the current the more heat generated in which expands the conductor. If you look closely you will see power cables droop during extreme peak usage (mostly summer heat waves or winter cold snaps).  If you need to move more power you need a thicker conductor. </p>
<p>While some methods for transmitting data does use electricity, increasing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput" target="_blank">Throughput</a> doesn't require more power but the ability to manipulate and monitor the manipulation the medium that it is sent. There are many different mediums and variations of those mediums.  Copper is pretty inexpensive to deploy and maintain for short distances,  Fiber while expensive and delicate is not susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference" target="_blank">interference</a> (and a few other other problems) like copper is, so it is better for long haul connections.  The RF spectrum has loads of downsides that I'd rather not attempt to list. </p>
<p>As for an &quot;internet port&quot; I'm assuming you really mean the &quot;Ethernet&quot; port,  currently most computers are sold with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet#1000BASE-T" target="_blank">1000BASE-T</a> ethernet ports (commonly refered to as &quot;gigabit ethernet&quot;) that already is faster than what most ISP's are willing to deliver to residential customers. If for some reason you need more throughput than it can deliver there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Gigabit_Ethernet" target="_blank">10 Gigabit</a> Ethernet available, but that exceeds the speed of most desktop's storage.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ok, so essentially there are two &quot;steps.&quot; Step 1 - as soon as you load up the page with CAPTCHA, a TON of info gets sent to to Google. IP address, browser information, all your mouse movements, etc.</p>
<p>Then, all that gets fed into their proprietary machine learning algorithm. Google keeps secret what information the algorithm pulls in and looks at. We do know that tracking and anlyzing mouse movements is one of the things it does.</p>
<p>Based on that, if it thinks you are human, you just get the checkbox and you get to move on. If the algorithm still isn't sure, that's when you get to step 2, the second request to do the picture matching. You don't have to get the pictures perfectly right, because again, while you are doing it, it's also tracking everything else, like mouse movements and click rates and such. Until the secret algorithm is satisfied that you're not a robot. </p>
<p>Bonus info: once Google decides you are human, you get a unique token representing your log in attempt. Then, you provide that token to the website you are logging into. The website then takes that token and independently checks with Google to see if that login attempt was successful. Google confirms and you are then let into the website.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Really it has nothing to do with the 'click' and everything to do with what happens before that. The way your cursor moves across the screen. If it immediately snaps to the box in a perfectly straight line then it's definitely a bot. Same with perfect curves. Human mouse movement, when you look very closely, is erratic and imperfect and that's quite hard to replicate with mathematical functions. </p>
<p>Edit: so a lot of people have pointed out they're also checking cookies, Google account, headers etc. for a history of bot-like activity. And yes, while you could record human mouse movement and replay it, I doubt it would work more than once, and identical movement to a previous attempt is just as suspicious.

Anything else (typing in the fuzzy word, &quot;click all squares with a shopfront&quot;, etc) is just you helping to train their machine learning to recognise the images.</p>
<p>You can test this if you get a CAPTCHA that gives multiple challenges in a row, often, if you pass the first one successfully (the actual test), you can do the following ones slightly incorrectly and it will still pass you, because it doesn't know the answer itself, you're telling what the correct answer is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>firstly theres no actual cash being stored anywhere, nor would any physical cash change hands in such a deal</p>
<p>when they say &quot;cash offer&quot; they just mean regular money in an account, and not any asset trading. </p>
<p>comcast isnt just keeping $60B in accounts sitting either. they likely have them invested in short term things or just stuff they can liquidate quickly. </p>
<p>all companies keep a stash of fairly liquid investments incase they need it. </p>
<p>comcast likely prepared and gatherered that amount of cash over time in preparation for their bid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Comcast only has about $5 billion in cash.  They secured bank commitments to provide loans to support their $60 billion offer for Fox.   The way this works is they hold confidential meetings with the banks to make sure the loans are available before announcing their bid for Fox.  Comcast has annual earnings of about $15B, so a $60B loan against that business is not all that absurd. So, if the Fox shareholders accept the Comcast proposal then the deal will close with Comcast's banks wiring $60B to the Fox shareholders, Comcast then owns all of Fox's shares and the combined company now has a $60B debt load that they will pay down by gouging you on Internet Access fees and selling your privacy data to Russia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The &quot;all cash&quot; is just to differentiate it from a &quot;cash + equity (stock)&quot; offer in that Fox shareholders are receiving cash for their shares instead of stock in Comcast.</p>
<p>For company that do keep a lot of cash around, usually only what they need in the next month or two is actually kept as cash, and depending on the size of the company may be spread over many, many accounts in many territories. A lot of the rest is kept as &quot;cash equivalents&quot;, basically short-term, highly liquid investments that have very low risk to lose value, for example CDs, commerical paper, money market funds, treasury bills etc.  Many companies also keep a portion of their cash (especially cash that they think they won't need within a year) in longer term financial investments, which is usually classified as investments held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, depending on the type of financial instrument.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gangstalking is a particular manifestation of paranoid schizophrenia.  Specifically, that &quot;everybody is out to get me&quot;.</p>
<p>The internet has enabled paranoid schizophrenics to network, sharing and reinforcing their delusion.  This has resulted in a fairly standardized presentation with shared terminology and perceived tactics.</p>
<p>The &quot;targets&quot; of gangstalking believe that they are the target of a <em>vast</em> conspiracy.  So vast that literally every person they see or talk to is a member.  This conspiracy expends vast amounts of time and money to, say, beam intrusive thoughts into their heads with top secret technology; frame them for crimes; break into their homes to tamper with things; and generally annoy them in extremely petty ways.  For example, it's common to believe that multiple people will pass them, each saying one syllable of a slur.</p>
<p>Here's a &quot;comic&quot; that explains gangstalking from the perspective of a victim:  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/timirrors/targ" target="_blank">Targ the Target</a>.  Edit: Because a lot of people have been confused, I want to be clear.  <em>Targ the Target</em> is not a parody or a description of the condition from the outside.  It's written by a woman who suffers from the delusion, and is 100% serious.  Targ appears to be a composite of herself and other sufferers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The shape of the orbit is determined based only on the planet's center of mass. Even a theoretical egg-shaped planet or something with a more extreme shape (like a space station) only orbits based on its center of mass.</p>
<p>That center of mass has may have changed within the earth over the past 335 million years, but this change has not affected the orbit because of the law of conservation of momentum; any motion within the system does not affect the trajectory of the entire combined system.</p>
<p>Even if there was a massive explosion and the planet cracked in half, the center of mass of the combined two halves of the planet would continue on the same trajectory as the center of mass of the once-whole planet.</p>
<p>Because of conservation of momentum, the only way to change our planet's trajectory (or any trajectory) is to eject mass out into space. If we were to hurl a continent out into space, conservation of momentum states that the trajectory of the center of mass of the planet+continent must remain the same... but we don't care about the continent any more. The center of mass of the planet will change trajectory from the planet+continent system.</p>
<p>This is how rockets work to change their trajectory; they eject mass (exhaust) into space. The center of mass of the rocket + exhaust does not change trajectory, but the trajectory of the rocket alone does. We just don't care any more about the rocket exhaust flying out towards deep space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;pigeons&quot;, you mean feral pigeons: these are pigeons that were kept and raised by humans as racing pigeons or even pets, and escaped or never came home; and their descendants. When they went feral, they tended to live in cities: they weren't afraid of humans, and the tall buildings were naturally attractive to them as they were bred from rock doves which nest on cliff-faces. Since their young grow up in that environment, they are similarly not afraid of humans: humans are just these creatures that they see all the time and which usually ignore them -- some of them even throw some food their way.</p>
<p>Sparrows that grow up in cities can also lose their fear of humans: even ones that grow up in small towns can become quite cheeky. In some cities, you actually have to be careful where you tread, because you're seriously in danger of stepping on a sparrow.</p>
<p>Even in the country wild birds can become very familiar with humans. I live in central Europe, and blue tits and great tits (don't laugh, they really are called that) are regular garden visitors. Although they'll take flight if a human suddenly appears, a few of them return immediately and feel perfectly safe feeding mere feet or even inches away.</p>
<p>European robins (a completely different species to the various species of robin native to North America) are an interesting case. On the European continent they were once actually hunted, but in Britain hunting robins was discouraged because they eat garden pests. Thanks to that, British robins are rather less shy than robins on the continent, and will frequently perch somewhere where somebody is digging in the garden, ready to swoop down if he unearths some tasty treat.</p>
<p>And if you're really very patient and a bit lucky, you can get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAP_-X011wI" target="_blank">some of these birds</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxdxf-RnzGE" target="_blank">eat out of your hand</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sparrows and robins are prey animals even in the suburbs, so they're a bit skittish if you get too close.  They're heavily hunted by predatory birds and a few straggler land predators like cats and coyotes that have managed to persist in human occupied areas.</p>
<p>They're definitely <em>not</em> very afraid of humans though, they'll approach pretty close if you have food and have no issue with building nests and raisng hatchlings five feet from your den.</p>
<p>Pigeons (specifically the rock doves that successfully nest in bridges and skyscrapers) once had the same predatory pressure, but their great success in our predator-free major cities has made them more fearless over the generations.</p>
<p>Their close suburban relative the mourning dove is a favorite snack among hawks and isn't so brave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>European Robins don't have much of a fear of humans, they are wary of humans, but if you talk or sing to them nicely they will come to you, they are very clever and can learn to trust individual humans. </p>
<p>Pigeons are panicky birds but get use to humans if fed often, they are very much group birds and do what the other pigeons do. They can make a whistling noise with their wings to signal panic, if one pigeon panics and makes the sound the group will usually flee without question.</p>
<p>The Pigeons in the city get use to humans but will still evaluate your behaviour, they can learn to recognise hostile and friendly actions as well as humans that they know by sight. Because they are a big group bird they evaluate individuals more than the paired birds do.</p>
<p>Birds like European Magpies and small song birds are terrified of humans because people would capture them to eat them(Magpie) or to hear them sing(songbirds).</p>
<p>The birds who survived to witness others being captured taught their offspring to fear humans, this eventually became a trait in the birds and now these birds are all naturally very afraid of humans.</p>
<p>Individual birds though have different personalities, I've had a wild magpie say hello and I've sang a duet with a blackbird, so as a species they are different, groups can be different and so can individuals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I teach social work at Portland State University and internal medicine at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland, Oregon.  There's a lot of talk about autism in children, but not as much about autism among adults.  That's why we just launched this new academic journal. Our goal is to cover the most pressing issues affecting autistic adults, from emerging adulthood to later life. I am particularly excited about including autistic adults in our new journal - as editorial board members, authors, reviewers and readers. As a doctor and a services researcher, my own research is focused on how people on the autism spectrum can get better access to health care services. Many autistic adults don't get the health care they need, resulting in more health problems and shorter life expectancy.  Ask me anything about the new journal or the ways that people on the autism spectrum can get better care. </p>
<p>We'll be on at 1 p.m. Pacific (4 PM ET, 21 UT), we're looking forward to the session!</p></div></div>

Slumping over stretches out the ligaments in the spine and over time they deform in order support your spine better.  When you force yourself to have good posture, these connective ligaments are being compressed and that feels uncomfortable.  But if you keep up the good posture, they will reform to a more compact state and standing straight will be easier.

<p>&quot;Overall “skin–iron odor” mechanism: The metallic odor from iron contacting skin is surprisingly a type of human body odor. Sweaty skin corrodes iron metal to form reactive Fe2+ ions that are oxidized within seconds to Fe3+ ions while simultaneously reducing and decomposing existing skin lipidperoxides to odorous carbonyl hydrocarbons that are perceived as a metallic odor. This fast reaction creates the sensory illusion that it is the “metal in itself” that we smell right after touching it. Similar mechanisms underlie the skin–metal odors of iron, copper, and brass (<a href="https://application.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc_2002/2006/z602100_s.pdf" target="_blank">Supporting Information</a> ) used as every‐day objects. &quot;</p>
<p>Basically, it's the different chemicals from our skin/sweat etc reacting with the metals. The metals don't smell-- we do!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Something has to touch the metal before you can smell it on your fingers. This is because the oxide coating is dissolved into your skin's oils and lipid tissues. In some cases like silver, the oxide layer can't even be smelled. This is as silver oxide isn't as soluble, and silver is also antibacterial, removing any organic molecules that can carry the smell on your skin. I believe that all martensitic, ferritic and austenitic steels are able to be detected by scent. This concept also applies to zinc and copper oxide groups.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, any color screen could be used. However, there are a number of reasons why green is preferable over other colors.</p>
<p>First is the nature of the subjects in front of the screen. In most scenes with a green screen (or the more technical term: chroma keying), humans are the main subjects in the scene. Humans tend to have very little green in their skin or their clothing, which makes it easier to replace the background without accidentally replacing part of the subject.</p>
<p>Another reason is more technical in nature. Digital sensors don't record R, G and B with the same level of detail. This is by design. A pixel in a digital sensor can only capture the total light intensity. In order to capture color detail, each pixel is fitted with a filter that only lets a certain color through. So you'll have red pixels, green pixels and blue pixels. A full color image, where every pixel can have a full range of colors, is reconstructed using this limited information. Since human vision is more sensitive to green than to other colors, the commonly used approach is to divide the sensor into blocks of 2x2 pixels and giving 2 of them a green filter, and the other 2 are used for red and blue. This is called a Bayer filter.</p>
<p>Because of this, the raw image data contains more green information than red or blue. That means that green features will have a higher resolution. Since the quality of chroma keying is very much affected by how accurate you can record the edge between the foreground subjects and the background screen, the increased resolution of the green channel allows for more accurate cutouts of the background.</p>
<p>Note that in the time of analog film, blue screens were more common, since the chemical properties of analog film resulted in a higher level of detail (reduced grain) for blue elements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The green screen needs to be as different as possible from the human skin color for best results. Human skin is orange, which is a combination of yellow and red. So yellow and red would be bad choices, as the computer would not just remove the background, but also the similarly colored humans.</p>
<p>Purple is a combination of blue and red, so again, there a common color with the human skin tone (red).</p>
<p>That leaves green and blue, none of which can be found in human skin. Both are used in special effects but green is used more often.</p>
<p>Digital camera sensors record more detail in greens than in blues, as there are twice as many green photocites than blue or red. Therefore, you get a more detailed background removal if you use green. But when characters have to be wearing green clothes for example, you can use blue.</p>
<p>You could use any color really, as long as its color is very different from your subject, but when given the choice, green works slightly better than other colors due to how sensors are built.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Green screens are the go-to for SFX, but any color can be used. Blue screens used to be pretty common with television.</p>
<p>There's no color that can't be used. There are just colors that are easier to work with and have more benefits over using.</p>
<p>You asked &quot;Why not yellow, or purple, or red&quot;. I know for a fact that yellow and purple (fuschia) screens have been used in the past. I don't personally know of any red screening, but I can guarantee it's been used at more than once.</p>
<p>Great wikipedia article explaining backgrounds in chroma keying:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Background color</h3>
<p>Blue was originally used for TV chroma keying special effects because human skin tone contains very little blue, and because the film industry used blue backgrounds for similar purposes. The color blue was tied to the blue emulsion layer of film having comparable grain and detail in comparison to the red and green layers of the emulsion. In television and digital filmmaking, however, green has become the favored color because of some practical considerations, and because lossy compression algorithms used in both analog and digital TV distribution retain more detail in the green channel. The choice of color is up to the effects artists and the needs of the specific shot. Whereas the blue screen was introduced to the television industry by the film industry, the use of green screen visual effects has been introduced to the film industry as electronic imaging has augmented and replaced the use of chemical film stock in cinema. Also, the green background is favored over blue for outdoor filming where the blue sky might appear in the frame and could accidentally be replaced in the process. Although green and blue are the most common in part because red, green and blue components are used to encode the visible light spectrum, any key color can be used. Red is avoided for human subjects due to its prevalence in white skin tones, but can be often used for objects and scenes which do not involve people.</p>
<p>So-called &quot;yellow screen&quot; is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera. This second film is high-contrast black and white, and is processed to produce the matte.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a magenta background is used, as in some software applications where the magenta or fuchsia is sometimes referred to as &quot;magic pink&quot;.</p>

<p>TL:DR - Any color can be used but green has a lot of benefits that make it the first choice for chroma keying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
