		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason juice companies use concentrate is so that they can keep their juice tasting similar throughout the season, despite different types of oranges being harvested from different countries even. By mixing the concentrates, it gives a uniform blend to their juice throughout the year. For example, when the winter oranges are harvested, part of their juice is added to summer concentrate, and part of it is frozen or canned. Then during summer, vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For soaps and such, it just means it's more concentrated, as the name would imply. Dish soaps and laundry detergents are typically mostly just water. The water added makes it mix easier and measure out easier. It also makes it look like you're buying more of something on the shelf, so you think you're getting a better deal (12oz soap for $1 vs 24oz for $1).</p>
<p>Most of the top juice replys are somewhat wrong.  Juice (like orange juice) goes bad after not too long, even stored and refridgerated, and orange growing season is not steady all year. So science (florida university in the 1940's) figured out that  heat and pressure can remove most of the water and many other compounds/nutrients from the juice to store for much longer, and then add it back when they need to use it. This leaves it tasting not the same as fresh squeezed, though.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;not from concentrate&quot; juice isn't really much different.  Instead of freezing after removing water, they de-oxygenate it and store it as a liquid. This also strips much of the flavor and vitamins out of it, which are added back (usually added back from extractions of the orange peels. This is for concentrate and not from concentrate.) to it after being stored for up to a year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concentrates of liquids like dish soap and juices take up less space on shelves, and in the case of dish soap it cleans better with a smaller amount when it's concentrated. As for juice, it's easier to get a taste you like if you start with concentrate, since you just keep adding water until it tastes best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to believe it's more about economics. If you can manufacture and ship  1 unit of product that the end user can turn into, say, 10 units simply by adding water, there's more money to be made by the  company, and money saved by the consumer. Water is cheap at the consumer end, but costly to package and ship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the product. Concentrate normally means they've taken water out of something to make it 'stronger'. </p>
<p>For cleaning products, I suspect it is marketing. The thinking with that would be we assume and associate concentrate with with being stronger, so a concentrate cleaning product must be X times better than a non concentrate product.</p>
<p>For juices, again it can be marketing. <strong>NB</strong>:Where I live, juice from a supermarket has no concentrate. If it did, it would be a fruit <em>drink</em>, not fruit <em>juice</em>. A fruit juice has 100% fruit juice, a fruit <em>drink</em> has some fruit juice (usually not much) + all these additives, sugar etc. In this context concentrate means they have taken some water out of the juice to make it stronger. They've then put some of this concentrate juice into the drink along with other things to make a new fruity drink. </p>
<p>Another possibility (common in fast food joints), concentrate means they've taken some water out, transported it and added water back in, all to cut down on transport costs. In McDonald's (again, at least where I live), they link the concentrated drink, whether it be Coke or juice, directly into the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib-ce2z5PSAhVHxrwKHck5CgYQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flist25.com%2F25-fast-food-restaurants%2F&amp;psig=AFQjCNFyehn3AI7bsVZ7B01YsVLxn5GDhw&amp;ust=1487300265781751" target="_blank">dispensers</a>. The dispenser also has a water hose and when pressed there is some ratio of water to concentrate that is supposed to come out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is we sorta didn't. When people say we don't know how they built the pyramids, it's more about us not knowing their exact methods, not about how they were so advanced and we could never do it today. We do have plenty of plausible theories but we can't say we know exactly for all of them. The amazement is about what they managed to achieve with what they had, not about us not being capable of replicating it at all.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind the amount of time and effort that was put into some of these megastructures. They took many decades to build and were huge efforts that often took the resources of powerful kingdoms/states/empires. I'd say it's better to compare the building of the pyramids to something like the Space Race and moon landing rather than to buildings today.</p>
<p>Also note that it's not as if these megastructures somehow prove that ancient peoples had better building technology. They would've found it impossible to build the skyscrapers we can put up in a few short years. The Roman ancient roads were an amazing achievement at the time, but they would not have found it possible to build the US highway system. And just because stone tablets will last hundreds of more years than paper doesn't mean that they are somehow more advanced to develop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As far as I know, the ancients haven't been surpassed in that regard. We could surpass them if we wanted to, but we have modern materials that are easier to build with. So, we don't surpass the massive stones, and we remain awed by the real achievements of engineering that used them.
Similarly, entering a structure made all of wood with no nails can impress us for achievements that we do not emulate today. The examples abound of architectural practices that awe is that are out of vogue: gargoyles, stained glass, spires, even large scale brickwork is not seen so much and impresses me when I see the beautiful rows of bricks, and the devil's bridges, and the mud skyscrapers of Yemen, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you mass produce tools? First, you sort of cobble a tool together using whatever you've got. Then you have your proto-tools, you use those to bootstrap yourself up to the next level, hand-crafting your nice tools. Ok, now you have some actual tools, but you still haven't gotten mass-production. So you use your nice tools to build some tool-building tools, and then once you have those, you build some tool-building-tool-weilding automation systems (you could call them robots, or factory lines, depending which era you're talking about). And so on.</p>
<p>It's basically just bootstrapping again and again and again. Somebody took the first circuits and said &quot;if I connect these two wires in this way, I get this output&quot;. Somebody else said &quot;well let me take some circuit boards and print them in such a way that it's easy to switch the inputs around to get different outputs&quot;. Then somebody said &quot;cool, now that you have that, I'm going to come up with a set of common rules on how best to get a certain output using these circuit paths. As long as your circuit machines follow this convention, other people can quickly bang out circuits using that same convention without having to build it from scratch every time&quot;. That's assembly. Then somebody else said &quot;ok cool, but some people don't really understand circuits, so I'm going to abstract that one level further&quot;.</p>
<p>If you are a programmer, any time you abstract some concept into an easier to use API, you are doing the exact same sort of process the early programmers were doing. They just didn't have so many shoulders to stand on as you do. When I write fetch('/foo').then(r =&gt; r.text()).then(console.log.bind(console)), I am not actually thinking about all the various pieces that breaks down into. But somebody else at some point said &quot;you know what, javascript needs a way to make http requests&quot;. And somebody before them said &quot;you know what, there should be a quick and easy way to make a standardized tcp connection to a server, receive some data, and close the connection&quot;. Somebody before that said &quot;I wish there were a protocol that would help me send packets of data across a network in a standardized way&quot;. Before that somebody said &quot;I wish there were some way to beam bits of light across ethernet cables&quot;. etc.</p>
<p>Obviously take these generalizations with a grain of salt, I'm sort of making it up to prove a point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am enjoying this topic, so let me try my hand at explaining it.</p>
<hr />
<p>First, you must understand that a computer is essentially a really complicated series of switches.  Each switch does something specific with a bit (1 or 0).  Flipping a switch may send a bit to one place or another.  A different switch may save that bit for later.  Yet another switch may flip a series of other switches which all preform a more complicated action like binary multiplication.  It may even do something really fancy, like light up a pixel on an external display.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, a computer has a lot of these switches in the processor.  Millions or billions of them in fact.  Basically, way too many to set individually.  So, when we design a chip, we make a few switches that control all the rest of them.  We call this an instruction.</p>
<p>An instruction for a simple processor may just be 8 bits, something like '11001100' which means we turn on the 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 8th switches, while leaving the others off.  When you use the switches this way, it may cause a cascading action that adds two bits together, and outputs the result.  Now that there are easier instructions, users can just input the instructions that they want the computer to run, one at a time!  This is effectively a language, called machine code.  Old-school processors came with a thick book of instruction decodes (Add A to B is 11010001), and you would have to run it that way.</p>
<p>Okay, so users can put in one command at a time.  Too Slow!  So what we do is save commonly used commands that handle standard tasks, such as reading a keyboard press, displaying text on a screen, or reading a harddrive.  All these simple tasks can be saved to a memory chip that runs the moment we press the power button, and continues running as long as the computer is on.  So that way, it knows when you press the keyboard for example.</p>
<p>But still, no person programs in machine code these days.  Instead, we abstract that by making a language that is easier to read and write.  Something like C, or Python.  So what we do is write code in those languages, and then another program turns that language into the machine code that runs the computer.  </p>
<hr />
<p>TL;DR - Basic tasks that are necessary to get a computer to a point where you can program it are hard coded 1s and 0s that drive the transistors in your processor to a state where you can load more complicated code.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Step 1: Build a computer that can only be programmed by physically moving wires around to change the patterns of 1's and 0's.</p>
<p>Step 2: Get sick of that, so create a computer that can read those ones and zeros off a physical medium, such as a long strip of paper, or cards.   This is called programming in &quot;Machine Language&quot;.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get sick of writing ones and zeros for the commands, so give names to the various opcodes, such as &quot;LSR&quot;, for Left Shift Register.   This is called &quot;Assembly Language&quot;.   Write a program that does a 1 to 1 translation of assembly command to machine command.</p>
<p>Step 4: Realize that you keep doing the same sequence of assembly language instructions over and over, so you create a program that can convert a special command, such as &quot;loop X times&quot; into that sequence of assembly language commands.</p>
<p>Step 5: Keep adding more commands, and realize that symbolic addresses are useful, too.   Before you know it, you have a compiler for a high level language, written in assembly language.</p>
<p>Step 6: Do future iterations of this process in the higher language to build even higher level languages. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The operating systems, and compilers are all there to make life easier. As a child I had a z80 computer which came as a box of components and a circuit diagram. The input was three banks of buttons one (8 button bank) for the byte, one for the address and a small number of functions like write memory, show memory, run program and the like. To write a program for this monster I would get a piece of paper and work out what i wanted it to do. I would then write (by hand) the machine code instructions and then refer to another sheet of paper with the binary equivalents for each instruction. </p>
<p>I then used some graph paper on which i had columns for memory address, op code (the command) and the data, all written as 1's and 0's. I would then use the keyboard to enter the memory address (in binary) and the command or data i wanted to enter. After many hours I would then hit the run button and watch as the bank of 8 Light bulbs would flicker in a set sequence, and have to start all over again as the computer had no long term memory.</p>
<p>Earlier than that, NASA and other organisaitons used &quot;braid memory&quot; which is literally bundles of wires braided together into the binary patterns for the program to be run. This means that rocket's flew into space running computer programs entered into them by little old ladies basically knitting miles and miles of wire.

<p>And even earlier than that the Bombe (a code breaking computer from 1939) had rotating switches for memory, you programmed it by turning dials for each memory location before running it. Although the bombe was only capable of running one &quot;program&quot; without physically re-building it, and the memory was more like a saved configuration file for that program in today's terms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you asking us how programmers programmed programs when they didn't have any programming programs to program programs with?</p>
<p>If you look at the predecessor to Windows, MS-DOS, you will notice how simple it is, and how little it could do. So somebody wrote compilers for it, which allowed people to write more complex programs for it. Then people wrote graphical Software Development Kits, and slowly the beast just grew and grew. What was important here was the fact that everyone settled on using the same computer - what was known as the IBM-compatible, or as it's called today: The PC.</p>
<p>I had an 8-bit machine back in the eighties, and we could buy magazines with programs to enter. It would come in the shape of a page of machine code, and a tiny BASIC program that you could enter the machine code into in order to write it to disk. Oh, yeah, and if you got any of the bytes wrong, you'd just crash and would essentially have to start over. I'd say &quot;Good times&quot;, but damn it, it wasn't.</p>
<p>The 8-bit processor would itself come with a ROM - read-only-memory, which would provide basic functionality. To the best of my knowledge, this was actually hardware. As in, the programs were written with logic gates. I did have a PASCAL compiler back in the mid-eighties, but the compiler itself took up most of the disc space itself, so you couldn't really do much with it. :p</p>
<p>TL;DR: With logic gates and machine code. And very slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

De-gassing water to prevent corrosion or make very clear ice is done by repeatedly boiling and cooling water.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume your question asks about why the oxygen concentration decreases with depth in the ocean.  If not, please clarify.</p>
<p>Atmospheric oxygen equilibrates with the ocean at the seawater/atmosphere interface.  Whatever temperature and pressure are for a given water mass is when it is at the surface defines its starting oxygen concentration.  If the water then cools and becomes more dense it sinks.  It does not increase in oxygen concentration since there is no source of additional oxygen.</p>
<p>Oxygen is consumed by biological processes, i.e respiration.  As organic matter is metabolized it consumes oxygen.  Organic matter falls through the water column and as it is consumed it must use oxygen whether the consumer is a microorganism or other heterotroph.</p>
<p>Therefore, as you get deeper, the &quot;older&quot; water, that is water that has been away from the surface longer, decreases in oxygen concentration.  In fact, when there is abundant surface productivity raining down organic matter it can drive the oxygen concentration all the way to zero, creating so-called &quot;dead zones&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bco-dmo.org/parameter/527499" target="_blank">Apparent Oxygen Utilization</a> is a handy tool to measure productivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In freshwater or marine systems Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) is the difference between the measured dissolved oxygen concentration and its equilibrium saturation concentration in water with the same physical and chemical properties. Such differences typically occur when biological activity acts to change the ambient concentration of oxygen. For example, primary production liberates oxygen and increases its concentration, while respiration consumes it and decreases its concentration.</p>
<p>Consequently, the AOU of a water sample represents the sum of the biological activity that the sample has experienced since it was last in equilibrium with the atmosphere. In shallow water systems (e.g. lakes), the full water column is generally in close contact with the atmosphere, so oxygen concentrations are typically close to saturation: AOU values are low. In deep water systems (e.g. oceans), water can be out of contact with the atmosphere for extremely long periods of time (years, decades, centuries) and large AOU values are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>edit: OK!  so, I went to r/science <em>after</em> reading r/askscience questions.  I now assume your question relates to this post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5u9cr3/new_study_has_detected_a_decline_in_the_amount_of/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5u9cr3/new_study_has_detected_a_decline_in_the_amount_of/</a>  </p>
<p>In any case, the answer is well provided there: as the ocean warms the water can dissolve less oxygen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean.</p>

If a person is compromised, then whatever information they ever had access to is considered compromised. That's why security breaches are so painful. It's also why the modern intelligence aparatus must be compartmentalized. Most of the incriminating information is about how we collect information. </p>
<p>For instance, if we have a record of who the attaches are in an embassy that belong to that nations intelligence service, it's not as important as the how we got it. All of them will be replaced, and as long as our method of obtaining information is secure, we can continue to monitor the correct people. Generally speaking, the president won't know, the how we get something. He doesn't have time for it, he'll just know the what. </p>
<p>As for the how, it can get pretty dicey, especially when we get it from a third party. Everyone spies on their allies, since often our allies know the kinds of things we want to know about our enemies, but they can't tell us because it would compromise their sources. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Private collections are actually a pretty big problem for disciplines such as archaeology. As pointed out in this thread, people with large amounts of money will buy these things, and this would be the targeted buyer for these items, as no one else would realistically have the money to buy them. From time to time items are discovered by descendants and gifted/sold to museums to add to their collection, but, for the most part, a lot of useful artifacts that could be used to answer a lot of questions about past human cultures remain in private collections. Anything from ancient clothing and jewelry to actual fossils of proto-homonins could be found in these collections.</p>
<p>Edit: as some people have pointed out, yes, some museums don't display their entire collections, for the public that is. Researchers can still get access to these collections for academic purposes, but getting access to a private collection is a much more difficult process. Also, museums, at least I assume, have much higher quality preservation technologies, and thus can better maintaining the quality of their collections. But I agree, it would be nice if museums could display their collections more</p>
<p>Edit #2: rereading this, I realize that maybe I shouldn't have used the word &quot;problem&quot; to describe private collections. I am coming from an anthropology background, so my bias points me to not being a big fan of people who keep their collections private instead of allowing them to be researched. While there are a lot of issues surrounding research done on private collections, my stance towards it is usually along the lines of &quot;better than nothing&quot;, but other people see it differently. Thanks to everyone for replying, I quite enjoyed the replies.</p>
<p>Edit #3: someone asked me for my credentials, and I realized that that would have been a good idea to post my original post; I am an *anthropology undergrad at the University of Waterloo. I apologize for not having put this earlier</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a reformed collector, you have to understand the collector 'mentality' and how diseased it can become over time. </p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why people collect things. At the best and most wholesome level, its because you're interested in something and collecting it can be a fun way to engage in that passion. Maybe you enjoy playing the vintage video games you had as a kid. Maybe you're interested in coins or stamps or you like reading comics from the mid 1970's. There's a large majority of 'collector sentiment' that's perfectly reasonable, sane and even worthwhile. </p>
<p>So lets say that the next 'level' of collecting (where a ton of people exist) is 'ego collecting' - that is, collecting things because you realize that they're impressive to other people and you have a deep, insecure desire to impress others. A ton of collecting is rooted in this sentiment. Same with the high end wristwatch market and other things. 'Collecting' can also become very competitive, where you collect not because you particularly 'enjoy' your collection anymore but because you're obsessively trying to make it 'the best'. </p>
<p>At the furthest end of the spectrum, you have people with a lot of money, with deep rooted 'collector' obsessions and very skewed values, that are willing to have something stolen so they can own it. These aren't common, but they're common enough that museums with shitty security practices can find themselves vulnerable. </p>

They will also leave the battery with a very small amount of charge when the phone dies to prolong the battery life and keep the internal clock going too.</p>
<p>Basically, lithium batteries would overheat when left plugged in, which would cause damage to the battery over time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You charge a battery by forcing electricity through it backwards. So if you have a 12-volt car battery the alternater and charger and such can put up to 18 volts across the terminals. That extra 6 volts forces the electrons to go in the &quot;electrons come out here&quot; side of the battery.</p>
<p>Batteries work through chemistry. You take some stuff (usually metal) and make a sandwich of the stuff around some other stuff (usually some acid or alkali). The middle stuff dissolves the metals releasing electrons and pushing them one way or another.</p>
<p>So your car battery is a lead-acid battery, and your flashlight takes D-cells that used to be carbon/acid, but are now (something I don't remember)/alkaline. So that's what an &quot;alkaline battery&quot; is.</p>
<p>So some batteries, like lead-acid, are easy to charge because the chemestry is really easy to reverse. Other batteries are just about impossible to charge because it's like trying to un-burn a log. This second type is the normal batteries and alkaline batteries you buy from the store. They just aren't <em>safely</em> rechargeable.</p>
<p>Why? They tend to catch fire and explode, or when you run the electricity through them backwards they don't produce the same chemicals they were built with.</p>
<p>So we've always had the big rechargable lead/acid batteries. But making little ones has required a lot of development.</p>
<p>There are different bad things things that can happen when you recharge a battery...</p>
<p>For example the metal in the metal sandwich can fall apart from being repeatedly changed and changed back. This is why car batteries go bad. The lead flakes off and eventually the flakes form a conductor from the two sides of the sandwich and that fraction of the battery becomes useless. The typical 12 volt car battery has six sandwiches so when you lose a cell it's now a 10 volt battery. Lose another and it's an 8 volt battery and that's not enough to do the job.</p>
<p>The battery can get hot and literally &quot;cook&quot;. So the modern lithium-ion batteries have little thermostats in them and as you charge them they get warm, and the warmer they get the less electricity they can stand to take, so the thermostat slows down the charging by slowing down the current. That's part of why your &quot;quick charger&quot; for your phone will, on an empty battery, charge to 80% real fast and then take longer and longer to get to 100%. It got warm as fast as it got charged and so it can't charge to full without slowing down.</p>
<p>Finally there's that whole thing where batteries &quot;get memory&quot;. This is not what's happening. As you charge and discharge some kinds of batteries they get pits and cook into new chemicals &quot;fractionally&quot; So every time you recharged the old batteries you &quot;used up&quot; a little of teh metal or the acid/alkali. With some of the material used up, the total amount of available stuff to make electriciy was reduced and the batteries lost their &quot;capacity to hold a charge.&quot; People called this &quot;memory&quot; because it was easier. But in truth you were more likely to ruin a battery by &quot;topping it off&quot; than you were likely to ruin it by charging a nearly dead battery. So it <em>seemed</em> like frequent short charges were &quot;remembered&quot;. But, no..</p>
<p>So finally, what is over charging.</p>
<p>Each sandwich inside any battery has a limit to how much electricity it can store. If you reach that limit and <em>persist</em> in forcing electricity through it backwards then it <em>can't</em> save any of that electricity as chemicals. So it <em>cooks</em>. Heat is generated and the good chemicals may bake or burn.</p>
<p>For instance, as your car battery dies the headlights visibly dim. This is because the 12 volts becomes 11, then 10, then 9 (and so on) as you use up the stored energy. And as you charge the 9 become 10 then 11 and 12. (the actual peak number is something like 13 volts for a car battery, but let's stick with 12.)</p>
<p>The charge/voltage regulator in your car stops charging the battery when the target 12 volts is reached because after that it's just doing damage. But if you've ever had a junker car that &quot;Eats Batteries&quot; you know it was really that your voltage regulator went bad. It wen't bad by being unable to stop the &quot;overcharging&quot;.</p>
<p>Now over time, because of different battery materials <em>and</em> by the proliferation of <em>better</em> electronics, the whole &quot;overcharging&quot; thing has largely gone away. We simply got better at the whole task from every angle.</p>
<p>But we still hear of whole phones (by part number) that are &quot;prone to explode&quot;. This happens when the phone in question, or the battery pack itself, has a design fault or was built with inferior parts. The bad design, or bad parts, lets the battery take in, or give out, too much electricity too fast. It gets hot. It get's unstable. And then it goes &quot;boom&quot;.</p>
<p>That's overcharging in a nutshell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The worst enemy of your battery is heat. This is what slowly chips away its efficiency.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What batteries are you talking about? Phones nowadays are generally smart enough to disconnect the charger voltage from the battery when the battery is charged.</p>
<p>Rechargeable batteries generally convert electrical energy to chemical energy and back again, as needed. They do this best under specific conditions, over a limited range of temperature, for example. Li-ion batteries like in our phones are most efficient when charged between 50% and 80%. They do this through reversible electrochemical reactions. If you discharge them to 0% and charge them back to 100%, often some measure of irreversible chemical reaction occurs.</p>
<p>If you want a specific explanation of the irreversible chemical reaction, can you provide a specific battery or application for the inquiry?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out on this thread, you can't actually overcharge the battery above 100% with a modern device by leaving it plugged in. Leaving it plugged in does, however, have the potential to wear the battery. The reason for this is that the phone is still running on the battery, and basically topping itself off every few min. Since the most destructive parts of the charge cycle are the very bottom (20%-0%) and the very top (80%+) you are cycling the battery at the worst part over and over. If you got an app that let you limit the max charge to 60%, the effect would be negligible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One way to cool something down is the passive way of equilibrium, put something cold near the object you're trying to cool down, and equilibrium will have heat travel from the warmer object to the colder one, cooling one and warming another. Another way would be to modify the properties within the PV=nRT gas laws. If you change one side, the other side will change as well to maintain equilibrium. To get the extreme cold temperatures, you'd heavily compress the gas, which will increase the temperature, then cool it down to a reasonable temperature like room temp, and once you expand it out, it will heavily cool down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Then you release the cold, high-pressure gas through a nozzle. When you drop the pressure of something, it becomes colder.

The remaining very cold gas is used to cool off the compressed gas in step 2, before being cycled back through the compressor.</p>
<p>Now helium is seriously weird in many ways, so you have to be careful in what pressures and temperatures you try to liquefy it at, but the basic idea is the same.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, we don't need anything cooler, just like your fridge doesn't need a constant supply of let's say ice cubes to keep your milk cool. And even if it would, you would need a way to freeze water to get these ice cubes. Simply speaking, cooling means nothing but reducing the average kinetic energy of the system, so you need a machine that does exactly this for you. Generally this is how it works:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampson%E2%80%93Linde_cycle" target="_blank">Hampson-Linde cycle</a> </p>
<p>The first step is to compress the gas, but by doing so you will actually heat it up above room temperature. You can now cool the gas by letting it equilibrate with a cooler environment. Now you can exploit the Joule-Thomson effect*, that states, that an expanding gas will cool down. So by expanding the gas into a bigger Volume, you will further reduce its temperature. You have to repeat this over and over again, but eventually you will end up with liquid helium.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>*Helium is actually a special case here as it will not reduce its temperature on expansion if its temperature is above a certain value. To actually exploit the Joule-Thomson effect in Helium for cooling you have to pre-cool it. For this you could use regular air that has been cooled below the critical value by using the same technique. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
