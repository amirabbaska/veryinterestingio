		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue with the levels is a result of the 8-bit processor using a single byte (8-bits) to store the current level value. The score is a whole other animal. Depending on methods for display, two different solutions can be used. </p>
<p>One of the solutions is space hungry and fast, while the other is less space hungry but requires more process time to display. The faster solution (used in many NES games, but would apply here) is to use a single byte to store each digit. The space is lost because you only need 4 out of the 8 bits to store binary coded decimal (BCD) values. Then all you need is a number of bytes to store data into that is equal to the number of digits that you need to be able to change. The other method (used by Vs.Duck Hunt for certain, but likely others as well) is to store BCD values of the 0-99 range in a single byte as it would use less memory, but the program would have to break each 4-bit component (nybble) of the number out for display reasons. This of course requires more process time to complete as you'd be not only breaking out the nybbles but then (possibly converting them into correct graphics data) and dumping that information to display memory. </p>
<p>Trailing zeroes may not be stored in these ways as the game may never change those values. Simply put, if no earned score value is lower than 100, the two trailing zeroes are just plain text, which further reduces needed storage allowing larger numbers. This would result in needing only 5 bytes to store scores in the millions per method 1, and 3 bytes to scores in the millions per method 2.</p>
<p>After all that, the final limiting factor is the display space to show the player the values in the memory. Even if you can store values in tens of millions (method two, assuming no score quantities under 100 pts.), you won't be use all the space if you can't display all the values on the screen.</p>
<p>These are the common ways to do this as it simplifies the math routines needed to update the score information. </p>

<p>The reason behind the kill screen is more complicated than simply wrapping around from 255 to zero. Here's a full explanation: <a href="http://www.donhodges.com/how_high_can_you_get3.htm" target="_blank">http://www.donhodges.com/how_high_can_you_get3.htm</a></p>
<p>It's totally possible for an 8-bit processor to work with larger numbers than 0-255 - such as the Pac-Man score. The only restriction is that it has to deal with 8 bits <em>at a time</em>. For example, I used to program a Commodore 64 which had an 8-bit 6510 processor, and the way to do larger numbers was to use a &quot;low byte&quot; and a &quot;high byte.&quot;</p>
<p>By using two bytes, you could represent 16-bit numbers: the high byte's eight bits represented the bits that stand for 256, 512, 1024, ..... to 32768; while the low byte's eight bits represent the 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... to 128. This way you could go not just from 0-255 (256 = 2^8), but from 0-65535 (65536 = 2^16).</p>
<p>Using three, or four, bytes would allow for numbers up to 16.7+ million or 4 point something billion, respectively.</p>
<p>Edit: oops, wrong link; that was for Ms. Pac-Man. I think the original is on that same site somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even on an 8-bit processor, you can handle larger numbers, but for each variable in the program, you decide how large it should be. So, they expected the core to be large, and used a large variable. They didn't expect anyone to beat 255 levels, so they used a small variable for that.</p>
<p>Why not always use the largest variable available?</p>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed. Since the CPU can only work with 8 bits at the time, every operation needs to be don on chunks of the variable, meaning more operations.</p>
</li>
<li>Memory. On these early systems, memory restrictions were a very real issue. Every byte counted, so programmers always strived to use the smallest variably available.</li>

<p>However there is in fact a local temperature drop during an eclipse.</p>
<p>Edit: trying to find hard data on the temperature drop it seems that the drop is only about half the difference between day and night temperature. It feel a lot bigger because you lose the direct radiant heating from the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>(The video is actually a series of still photos, as it would take hours for the shadow to cross the whole Earth)</p>
<p>As /u/electric_ionland pointed out, the Moon's shadow only blocks the Sun on a very small portion of the Earth at a time.  The duration of a total eclipse at any given spot can never exceed about 7.5 minutes, and is usually much shorter than that.  So the cooling potential is like slow sunset, followed by 3-4 minutes of night, followed by a gradual sunrise.  It's noticable, but not much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It does. As more of the Sun gets covered, the temperature drops noticeably, and animals, fish, and insects start behaving like it's sunset. But the Earth has a lot of thermal inertia, and just like when the Sun sets, the temperature doesn't immediately drop to freezing.</p>
<p>And bear in mind that the path of totality in a solar eclipse is not <a href="http://www.eclipse2017.org/2017/maps.htm" target="_blank">THAT wide,</a> so it's not like the entire hemisphere is being plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>While the partial phases may last a couple of hours, full totality is never longer than around 6-7 minutes, and the time when a significant amount of the Sun is covered is not that long either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we are all just stardust!</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>All the heavy elements in our solar system, (and by heavy elements I mean anything that isn't hydrogen or helium) is basically a product of a supernova, barfing it's contents across the cosmos.  None of the oxygen, carbon, silicon, sulfur, iron, etc... was produced <em>in situ</em> by our sun, it was produced as fusion products in another, far older, far more massive, long-dead star.</p>
<p>So let's talk about how stars produce elements, shall we?  In stars like our Sun the primary source of Hydrogen burning is a process called the proton-proton chain.  Two protons fuse to form a Helium with no neutrons, which is very unstable.  The vast majority of them decay right back into to protons, but occasionally one of the protons undergoes a beta-plus decay, emitting a positron &amp; a neutrino to transmogrify into a neutron.  At that point you've got Deuterium, which can much more easily fuse with a proton to form He^3 , which is stable.  Eventually that He^3 captures another neutron and you end up with garden-variety helium.  In stars more massive than our sun with significant amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen already present, a more efficient process known as the CNO cycle catalyzes the fusion, but the end result is the same:  Hydrogen gets burned into Helium.  So step 1 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 H^1 --&gt; He^4 (through a variety of paths.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the star runs out of Hydrogen to burn the next stage of burning occurs, (after a collapse to higher pressure &amp; temperature) which is the triple-alpha process, where two helium nuclei - which I'm going to refer to as alphas - fuse into Be^8 ,which is highly unstable, but if it captures a <em>third</em> alpha, will fuse into stable carbon, C^12 .  So now our next equation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He^4 + He^4 + He^4 --&gt; C^12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally we have the last process, which burns heavier elements, known as the alpha process.  This is simpler, in the sense that it's just the capture of a single alpha particle by a heavier nucleii, but there are lots of flavors.  Pretty much one for every element up the chain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C^12 + He^4 --&gt; O^16</p>
<p>O^16 + He^4 --&gt; Ne^20</p>
<p>Ne^20 + He^4 --&gt; Mg^24</p>
<p>Mg^24 + He^4 --&gt; Si^28</p>
</blockquote>
<p>etc. etc. etc...</p>
<p>It's this process, the alpha process, that is responsible for much of metal production (in the context of stellar nucleosynthesis, everything that ain't Hydrogen is a metal) in pre-type 2-supernova stars.  Then, of course, they go supernova and spew their contents across the cosmos.  Like ants with fungus in their heads.</p>
<p>This is why most common elements are even in atomic number.  They're more than even in their atomic number, they're also usually integral multiples of 4 in their atomic <em>mass</em> as well, because they're all just assembled from the body parts of alphas.  If you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements#Abundance_of_elements_in_the_Universe" target="_blank">abundance of elements in the universe</a> (which mirrors the abundance of elements in our solar system) you'll find these elements all represented.</p>
<p>Note, the answer that the nuclear pairing force encourages even-numbered protons, neutrons, and nucleii isn't wrong, <em>per se</em>.  It's actually a driving force behind these reactions: the alpha makes an excellent brick with which to assemble heavier nucleii because it is so stable because of the pairing force, and those even/even nucleii are even more stable for the same reason.  So /u/RobustEtCeleritas isn't wrong at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, does the size of a pulsar matter much when determining the break-apart speed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Less massive compact objects have a slower rotation limit, because they are physically larger. It doesn't make much sense to talk about a break-apart speed in this context, since in order for a stable compact object to break apart due to rotational forces, you'd need to put sufficient rotational energy into the star such that the outermost layer spins beyond its orbital velocity; I don't know of any mechanism that does this.</p>
<p>EDIT: Last sentence as originally phrased was incorrect; I neglected to mention accretion, which can cause a star to rotate faster, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5zorv7/psr_j17482446ad_is_the_fastest_know_pulsar_at_716/df1nchu/" target="_blank">but only up to surface speeds equal to the orbital velocity of the surface</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other good answers here but I wanted to add on. /u/bencbartlett gave the minimum period from causality, which comes from the fact that the internal adiabatic sound speed should not exceed the speed of light. The breakup period where the neutron star will tear itself apart is potentially a bit higher though. This can be calculated rather simply for any spinning object of uniform density, see <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/Pulsars.html" target="_blank">the equation before 6A1</a>. The idea behind this calculation is that you have a centrifugal acceleration pulling a particle from the surface while gravity is pulling it towards the center, and you care about when the pull away is greater than the pull towards. Of course, neutron stars don't have uniform density, and so you need to plug in the appropriate equation of state that describes how the density changes as a function of radius within the neutron star (you can imagine that the center is more dense than the outer shell because of gravity). In this simple model, you'll notice that the period does depend on the size of the object via the density (also go two equations up for this form). This is in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=x1TMSMpzD2UC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=neutron+star+break+up+period&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_tuAMAfXgl&amp;sig=dAOV88wRY_CHzd7jQgqDpde9-NU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqkrrmmdvSAhUF7CYKHRynA_8Q6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=neutron%20star%20break%20up%20period&amp;f=false" target="_blank">0.5 millisecond range</a> though it really depends on how complicated you do the calculation and I've seen some that include full general relativity plus other effects. The numbers I've seen are usually around there though. Some theory papers suggest you can't get sub-millisecond neutron stars if you include more effects but I would say that's still not quite certain or observationally demonstrated yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Some theories suggest that the highest reachable spin rate of typical pulsars is 1500 rotations per second, but that doesn't prevent a pulsar from spinning faster. However, a rate of 1000 rotations per second and higher would make the pulsar lose energy by gravitational radiation.</p>
<p>You must bear in mind that other astronomical objects can spin faster than pulsars, like black holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can see galaxies and (with the Hubble telescope) see the speed at which they rotate.  We can also calculate how much the stars in those galaxies mass.  The problem is, that much matter, spinning at those speeds, would fly apart.  Even adding in planets, dust, and black holes, there still isn't enough matter in galaxies to hold them together.  Not even nearly enough.  There shouldn't even be galaxies anymore, just scattered stars.  But there <em>are</em> still galaxies, so <em>something</em> we can't see must hold them together.  </p>
<p>The leading contender for that <em>something</em> is matter that doesn't interact with normal matter or energy but does create gravity like normal matter.  We call that hypothetical <em>something</em> dark matter, and we're trying to figure out what it is.  </p>
<p>From observing the movements of galaxies and the apparent mass they contain, we can approximate how much gravity would hold them together, and that gives us the amount of dark matter.</p>
<p>Dark energy comes from a different observation about the universe. There is a type of supernova called 1A, which is an exploding white dwarf star.  Since white dwarfs explode at a certain mass, the explosions are always about the same, and each 1A supernova is pretty much the same brightness and color spectrum as the next.  </p>
<p>Since they're the same brightness, we can calculate how far away they are by how faint they appear.  Since they're the same color, we can calculate how fast they're moving away from us - the faster a star moves away from us, the redder it appears- we call that its <em>redshift</em>.  (Although, regardless of the speed or direction its source is moving, light always moves at the same speed, movement toward us compresses the light's wavelength, making the light appear bluer, while movement away stretches that wavelength, making it appear redder.)</p>
<p>If the universe started all together and then moved apart at a constant rate, then we would expect the redshift - how fast it's moving away - to be the same for nearby galaxies as well as distant ones. But fainter (more distant) 1A supernovae aren't red enough.  Since we're seeing those distant ones as they were when the universe was very young, that tells us the universe was expanding at a slower rate back then.  And the further back in time we look, the slower expansion was at that time.</p>
<p>So the universe's expansion has been speeding up.  But <em>something</em> must be speeding it up.  What?  Nothing we can detect.  Since speeding up as we know it is always caused by energy, we call this undetectable something dark energy.</p>
<p>Calculating how much the expansion has accelerated, and how much energy it would take to do that to all those galaxies, gives us an approximation of the amount of dark energy. </p>
<p><strong>TLDR: We get the amount of dark matter from how much extra gravity it would take to keep galaxies from flying apart.  We get the amount of dark energy from how much energy it would take to accelerate the expansion of the universe at the rate we see it happening.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two very different components to this answer. Before I get into it, let's define the everyday stuff you encounter, every molecule, atom, quark, etc. we know about is called baryonic matter. Now in astrophysics, it's not bad to assume all baryonic matter is hydrogen, which burns in stars. Thus, baryonic matter is bright and we can see it in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>Now part 1 is the dark matter to baryonic matter ratio. Vera Rubin discovered this wild method of measuring the mass of galaxies via their rotational rates. Essentially, based on the speed at certain distances from the core, you can calculate where the mass in concentrated. We expected the mass to decrease as you get further from a galactic core because that is how the light drops off which is consistent with our explanations of baryonic matter. However, we find that there is more mass further out than we expected, meaning there is matter we cannot see that must be there. Because it doesn't interact with light, it must be dark. We're making a lot of progress in identifying dark matter, but it's very weird to think about.</p>
<p>Next we need to talk about the ratio of dark energy to everything else. I'm not a cosmologist, so I don't know much about this, but essentially the universe is expanding. We know this thanks to Hubble and everything we can see confirms it. However, we recently discovered that the universe is now expanding faster than it used to, ie. The universe is accelerating. Now this makes no sense because the expansion of the universe is defined as the expansion of space between things, so in order for this to be accelerating, something must exist intrinsically inside space to cause an acceleration. Energy is what you call something that causes expansion, so it must be energy. We can quantify it because we know how the universe is expanding, but we know almost nothing about what this thing really is.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that dark energy could also be considered dark mass because of Einstein's mass energy equivalence of E=mc^2. But that being said, this is a super nebulous explanation of a super nebulous argument that physics struggles to explain.</p>
<p>So even if we can get a good ratio of these things, we aren't very close to understanding them. Another misconception is that dark matter and dark energy are related. This is actually completely false. They have very different properties with almost no overlap and they're only dark because we've never seen them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to make some general comments to reply to a whole host of lower-rated comments that are dominating the discussion down here below the actual answers.</p>
<p>&quot;Dark matter&quot; really literally does mean <em>matter</em> that is <em>dark.</em> It is not simply a placeholder name or a vague metaphor. It could actually be as simple as huge masses of unassociated planet- or star- like objects drifting out there in the void between galaxies where it's <em>literally too dark</em> to see them. This (MACHOs) is a somewhat unlikely theory, but can't be ruled out. The leading theory (WIMPs) is that much of the substance of the universe is taken up in particles that bear mass, and so interact gravitationally with baryonic matter, but are electromagnetically inert. Many of you will be aware that literally trillions of <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~larson/Webpage/neutrinos.html" target="_blank">neutrinos</a> pass through each of our bodies every second; these theoretical WIMPs would be very much like neutrinos, except slower moving so that they can hang around in clumps around galaxies instead of flying along out of all but the very strongest gravity wells. (One of the strongest candidate theoretical particles for dark matter is actually called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralino" target="_blank">neutralino.</a>)</p>
<p>There is this ongoing meme that &quot;dark matter&quot; is just a modern <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Dormitive+virtue" target="_blank"><em>virtus dormitiva,</em></a> an impressive but vacuous label pasted over a lack of understanding. <strong>This is false.</strong> We have specific theoretical and observational reasons to believe that dark matter <em>is matter that is dark,</em> not some quirk of gravitational law:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our current laws of gravity are not just empirically curve-fitted to match observations. They &quot;fall out&quot; inevitably once certain very high-level and abstract assumptions about the nature of space-time are made. No-one has proposed any alternative theory that matches observations at least as well as Einsteinian general relativity while also having this property of &quot;looking like&quot; a legitimate fundamental theory. They're all just kludges. We seem far more entitled to add &quot;kludges&quot; to our inherently limited and incomplete telescopic observations of that portion of the universe which is visible to us in the electromagnetic spectrum than we do to add kludges to fundamental, abstract physical laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have at least some direct observational evidence that refutes non-dark-matter explanations of the anomaly in galaxy rotation rates. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster#Significance_to_dark_matter" target="_blank">Bullet Cluster</a> is a galactic collision that has caused stars and galaxies to spatter out in all directions in a pattern that looks <em>exactly</em> as if the galaxies' dark matter halos are really there and interacting gravitationally, and that seems to be <em>impossible</em> to explain without invoking such halos of dark matter. Since the 2006 Bullet Cluster observations there have been several other similar collisions observed. Admittedly, the interpretation of these observations is complex, and diehard opponents of the dark matter theory have attempted to poke holes in them. You really need to be an actual cosmologist to judge the resulting debates independently, but it is clear that almost everyone in the field thinks they really do refute non-dark-matter theories.</p>
</li>
<li>We don't have to do any kind of violence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">standard model of particle physics</a> to make room for WIMPs. There are actually several different places in the model where we can plausibly fit candidate particles that have the necessary properties to be dark matter. It is true that the experimentalists have started to eliminate some of these candidates, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">one that seemed almost &quot;miraculously&quot; plausible,</a> but there is still a lot of room in the model. So we are really not postulating anything crazy with dark matter.</li>

For example. You have a weightless piggy bank. You look into the piggy bank, and you can see 3 quarters and a dime. You weigh this piggy bank, and it weighs 35 pounds. You logically determine that under no circumstances can 4 coins weigh that much. No amount of error or scale calibration can cause that much error. Therefore, you determine that there is something else in the piggy bank you can't see. This is dark matter. We can measure its impact on the world. I.E. it's weight in the piggybank, but can't see it or directly measure it. The calculations that arrive at the exact percentages are guesses. Good ones mind you, but estimates none the less. Going back to the piggy bank example, it weighs 35 pounds, and the coins (for simplicities sale) weigh a pound. We can determine that the dark matter makes up 34 pounds of our piggy bank, or %97. And the matter, or  coins, make up %3. The reason accuracy is impeded is because we can't measure the mass of the coins exactly, but we know for sure there is a MASSIVE discrepancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Math wasn't handed down from us from the gods, perfect and written in stone. People invented it by asking questions and finding rigorous answers through what evolved into mathematical deduction and proofs. The thing is, if you ask a good question, then its answer will produce hundreds of more questions, so you are left with even more things to answer. Repeat for 2000 years, and you get today where hundreds of new results in math are being published every day, and so many more questions being asked without an immediate answer. Math is much more than college algebra and calculus, just like a glacier is much more than a single snowflake. </p>
<p>The amount of math activity, as measured by papers published, has increased exponentially through time, and it's not showing any signs of slowing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The conjecture has not yet been proven, but it is considered to be true because it has been tested for all integer values up to 5×2^60.</p>
<p>Two famous mathematicians, Paul Erdős and Jeffrey Lagarias said respectively: &quot;Mathematics may not be ready for such problems&quot; and &quot;This is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm super late to the party, but...</p>
<p>Mathematics is constantly reinventing itself. Early on, and for much of its history, people reasoned about mathematics in a very loose way. Sure, we had some notion of formalism with Euclid's axioms, and people tried to be rigorous in their arguments, but they assumed people knew what a &quot;function&quot; was or that proofs worked a certain way. This completely blew up with the invention of calculus, where intuition turned out not to be entirely reliable. People ended up proving a bunch of &quot;contradictory&quot; results because it turns out they were talking about slightly different things or didn't quite consider every case. How embarrassing!</p>
<p>Well, people set out to fix this problem. From the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s, there was a major effort to reduce mathematics to the mechanical derivation of true statements (and proofs of them) from a set of agreed upon rules. The goal was to be able to come up with a proof for any true statement you could formulate according to the rules. This would give a solid basis for mathematics to build out from, one we could have been sure of the correctness of.</p>
<p>This failed <em>spectacularly</em>. Kurt Godel shot it in the heart while Alan Turing shot it in the head. Either's proof would've been the end of that effort, but together, that effort was totally dead. However! the effort to mechanize mathematics <em>did</em> give a consolation prize, in the form of the electronic computer. (In those days, a &quot;computer&quot; was a person who did your calculations for you by hand.)</p>
<p>From that point forward, there's been a persistent effort to explore the way in which we can &quot;formalize&quot; mathematics -- that is, how we can come up with rules and frameworks to reason with.</p>
<p>This exploration is still very much alive. There was some major work from the early-1900s to the present on working out alternative ways to describe the process of reasoning. In fact, very recently a new framework (which expanded on some older ideas) called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory" target="_blank">Homotopy Type Theory</a> was published. This framework came about because a very smart man had an error in his work for <em>years</em> before anyone noticed, and decided that we needed new, more powerful methods of proof-checking on computers. Automatic proof-checking would make mathematics (and potebtially programming) better, by letting us be <em>sure</em> our claims were true.</p>
<p>So, even today, major work is happening on even basic mathematics -- like describing how we reason and prove things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of open problems in mathematics, but as a non-mathematician you're probably most interested in the problems that are applicable to other fields. A lot of these are things that science suggests are true, but whose formal proofs are very difficult.</p>
<ul>
<li>One example is the formalization of quantum field theory (see <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/4068/formalizing-quantum-field-theory" target="_blank">here</a> for a discussion). Quantum field theory (QFT) is the theory used by physicists to describe the behavior of the universe except gravity, and has been remarkably successful at producing testable predictions agreeing with experiment. However, these calculations have gaps in their logical derivation: there's a mathematical argument, then a jump that doesn't make sense, then more math. Trying to find a way to explain these calculations with mathematics would greatly increase our understanding of QFT and hence the universe, as well as make such calculations more methodical. This is an active area of research.  </li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" target="_blank">P versus NP</a> problem --- you might consider it computer science, but programs to prove it, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory" target="_blank">geometric complexity theory</a>, use a lot of sophisticated and recent mathematics. The problem basically asks whether there are fast algorithms for a certain class of hard problems. Many of these problems occur in applications in software engineering (e.g. graph coloring is used in optimizing compilers and SAT solvers in constraint solving), so having a considerably faster algorithm on large outputs could have concrete effects in software development.  </li>
<li>A lot of problems in theoretical cryptography (e.g. shortest vector problem in a lattice, hardness of discrete log, hardness of factoring) are thought to be difficult to reverse-engineer, but there has been no proof. The existence of a proof would bolster certain protocols --- and a counterexample would force us to change the protocols in use on the Internet right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of other problems that readily apply to the rest of the world: topological quantum field theory is being applied to increase the reliability of quantum computers, for just one example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You can carefully guide the beam onto a piece of material called a &quot;viewer&quot; and watch it through a camera. The viewer lights up when there is a beam hitting it.</p>
<p>I don't know the specifics of if or how they do this at the LHC, but it's common with any kind of accelerator.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It definitely depends on what direction you're looking at it from. If you're looking at it on the rotation plane of the beam (I. E., the plane of the accelerating ring itself) then you would definitely see <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation" target="_blank">Synchrotron radiation</a>.
This has important applications both as a source of EM radiation with special properties ad as a tool to measure the beam properties. Other than that, as long as the beam is propagating through vacuum, you wouldn't see much. </p>
<p>Edit: you can see an example of LHCs Synchrotron radiation collected with a mirror and a camera [here] (<a href="https://run2-13tev.web.cern.ch/sites/run2-13tev.web.cern.ch/files/image/inline-images/MAX5082.jpg" target="_blank">https://run2-13tev.web.cern.ch/sites/run2-13tev.web.cern.ch/files/image/inline-images/MAX5082.jpg</a>) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When accelerated it pushes the frequency well above the visible spectrum. That being said, to see &quot;light&quot; it has to hit something to reflect or excite electrons of a molecule that will in turn emit photons.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EM fields would be much more difficult to deal with than plastics and degraders. There are efforts to make different types of accelerators which can have variable energies but once protons are out of a cyclotron, it's much easier to slow them down with degraders which can be characterised and well understood, and be quickly added or taken away.</p>
<p>If your beam has a range of 240mm in water/tissue and you want it to have a range of 150 mm then simply place material in the way with water equivalent thickness of 90 mm. The centre I've worked at at use lead wedges that move in and out of the beam and are calibrated to deliver precise range in water. This is checked regularly during quality assurance, and there is much less that can go wrong!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, falling asleep is a very smooth transition. You don't go from an awake state to a deep sleeping state within seconds but rather go from awake over pre-sleep, light sleep, slow wave sleep to REM sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Memory formation depends heavily on changes</strong>. We are most likely to remember something new rather than something that doesn't really alter over time. Falling asleep is a rather slow change so there is limited need to remember it.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>pre-sleep goes hand in hand with decreased perceptual awareness</strong>. Another reason you don't notice the small changes. Therefore, with decreased awareness there is just less content to store. So what are you expected to remember if you don't really notice anything?</p>
<p>Third, with the decreased perceptual awareness <strong>we switch to an internal reflective state</strong> thinking of things rather than learning new things. So you start to think about your perfect lunch that day, how yummy it was and what you will have tomorrow. So there is just nothing new to remember. This is probably what the quote I cited tried to express.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One aspect is that the information isn't that important and you're not receiving much information into the brain, so what is there to remember? What colour was the 3rd car you saw yesterday? You have no idea because your brain doesn't store information unless it thinks it's important. </p>
<p>It's also important to realise that 'sleep' and 'wakefulness' are really just two points on an entire spectrum of consciousness. It isn't like you instantly go from being awake to being asleep; your brain slowly begins to inhibit lots of different parts of itself and the body. Your muscles become more paralysed, incoming information is filtered out, and eventually many of your brain processes (including memory) are inhibited. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the physiological reason, but I do know it may serve a purpose. Because feeling asleep is the most terrifying experience you can ever feel in your life. Let me explain:</p>
<p>You can train yourself to remain conscious during the transition from awake to asleep. When you fall asleep, your brain send signals to the body to paralyze it, to prevent involuntary movements that could injure you during your sleep. That sleep paralysis can be experienced consciously with some training (I experienced it when I was working as a casino dealer and my sleep patterns were fucked, resulting in being sleep deprived most of the time). </p>
<p>The problem is that if you remain conscious, your brain will instinctively try to rationalize that paralysis, to find a plausible explanation to why you're paralyzed. At that point you will experience what is known as night terrors / waking nightmares / hypnagogia. It's basically a nightmare that you can feel like is reality, and sometimes (for many people, me included) involves a shadowy evil figure crushing you and preventing you to breathe. What is very specific to hypnagogia is the intense feeling of fear you can experience. It's hard to describe and understand without having experienced it, but basically it's like you feel pure terror. Imagine watching a horror movie and being scared. Imagine that movie fear is only 10% of your potential fear. Now imagine 100% of the feeling of terror is unleash at once for you to experience. That's night terrors. It is THE MOST terrifying experience I've ever had in my life. Strangely, I also find it very interesting to experience, even though it's terrifying, it kinda makes me feel alive (I don't feel much things most of the time).</p>
<p>Anyway, not sure it answers your question, but you might find that fact interesting.</p>
<p>PS: you can google night terrors and hypnagogia to know more about that phenomenon, and how to induce it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are four stages of sleep</p>
<p>NREM( non-REM) 1 --&gt;2--&gt;3---&gt;2--&gt;REM</p>
<p>NREM 1 - theta waves, this is the point where you start drifting off into light sleep and or experience hallucinations and that &quot;falling feeling&quot;</p>
<p>NREM 2 - still theta waves and its a bit harder for you to wake up now- this is where you experience sleep spindles and K complexes ( this is where you are able to consolidate your memory and it protects your sleep by making it harder to wake you.</p>
<p>NREM 3- this is where delta waves kick in and its even harder to wake you from here</p>
<p>REM sleep- this is the stage where dreams occur and where sleep paralysis/ night terrors etc.. Your frontal cortex is important for processing information and making logical decisions, when in REM sleep it is dampened or attenuated thats why when you start dreaming of jiggly puff eating a peanut butter jelly sandwich near a volcano, it does not seem strange to you during that dream. Keep in mind this is where our physiological state is experiencing something called beta waves which is the same frequency of waves of when we are awake.</p>
<p>Also note these sleep &quot;cycles&quot; do not just occur once but multiple times and usually takes about 90 minutes for a full cycle to complete. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest reasons I'd that the transition from short term memory to long term memory takes time. About 30 minutes, actually. Short term memory is basically a bunch of neurons firing in a circle constantly refreshing themselves. Do it for about 30 minutes and it gets encoded into long term memory. </p>
<p>This process is really very sensitive and if it gets interrupted the memories are lost. This is why a lot of people who are in automobile accidents where they were knocked unconscious often say they don't remember the accident. It didn't have enough time to store the memory before things were interrupted.</p>
<p>As was mentioned by others, falling asleep is not an on and off process. You bounce in and out of sleep over and over again until you get to the big one. You are interrupting the memory storage process as you do it and losing your most recent memories.</p>
<p>This is also part of the reason why people can wake up in th night, talk, go get a glass of water, and go back to sleep and never remember any of it. If they are awake less than half an hour they probably won't remember it. Technically there are some other reasons like state dependence memory, but that's sort of a tangent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
