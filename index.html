		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, a lot of guys have this idea that there is a finite amount of room in your testes and that your body can only produce a limited amount of sperm.</p>
<p>In truth, your body is almost always producing sperm. While yes there is a finite amount of room in your testes for sperm to be created, in practice it is near impossible to ever reach this cap. One, because your testes can expand slightly, vastly increasing sperm storage. Two, because the amount of sperm your body can actually store, even before the aformentioned enlargement, is a pretty crazily high amount. And three, because older sperm are usually broken down and 'remanufactured' into newer sperm.</p>
<p>Your body nornally (Outside of a few diseases/nutrient deficiencies) does a pretty remarkable job of breaking down old or improperly formed sperm, absorbing the remnants, and then creating new sperm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

These cells drive the creation of sperm (spermatogenesis). They produce a product called inhibin B which feeds back to the pituitary and decreases the amount of FSH being produced (negative feedback). This creates a balance of the hormone driving sperm production. Not so much because the testes are 'full'. </p>
<p>Worth noting that testosterone also negatively feeds back on FSH production - thus taking exogenous testosterone will decrease not only your own bodies testosterone production but sperm production as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The toilet seat puts pressure on the nerves leading to your legs by allowing your butt to sink into the giant hole in the middle. This puts the bottom of your femur (thigh) under a lot of pressure, when that area would normally not be because our butts are designed to carry fat to protect our sacrum (tailbone) and the nerves that go through it/ around it. What happens is essentially the same thing as if you were to lean on one arm for too long- it's not so much a blood flow issue, although that can contribute in a minor way, but rather the compression of nerves. </p>
<p>We discussed this in a class in my nursing program (I'm studying to be a registered nurse) because they make a pillow referred to as a &quot;donut.&quot; It's supposed to help older adults feel more comfortable in a hospital bed, (especially because they don't have butt fat anymore) but instead it has the same effect as sitting on the toilet for hours on end. Companies try to market it to prevent pressure ulcers on patient's rear ends, but it's actually bad for them. </p>
<p>Now you know! </p>
<p>Edit: wow guys! Thanks for all the upvotes, and your wonderful comments :) </p>
<p>Other users have pointed out the actual muscles and nerves involved: the toilet seat puts pressure on the piriformis muscle, which then compresses the sciatic nerve. That nerve compression is what causes the unpleasant feeling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doc here, I know it's late but here's an actual explanation:</p>
<p>The feeling that you get is due to what we call neuropraxia, which is the mildest form of nerve injury. When you sit on a regular chair, your weight is distributed primarily on your ischial tuberosity(i.e. &quot;sit bones&quot;) and other soft tissue meant for weight-bearing. When you sit on a toilet seat, the weight shifts to where it's putting your weight onto your sciatic nerves(the major nerve in your leg).</p>
<p>This compression of the nerve causes this mild, reversible nerve injury and is responsible for the &quot;falling asleep&quot; feeling you experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>same amount of weight, smaller surface area. you know how a bed of nails works? if all of your body was on one nail, that one nail would hold all of your weight and poke into you with all of your weight. (this has a name: normal force is the force that pushes you back when you push on something.) on a bed of nails, you're suspended on many, many nails, and even though theyre ALL sharp, each nail only holds a tiny fraction of your weight, so it pokes into you less.</p>
<p>(also the reason snowshoes work. more surface area &gt; each inch of snow is holding less of ur weight and is less likely to crumble.)</p>
<p>so, all of ur body weight is on the seat of the toilet, so a larger fraction of ur weight is on each inch of rim, because there's less seat, so it's &quot;poking&quot; you more. where a normal chair has more even weight distribution. more force on each inch of ur body &gt; more likely itll fall asleep.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever had someone sit on your lap and thought, &quot;wow, they have a boney butt!&quot;  What you're feeling are the ischial tuberosities, the lowest part of a bone of the pelvis.  When sitting on a flat surface (in this case a chair) these boney projections prop up the body away from the nerves that run from the spinal cord down into the legs (the sciatic nerves).</p>
<p>Because the ischial tuberosities of the pelvis are fairly centrally located, when sitting on a toilet seat they don't prop up the body - and as a result you compress the sciatic nerves.  Nerves really don't like to be pinched, pulled, or compressed.  I think everyone has &quot;hit their funny bone&quot; enough to understand this quite nicely.</p>
<p>Note: the reason the answer to this question has nothing to do with blood flow is that the main blood supply to the lower limbs are from the femoral arteries, which are located on the front of the legs, not the back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toilet seat has a rim. Smaller surface area means it presses on your legs with higher force. So has higher tendency to slow down blood going into your legs. Regular chairs on the other hand are flat, have higher surface area, so less pressure, and less force pressing on your legs. So less tendency to slow blood flow.
Edit: the comment below me corrected me. The higher force  presses  on the nerves, not blood flow. thank you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp89Dh4LzWAhWCxYMKHcevBb4QFggzMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9781489980762-c1.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-1447120-p176365033&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2_-q6MEQq2bM2OXyudd5cT2vYEQ" target="_blank">Sucrose, HFCS, and Fructose: History, Manufacture, Composition, Applications, and Production</a></p>
<p>Some key quotes</p>
<p>1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The history of high fructose corn syrup is linked with sugar, in that HFCS owed its beginning to
demand created by periodic upsets in the supply of sugar. During such times, caused by weather or
political instability in cane-producing regions, sugar supplies became scarce and prices infl ated, causing
a hardship to food and beverage manufacturers. The mid-to-late-twentieth century was an especially
tumultuous time for sugar production with two major price spikes (1975 and 1980) occurring
within a span of 5 years; between 1960 and 2012, retail sugar prices increased sixfold. This created a
window of opportunity for the corn wet milling industry, which had access to a plentiful and dependable
raw material—cornstarch—and was seeking new ways to use it. Existing products such as regular
corn syrups and dextrose lacked suffi cient sweetness and functionality to successfully compete
with sugar. A series of technical achievements serendipitously coalesced around the time of the most
egregious sugar upsets to spur the development of a product with every bit as much sweetness and
functionality as sucrose: high fructose corn syrup. History thus repeated itself, just as sugar supply
issues created an opportunity for the budding beet sugar industry during the Napoleonic Wars 150
years earlier. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although fructose is found in many fruits and vegetables and the primary added sugars, its use as
a food ingredient is fairly recent. Crystalline fructose was available and used primarily in pharmaceutical
applications prior to 1987. The A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company saw untapped opportunities
for fructose in the food and beverage industry because of its unique sweetness and physical and functional properties, licensed crystallization technology from European beet sugar producer,
Finnsugar, and began marketing it to food and beverage companies in the late 1980s. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A key learning is that sugars have been a part of the diet for many thousands of years, though
not in the amounts now consumed. The only bona fide challengers to cane sugar—beet sugar
and HFCS—were developed in response to upsets in supply caused by the turmoil of war,
weather, or politics. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to HFCS, a sociological force that I did not see mentioned in the article which definitely drove the economics of sugar was the low-fat craze of the 1970s and 1980s.  Fats were removed from many foods, and to counteract the loss of taste, &quot;added sugar&quot; became an ingredient in many many foods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Many different molecules or parts of molecules will vibrate from the range of microwaves given off.  Water turned to steam or heated water inside a plastic plate cover in the microwave heats food the most evenly  because it contains the steam/vapor around the food when I use my microwave.  At the same time the ceramic plate I sometimes use can get hotter than my food. This is evidence that more than water can vibrate from microwaves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The microwave relies on being able to vibrate the molecules with the output energy. So it only really works on things that have a structure that will allow that, things like stone, glass, ceramic etc generally won't get hot. Basically anything with a strong internal structure, crystalline basically, won't really heat up much.<br />
But if you heat up something like glass first with a blowtorch then suck it in a microwave then you can melt the stuff as the initial heating has &quot;freed-up&quot; the molecules enough that they can absorb the incoming energy and vibrate more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not exactly 50/50, but it tends to be pretty close. This is due to several factors that can occur, a big one being gene inactivation where since you have 2 copies of every gene, the cells will inactive one copy to allow proper dosage.</p>
<p>In your case where you have the genetic profile of yourself and one parent and you want to know specifically if the parts that don't match are from the other parent, the answer is most likely but not always. The reason it's not always is because new mutations can occur in the sequence of your genes during embryo development. These mutations are abundant and mostly harmless, but they can also lead to various diseases. A lot of known inherited disorders also tend to have a high percentage new mutation rate, meaning that even if neither parent had the genes for the disease, their child could due to a mutation during development. This child would then be able to pass the disease on to their children as it is now in their DNA. There's also some other more complicated events that can occur while the female egg cells and male sperm cells are being produced that can lead to slightly different gene arrangements and possible mutations that are not seen in the body cells but could be seen in the sex cells or vise versa. </p>
<p>Let me know if you have more questions about anything specific, I'd be happy to answer. I'm currently in school for genetic counseling, so it's a very exciting topic for me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes that can be numbed from 1 to 23.  Assuming you are a normal human, you will have a single chromosome 1 from your father and one from your mother.  This goes for all 23 sets of chromosomes.  So in terms of number of chromosomes, you have 50% from your mother and 50% from your father.</p>
<p>Now, the number of genes contained in each chromosome varies, but chromosome 1 from your mother and 1 from your father will have the same number of genes.  This goes for all chromosomes with the exception of the 23rd chromosome, which is the sex chromosome.  As another user has posted, the X chromosome has significantly more genes than the Y chromosome.</p>
<p>However, sex chromosomes make up less than 5% of all genes.  So even if you get a Y chromosome from your father, you're still pretty close to 50/50 (maybe somewhere around 53%/47% mother/father).</p>
<p>What is much less clear though is genetic expression.  Just because 53% of your genes from your mother doesn't mean you're going to have 53% of her traits.  Your genes are like a complex set of rules for a game.  Some rules might cancel out or override other rules in certain situations, so you might have a but of genes that appear not to be used.  </p>
<p>There are certain traits in humans, such as eye color, that you may have heard referred to as dominant/recessive.  This means one trait (brown eyes) always wins out over another trait (blue eyes) when you inherit one set of each genes from your parents.  So you might have received the blue-eyed gene from your mother, but end up with brown eyes because of your father.  Reasons such as these is why you might end up looking 70% like your father, even though only 47% of your genes are from him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as getting genes from your parents, it's more complicated than just 50/50. </p>
<p>The chromosome that determines your genotypic gender are either X or Y chromsomes. If you get an X from mom and an X from dad, you are a female. If you get an X from mom and Y from dad then you are a male. It is true that the Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome. </p>
<p>There are 22 other pairs of chromosomes that make up your DNA. One chromosome from each pair comes from your mom and one comes from your dad. So genotypically, yes you get an almost exactly 50/50 split initially. </p>
<p>When an egg meets a sperm, fertilization happens, and the chromosome from mom and chromosomes from dad have a possibility of meeting up and mixing amongst the pairs. This can cause changes in the DNA. </p>
<p>Not to mention that not all your genes are expressed equally either. There are a huge number of factors that determine which of your genes are expressed or not. </p>
<p>Of course this is all assuming you have no DNA mutations. </p>

<p>Here is the answer, in song form:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osWuWjbeO-Y" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osWuWjbeO-Y</a></p>
<p>In short, no. It's not 50/50, &quot;Slightly more than half of everything [we are] is thanks to [mom]&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Males have more genetic materials from the mom given the X chromosome is larger than the Y.</li>
<li>Your mitochondria contains genetic material and that comes 100% from your mom. AFAIK, sperm has mitochondria in the tail but looses them when entering the egg.</li>
<li>On top of that most of your &quot;genetic framework&quot; (Mrna, transcription factors...) come from your mom.</li>
<li>Finally the prenatal environment has an effect in your epigenetics. This is largely overlooked since it's not exactly your genetic code, but it shapes you in a big way. A large part of that prenatal environment comes from your mom (temperature, hormone exposure etc.).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone has given a proper answer here, so I'll see if I can make a very clear answer.</p>
<p>Take a look at this photo of chipped glass pieces: <a href="https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1P_vdHXXXXXbeaXXXq6xXFXXXb/200217028/HTB1P_vdHXXXXXbeaXXXq6xXFXXXb.jpg" target="_blank">Photo</a></p>
<p>Notice how the glass has bright reflections in it on the edges. Yet if it were not ground up you'd just see the green color you see in some other parts of the photo.</p>
<p>This is the effect of scintillation or light bouncing around inside an object, and the effect of being redirected and focused or spread out. This is exactly why a diamond is shiny where as a sheet of glass is clear.</p>
<p>The exact same process is happing with the water. It's like taking a big sheet of clear material and turning it into many very very small sparking gemstones. The gemstones will appear far brighter, because they reflect light most of the time, while the sheet appears clear most of the time. Flat planes like lakes only shine in at one angle which is why you get a blinding reflection of the setting sun off the water but <em>not</em> off the waterfall. That's where the extra brightness is coming from.</p>
<p>The thing that turns a dark surface of water into bright waterfall is millions of tiny air pockets being trapped in the water. These then act like the above mentioned gemstones and sparkle inside the water itself, making it lighter. So the millions of tiny diamonds in water make it white. That's how I usually teach this to kids.</p>
<p>Hopefully that helped.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a nice example of a macro photo of water foam, you can see the reflection of the window on the bubbles giving them brightness, but the window is not reflected on the undistubed water. <a href="https://previews.123rf.com/images/aga7ta/aga7ta1501/aga7ta150100195/35759505-foam-bubbles-on-blue-water-background-Stock-Photo.jpg" target="_blank">Photo</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a similar mechanic to crushing glass into a powder. You could use that to illustrate the process, as glass goes from transparent to white, the more finely you ground it. I do admit though, that this is maybe not the safest thing to do with your child...</p>
<p>The reason for both materials turning white is the increased amount of surfaces. When you have a still body of water, you have one surface. Light will reflect in this, it works like a mirror. The only difference to a mirror is, that part of the light goes through the surface layer, instead of being reflected. This is why you also can see below the surface of the water. Because of the even surface, just like a mirror, any light that gets reflected, gets reflected at a constant angle. This means you reflect the whole picture.</p>
<p>If you were to roughen up the surface of a mirror, the light would not be reflected in the same direction, but in a <a href="https://www.online-sciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/reflection-of-light-44.gif" target="_blank">random direction</a>. This is the reason why roughed glass gets milky and white. This might also be a safer example to show your kid. Buy a piece of plexi glass, show how it reflects light (and pictures, like the water), then rough it up.</p>
<p>Now back to the water. When you start stirring the water, the light still reflects, but the picture gets less clear. You will start to see only jumbled forms. If it is really rough, air will be trapped in the water, creating bubbles. Those also have surfaces, where the light reflects. Remember the light that goes through the top surface of the water? Some of this might now hit the bubble and be reflected back towards the surface.</p>
<p>Now you have a waterfall. This means you have lots and lots of bubbles in the water. Because of that, basically all the light gets reflected back out, as it is reflected of the bubbles. But as the bubbles are very uneven, just like your roughened glass, the light gets reflected back in random directions. This is why you get an even white, instead of a clear picture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Petwins is right. It's the same mechanism that makes a cloud white - it's a lot of water droplets spaced out in air, which scatter light uniformly, making it white (all colors represented equally). Any suspension of particles larger than the wavelength of light (400-800 nm) will tend to do this. </p>
<p>This is also why milk is white, even though it's mostly water (clear) and suspended &quot;butter&quot; particles (yellow) - the size and distribution of the fat particles causes the same kind of uniform light reflections, making it white. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> changed wavelength units from µm to nm - thanks u/HuntertheGoose for pointing it out. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> The technical term for this kind of scattering is &quot;Mie scattering&quot; -- thanks u/UniqueMumbles for the addition</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering</a>,  <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/mch/sct.rxml" target="_blank">http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/mch/sct.rxml</a></p>
<p>It's related to Rayleigh scattering, which is when you have slightly smaller particles, and is the reason the sky is blue, because the particle size is small enough to select blue light preferentially. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reasons clouds are white. </p>
<p>Water is clear but it also reflects light. Anytime a wave (like light) travels through one clear medium and transitions to another with a different density, like water, some of the wave will get reflected back. It’s just like an echo. When a sound wave travels through air and hits a denser material (like a wall) some portion of it it reflects back too. </p>
<p>Ever see a slinky demonstration of a wave? If one end is tied to something that doesn’t vibrate as fast (is denser) it will echo and some of the wave will bounce back (reflect). </p>
<p>It does this because incident (incoming) waves move faster through the air than through the water so some of the waves behind it crash into the slowed down waves and have to reverse direction. To dissipate. </p>
<p>So, when water is frothed, light transitions from air to water and back over and over. It acts like a thousand little mirrors, reflecting back part of the wave like the surface of the water does. The overlapping reflections blend together and gives the color that light gives when many colors are mixed together - white. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to rail in the U.S., there's basically two places: The Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington corridor, and the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Rail used to be the main way to get between cities in the U.S., but the Interstate offered faster and more convenient travel for those with a car, and really long distances like going from one coast to the other can only be done quickly by air. (For instance, even the fastest high-speed trains wouldn't be competitive for the New York to Los Angeles route.)</p>
<p>Amtrak, the national rail company, doesn't own its tracks in most of the country, so its trains often have to wait for freight trains to go first. Coverage and routes are limited. If you live in Memphis, you can go to Chicago fine, but getting to St. Louis might take days even though it's only four hours by car.</p>
<p>For the big cities between Boston and Washington, rail is still ideal. Traffic is bad, many people don't use cars, and airports are far from the city center. Traditional rail still does pretty well, and high-speed rail would be incredible. There's still two problems. One is crash-test regulations, which force trains to be heavier and slower than foreign counterparts. (Other countries don't have such strict regulations; rail collisions are quite rare, and traveling by train is much safer than by automobile anyway.) The other is simply the cost of building rail lines in that area which can handle high-speed rail. Amtrak's proposal for true high-speed rail in that corridor is projected to cost over $100 billion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of reasons, all of which are covered very well in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbEfzuCLoAQ" target="_blank">video by wendover</a>.</p>
<p>Population density is partly to be blamed but there are certain routes (eg DC to Boston via Philly and NY) that would be perfect for a high speed train. There is an existing rail system and in fact it has been doing very well.
Amtrak is a company that was created with the aim to make &quot;train travel great again&quot; and to build high speed trains in the future. Unfortunately <del>it is fairly new and other</del> <em>freight</em> companies already own the train tracks and Amtrak has to rent it. Comparatively, the SNCF in France owns all the tracks in France. So now, if BNSF has a train on the tracks and there is an Amtrak train coming, the latter will have to wait for the slower  train to finish first. You end up with a cyclic problem of the train suck and with people thinking that it sucks, less income to improve it. Building new tracks is extremely costly and is not really a project that any sane person would like to undertake. </p>
<p>Edit: BNSF not BNCF and strikethrough/italic</p>
<p>Hopefully we get the hyperloop though and that will be amazing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of comments here. One I haven't seen mentioned:</p>
<p>The US has the most efficient and heavily used <strong>freight</strong> rail system in the world. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16636101" target="_blank">Economist</a></p>
<p>We have a lot of rail, we use it for moving stuff rather than people. The transcon mainlines move a crazy amount of cargo. Hundreds of trains a day like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZtPUDlnmZ0" target="_blank">this</a> going across the country on them.</p>
<p>Moving stuff efficiently and moving people efficiently are largely incompatible. Freight efficiency means huge, slow (comparatively) trains. Moving people efficiently means high speeds. You basically can't mix a lot of both on the same tracks and get anything useful out of it. Europe opts using it's rail primarily for people, we use it primarily for stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Population density. The population density of France is about 300 people per square mile, and that's one of the lower values for Europe. Germany is 600, Italy is 500, Netherlands are 1000, UK is 700.</p>
<p>There are only 8 US states with a population density above 300/sq mi, and except for Florida, all of them are in the Northeast, where the US does have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acela_Express" target="_blank">something resembling high speed rail</a>. </p>
<p>35/50 states have a population density less than 200/sq mi and 24/50 are less than 100/sq mi. </p>
<p>So it's just too few big cities too far apart. You could maybe extend the existing Northeast system south to Charlotte, NC and west to Detroit or Chicago, but after that, the number of big cities starts dropping off pretty fast. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Enough of our cities do not have self-contained public transportation so HSR between cities will not be convenient enough to deter people from driving. This is because once you get to a city, you still need to get around. Although you can Uber, the combined cost of HSR ticket and Uber make the convenience of driving yourself the &quot;best&quot; option.</p>
<p>Before we invest in HSR BETWEEN cities, IMO, we should invest in building public transportation WITHIN cities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the earth is collection of huge 'plates' that float over a layer of partly solid and partly molten rock called magma; collectively  referred to as  the earth's 'mantle'. These plates floating on the mantle are called 'Tectonic Plates'. They are in constant, if very slow, motion. Where the plates bump against each other there is friction and pressure. The 'Ring of Fire' is where the edges of the plates meet. The fire in The 'Ring of Fire' refers to volcanos  created when one tectonic plate is shoved under another. This movement of the ocean floor produces a &quot;mineral transmutation,&quot; which leads to the melting  of magma  bubbling out at a gap in the seams: that is volcanos.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are caused by buckling and cracking of the earth's plates caused by the pressure of them pushing together at the seams. The pressure is so great that 'something has to give'. One of the plates moves violently, and that is called an earthquake.</p>
<p>We know that the earthquakes are related in the sense that they occur because of a particular plate moving in a general direction. What we don't know is the specific reasons underlying the movement of any particular plate, the speed of the movement, or the specific amount of pressure required to cause a quake. </p>
<p>As for the danger to California, yes, someday there will be a disaster, and since we know where the plate seam is, we can roughly predict where. However, we don't understand enough of the variables to say <em>when</em>, even within an error range of a thousand years. </p>
<p>I prefer to take to the approach of the late Warren Zevon on the danger to me personally from 'the big one' in California.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>And if California should fall into the ocean, like the mystics and statistics say it will, I predict my hotel will stay standing until I pay my bill.....and I never will.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Californian here who studied a bit of geology. </p>
<p>California building codes assume there will be earthquakes. We bolt our houses to their foundations and use materials that can handle ground movement. You won't see brick buildings in CA.  That being said, there are still a lot of old buildings that I would never live in.  Retrofit or not, I'd never live in a masonry building. </p>
<p>Having 5+ quakes is actually a good thing. They relieve stress on the plates. The more 5s we get, the longer it will be before we have an 8.</p>
<p>So, is there a lot of activity in the ring of fire?  Yes.  Should Californians be worried?  No, but they should be prepared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
