		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really are a lot of factors, some of them mentioned already, I'll try to explain a few more.</p>
<p>Culturally, there is something in Afghanistan called 'pastunwali' which is a set of rules that are followed by nearly all Afghans. It has many facets, one of them is to welcome and protect visitors. This will come into play later. To really understand the issue in Afghanistan, you have to know the historical connotations to what went on.</p>
<p>So, in the mid 80's, the Russian's were pushed out of Afghanistan. Like many other countries (Britian, and eventually the US) they found that it would just cost too much money to stay. For around 8 years or so, there was somewhat of an ad hoc communist government, although it was limited to really the main cities (Kabul, Jalalbad, Herat, Konduz, Kandahar). The rest of Afghanistan (80-90%) was  run by warlords. To make a long story short, there ended up being two factions. The pro government forces, and the Taliban, which emerged from one of the warlords (Mullah Mohammad Omar). To fight the government, the Taliban needed money and training, and it called upon al Qaeda to do so. </p>
<p>Although they supplied funding and training, Afghanistan became the 'place to jihad', only because at the time, there other place was Chechnya fighting the Russians, and the Russians were using 'scorch earth' policies...which consisted of of carpet bombing whole villages and areas that were deemed enemy terrority. </p>
<p>So, while there was money and training involved, these members of al Qaeda were coming in droves to Afghanistan, but really didn't care about the fight going on. Eventually, the fight became a stalemate, and areas were set up for both sides.... and al Qaeda never left, but after 9/11, there was the cultural practice to protect their 'visitors', which did happen. </p>
<p>Pakistan</p>
<p>While the Afghans do protect their visitors, they are very 'eye for an eye', so after about a month of refusing to turn over Bin Laden, the US just started a bombing campaign, and most Afghans were really ok with it. The majority of al Qaeda was holed up in the Tora Bora mountains, which is in eastern Afghanistan near Jalalabad. (If you're going to be a terrorist, that's a really beautiful place, as well as Nuristan where the rest remain today). The idea was to start bombing, push the al Qaeda forces east to the awaiting Pakistan border, where their army would either capture or kill the renaming forces. Essentially, the Pakistan army opened up, and allowed them safe haven in Pakistan, and the US was kinda stuck. </p>
<p>There are a myriad of terrorist organizations that are allowed safe haven in Pakistan. The Haqqani (which sees its self as the Taliban, although the DIA has been trying to make them their own organization for years) is stationed in Miram Shah Pakistan. This was the organization that had Bergdahl. </p>
<p>The Lashkar-e-Tabia is based in Pakistan, and they are fighting the dispute between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir Area. </p>
<p>There's a whole bunch, and I'm on mobile, but many believe these various forces are the military action army of the Pakistan intelligence service (ISI). </p>
<p>Uzbekistan</p>
<p>Uzbekistan kinda of took a hard stance against Islam. Captured everyone that was coming and going to a mosque, put them in swimming pools and shot them all. This in turn formed the IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan) which operated out of Northern Afghanistan. </p>
<p>In there end, there are a ton of factions that can operate freely in Afghanistan, and do so, as well as Pakistan. And although some has changed, the Afghan people still operate under Pashtunwali, and both host and protect these various organizations. </p>
<p>To note, many of the other responses are also true, its really a hodgepodge of reasons for their situation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of comments talking about the invasions and toppling of governments by various world powers, but I think that's a symptom more than a root cause. IMHO, the root cause is more like that Afghanistan never really developed a firm, centralized power structure.</p>
<p>I don't know as much about this as I'd like, and it doesn't seem to be super well documented, but the process of increasing amounts of power being held by central National governments at the expense of tribes, cities, and regions seems to have mostly happened in Europe through the course of the Renaissance times. It took a while, and had a lot of hiccups, conflicts, etc, but eventually, the National-level government got to the point of being able to reliably exercise authority over all of the more regional governments within its territory. This goes hand-in-hand with many facets of modernism, like unifying language and minimizing accents, establishing a national currency, standardizing on weights and measures, building roads and keeping them open, etc. This has happened at various levels over most of the planet, though at different times and in different ways in many places.</p>
<p>For some reason, this never seems to have happened in Afghanistan at all. There's a central government, but it basically only exists in the big cities, and not necessarily even all of those. The majority of the country is only dimly aware of the existence of the supposed national government, and it as essentially no meaning to their lives. This goes the same for all of the trappings of having a strong national government of any ideology or structure. All of the stuff I mentioned in the previous paragraph, plus things like being aware of or participating in the global media cycle, being connected to the global economy, being exposed to the sort of cultural mish-mash that is the modern world.</p>
<p>It's kind of a natural fit for many sects of radical Islamic ideology. The ancient culture and lack of connection to the global economy kinda fits in with a lot of what many of these extremist ideologies seem to think. The National government is barely aware of the existence of most of these tribes and villages, and has no real power to do much of anything in them. The people who live there only really care about their tribe and maybe the next few over, and talk of things like the Nation of Afghanistan, America, New York, jetliners and skyscrapers, it might as well be on Mars. For that matter, most modern Westerners have probably thought a lot more about Mars than these villagers would think of any of these things. A great place to hide out of you are wanted basically in the entire civilized world - the idea of you being found, or of someone reporting you, would be basically crazy.</p>
<p>So all of this was already the case before any of the modern foreign invasions really got started. But they sure didn't help. It's hard enough to get villagers used to bowing to the power of a national government when it's a national government run by your people. It's a whole different matter when the national government is run by what to you seems like a dizzying array of alien cultures from the other side of the planet. Just when a few people start to think that maybe these foreigners have something going and participating in the global economy might not be so bad, they get tired of it and leave you right back where you were, validating the people who wanted to have nothing to do with them. It's easy to send a foreign army into one or a handful of villages, but controlling all of them all the time is impossible. So Afghanistan is basically ungovernable now, and there's not much incentive for that to change anytime in the near future. Meanwhile, most of the surrounding countries seem to have more or less successfully centralized power, so while they may have problems, they don't have the kind of problems that Afghanistan has. And the reason why that is, I don't know, and I'm not so sure anybody knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were constituent republics of the Soviet Union for some 70 years and, thus, heavily controlled. The Soviets had no patience for religious freedom and stamped it out whenever and wherever they felt it threatening to the absolute authority of the state.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991-92, those republics became independent and have largely remained controlled by dictatorial strongmen who feel about as kindly towards Islamist extremism as the Soviets did.</p>
<p>Afghanistan, by contrast, has been a factional, semi-lawless psuedo-state off and on for many decades with well-funded** and organized Islamist militants vying for control against the various Afghan nationalist clans and, for a while, the Soviets. So for a long time it's been highly fertile ground for that hotbed of religious extremism to develop.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very perceptive question.</p>
<p>You have touched on one of the fundamental flaws of Newtonian gravity: the fact that it is &quot;non-local&quot;.</p>
<p>We know that the speed of light must be constant in all frames of reference, and yet Newton's formulation of gravity requires that gravitating bodies <em>instantaneously</em> know where everything else is, as you mention in your question.</p>
<p>So one of the motivators of general relativity was to develop a <em>local</em> theory; i.e. one in which the effects of gravity on a body are simply the results of some feature of its IMMEDIATE surroundings.</p>
<p>And so we describe gravity as the effect of <em>curved</em> spacetime.  We imagine that all masses cause a curvature in spacetime around them, and this curvature distorts the paths of other bodies in the vicinity.</p>
<p>So the &quot;gravity&quot; felt by a body is simply the effect of the curvature of spacetime in its immediate region.  This removes the issues of non-locality since no information needs to be transmitted at higher-than-light speeds.</p>
<p>I hope this explanation helps, feel free to ask follow-up questions.</p>
<p>Edit: I've mentioned this a little lower down in the comment chain, but it is an important point which belongs here too: <em>changes</em> to curvature propagate at the speed of light.  i.e. if, through some truly epic disaster, the sun suddenly popped out of existence, we would not encounter the effects until about 8 minutes later.  This is due to the fact that <em>information</em> cannot travel faster than light (in a vacuum).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you hold a ball, it <em>already</em> wants to fall. Gravity has been affecting it all along. The atom on the other side of the planet had <em>already</em> been pulling on the atom in the ball. The only thing that changed when it fell was that you let it go.</p>
<p>If the atom on the other side of the earth were to suddenly disappear, the atom in the ball would not feel it until 0.042 seconds later (speed of light fast). It would get a <em>little</em> lighter in your hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i always thought of it like: the speed of light is actually the max speed of spacetime. so everything within spacetime is limited to that speed. the curvature of space can move at max speed because it is massless and spacetime imposes something like friction to mass because it distorts it, which requires more energy to move faster (infinte to get to the speed of light). when mass is pure energy and no longer mass it is light and thus rides along the max speed of spacetime because it has no resistance. this is just how i think so in sure ill be criticized for not having sources. so gravity really is just a ripple in spacetime which is what defines the speed of light and not the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, it all boils down to whatever is contractually obligated.  To answer your second question, the AFM (musicians union) doesn't have any specific language in their contract requiring that musicians be listed in credits of film, so it just doesn't happen.  For films that are recorded non-union, most likely it's actually the players themselves that don't want to be listed, as a lot of films record on &quot;dark days&quot; meaning union players playing in a non-union recording session, which is against the AFM bylaws. (In other words, if an AFM player did a non-union indie dark, and then had their name in the credits, they'd find themselves in trouble fairly quickly and facing some serious fines)</p>
<p>For songs in film versus TV being listed, if often does come down to the time constraints of music being one of the last things to be finalized.  For TV, it's quite often that the end credits for a show have already been completed for a particular episode before final music choices have been made, so there isn't a way to include it.  Additionally, there can be upwards of 20-30 songs (that you would see listed used in a film) in a single 30-minute TV program, and there just isn't time to list them (TV end credit beds are pre-determined length and rarely vary from episode to episode).  </p>
<p>Tldr; contracts require different things for different formats</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, the top answer is the correct one, But another contributing factor is this:</p>
<p>TV shows want to save as much time as possible, because they have a small window of time to fill, and the tv stations want people to keep watching, so television shows try to have as short of credits as possible. They will usually do the minimum required, and have the credits go as fast as possible. Often leaving out things like VFX people and merely mentioning the VFX companies involved. </p>
<p>Movies however are not concerned with how long the credits are, and longer credits actually make a movie seem like a bigger deal. So a lot of movies pad out the credits with as much information as possible, not only do they list every person who worked at each VFX company for example. They even have absurd new things they're doing like &quot;production babies&quot; which is just a list of all the children that were born to employees who worked on the movie during its production. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree about the assertion that resonant frequencies are the source of your interpreted mood. Often the supporting arguments dwell on specific chords and don't account for harmonic context.</p>
<p>It is often thought that a major chord is interpreted as &quot;bright and happy,&quot; but what you really mean is that the &quot;major keys&quot; sound bright and happy.</p>
<p>I'll give you an example. There is a chord called the Neopolitan 6th. It is technically a major triad, but if you play this chord in the context of a minor progression (as a traditional N6-V7-i resolution), it doesn't sound happy at all, but moody. This is because of its harmonic context (it is rooted on the flattened 2nd which is harmonically unstable and demands resolution)</p>
<p>Here's some evidence. Moonlight Sonata is a very popular classical piece where this chord is used very early on. Click on this link and play the piece. Where you see the notation &quot;bII 6,&quot; this is the Neopolitan chord. Examine how it feels to you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/ludwig-van-beethoven/piano-sonata-no-14-moonlight-1st-movement" target="_blank">https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/ludwig-van-beethoven/piano-sonata-no-14-moonlight-1st-movement</a></p>
<p>Another example would be Dominant chords, which are major triads with a minor seventh. This chord contains not only a major second interval (which is very dissonant) but also an augmented fourth (commonly known as a tritone) between the seventh and third of the chord (also very dissonant). If you prepare this chord properly in a major key, the resulting sound is not dark but bright and pleasant despite its inherent instability.</p>
<p>Here's some more evidence. This is a transcription of the same Moonlight Sonata in a major key. Try to follow along with the link I posted earlier. Every time it says &quot;V&quot; of any sort....this is the Dominant chord. Examine how it feels in this context. Only bother with the first few measures that are present. The rest of the transcription is very awkward.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it has to do with the resonant frequency of the individual chords. Some are extremely pure and propagate linearly while others are really &quot;shaky&quot; and propagate with different types of noise. Think about the difference between someone singing well and someone screeching. The difference has to do with how pure the wave is. </p>
<p>When chords travel, if the individual notes travel perfectly together they are usually the major chords. For the minor chords (or even the chords you make up that sound awful), the individual notes are destructively aligned and create a wave that doesn't propagate perfectly together; instead, the standing chord wave seems to travel backwards as well as forwards due to how the individual waves add up (the pure standing chord wave seems not travel at all). </p>
<p>Our ears simply hear these frequencies and take them to be either pure which sounds good and evokes good feelings, or we hear the minor chords that aren't pure which evoke bad feelings.</p>
<p>Its hard to explain, i hope this comment isnt completely confusing. Im sure someone else can explain it better.</p>
<p>edit 1 and 2: trying to make more sense. Also, i think OP was looking for a biological reason to why this happens, instead of the physics reason which i gave so idk if this is what op was looking for</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Download a piano app, we're going all in.</p>
<p>While it's downloading, think of all the songs you heard or sang as a child.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday or Mary Had a Little Lamb are great examples (and you should look up how to play them when we're done here!)</p>
<p>These songs are in a &quot;major&quot; key, which basically is what we associate with happy in music.</p>
<p>To understand, check out this diagram I made.
<a href="http://imgur.com/3CUdEsu" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/3CUdEsu</a></p>
<p>Play the &quot;major&quot; notes, all white keys, in order. Notice the note labeled B next to the top note, C? This is what gives major keys the sound we love so much: the <strong>leading tone</strong>. Between most notes, you will see a black piano key. But between E and F, along with B and C, we have nothing.</p>
<p>Alone, no two piano keys next to each other have this effect, but because we started on C, the B is <em>leading</em> us into C again.</p>
<p>So basically, major keys make us feel happy and complete.</p>
<p>But within a major key, there is a lot more going on. For example, there are major and minor &quot;chords&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minor chords in a major key? What's going on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes that's right! In fact, within the white keys is another key signature which we call &quot;A minor.&quot; Test it out now and play it through!</p>
<p>You'll notice, unlike in C major, we do not have a leading tone in this sequence of notes (which we call a scale).
You may also notice that these are technically the same notes as before, don't get too hung up on this!</p>
<p>What you need to know is that in these two scales there is one big difference, the leading tone. In minor keys we don't experience the completeness that major keys have to offer, so they sound a lot more ambiguous and we don't know where they're going.</p>
<p>Both key signatures though, use both types of chords (in fact, there are many other types of chords). If you want to play around with this, play alternating notes together (C-E-G, D-F-A, etc) and you'll notice that some sound very different than others. But they're all white keys!</p>
<p>In short, the difference between A minor and C major is where we start. In C major, we want B to move into C. But there's nothing inherently happy about C or sad about A, it's just where we start, and what notes are played accompanying these notes.</p>
<p>Part of our association with these sets of notes is because of sound-waves and how our ears interpret them, and part of it is because we are raised listening to a lot of major sounding music.</p>
<p>We listen to this music because its a lot easier to sing, not because it's inherently happy. So it's kinda confusing.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this didn't make sense, I spent a lot of time on it but I have to acknowledge that I'm only just getting into music education and still have a lot to learn.
I'd be happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p>Please check out these resources. Do not shy away from music theory, it will only make you enjoy listening to music more!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two terms I can think of that can relate to driving drowziness. The first term although not directly causing sleep is called <em>Highway Hypnosis</em>. This is where a driver can go for a long period of time driving, not remembering any or all of the trip. Also called sleeping with your eyes opened, has been related to a lot of drivers dosing off to actually falling asleep, or causing accidents, although there has been incidents where drivers have made safe decisions in this state of mind. This phenomenon is most common along highways, the view staying the same, your brain doesn't have to register much information, you stay at a steady cruise, and fail to store the short term memory of driving, although you may be thinking of other things. The second term, <em>Carcolepsy</em>. There's a few factors to sleep, and a large one is comfort. Physically and mentally. If you're a regular driver, and you have the chance to be a passenger you have a sense of relief, a comforting sense, you don't have to worry so you tend to doze off. Although I've only mentioned a few, there are alot more factors that play into this. Mental exhaustion, depression, maybe a certain medicine you use. On a personal note, I can rarely ever doze off in a car due to a bad accident I was in a few years ago, I was awake at the time but no matter who it is I have to be awake and alert, I speak for myself when I say, you can't trust any driver on the road. One blink of an eye and your whole life is gone, so OP you may get a bunch of knowledge from reddit, but I recommend just explaining to a doctor at your next checkup. Better safe then sorry because there may be some other underlying issue. If you have any more questions just ask, I have nothing to do on this long car ride from Florida to Maryland, besides stay awake ;). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So, I was doing my Fire Inspector training and I was able to test this at a newly built NFL stadium about 4 years ago. We called it the &quot;Super bowl.&quot;</p>
<p>We recruited local Girl and Boy Scout organizations, schools, and had volunteers sign up to flush all the toilets in the stadium at exactly the same time. The purpose of this was to test the plumbing and simulating &quot;half-time&quot; when most attendees go to the restroom. As the local fire department we were assessing the stadiums ability to handle that much pressure loss. The reasoning is the sprinkler systems require a certain amount of pressure and we wanted to simulate the worst case scenario: Fire during half-time when everyone is busy flushing shit, literally. </p>
<p>Tldr; Fire department I was at did this at a NFL stadium being constructed. We had volunteers flush all the toilets as a stress test, called it the &quot;Super bowl.&quot; Nothing exploded.</p>
<p>Edit: Inclusion. </p>
<p>Edit 2: System we inspected was getting its water supply from a small body of water nearby. Our fire department was ensuring that this eco-friendly water system was capable of handling a heavy workload (bunch of flushing at same time) and still maintain enough pressure for fire sprinklers while being stressed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>Water supply pressure will drop. If you have a high building, water could flow back to lower sinks by gravity.  </li>
<li>An air bubble will be trapped inside the sewer lines. Between the flush of floor 1 and the flushes of floors above. This air bubble wants to get out of the way. The air will take the easiest route, which could result in your toilet &quot;exploding&quot; or pushing all water back trough the sifon. The sifon is the j shape that prevents smells from leaving the sewer.</li>
</ol>
<p>We used to have this problem with our toilet on heavy rain. All the water would storm its way down the sewer pipes. And since we were at the lower part of town, the air pushed away by the water would let our toilet &quot;explode&quot; the sifon contents on the ceiling.</p>
<p>An extra vent was placed in the streets to be the easiest path for the air. It has not happened since then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>With blue and red stars, most of the radiation is outside our visible range, so we can just see where it enters at one edge of our range (ie, blue or red). Green is in the middle of the visible range.</p>
<p>In other words, the light is too broad a spectrum to be &quot;saturated&quot;, ie, even when the peak wavelength is green, the presence of blue and red will just make it look white. Look at the first chart in that wikipedia page - the curve shows the black body colour, which never enters the green region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colour of stars is a combination of the frequencies emitted by the source,  which as people have mentioned is a black body spectrum,  the intensity of each frequency which is lost due to scattering in the atmosphere and the way your eye sees colour in terms of the responses of the three (for some people four ) cones cells in your eyes. The sun actually briefly looks green just as it drops below the horizon due to refraction. </p>
<p>Looking at stars in the sky your eyes will be operating in low light conditions known as scotopic vision, which actually alters your perception of colour anyway, so it is hard to gauge the true colour of stars by eye.  Frankly why things are the colour they are is actually quite a deep question!  But the primary reason is the combination of frequencies that make up a black body source cannot ever be the colour we have evolved to see as &quot;green&quot; nor can it be pink for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason for using oil is just to make a thermal path between the pan and the food, so the food doesn't only cook exactly where it touches.</p>
<p>The reason boiling doesn't achieve browning, is that water cannot be heated above 100C, except at extreme pressures. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" target="_blank">Maillard Reaction</a> is commonly what turns food brown and produces a pleasant taste, and this happens at 140 to 160 C.</p>
<p>And according to: <a href="http://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-frying" target="_blank">http://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-frying</a></p>
<p>&quot;When food is plunged into hot oil, the water in the food starts to boil and percolate toward the surface. In order for a crisp, dry crust to develop, there must be a barrier between the hot oil and the migrating water. This barrier is typically something starchy. As the starch fries in the hot oil, it dries into a pleasantly crisp shell and protects the moisture beneath. The food inside steams while the coating browns and crisps.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: As /u/Choralone points out below, the Maillard reaction can take place at lower temperatures, but very slowly. So cooking items over several hours can sometimes produce similar results, but perhaps not with the types of food that are normally fried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a sense the answer is a matter of definition: &quot;frying&quot; means &quot;cooking food in oil.&quot; But that doesn't explain why it's a good idea.</p>
<p>Air is very bad at transferring heat, so if you cook food in a completely dry pan, it will only cook where the food touches the pan. Oil and water are much better at transferring heat, so if you put either of those in the pan with the food, it will cook much better, much more evenly, without burning at the spots where it touches the bottom.</p>
<p>The difference between oil and water is that water absorbs a load of energy when it gets to 100⁰C and then evaporates, keeping the temperature of the water at 100 degrees (even if you heat the pan loads) and, once it stops doing that, no longer providing that heat transfer function it used to. Oils have a much higher boiling point so they heat up way more. This is important because food tastes better if it's been cooked at a higher temperature; the Maillard reaction happens at about 150⁰C so it can happen in hot oil but not hot water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because removing water from food concentrates flavour and facilitates the creation of The Mallard Reaction (browning) and since oil can reach temperatures higher than water, cooking in oil allows for the fast and easy removal of water while at the same time cooking the food. You can never achieve the Mallard Reaction by boiling food, boiled food never ever browns. And &quot;frying in air&quot; is the same thing, you are using hot air to heat the oil that's already in the food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As explained by several here there were numerous contraceptive methods. Abortions existed in various forms, though their risk and effectiveness was rather varied. Taken early many herbal concoctions (read; poisons) could induce a miscarriage, assuming the pregnancy had not in itself already miscarried anyways (the most common form of 'abortion' is a nonviable embryo or fetus being flushed out; often perceived as little more than a late period)</p>
<p>There was also, of course, temples. Virgin Births have always been a staple of religions (as has resurrection for anything demideity or above). The common claim to avoid any stigma from young unwed mothers was that Zeus did it. These children would be left to the temple, and while everyone understood what's really going on (except for some of the more naive) given the circumstances often involved it was extremely uncouth to not at least pretend.</p>
<p>Later on this was replaced to a degree by convents. Girls caught &quot;embarrassing&quot; their families would be sent to the nunnery, where many would presumably discover a poor orphaned baby a few months down the road after a miracle diet. My own grandmother had extensive experience as a midwife for the nearby convent in 1930s canada: Many nuns would come to her small town for a 'spiritual retreat' from the larger cities and return after they'd lost some weight, discovering a poor abandoned child alongside the road. While it was more often first-time nuns visiting, she had some rather dedicated regulars. In some cases that was a bit of a problem; there historically has been much abuse of nuns by the clergy. Yes, that kind of abuse (estimated 40% of nuns)</p>
<p>It was ... impolite to point out simple facts among the congregation though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: source </p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Alan Moore's notes for his own From Hell:</p>
<p>The trick by which a prostitute would hold the penis between her thighs to simulate intercourse without penetration was allegedly a common one during the period (and unfortunately recorded in a source that I am presently unable to trace) stated that during twenty years working as a prostitute in the East End of London, she had only been penetrated twice the rest of the time fobbing the customer with the trick...'

The woman could (ideally if the man was drunk) hold is penis between her thighs rather than actually entering her to avoid pregnancy.</p>
<p>*On a related note there was some coded language when soliciting sex. A man may explain to a women that he &quot;wished to get to hairyfordshire, but only had thruppence (i.e. three pence) for the fare... For a prostitute this would obviously be a request for sex, but could otherwise (if necessary) be innocently explained as a request for money to pay for the fare to get to the county of Herefordshire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Different herbs have been used as birth control or to induce miscarriage. Sometimes animal intestines or treated linen were used as condoms until rubber condoms were made in the 1850s. You can still buy lambskin condoms if you have a latex allergy. Some cultures used different things to block semen, like sponges, citrus peels, crocodile poop, etc.  </p>
