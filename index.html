Up to a certain point, you have to start making educated guesses, based both on modern-day descendants and modern-day analogues. So, say we had absolutely no images or depictions of anything even vaguely &quot;mammoth-y&quot; from prehistory, we'd be able to tell that it probably had a very elephant-like trunk based on comparison with modern-day elephant skulls and knowledge of how the animal could physically be built.</p>
<p>But, I mean, after a certain point you do slightly have to start making educated guesses. It varies from fossil to fossil though, and paleontologists are clever people. We're pretty good at guessing this stuff, and our guesses usually turn out to be right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Imagine the LHC experiment, but with lots of opposing targets. Even half of the LHC energy (eg one accelerated particle hitting a particle at rest) is enough to cause the fired particle to breakup and cause a chain reaction of decay and broken up particles.</p>
<p>I'm on my phone and can't get a nice link, but look at how particle detectors like Pierre Auger Observatory or Gamma-ray observatories like VERITAS work. You're basically doing this in reverse sending the particle shower into space instead. Gravity plays no role (at least for the showers I've dealt with).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Graphics aren't everything in an engine. Keep this in mind, as it'll be important throughout the explanation. </p>
<p>First off there's the licensing and cost of running an engine that isn't yours. In the contracts, some companies can charge a % of what you make past x amount. You can imagine the publishers, shareholders, and other such people won't be too keen on losing money the put in. </p>
<p>The next bit is the physics requirements. Each game has different physics. Granted the projectile motion might WORK the same, but you might not get the same distances and etc.</p>
<p>Another issue is how game mechanics can tie in with the engine. UE might not support levelution on the scale that Frostbite can in Battlefield. UE might have issues working Halo's balance of movement, vehicles, and gunplay. There's also necessity. The engine may have stuff you don't need, which has to be cut out or else it just adds to the end file size.</p>
<p>Now we reach the grapics argument. In a sense, why do you WANT realistic graphics in every game? Look at Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch. Both have this cartoon feel to them. Borderlands focuses on their cell shaded approach to their style. Telltale games also do this too. Minecraft is self-explanatory as to why it's not necessary. Graphics and realism is nice, but the art style is where it's at. I can go and make a copy of real life, but where's the enjoyment to it? Where's the flair that separates it from all the other realistic copies? Now that real life copy I made won't sell as it's basically the same as everything else. Now if I accent something, distort the realism to something aesthetic, and capitalize on it, I can sell my copy. It's no longer copy of real life, but rather a copy of life that I see and enjoy.</p>
<p>Another argument is developer preference. It's similar to cost, but this time focusing in on the actual makers, not the investors. You may have guys that are killers with one language, but less so with another. UE4 can force this to happen, instead of just making an engine with what you need. </p>
<p>The last thing is what others are doing. If you just fall in with all the others, you can't set yourself apart. Setting yourself away from others and innovating with your own engine can boost marketing potential. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games" target="_blank">Here's</a> a list of all UE made games. You can see a lot of devs have been using it. You can also see that a lot of popular games don't use it at the same time. DICE has Frostbie, Crytek has Cryengine, 343 has...whatever they call theirs, Bungie has... also whatever they call theirs, Valve has Source, Alien: Isolation was made with a separate engine, Planetside 2 uses Forgelight, CoD games run on the IW Engine, Rainbow Six: Siege runs on the Anvil engine, and there are many other games running other engines.</p>
<p>The reason we hear about UE and its use is that it's publicly marketed to indie developers. You won't get a copy of Forgelight, IW, or Frostbite all that easily like you can with UE or Unity. </p>
<p>Now why did I say to remember that graphics aren't everything? Just look at this mini-essay. The best way to do this is to basically say &quot;Do I REALLY need a superpowered Formula1 engine in my Jeep? It's a great engine, but does it do what I need it to do effectively? Does it fit into my Jeep right? Can it help me with what I do with the Jeep, or is it just for the cool factor? Is this a smart, economically wise, thought out idea?&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR (Lazy copy/paste of quote above this, but this'll make it easier for y'all)</p>
<p>&quot;Do I REALLY need a superpowered Formula1 engine in my Jeep? It's a great engine, but does it do what I need it to do effectively? Does it fit into my Jeep right? Can it help me with what I do with the Jeep, or is it just for the cool factor? Is this a smart, economically wise, thought out idea?&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a game dev, and though I am not an engineer, I'd generally answer something like this...</p>
<p>A game engine is a lot more than just a way to put graphics on the screen. It is a development environment for artists, level designers, animators, programmers, etc. It also manages all the data structures, netcode, etc. of the game and defines their most basic capabilities and functionality. Unreal is great at a lot of things (it has extremely good art and level design tools), but it has some quirks and weaknesses too that don't necessarily mean everything is a win (you wouldn't say, want to make an MMO with it).</p>
<p>Even if we're talking about sheer graphical capabilities alone, Unreal is starting to get beat out on that front by other engines in the last few years. The new Tomb Raider, Metal Gear Solid, Doom, Dishonored, etc. all look just as good if not better than anything you could do in Unreal, and in large part because the engine developers are working directly in tandem with the game developers rather than doing everything &quot;off the shelf&quot;.</p>
<p>There's quite a few other good reasons Unreal has been feeling the squeeze in recent years, too.</p>
<p>For one, the third party publisher-developer behemoths like EA, Activision, Square Enix, etc., the ones who used to keep Unreal afloat, have started pouring massive resources (hundreds of millions of dollars of development) into their own engine tech. About 5-7 years ago they began to realize it was better to do their own tech and have consistent communications, development and engine support structure across all their games and studios, than to depend on a separate company who would <em>maybe</em> get something they really need in for the next release in 6 months. Unreal is great, but if the engine doesn't do what you need it to, or has a critical bug, it can often cause massive stalls and headaches in development.</p>
<p>Then, the competition available from other third parties has got way better too. Unity, especially, has become extremely popular in recent years. That is not a surprise. It might not have the sheer graphical grunt out of the box as other engines. However, it has a well-designed development environment, its generally rapid release rollout often means faster engine bug fixes, the asset store means you don't have to necessarily hire artists and programmers to make everything in your game (VFX is one place this is extremely useful), and of course, there is a massive developer community to turn to for support, and as it's being taught a lot in schools, there are <em>tons</em> of people familiar with Unity out there to help make your game.</p>
<p>What else explains Unreal's decline and Unity's rise? A big part of it is simply that it's cheap, which helps a <em>lot</em> more than most gamers realize, as often game development is, for most studios, more about budget (time/money) limitations than it is technological ones. Unreal also gained a lot of traction because it was one of the first big engines to make its dev tools available to modders - many got their starts doing maps for Unreal and Unreal Tournament, which informed the tastes and needs of an entire generation of game companies. But, that modding culture has since dried up (or at least moved on), so there's less familiarity with and desire to use Unreal among developers. Last, Unity is also very versatile - everything from first-person games, to simulators, to racing games, to RPGs can run on Unity. It doesn't really excel at one particular genre, which on paper sounds bad, but in actuality means a dev team can hop from game to game much more easily.</p>
<p>On the lower end, Game Maker is actually pretty capable, though I don't have a lot of experience with it. But, if you are an indie dev looking to make a 2D game, it's one of the more appealing options out there, and the games likewise will run on tons of target platforms with few if no modifications. There's just no reason for someone like this to even consider Unreal, yet games like Shovel Knight and Hyper Light Drifter have done <em>very</em> well lately. It turns out that 2D games are still awesome, and you don't need to have cutting-edge tech to be successful.</p>
<p>There's two final things I would keep in mind that inform all this:</p>
<p>1) The goal of most game developers is primarily and above all else <em>to ship a product</em>. Anything not in service of that is very liable to get their business killed. Relentless pursuit of tech that is not in service of that goal is wasted time and money. And...</p>
<p>2) Game development is extremely hard, and takes a long time. You are working for years on projects which you <em>hope</em> on paper are going to be good, yet for about 85% or more of a game's life, it's actually a smoldering wreck. There are a <em>million</em> more variables in creating a game - questions like &quot;does the build even start?&quot; or &quot;did the Perforce server go down for the third time this week?&quot; or &quot;shit, we failed cert because someone forgot to test what happens if we leave the Xbox running for 12 hours straight on the main menu, and we have 6 weeks until our ship date, and Microsoft has no remaining cert slots for the next 4 weeks, we're so fucked&quot;, are usually far more important concerns than &quot;does it do graphics good?&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost is a big issue. The engine is free to start using, but you have to pay royalties if you make over a certain amount of money. So for big companies that expect to sell a lot of copies, the price may not be worth it. Admittedly big companies might be able to get a better deal, but they might still find other options make more sense financially.</p>
<p>Being dependent on another company's technology also has some risks. What if Epic go out of business? Or they get bought out and stop selling their engine? Or they change the licensing deals? If those things happen you might find your company left without a tech base to make games with. So some companies prefer to invest in making their own engines so they don't have to worry about what might happen to that other company. Also that means their own staff have in depth knowledge of it instead of needing support from a different company. This also has the advantage that you can build the engine to your own specifications, you have complete freedom to optimise it for the games you want to make.</p>
<p>Unreal isn't perfect either. Its very good, but maybe its just not a good fit for what you want to do. Maybe its easier to make your game in Unity or some other engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to approach your question.</p>
<p>The pedantic answer is that engines can't really &quot;look realistic&quot;, since a game engine doesn't look like anything. They offer features and tools for artists and programmers to realize their vision, but they don't look like anything without the assets the artists create for the game. While games created with the same engine can share some similarities (due to built in assets and effects), most engines are flexible enough to support any kind of art style, realistic or non-realistic. For instance, Dota 2 and Titanfall 2 run on the same engine (Source Engine ^(though heavily modified in both cases)), as do Hearthstone and Cities: Skylines (Unity Engine).</p>
<p>While a good game engine helps with creating believable and realistic-looking environments, it's not the most important factor. The assets (models, textures, animations) are arguably far more important. Creating high quality assets is very time consuming and therefore very expensive. Even though a single developer or a very small team can create a game using Unreal Engine 4 or CryEngine, the game will not look nearly as good (meaning realistic in this context) as one created by an AAA-developer, since they lack the manpower required to create enough high quality assets. The game engine is not the bottleneck, the budget is.</p>
<p>As far as I know for big budget AAA-games Unreal Engine is <em>the</em> most used game engine of all time, and has been extremely popular for the past 15 years. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games" target="_blank">an incomplete list of games built with UE in Wikipedia</a>, and it's absolutely massive. However, the most popular version of the engine is the 3rd version, which is still used for some recently released and upcoming games. While the 3rd version was very advanced at the time, it's over a decade old at this point. The engine's 4th major version was released in 2014, offering a huge leap in graphical fidelity due to several new advanced features. Quite a lot of games have been released on it already, and more are coming in the near future. Games can take a lot of time to develop; a game started in 2014 might take 4 or 5 years to finish it.</p>
<p>Even though it's pretty popular, why isn't it even more popular? Many AAA publishers have their own internal game engines, which they use for multiple different franchises. For instance, EA uses DICE's Frostbite engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frostbite_games" target="_blank">for most of their high-profile titles</a>. Additionally, some games wouldn't necessarily work that well on UE4 in terms of technology and design, at least without changing their scope or making large modifications to the engine. </p>
<p>For indie developers, Unity has a larger market share. While UE4 has no upfront licensing costs at the moment, it used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars just a few years ago. Unity on the other hand has been available for free since 2009. It offers less control for developers compared to UE4, but it's arguably easier to use and has a larger community. Unity also has lower system requirements, which makes it a better platform for mobile games. It's arguably less powerful in terms of sheer performance and graphical features out of the box, but since indies lack the budget to create photorealistic assets anyway, it's not a huge issue. For indies, speed of development, the community and portability are far more important than the maximum attainable graphical quality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you don't need hyperrealistic graphics, why bother spending the extra hundreds of hours making detailed models, rigging them, creating animations, fine-tuning light sources, adjusting shader settings...?</p>
<p>For established studios: Oftentimes, a studio will already have an engine they like to use, which they may have written themselves or bought from someplace else. Why bother learning a new engine and editor when you've already got experience with one that'll do the job fine?</p>

<p>Noise-cancelling equipment is able to produce a sound that creates a 'peak' where the heard wave is a valley, and a 'valley' where the heard wave is a peak, as in this diagram (ignore titles) <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/f/ff/Destructive_interference_.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/f/ff/Destructive_interference_.png</a></p>
<p>This results in no sound being heard, because waves that are perfectly out of phase will cancel themselves.</p>
<p>Noise cancelling equipment eliminates droning white noise, not loud noise. The sound itself wouldn't damage your ears, and neither will the equipment that can cancel the sound. Only loud sounds can hurt your ears, so wear ear protection where there is loud white noise, not noise-cancelling equipment </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other responders explained the first part of your question better than I could, so I'll defer to them. I'd like to address the second half about whether or not adding more sounds and decibels can hurt your hearing.</p>
<p>While active noise canceling headphones add sound waves, they do not increase decibels to your ears. In fact, they decrease them. Think of sound waves like ripples in a pool or pond. The height of the waves (amplitude) is how loud the sound waves are. So if you have something at one end of the pool causing waves 10cm high that might represent a loud sound. </p>
<p>Now let's say you have another mechanism that creates waves, but times them in such a way that it adds a peak when the other wave is in a trough and adds a trough when the other wave is a peak. The peaks and troughs of both waves cancel each other out and you get waves with smaller amplitudes. You added waves, but decreased the height of the original wave through interference. This is how noise canceling technology works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound waves are sinusoidal.  Think of a [sine wave] (<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg/1024px-Simple_sine_wave.svg.png" target="_blank">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg/1024px-Simple_sine_wave.svg.png</a>), it varies between a peak and a valley.    </p>
<p>Noise cancelling produces a sound wave that is exactly the same, but 180 degrees out of phase... meaning at the same time that the original sound produces a peak, the noise cancelling system produces a valley and instead of a valley, it produces a peak.  When you combine the two waves that are 180 degrees out of phase, the amplitude cancels out to zero.    </p>
<p>It's the same as how adding +1 and -1 = 0.    </p>
<p>Does it hurt your ears?  No, because the level of the sound is actually reduced.  This isn't tricking you into thinking that it's reduced, it really is.  The amplitude of the noise reaching your ear drum is much lower, which is why you don't hear it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I sometimes wonder if slight imperfections in detection and cancellation can create even bigger waves than the original (e.g. a high-frequency sine wave and negative sine wave sum to zero, but if displaced just by a <strong>tiny bit</strong>, they can sum to be twice the original).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers about how sound comes in waves and those waves can cancel, but to put it in more &quot;real&quot; terms those &quot;waves&quot; are actually pockets of air with either higher or lower pressure. So think of a guitar string, when you strum it it hits the air a pushes it closer to other air, creating a pocket of higher pressure. That pocket pushes into the air next to it, and then that pushes into the air next to it, etc., so the pocket travels. </p>
<p>When you cancel noise, you're eliminating those pockets of high and low pressure so at your ears the air is exactly how it is if they was no noise, and thus it doesn't hurt your ears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Actually, fresh out of the oven the &quot;air&quot; inside a hot cookie is possibly steam. When this hot pieces fall into a cold liquid (like milk) the hot air contracts (or the steam is quenched) and a large fraction of the void space is filled with milk.   The cookie sinks.</p>
<p>When the cookies are not longer hot out of the oven, all of those spaces are already filled with relatively cooler air, so there is a smaller fraction of void space to fill with milk.  The cookie floats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing about physics, but I have read a lot about baking. When coating a cake with a flavoured syrup that you want to sink into the crumb, I've read that it works best if the cake and syrup are different temperatures - either a still-hot cake with room-temperature syrup, or a cooled cake with heated syrup. I haven't been able to find any proof or spelled-out scientific explanation, but perhaps the hot cookies are drawing in the cold milk faster than the cooled cookies would? </p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how when you pour water on soil that is completely parched, a lot of it runs right out the bottom of the pot without seeming to wet the soil at all (I kill a lot of plants...)? But soil that's only a little dry will suck up water like a sponge. I don't know the reason for that either, but maybe it has something to do with things shrinking as they dry out so the openings water could seep into are narrower. Maybe also a similar effect? I would have thought pockets of steam within the crumb of the cookie would make it more buoyant, not less, but maybe the steam is also keeping those little pores open? Cold cookies are definitely more dense than ones fresh out of the oven (you can see them shrink as they cool), so better moisture-resistance is the only thing I can come up with that would explain the floating.</p>
<p>I'd be very interested to hear corrections from anyone with some real physics knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is called a signature.  They can be as small as 4 pages, or much larger.  A book is typically made up of several signatures.</p>
<p>The result is, I can take two 4 page signatures and make an 8 page book, but I have no way to make a 9 page book.  If I add one page, I have no way to attach it.

I might be forced to make it fit in a 7 page book, or maybe print a 12 page book with some blank pages (some print methods can use 2 page signatures).</p>
<p>The short answer is that when making books its usually easiest to make them a certain way, and blank pages may be the result.  A children's book might be 30 pages, but the publisher finds that one 32 page signature is the cheapest method of production.

The opening blank pages are called fly leaves. The pages with writing/art is called the textblock. These pages, if loaded with art (illuminated) sometimes took days to create. The &quot;pages&quot; were vellum (calf skin) and as you can imagine were expensive to make. You want to protect this investment.
When books were bound in leather, the tanned leathers would leak and damage the textblock, so the fly leaves were to protect the writing/art from damage. You would use the minimum amount to protect the text block because vellum was expensive to produce. With the advent of fiber paper, you could increase the number of fly leaves. Depending upon on the binding technique used there would a different number of these fly papers.
Also, fly leaves are constructed to add structural strength to the book. A book opens and closes and making the hinge strong and durable are important, especially when you consider a town would save up just to buy one book. So there are numerous different construction methods in hand binding that is reflected on the type and number of fly leaves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For the information theoretic definition, this multiplier is set to arbitrarily make the entropy of a coin flip 1.</p>
<p>Of interest, there is discussion in the academic community over whether they should be interpreted as equivalent notions or not. The major prevailing opinion though is that there is enough there to justify overlapping study. </p>
<p>The major difference between the two is the types of problems they apply to. For instance, it is common for the processes used in information theory to not satisfy the second law, that is entropy does not always increase. While in statistical mechanics, this law is supreme. </p>
<p>The best discussion is probably <a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Information theory and statistical mechanics</em> by E.T. Jaynes (PDF)</a>. While if you want a more recent and thorough discussion, there is the book <a href="http://webee.technion.ac.il/people/merhav/papers/gcnotes.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Statistical physics and information theory</em> by Navi Mehrav (PDF)</a>. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic idea revolves around the concept of the <strong>microstate</strong> and the <strong>macrostate</strong>.  The microstate is the configuration of the components of the system, and the macrostate is a &quot;label&quot; we use to categorize the microstates.</p>
<p>For example, in a game of yahtzee, the individual configuration of each dice might be the microstate, and the macrostate might be &quot;Number of sixes rolled&quot;.</p>
<p>We define the entropy of a macrostate to be proportional to the number of microstates that would be 'counted' as a part of that macrostate.  For example, &quot;five sixes&quot; would be an extremely low-entropy macrostate because there is only one way you could roll five dices to get five sixes.  &quot;four sixes&quot; is also a pretty low-entropy macrostate, but bigger than &quot;fix sixes&quot;.</p>
<p>You can extend this pretty seamlessly to the physical concept of entropy.  The microstate of a cloud of gas might be the position and velocities of every molecule in that cloud.  The temperature of that cloud would be a macrostate.  There are many different configurations of moleculues that will yield 300K.  And, again, that's all the entropy is -- a measure of the logarithm of &quot;how many&quot; molecular configurations would yield your macrostate (300K).  As it turns out, there are <em>more</em> ways to configure the moleclues to get 300K than there are to get, say, 30K.  There are even less ways you can configure the molecules in that cloud of gas to get 3K.</p>
<p>Information theory entropy and thermodynamic entropy are literally the exact same concept -- a number proportional to the possible configurations that would yield the macrostate you're asking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In both cases entropy can be seen as how much information it would take to describe the state of a system. The more chaotic a system is, the more information you need to completely describe its state.</p>
<p>When matter is at 0 kelvin, its atoms aren't 'jiggling' because it lacks heat and therefore you need no information to describe it, as you already know how all its atoms are behaving. You could say its entropy is 0.  In a gas at a high temperature its atoms are jiggling and colliding onto each other, so you would need a lot of information to describe the velocity and energy of each one, so it's entropy would be high.</p>
<p>In information theory, if you have a set of messages you want to transmit, entropy tells you how much information you need to describe them, IE.: How much you can compress them. If there is a lot of repeated patterns between them you can make use of this and compress the messages. The more complex the messages are, the more bits (information) you need to describe them, so the more entropy they have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They weren't all introduced at the same time, and therefore have to compete with each-other for market share.</p>
<p>Originally there was only flat-head, this is because you can make a flat-head screw and driver very easily. Before there were different types of screws, they called the driver a &quot;Turnscrew&quot;</p>
<p>Then somebody thought to themselves &quot;If there were two slots, like an X then the Turnscrew would be a bit harder to make but wouldn't slide out of the screw all the time. (this guys name was probably Phillips, not actually sure though)</p>
<p>This idea worked quite well and so there were now two standards. They both co-exist because X is definitely better to work with, but the slot is always going to be cheaper and easier to make.</p>
<p>Eventually a third person decided that the way that Phillips pops out if you apply too much torque is sub-optimal, so they came up with Robertson (Square type) This system managed to catch on quite well, but not become very widespread. This type is a little more expensive to make the screws than Phillips, but a little cheaper to make the drivers too.</p>
<p>Now we have three competing standards. All of which have their strengths and weaknesses. All of which are able to take a viable slice of the market and compete with each-other.</p>
<p>The other standards you've mentioned all came into the market in a similar manner, but I'm telling the story of the big three types because it's way simpler to explain the concept that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Phillips heads solved that problem, but introduced another: the screws strip easily when the driver cams out due to excessive torque. Newer designs have different balances of torque protection, size, manufacturing ease, etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of reasons, and many other answers have hit the high points. In general, &quot;sophisticated machinery&quot; means &quot;it's more expensive to make.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Flathead&quot; screws were created first because they're the easiest to make and didn't require sophisticated machinery.</li>
<li>&quot;Phillips head&quot; screws were created later because it takes more sophisticated machining to create them. They're easier to screw in than flat heads, but can be subject to &quot;stripping&quot; that makes reuse impossible.
<ul>
<li>They are, by design, subject to a problem called &quot;cam-out&quot;, that means the screwdriver might slip and stop applying force. In good Phillips screws, this stops you from over-tightening the screws. In cheap Phillips screws, this makes it impossible to properly tighten them without stripping.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Robertson&quot; screws were created to deal with the stripping problems of Phillips heads, but take more sophisticated machinery to create.</li>
<li>Torx and Hex screws are alternate ways to try and address the problems with Phillips heads, and also require sophisticated machinery. (I think it's possible Torx was trademarked
<ul>
<li>Robertson, Torx, and Hex are more resistant to &quot;cam-out&quot;. That means you're less likely to strip them, but you can also over-tighten them without a more sophisticated screwdriver designed to prevent over-tightening.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few other head types exist and are called &quot;security bits&quot;. The goal here is either to make a screw few people will have a screwdriver to turn, or in some cases make it very difficult to unscrew the screw without causing damage. These are for applications like public restroom stalls, where you don't want vandals to unscrew your screws. Common security bits have tri-wing, square, and triangular heads, but many tighten-only screws have drivers that look sort of like bottle openers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the reasons so many heads exist are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some screws are really cheap to make, and the cheapest possible solution will always exist even if it's very bad.</li>
<li>Some screws were designed to be easier to use than the cheaper ones, but are more expensive and have varying problems with over-tightening or stripping.</li>
<li>Some screws are designed in the hopes that you don't have a screwdriver for them, so you don't mess with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's sort of why a lot of car mechanisms use different screws on one part. The manufacturer is trying to make it so the average person with a cheap toolset won't be able to properly disassemble and reassemble the mechanisms. But the licensed, &quot;qualified&quot; mechanic's shop will have all of the necessary tools. Don't ask me why they tend to replace all of the screws with inferior, half-broken ones. That probably has to do with the &quot;cheaper&quot; reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. It would be much better if they were able to do that and hopefully they will, but it's naive to think that's going to happen anytime soon. Even though we have common enemies to some extent, both sides don't want the same things.</p>
<p>When Obama first took office, he did try to calm things down with Russia. He unilaterally withdrew planned missile defenses from Eastern Europe. He reduced our nuclear arsenal well below treaty limits. In contrast, Russia invaded Georgia (prior to Obama's tenure), he's built up the Russian nuclear arsenal well in excess of treaty violations, is developing new missile technologies Russia which are in blatant violation of treaty, conducted a proxy war in Ukraine, war crimes in Syria, has been flying bombers into West Coast airspace, buzzing US ships and jets, has been enabling Iran's nuclear program, etc.</p>
<p>The US wants peace, stability and to overall maintain its influence and the status quo. Russia is not happy with the status quo and wants to increase its own power and influence. Russian attitudes have grown increasingly disdainful of the US and sanctions employed to curb Russia's behavior only antagonized them further.</p>
<p>Russia hasn't kept to its current treaty agreements and has no intention of doing so. More talking is unlikely to change that...unless...do you have something novel you think they should talk about?</p>
<p>The US has a few options.
1) We do nothing and passively let Russia do what it wants. This avoids escalation for now but emboldens Russia and other nations to take advantage of our absence to do all sorts of things we don't like. This may lead to even larger conflict later (think how European diplomacy failed to prevent WW2).</p>
<p>2) We employ more sanctions. This may weaken Russia but is unlikely to curb behavior. It didn't work in Cuba, it hasn't worked in North Korea and it isn't going to work with Russia. Additionally, our allies in Europe depend on Russian oil among other things, so the sanctions would be fairly limited. We also run the risk of pushing Russia to establish deeper ties with countries who are already our adversaries.</p>
<p>3) We escalate the situation. <em>The point of this is to avoid war. </em> When the US says &quot;Hey man, I have zero intention of fighting you. Let's talk and cool things down,&quot; that does not have the desired effect. It just tells Putin he can do things with impunity since no one will stand up to him. When you say, &quot;you chill the fuck down or I am prepared to annihilate the ever living fuck out of you,&quot; he'd be more inclined to listen. That also risks war and a bad one. On the other hand, shying from conflict now may risk an even larger conflict in the future. </p>
<p>4) We tell Putin he's awesome and we love everything he's doing. We try to be just like him, help him do all sorts of stuff and hope he will see us as his buddies. This achieves none of our policy goals. It enables Russia. It weakens the US.</p>
<p>This situation is a bit different from the Cold War. Back then, the US and the Soviets had 2 very ideogically opposed world views and both thought the other side may risk nuclear attack at any moment. Russia knows we don't want to  nuke them. And we...well...reasonably expect Russia isn't about to nuke us out of the blue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Complicated question. Depends whom one asks. But stuff is political and there are longstanding tensions between the two, so you're unlikely to hear 'yes'. This will probably get long, convoluted and appear to be tangential (there are a lot of threads and it's past midnight). </p>
<p>You have to remember it was only about 25 years ago the USSR dissolved. Before those 25 years there was about 40 years of intense propaganda, competition and distrust on both sides. Those things reduced, but did not halt, after the dissolution. So there are still many, many people who have ingrained in their beliefs that Russia is an enemy. It's become a cultural thing in some respects to continue to view them as an enemy. </p>
<p>Now with respect to Russia and it's recent events, there are two broad camps. There is the Russia is expansionist and a threat to the west view. There is also the view Russia is threatened, acting like a cornered animal and the west fucked up. That second one is rarely repeated even though it is a serious position held in academic circles. Why is it not repeated? A combination of Donald Trump being pro-Russia (and Trump being a very disliked president elect), the above propaganda and anti-Russian culture and western/American exceptionalism (this is  related to the propaganda, but I feel like an elaboration on this would be useful). </p>
<p>What is American/Western Exceptionalism? At it's heart it's the idea that people tend to view themselves as being exceptional. That's not abnormal really, most groups of people (or individuals) tend to justify their actions and beliefs, while struggling to see the viewpoint of the other side. Unfortunately, this can and has lead to a biased and hypocritical view, especially in combination with the propaganda. E.g., how the two other replies at this point justify/explain the actions of the US. One has justified it by saying it's exporting democracy (which is very recent and even then debatable)*. The other has justified it because Russia invaded a country. The problem with this view is the US has invaded more countries, involved in more wars, more interventions etc in recent times (they're completely mistaken to think the US does it far less), so if that's a valid justification we should expect all to abandon the US. Those are two very common justifications by the way and implicit it those is their side is right. There is a kind of cycle where these kinds of views and thinking are shaped by the media at the same time as shaping the media. </p>
<p>*I've heard it said western exceptionalism is the modern equivalent to white mans burden. An interesting thought whether you agree or not. </p>
<p>And on top of all of that complexity, there does exist real conflicts in interests. The EU and NATO want to expand eastward, the US supports both (and it makes sense strategically from their own perspectives). Russia views the encroaching of those organisations as threats. They back different sides in Syria (again, makes sense from the respective positions). </p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>It's the combination of historic, cultural, political factors as well as conflicts of interest that gives the appearance of it not be acceptable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it make sense if they sat down &amp; talked things out?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might, it depends on if it were to result in any change. It really is difficult to tell from where we stand. For instance, if one were to view China as the enemy (and Trump does seem to be signalling that at the moment) it makes sense to try and deprive China of their friends, friends like Russia. In that case increased ties to Russia would be very important. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Russia isn't a model of democracy, but that's not really the reason why the US isn't friend with them. Saudi Arabia is probably worst than russia in that department, but their interest somehow align with those of the US.</p>
<p>Ukraine. Both the US and Russia don't really care about what the people in Ukraine really want. The US want to expand their influence in the region and limit Russia's influence. Russia on the other hand feel threaten. Think about it, poland, hungary, baltics, etc. They are used to be friendly with russia. It's a great buffer zone to protect your territory. Missile are thousand kilometer away from your border and so are enemy troops. But now the US have anti-missile shield unit in Poland, Romania and Turkey. Hell they even have nuclear missile in Turkey and Germany. Russia also have lost of alot of their access to the Meditterean. They still had a base in Sevastopol that their lease from Ukraine, but with Ukraine possible joining NATO, they just couldn't protect their trading line anymore. Russia just used the presence of Russia speaking people in Ukraine to protect their interest there. Not really democratic, but I pretty sure the US would be doing the same if needed. They invaded a couple of country for the same reason in the last 60 years.</p>
<p>Syria. A lot of people think that the involvement in of Russia and US in syria is to back their own friend in the region and prepare work for a pipeline. The US back Saudi-Arabia and Qatar pipeline going from Qatar to Turkey go through all US ally except Syria to sell Arabian oil to europe. But their is also a Russian backed pipeline going from Iran to Syrian mediterrean port for export. Syria is highly unlikely to allow both pipeline going through and the winner will have a huge economic advantage in the years after the war.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Russia has invaded it's neighbors to oppose their desires for closer ties to the West -including invading and annexing a portion of Ukraine, ignored its treaty obligations, ramped up confrontational tactics (illegal flyovers, subs in national waters, irresponsible confrontational maneuvers around allied military planes and vessels) with NATO nations, and used hacking and disinformation campaigns to sow discord and meddle in the elections of the US and our allies. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Countries that try to become some sort of Empire (in the economic sense) or at least dominate those around them have a problem if another country tries to be an Empire. </p>
<p>Why do you want to be an empire? Basically it is about getting ressources to produce things with and markets to sell those things to, there might be ideology and military strategy in it, but it basically is about ressources and markets. From that follows everything else: You want to keep your markets? You need to control the seaways from and to. You need to have some sort of military control over your areas of influence to not lose them.</p>
<p>Now imagine there are two or three or five of those &quot;big countries that want to be Empires&quot; and obviously there will be intersections of the areas they want influence in. Obviously, there are &quot;problems&quot; that arise. </p>
<p>For example take Syria: Russia has influence in that area via their local dicator, the US wants the russian influence gone, as such the russian-friendly local dicator. Russia wants to keep it. The US wants it gone. This is just an extreme case, but the world is littered with &quot;areas of influence&quot; of this &quot;country that wants to be an Empire&quot; or &quot;that other one&quot;.</p>
<p>This, in a pretty simple nutshell, is geopolitics explained. </p>
<p>It lead to the european powers start WWI (GB, Germany, France, Austria, Russia, Italy), GB and France start wars in Africa, Japan to attack the US in WWII (they wanted a pacific-empire), the Vietnam-War (US vs. Russia), China having problems with the US over Taiwan, ...</p>
<p>The &quot;sitting down and talking it out&quot; has precedences in history. For example during some parts of the Cold War there was an agreement of &quot;Don't fudge with our areas, we don't fudge with yours&quot;, which mostly worked. You also had the then-superpowers Spain and Portugal basically split the world among themselves 1494, simply because they knew that a big conflict would destroy them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of answers here that <em>answer</em> the question but not to a satisfying level of detail so I'll take a swing.</p>
<p>The main reason is because honey is almost completely sugar. That high sugar concentration dehydrates any cells that try to take up residence through osmosis. (Osmosis being like a gravitational pull toward balance.) If there's water inside of a cell that falls into the honey, the honey will pull water out of the cell until the proportion of water to sugar inside the cell is equal to the proportion outside the cell.</p>
<p>Since the honey had such a high sugar content, a single cell just doesn't have enough water in it to make a dent in that so the honey ends up pulling nearly all the water out of the cell, killing it in the process.</p>
<p>There are some things that can survive without any water; botulism spores have already been brought up and are a great example of why we pasteurise honey, despite how well it kills bacteria on its own.</p>
<p>There are other properties that play lesser roles like a chemical secreted by the bees called defensin-1 which works as an antibiotic but these other properties pale in comparison to the mighty osmotic pressure.</p>
<p>What this means, though, is that, yes, honey has antimicrobial properties but the main one (osmosis) goes away the moment you dilute it because the balance mentioned earlier is much easier to reach if the overall solution has a lower percentage of sugar.</p>
<p>In turn, that means that honey does not pass it's abilities on to you by drinking it since you dilute it with your saliva and stomach acid. In other words, if someone tells you it will help fight off a cold because of its antimicrobial properties, they don't know what they're talking about.</p>
<p>It will, however, make your throat feel better temporarily but that's another ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey can expire if it has too much water in it, which it can pull from the air if it is stored improperly. Bees will actually cap the honey comb when the moisture of the honey gets too high (around 16-17%) so it cannot absorb any more water. Moisture above 18% can <del>cause</del> allow the honey to ferment, which would effectively spoil the honey. When honey is processed by a beekeeper, it is typically done in a humidity controlled environment to avoid over hydration. </p>
<p>Honey, if stored properly (dry and airtight), can last thousands of years because of its sugar content and natural antibacterial properties. It will often crystallize when stored for a long time, but this does not mean the honey is bad. Simply warm it and it will turn back to honey. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of these top answers are pretty much wrong. Not really so much to do with the sugar, but not too far off. I wrote a paper about this, so I will tell you about honey and more at an age above 5.</p>
<p>When bees gather pollen from flowers, they add an enzyme called invertase to break it down into two sugars: glucose and fructose. When the bee returns to the hive and regurgitates the nectar into the honeycomb it adds one more enzyme called glucose oxidase.  This creates trace amounts hydrogen peroxide in the honey. Yes, the same hydrogen peroxide that your mother poured on your scrapes and cuts, and the same one that keeps everything it touches clean and sanitary. The bee then flaps its wings over the honey until all the water has left. The lack of water and the existence of hydrogen peroxide makes it a rough place for any bacteria to live. </p>
<p>Civilizations as far back as the ancient Sumerians know that honey helps treat wounds. It prevents bacteria and moisture from entering while at the same time, sucks moisture out of the wound. A visit to Boca's Gumbo Limbo Nature Preserve  shows how in their sea turtle rehabilitation, honey treatments are frequently and effectively placed over cracks and other exposed injuries to protect damaged sea turtles from developing infections.</p>
<p>Eating local honey also can help immunize against local allergies. As an informal study from Xavier University in New Orleans found, bees gather small amounts of pollen that could normally trigger allergies.2  But eating that honey introduces tiny amounts into you, and allows your immune system to build up tolerance to common allergens.
The positive aspects of honey continue. The National Journal of Biological Sciences research suggest that honey may be a great tool in the management of diabetes. Honey raises your blood sugar much less, and requires much less insulin to break down then the sugar found in most foods. Using it as a substitute could not only help combat diabetes mellitus at early stages, but also due to its anti-lipidemic effect,  can fight against obesity.</p>
<p>Like any good thing, honey can also have its drawback. While anyone old enough to read this can enjoy the full fledged benefits of the golden nectar, it is not recommended for infants.  Toxicologist Charles Santerre recommend waiting until the baby is 12 months old before you introduce honey into the diet.  Honey can rarely contain a bacteria called Clostridium botulinum which could affect an infant's immature digestive tract and cause infant botulism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey never expires because the water that is present in the honey is molecular and/or chemically bounded (trapped). Water becomes bonded through their strong electrical attraction (polarity), this can happen through water-ion and water-dipole interactions. This is important to know because Many microorganism, such as the types of bacteria and yeast which are associated with food spoilage, require moisture (water) to grow and reproduce. </p>
<p>You have probably bounded water yourself. When you throw salt on the sidewalk, the salt intercuts with the water trapping the molecules and preventing them from expanding (freezing) therefore lowering their freezing point and preventing snow from building up. But as we know it will eventually freeze. </p>
<p>Back to honey- </p>
<p>All foods have what is called a water activity (Aw)., with 1.0 being the maximum possible.
To show an example:
Fresh meat has a water activity of 0.985, while potato chips/crisps have a water activity of 0.08.  </p>
<p>The bacteria associated with food spoilage require a minimum of 0.90 to survive, grow and reproduce. Yeast require a minimum of 0.80 and 0.70 for mold.
There are exceptions of course which I can name if you guys are interested. </p>
<p>At low water activities, microorganisms die because water inside the cell diffuses out in an effort to balance the osmotic pressure. So basically the cells dehydrate and die because the water leaves theirs cell. </p>
<p>This is why honey never expires, it has a very low water activity, preventing it from supporting the growth of micro organisms that would cause it to spoil. </p>
