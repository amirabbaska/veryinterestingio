		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, some studies that helped me with my reasoning: A study has shown that people who are imagining visual stimuli (as opposed to actually seeing it) still show activation in their visual cortex. A different study that looked at the <a href="https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1426245/rubins-vase.jpg" target="_blank">vase-face illusion</a> found that people's brain activity differed depending on which part of the illusion they were perceiving - if they reported perceiving faces, their fusiform gyrus (the brain's face area) was stimulated, but if they were perceiving a vase, the same area was not lit up. There didn't seem to ever be a time where brain activation showed both patterns indicating perception of both the vase and the faces simultaneously, which suggests that your brain can only perceive one thing or the other. </p>
<p>So my guess at what is happening, in the visual aspect at least, is that your visual cortex would be stimulated, but the stimulation in your visual cortex when you're &quot;seeing&quot; your thought would be different from the pattern of stimulation when you're consciously perceiving what is in front of you. </p>
<p>So for example: you're sitting in front of a striped black and white wall, but you're imaging or &quot;seeing&quot; a solid red coloured wall. When you're focusing on (i.e. consciously perceiving) the striped wall, the visual neurons that respond to contrast would be stimulated, but the neurons responsible for colour perception would not. When you switch your focus so that you are consciously perceiving the imagined red wall, your colour neurons would be stimulated, but your contrast neurons would not. </p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain responsible for stuff like reasoning, cognition, and other executive functions - probably also plays a role in the thoughts that you &quot;see&quot;, because it's implicated to be heavily involved in consciousness. </p>
<p>As for people who can't &quot;see&quot; things in their minds, you're not alone. There's a condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">aphantasia</a> where people don't see pictures in their head. If I asked the average person how many windows they had in their home, they would probably do a mental walkthrough of their home and count the windows. For somebody with aphantasia, they'll know, but they might not know how they know. </p>
<p>TL;DR: activation in the visual cortex for the &quot;seeing&quot; part, and likely activation in the prefrontal cortex for the &quot;thought&quot; part. Also, not being able to &quot;see&quot; things in your mind is actually a thing - aphantasia. </p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811902912437" target="_blank">vase-face study</a></p>
<p>EDIT2: <a href="http://psylux.psych.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/assets/images/vase.jpg" target="_blank">cool example</a> of the vase-face illusion, of faces of two real people - who are they? :D </p>
<p>EDIT3: fixed the study link so that you don't need a school log in, but it only shows you the abstract (the summary) for free. </p>
<p>EDIT4, <strong>attempting to ELI5 even more</strong>: the part of your brain that you use when you see is turning on both when you're looking at a thing, and thinking about &quot;seeing&quot; a thing. there's a different pattern when each of those happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer this on a deeply neurological level, but I can on a cognitive-psychological one. The short answer is that while visualizing something in your head, you're not <em>fully</em> processing what's in front of you, at least not to the same extent.</p>
<p>Think of your brain like a computer, i.e. an information-processing machine. All of your senses are essentially &quot;input&quot; sources for information;
your eyes are getting visual info, your ears are picking up sound, your skin is picking up pressure and temperature (and possibly pain), etc. There are actually <em>way</em> more than 5 senses, but the point is that at any given time, there is a <em>lot</em> of sensory information that is flowing into your brain at any given time.</p>
<p>Then you have <em>internal</em> information, which you pull from your stores of memory or your thoughts. This would be the origin of something that you're &quot;picturing&quot; in your head, without seeing it in front of you. Your brain includes what effectively amounts to a biological graphics card, so when you're picturing something in your mind, you're essentially running a kind of simulation.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the main point: even though all of this sensory and internal info is <em>presented</em> to your brain, your brain isn't necessarily <em>doing anything</em> with it. It's not all being automatically processed. To use vision as an example, your eyes are basically giving the rest of your brain a video feed, but <em>that's all that your eyes do</em>. In order for you to do even basic things like recognize objects or faces, tell the shape of an object, etc, your brain needs to do further processing on this visual feed, and here's where the bottleneck is.</p>
<p>As powerful and complex as it is, the brain has a <em>limited amount</em> of computing power. It simply <em>can't handle</em> everything at once, especially when two different tasks are competing for use of the same parts of the brain. The brain has to choose which information it <em>attends</em> to (&quot;attend&quot; = the root of &quot;attention&quot;) and which information it just lets drop and be overwritten.</p>
<p>In the case that OP cited, the visual feed from the eyes is usually handled by the same neurological hardware that also performs the &quot;picture in your mind&quot; bit, so they're directly competing for cognitive resources. When you're picturing something intensely, your attention is mostly on the simulation that your brain is running. Meanwhile, the info coming from the optic nerve is being stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_memory" target="_blank">sensory memory,</a> which is sort of like a temporary cache for sensory information that hasn't yet been processed further. Your brain is still paying a <em>little</em> bit of attention to this sensory memory, but not as much it normally would, because your attention is being diverted towards another task. </p>
<p>The reasons I listed above are also why visualizing something is often easier with your eyes closed. Similarly, for an auditory equivalent, reading comprehension is typically impaired while listening to music with lyrics, but it is <em>not</em> as affected by music <em>without</em> lyrics; language is processed by the same parts of the brain whether read or heard, so presenting both at once essentially creates competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Add to what others are saying:  There was an experiment started by nasa a long time ago where they were having people wear glasses that inverted the vision.  The reasoning had to do with the lack of orientation in space.  They had to wear this 24/7.  It was discovered at about the 3 week mark that all test subjects actually became accustomed to this flip, and they were able to go about their day as if it were normal.  What was discovered was that the &quot;mind's eye&quot; was able to overcome this change and see things normally again, despite the inverted vision.  It was also later discovered that the mind's eye actually flips what images go into the retina naturally.</p>
<p>In other words, the mind's eye is more powerful than you can take at face value.  The brain just interprets the data as it needs, regardless of what it actually sees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's evidence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that imagery and perception share common processing mechanisms, and demonstrate that the specific brain regions activated during mental imagery depend on the content of the visual image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/media/pdfs/OCravenKanwisherJOCN00.pdf" target="_blank">this fMRI study</a>, but there are many more.</p>
<p>One of the things you learn in a cognition &amp; perception class is that there's not really such a thing as &quot;multitasking.&quot; The best we can do is shift our attention between multiple things quickly. So if you're imagining visual imagery, you're attending to that and not really processing—or we should say, <em>perceiving</em>—what your eyes are sensing at all. If I understand it correctly, studies like these suggest that the brain uses the same areas to perceive both imagined imagery and real imagery coming through your optic system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former pastry chef here. As some other users have pointed out, apple has a mild flavor profile. Why is that, though? One of the reasons is that apples are a pretty watery fruit, so it's less concentrated in flavor compared to fruits like strawberries or cherries. B-but wait, what about pineapples or watermelon? Those are watery and you see those in ice cream!</p>
<p>Flavor is directly affected by the sugar content of the fruit. Apples don't taste as sweet as other fruits commonly seen in ice cream and they happen to be on the tart side (tartness hinders the way we taste sweetness). The natural sweetness of a fruit is really important for seasoning products. If you make banana bread with bright yellow firm bananas, then the banana bread will be bland because of the lack of sugar development. You'll just end up with a sugar loaf with banana in it. Concentrate the apple flavor by means of reduction, add it to a base and you've got yourself some delicious apple ice cream. However, extra steps in preparation = extra labor costs.  </p>
<p>It really isn't about texture because people tend to be adventurous with fruit flavors. You can make almost any fruit agreeable in texture. I hope I could offer some insight on this. </p>
<p>Edit: Changed sentence wording and added a bit about tartness because I forgot.<br />
Edit 2: Edited banana bread sentence to be less confusing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has a circadian cycle, meaning that certain hormones are released at certain times of the day. For example, melatonin (what makes you feel sleepy) is released at night, and is inhibited by the light.</p>
<p>Similarly, other hormones, such as cortisol (the stress hormone) is released in cycles during the day, including a spike early in the morning that helps you wake up. If you try to sleep during a spike, you won't have as good sleep.</p>
<p>Your body's circadian rhythm can change, but it takes time. If you choose a sleep schedule and stick to it, after a few days, your body will adjust. If you keep changing your schedule, your body can get confused and it will impact how restful your sleep feels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two mechanisms controlling sleep.  Circadian rhythm, which responds to light stimulation and issues wake / sleep hormones accordingly, and also a &quot;body clock&quot;, which generally keeps track of how long you've been awake, to pressure you into sleeping if you've exceeded ~16 hours or so. </p>
<p>Circadian rhythms sort of become fixed when we're teenagers, and some people's are more flexible than others'.  The rhythms dictate when you produce cortisol, a hormone that induces wakefulness and alertness, and melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. </p>
<p>And this effects many other systems in the body, including digestion, &quot;core temperature&quot; (your internal body temperature), brain patterns, etc.  If you're forcing your body to try to go to sleep when its in wake mode, the sleep you get is generally much lower quality, because you're not entering deep sleep and REM.</p>
<p>For people whose circadian rhythms are flexible, you can generally go to bed within a wide range of times, and experience relatively little effect.  But some people (like me) have a disorder called Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome.  Basically, my circadian rhythym is VERY rigid, and what's worse, I feel tired around 4AM and want to wake around 12PM.  Deviating from the schedule makes me feel like garbage.  And because it isn't flexible, it takes a herculean effort to &quot;retrain&quot; my body, and the effort is all wasted the moment I stay up a little too late, and my body &quot;snaps back&quot; to the previous configuration.   </p>
<p>When you put me in a sleep study, and I go to bed at 11, even though I will &quot;fall&quot; asleep, its basically restless, crap sleep, until around 3 - 4AM, when suddenly the graph shows me drop into very deep and restful REM sleep.  </p>
<p>So even though I <em>think</em> I'm getting eight hours, because I closed my eyes at 11 and woke up at 7, in reality, I only get about 3.  And this is very common for people with DSPS, and most people don't even realize they have it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure a doctor will pop in with more info later, but your body operates on a schedule called the circadian rhythm.  Long story short is your body expects to have a certain amount activity/rest throughout the day, and on a fairly regular schedule.  So deviating from that will throw it off slightly.  It is also not on a 24 hour cycle, I think the last I read was it's actually a 25 hr schedule, so your body, if left unchecked would have you go to bed a little later  each night and sleep in a little more each day (but sunlight and other factors prevent the sleeping in later as a great time for sleep).  When the sun is up your body wants to be up, that's why you need blackout curtains to sleep well during the day.
So, going to bed an hour early is not going to upset your established circadian rhythm because your body is still going to expect to get up at your normal time, plus it should be during night hours so no morning light to mess up your sleep.
Also, if you're planning on sleeping more than usual keep a glass of water next to your bed, that overly groggy feeling from 'too much sleep' is usually just dehydration.
I know I have skipped over a lot, experts of sleep please feel free to throw in the gaps/correct as necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm sure they didn't intend you to sleep the same length, they probably intended you to go to bed earlier to get more sleep.</p>
<p>Still, even if you go to bed earlier and sleep the same length, we were awake for a shorter time that one time you started, and should need a little less time to recover so in practice you still do get a little more sleep than you needed that one time...</p>
<p>But that is minimal, the main advantage if you both go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier is that you give yourself the margin to sleep a little extra (to the usual time you went up before) when it's needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. Or rather: the abstract definition of charge flowing from the positive electrode to the negative is inaccurate.</p>
<p>In reality, a current can consist of a various species of particles: electrons, positive ions, negative ions. Since electrons are by far the lightest, in most situations the current is mostly determined by the flow of electrons. In a regular metal wire, the ions are part of the metal and are thus fixed, while electrons can move freely, but from negative to positive, opposite to the direction of the reference current. However, in a semiconductor material, current is carried by both positive and negative charges.</p>
<p>The convention that current flows from positive to negative is an arbitrary choice. You could easily define it the other way around and nothing would change. For historical reasons, we use positive-to-negative and while in many cases the dominant flow of charge carriers is in the opposite direction, it's not really worth the hassle to change the definition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In many cases, like batterys, it happens both ways with ion transport.
Ben Franklin came up with the direction and was another century before electrons were discovered, so it became 'convention', hence conventional current flow vs electron flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Since those are negatively charged, they're attracted to positive charges. A positive charge is basically just a place with missing electrons. The electrons want to go fill those empty spaces.</p>
<p>Think of a row of chairs filled with people, except for one seat on the end. We'll pretend that the seats closer to that end are &quot;better,&quot; so people want to sit there. The person next to the empty seat moves over, creating a new empty seat where that person was. So now the person next to the new empty seat moves over. This keeps happening down the row. If you were looking at the row from a distance, it would look like there were an empty seat traveling down the row of people. This is what an &quot;electron hole&quot; looks like in a flow of current. It's easier to track the hole moving from positive to negative than it is to track all the electrons moving from negative to positive.</p>

In nature, the Electric Field of a positive point charge points outward and that of a negative point charge points inward. </p>
<p>Scenario 1:  When you put two oppositely charged point charges of equal magnitude closely next to one another there will be a Lorentz Force exerted pulling them together that is proportional to the charge size times the net Electric field.</p>
<p>Scenario 2: You have two metal plates close together with a copper wire attaching them to each other on their backside to make a circuit. The plates are oppositely charged and the positive plate has 2x the charge as the negative plate. The net Electric field will point towards the negative plate. This force will polarize the loose electrons of the copper wire as the built up charged ions in between the plates flow in this direction around the wire. This effectively is a capacitor discharging. Most batteries are designed with ions flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, hence why people say current flows from positive to negative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the difference between 32 bit and 64 bit</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When your CPU runs in 64-bit mode, it gains access to a number of new instructions, which, taken together, may allow certain computations to be performed more efficiently. (Much of it is to do with the width of data being operated on. As a simple example, if your 32-bit application needs to add two 64-bit integers together, it doesn't have a single instruction for that. It has to emulate it through several 32-bit additions). However, the effect of this is negligible for Skyrim, because the program didn't really have a need for 64-bit arithmetic in the first place.</li>
<li>It also gives the CPU access to twice as many registers (where data is stored while the CPU is working on it. A larger number of registers means less need to read/write data from/to memory), and that might speed up the game by a few percent. This probably won't have a huge impact, but it's something.</li>
<li>Finally, it allows the application to use more than 4GB of RAM (which is all you can normally access from a 32-bit application). This has the potential to dramatically cut down on loading times. In the 32-bit version as you moved around the world, different parts had to be unloaded from memory, in order to make room for the parts you were entering. Now that the game can use as much memory as it likes, the game doesn't need to do that at all. (Of course the data still have to be initially loaded from the disk, and depending on how much RAM you have, it may still not be possible to fit <em>everything</em> into RAM, but at least the game can hold a lot more than 4GB of data in memory at the same time. The effect of this is twofold: it can cut down on loading times as I described above, but it also gives them the breathing room they need to upgrade the graphics. Higher resolution textures or more detailed models all take up more memory. In the 32-bit version, that would have to push something else out, causing even <em>more</em> swapping data back and forth between memory and harddrive. But in the 64-bit version, there's room for this.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>What did the programmers have to do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They <em>had</em> to do very little. It is quite easy to convert a 32-bit program into a 64-bit one. They likely needed to fix a few bits of code but assuming the source code is of half-decent quality most of it should <em>just work</em>, and then just compile the code again, telling the compiler to build a 64-bit application instead of a 32-bit one.</p>
<p>So the mandatory work likely wasn't much.</p>
<p>But then comes all the optional work, which I hinted at above: if they just did the lazy solution, they'd end up with a 64-bit application which had access to all the RAM in your machine, but which still <em>tried</em> to stay within 4GB. So they'd have to rewrite the code that loads/unloads assets to no longer be so strict about unloading assets.</p>
<p>There may also have been some performance tuning, because the code performs a bit differently when it runs as 64-bit code.</p>
<p>And then of course, any graphical enhancements probably required changes to their rendering engine, shaders would have to be rewritten and so on.</p>
<p>But all of that is basically optional; not something they <em>had</em> to do in order for Skyrim to work as a 64-bit game, but rather rewriting bits of the game to take advantage of what 64-bit gives them and to make the game prettier and better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>64 bit computers use an extended instruction set and both new and extended registers to be able to more efficiently work with 64 bit numbers and to allow an application to use 64 bit memory addresses. For the most part the switch from 32 bit to 64 bit is handled by the compiler that compiles your source code to machine code. There can be some issues in the code but it is easy to fix in most cases.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage to 64 bit for most games is that they can address more memory. 32 bit address allows you to address 4GB of memory. Most games are using more graphics that that and will run out of addressable space. One reason to make the game 32 bit is to allow it to run under older systems and force the developers to make the game handle low memory situations. They could have two different versions of the game from launch but that could be difficult to manage. Upgrading an old game to 64 bits allows them to add more detailed graphics that would not be able on the old, but this is not available to those with low memory systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As explained, there's really more to it than that if you want it to actually be much of a worthwhile change. About the only thing you get for &quot;free&quot; is more RAM to use and it really makes the most sense when it probably isn't &quot;free&quot;.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're tricky. Archaeologists' methods for determining the age of things fall into two categories: relative dating and absolute dating. </p>
<p>In relative dating, we use an object's association with other objects as a reference. So if you find some pottery on the floor of a buried Roman villa, you can be pretty sure it's from the Roman period too. Then if you find pottery in the same style in say, a pit, you can now date the pit itself to the Roman period too. Obviously this is not the most precise method, but over the years archaeologists have used this principle to create such an extensive &quot;database&quot; of artefact types that they could give you a ballpark age of pretty much anything. So despite great advances in scientific dating, the vast majority of finds are still dated using good old fashioned relative methods.</p>
<p>Absolute dating exploits a variety of physical processes that we know happen at a predictable rate, usually some form of radioactive decay. The most well known example is radiocarbon dating. The carbon dioxide in our atmosphere contains a small amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope.  When they're alive, organisms are constantly swapping carbon with the atmosphere so they have the same proportion of ^(14)C in their cells. But when they die they stop swapping, and the ^(14)C decays into <del>bog standard ^(12)C</del> nitrogen at a known rate (thanks for the correction). So by ascertaining the amount of ^(14)C left in a sample of organic material from an archaeological site, we can determine how old it is with a good amount of precision. In addition to radiocarbon dating there are a number of other absolute dating methods that use the same principle with different radioactive isotopes, as well as methods that use other physical processes that happen at a fixed, known rate. With any of them, the key to using them successfully in an archaeological investigation is <em>context</em>. We rarely get to directly date the thing we actually want to know the age of, like a house or a tool. Instead we'd date say, some seeds on the floor of the house or a bone found in the same pit as a tool. It becomes crucial to be absolutely sure that your sample is contemporaneous with the thing you actually want to date, that you understand how it got there and you can rule out &quot;contamination&quot; by, for example, seeds blowing into a house that had been abandoned thousands of years earlier. </p>
<p>As you might have guessed cave paintings and prehistoric art in general poses a problem for both approaches, namely that it's just sitting there in the side of a rock and has no <em>context</em> to speak off. The only thing you can possibly directly date is the pigment itself, which for a very long time precluded the use of absolute dating because there simply wasn't enough of it (but more on that later). As a result we're still mostly reliant on relative dating, and crude relative dating at that. For example, say in one cave with paintings there is also evidence that people lived there, and this can be dated using conventional methods. You could infer the paintings were made by the people who lived there and are therefore roughly the same date. And then you find paintings in the next cave that look similar, and so on. Sometimes you can glean some extra information from the painting itself; it could depict animals which have been extinct in the area since X years ago. Or from the stratigraphy of the cave; maybe the paintings are buried, or in a section that you know was closed off at a certain date. However obviously none of this gives you a particularly reliable or precise date. Usually it will be something like &quot;Upper Palaeolithic&quot; (which was tens of thousands of years long). Using absolute dating can narrow down the age of an associated deposit, but that doesn't give you any more confidence that the painting was really made at the same time.</p>
<p>Naturally archaeologists aren't very happy with this and have long sought to apply absolute dating directly to cave paintings, using some quite ingenious methods. Currently the two most promising are radiocarbon dating pigment and Uranium-Thorium dating.</p>
<p>Some pigments used by prehistoric artists were organic-based (like charcoal blacks) and so in principle can be radiocarbon dated. Unfortunately there are a lot of obstacles: you can only scrape a very small sample from them; what is there has been exposed for thousands of years and almost certainly contaminated; radiocarbon dating becomes less and less accurate the older something is and is pretty much useless beyond 30,000 years ago, so cave paintings are likely to be near or beyond the limit of its range. Nevertheless, sophisticated radiocarbon techniques can occasionally overcome these problems.</p>
<p>A more recent approach is to look not at the pigments but at little calcite concretions that sometimes form on top of cave paintings, like mini stalagmites. Fortuitously, these contain small amounts of radioactive uranium, which decays into thorium and can therefore be used for radiometric dating. Again, the very small samples are a challenge and you have to bear in mind that this dates the calcite not the painting itself, but when successful it tells you the latest date a painting could have been made (because obviously it was already there when the calcite started to form on top of it). Recently this method has been used to push back the date of the oldest cave art to at least 40,000 years ago, which is quite a bit older than we had previously concluded from relative and radiocarbon dating.</p>
<p>As an aside, you asked about cave <em>paintings</em>, which are obviously the most striking examples of prehistoric art, but it's actually far more common to find rock <em>carvings</em> or petroglyphs. These present even more challenges when it comes to dating, because there's no pigment, no calcite, probably no associated living deposits and they've usually been completely exposed to the elements for millennia. If you're lucky you can find one buried, and use the age of the deposit covering it or thermoluminescence dating (which dates when it was last exposed to light) to determine when, or <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130813121622.htm" target="_blank">be very clever with the local geology</a>.

<p>Initially, the age of the paintings had been a contentious issue, since methods like radiocarbon dating can produce misleading results if contaminated by samples of older or newer material, and caves and rocky overhangs (where parietal art is found) are typically littered with debris from many time periods. But subsequent technology has made it possible to date the paintings by sampling the pigment itself and the torch marks on the walls.</p>

<p>Abstract:
<em>Advances in radiocarbon dating by accelerator mass spectrometry now make it possible to date prehistoric cave paintings by sampling the pigment itself instead of relying on dates derived from miscellaneous prehistoric remains recovered in the vicinity of the paintings. Presented below are some radiocarbon dates obtained at the 'Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement' for charcoal used in the execution of prehistoric paintings decorating two French caves: Cosquer and Chauvet. The presentation of the dates will be preceded by a short discussion of the experimental procedure used in our laboratory (pigment sampling, chemical treatment, etc). The ages obtained so far have shown that the art of cave painting appeared early in the Upper Palaeolithic period, much earlier than previously believed. The high artistic quality of the earliest paintings underlines the importance of absolute chronology in any attempt to study the evolution of prehistoric art.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We've all heard how in the 19th and early 20th century, there were many so-called scientific claims about how blacks and other minorities were intellectually and morally inferior to whites. It's now widely accepted that these ideas are wrong, to the point where somebody like James Watson can have his career ruined for believing some of them.</p>
<p>How do we actually know these old theories are wrong, though? What methodological flaws did all of the relevant studies have? I've done some cursory research and have yet to see anybody address or disprove any of them - people just seem to accuse their proponents of racism and all discussion is dropped.</p>

<p>Asians have less offensive body odours, and dry earwax compared to Westerners. I envy them for that. There's more lactose intolerance in Africa than in Europe. Or more accurately, Europeans developed a higher tolerance than Africans. Then there's sickle cell anaemia, which is much more prevalent in Africans and their descendants.</p>
<p>But we never discovered any superiority as such, not in the modern definition of &quot;race&quot; which almost exclusively focuses on skin colour and intelligence. On the other hand, genetic differences have played a large part in human evolution, so we could well claim that Homo sapiens were superior to Homo neanderthalensis. Arguably racist, but there's some truth in that. Future catastrophes will show us, if there are any survivors, which subtle differences allow some genetic variants to flourish while others go extinct. Superiority in hindsight.</p>
<p>And it's the least PC subject ever, so we'll probably never know for sure anyway. The Nazis tried but failed to find any fundamental differences. They really, <em>really</em> tried.</p>
<p>Unpopular opinion of the month: Being Jewish was a &quot;race&quot;-related condition that led to lower survival rates in Germany during the war. An indirect genetic weakness based on subtle facial differences. Were the extermination camps some form of natural selection? Is there such a thing as <em>un</em>natural selection? Are humans removed from nature? Try discussing <em>that</em> in class.</p>
<p>The question of <em>nature</em> vs <em>nurture</em> also rears its contentious head. Are rednecks less intelligent than others, or is it a cultural issue?</p>
<p>I'm not sure I managed to ELY5, but I'm sure I managed to offend quite a few, which is much easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The tldr of it is that the best evidence for racist theories just don't have enough power to reject the null hypothesis of racial equality.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An arch is a strong structure. Imagine taking an arch and spinning it around, you get a dome which is also a very strong structure. It's good at resisting forces from inside too.
A bottle with a dome can better resist pressure.
Soda has pressure because the bubbles are CO2 gas which can dissolve in water, but getting enough into the water to make it fizzy takes cold and pressure. When you do get enough in there, it doesn't like to stay in the water. Keeping the water under a bit of pressure can help though.
We have glass soda bottles without curved bottoms, so what's different? A curved bottom means the bottle can be thin, and it's easy to make.</p>
<p>Old plastic soda bottles had a plastic cap glued onto them so they could stand up with the curved bottom. But this is extra material and extra steps. I would also bet the old bottles were harder to recycle but they were phased out before I can recall recycling becoming the norm.
I believe someone figure out the 5 pointed bottom would work well enough because we are not talking about crazy high pressures. I believe the bottom of these bottles are also a little thicker than the old ones. But the saving in materials, fewer manufacturing steps, and making them easier to recycle beat out the increases in price for the new process.</p>
<p>Edit: If you want to see the ability of a soda bottle to hold pressure in action, google &quot;soda bottle water rocket&quot;. If your launchpad can fit the mouth of a water bottle, you can see how it behaves under pressure in contrast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, many of the &quot;aesthetic&quot; features on bottles are for functional purposes rather than looks. Carbonated soft drink (CSD) or Pop bottle bases (petaloid)  are shaped this way because of the pressure in the bottle. The ideal base for a pressurized bottle would be a sphere, however this is not practical for keeping your pop upright, but if you ever look at packages such as a gel shaving cream dispenser you will notice that there is a cup fit onto the bottom of the bottle. This is because shaving cream requires even higher pressures and so Actually does have a spherical bottom and has a base insert that keeps it upright.</p>
<p>Another example of function rather than form in plastic packaging is sports drinks (anything ending in an &quot;ade&quot;).these bottles are called hot fill meaning that they are.... ta da. Filled hot, so the inset panels that you see on these bottles are to accommodate the loss of pressure once the liquid cools down. These bottles start with the panels popped out and during filling they suck in. </p>
<p>There is a lot of interesting things about the plastic packaging world that many of us take for granted until we understand all that goes into it.</p>

If you look at the flat bottom of a water bottle, you'll see that the wall and the bottom form a somewhat sharp corner where they meet. If you put the bottle under pressure, the bottom would pop out and become round, and the bottle wouldn't stand up any more. If you look at the bottom of a soda bottle, you'll see that all those funny bumps make it so that it's all curves, and no sharp corners.

<p>Water bottles are not under pressure, so the bottom doesn't need to be strong and a flat bottom stores more water per volume. I.e. Less wasted space in shipping. </p>
<p>Also, ever notice that water bottles are usually filled to the rim so it spills when you open it?  The flat bottom bottles don't handle increases in internal pressure well. Any air in the bottle would expand at high altitude and round the bottom. The water doesn't expand. Minimal air allows the bottle to retain shape. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
