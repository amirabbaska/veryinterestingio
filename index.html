Maybe it has 4 platters, giving each read head a reading speed of 32 MB/s, or 256 Mbit/sec.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hard drives use some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction" target="_blank">Forward Error Correction</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-decision_decoder" target="_blank">Soft Decision</a>; in some cases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction" target="_blank">Reed-Solomon</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder" target="_blank">Viterbi decoding</a> is used.</p>
<p>First, forward error correction - you take the data that you want to store, run that data through some algorithm that generates extra data (adding redundency), and then write the whole thing to the disk. When you then try to read that block off the disk, if some of the original bits are in error, then you can use the redundant bits to try to figure out what the original message was.</p>
<p>Soft decision uses the analog nature of the media to represent the bits, instead of actual ones and zeros - so I say that bit 1 is a '1' with 80% probability, then bit 2 a '0' with 30% probability, etc. This information goes into the error correction logic to increase its error correction performance because it can use the probability information to figure out what is the most probable output code.</p>
<p>For example, lets say we had a really simple system - we have 2 bits of original data, and we simply duplicate it 2 times. </p>
<ul>
<li>'00' becomes '00 00 00'.</li>
<li>'01' becomes '01 01 01'.</li>
<li>'10' becomes '10 10 10'.</li>
<li>'11' becomes '11 11 11'.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you receive '00 01 00', then as a human you can probably figure out that the most likely values for the original data was '00'. </p>
<p>If you receive '01 00 00', same answer.</p>
<p>If instead gave you a value where the second bit was in question: '00 01 00' with probabilities <code>{ 99, 10, 90, 99, 80, 05}</code>, then you would might say that the most likely value for the original data was '01' - the second bit is '1' because one indication for the second bit's value has 99% probability of it being a 1, while the other two indications say '0', but with 10% and 5% probabilities.</p>
<p>Viterbi decoding combines this idea of the probability of the bit being one value or another, along with the structure of how the forward error correction data is generated, and attempts to guess the correct data.</p>
<p>Reed-Solomon is one widely-used forward error correction scheme, and is based on the mathematics of finite fields, also known as galois fields.</p>
<p>The original inspiration for reed solomon was to represent the original data as a polynomial. You could then plot that polynomial, then sample that polynomial in as many extra spots as you want, and then transmit all of extra samples. </p>
<p>For instance, lets say we want to transmit one bit <strong>a</strong>. We could then agree that when we want to transmit <code>a =1</code>, we would send a whole bunch of points sampled on the parabola <code>y = (1) * x^2</code>. If we wanted to send <code>a=0</code>, we'd send a whole bunch of points sampled on the parabola <code>y = (-1) * x^2</code>. If i send you 6 points <code>{-13, -5, 10, 0, -5, -8, -13}</code>, you'll notice that a couple of those points don't exactly agree with a parabola, but they fit the curve well enough that the curve generally fits the pattern of <code>-1 * x^2</code> and so the transmitted bit was a 0.</p>
<p>Practical reed-solomon is based on the mathematics of finite fields (aka Galois fields).</p>
<p>A decent, practical paper to read to understand Reed-Solomon and Finite fields was written by the BBC:
<a href="https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP031.pdf" target="_blank">https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP031.pdf</a></p>
<p>If you're feeling very curious, I have written an implementation of Reed-Solomon (without soft-decision) in C#:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/antiduh/ErrorCorrection/tree/master/ErrorCorrection" target="_blank">https://github.com/antiduh/ErrorCorrection/tree/master/ErrorCorrection</a></p>
<p>The fun starts in <code>GaloisField.cs</code>. Also check out <code>Encoder.cs</code> and <code>Decoder.cs</code>. Those files have almost as many comments as they do code, and my implementation uses a lot of the conventions followed by the BBC paper I linked above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Q: What does the signal from the read head look like?
A: An analog signal, or more simply, something like a sound wave. :)</p>
<p>Q: How is it processed to be digital?
A: First, understand the data flow: Head(s) &gt; Preamp &gt; Controller Read Channel &gt; HDD Controller Interface &gt; Host Interconnect.  </p>
<p>When it's originally read, it's an analog signal. The preamp, typically on the actuator to limit distance to the heads, performs the signal clean-up, then passes this analog signal to the Read Channel, which will convert it to a digital signal. When a write is performed, reverse this process, and the digital signal is passed from the Controller to the Read Channel, which then converts the digital signal to analog. The analog signal is passed to the preamp/heads to commit the write to disk. The conversion itself just takes the Digital AC signal and spits out an Analog AC signal, by way of using a series of alternating current transitions... </p>
<p>Q: How does the HDD know where the head(s) are relative to the platter(s)?
A: The platters all have 'spokes' (or more appropriately called servo fields), somewhat like a bike wheel, which are pre-defined spaces along the tracks and between the data sectors. When the heads pass over these spaces or fields, the Controller calculates the heads position on the platters, relative to which track, sector, and block the servo field was detected.</p>
<p>Tada!</p>
<p>Edit: Correction in terminology of Q#3 summarization (changed reads to head(s), silly auto correct).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HDDs only read from one surface at a time, so the datarate is all coming from one head.  It's too difficult to align multiple surfaces to the required accuracy, so they are not interleaved.  There have been efforts to make multiple servos on a unit, but it's either very old or very proof-of-concept.</p>
<p>/u/TANKtr0n gave a good description of the data path, but I think you're wondering how analog gets converted to digital.  It's just like most A-to-D conversion.  Each analog value is only a single bit, so the goal is to write to a high or low enough level for easy decoding.  Often there are marginal bits, and that's where error correction codes and retry steps come in.  For error correction, there are more bits stored on the media than the user expects, and the extra is used error detect and correct using mathematical equations.  Retries are like they sound:  try reading again.</p>
<p>How does the signal look?  Positive polarity and negative polarity.  The cleaner the write, the strong the signal strength.  Each position is converted to a single bit, which is then matched to the next neighboring bit until you get the complete data sector.  A sector is usually 512 bytes, but different uses can change this to 520, 4096, etc.</p>
<p>/u/NotAnotherNekopan did a good job on the servo positioning description.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer the second question. An HDD uses a voice coil to control where the head is. It is an electronic magnet that can very precisely control how far out from the parked position the head will go, based on the voltage applied. It simply needs to know what voltage is being applied to know where the head will be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>These outlets seem like you really need to jam the plug in to get something into them, and you'll probably only find them in newer homes or recently renovated rooms. They're basically designed to close a door over each prong socket and neither will open unless you stick something into both sides at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol can be consumed in vapor form as well, although this is very dangerous due to a variety of factors to include; inhalation gets it into your bloodstream much faster (get drunk faster off of less alcohol) which causes more extreme impairment if you don't regulate yourself better, you bypass the liver function of breaking down the alcohol (good if you have a bad liver, bad if you want to have more than a few shots), overdosing becomes extremely easy because you're bypassing the liver, and others.</p>
<p>It can also be consumed by snorting, using the powder you mentioned. This has all the downsides of vapor inhalation.</p>
<p>Finally, it can also be consumed in edible form by turning the liquid into gelatin. Gummy bears are popular. You can also infuse foods with high moisture content, such as cupcakes or fruits.</p>
<p>BONUS QUESTION: All injectable drugs are liquid or become liquid during the process of cooking. You can use cocaine, heroin, meth, and amphetamines this way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since Ethanol(the type of alcohol that we drink) itself is a liquid, any solid food or powder containing it needs to absorb or contain it somehow, which limits what you can do with alcoholic consumables. You can for instance, as another commenter mentioned make cakes or similar foods containing alcohol, but such foods will either be sort of liquid(such as a pudding or sauce) and/or have fairly low alcohol content(as most alcohol will evaporate when say, baking a cake).</p>
<p>It's also notable that alcohol is consumed in far greater doses than most other drugs, which is why ethanol being liquid matters. If you compare marijuana for example, the THC(the active substance in marijuana, i.e. the stuff that actually makes you high) is 5-10% of the mass of a joint, which are usually only a few grams to begin with, whereas a beer with a similar % alcohol content is 330 ml, and if you actually want to feel drunk you'd probably drink quite a few of those. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Alcohol is consumed as a liquid because it is liquid, and unlike other drugs you consume a lot of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Let's say it takes you 3 beers to get drunk.  Using a standard can (12oz = 355ml) and assuming a strength of 5% ABV, that's 50ml of pure alcohol - a whole shotglass worth.  You'd either have a lot of pills or a <em>very</em> large pill.</p>
<p>...this ignores the fact that pure alcohol is <em>not</em> gentle on your system and having all the extra water in your beverages helps prevent damage.  It also ignores the fact that anything with 100% alcohol is dangerously flamable.</p>
<hr />
<p>BTW, if you ever start wondering &quot;why can't we just have some pills for food&quot;, the same logic applies.  Fat is the densest form of calories available.  Butter is pretty much straight fat and a stick of butter only has 800 calories.  These &quot;food pills&quot; would amount to eating 2+ sticks of butter per day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Friction happens because of the way those imperfections collide when two surfaces push up against each other. The force required to overcome that friction depends on the material; smoother surfaces have less imperfections, so they have less friction. Theoretically, if there was a material that was completely smooth at the molecular level, it's friction coefficient would be zero (no friction).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! The true answer is: &quot;Nobody knows.&quot;</p>
<p>When friction happens, there can be chemical transofmations, extreme local heating, electrification, plasma discharges (google &quot;triboplasma&quot;), all kinds of weird fluid dynamics, phase transformations, etc. Furthermore, these are usually not &quot;equilibrium processes&quot;: there are strong spatial gradients, and everything changes in time quite fast. Figuring all this out is further complicated by the fact that most of this happens on small scale (from nanometers to microns). All of it is hidden from naked eye by small scale and short duration of these processes.</p>
<p>The keywords you might want to check out in Google Scholar are: nanotribology, tribochemistry, friction multiphysics. </p>
<p>By the way, for similar reasons, there is no microscopic theory of how polishing works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The negatively-charged electrons do repel each other. However, the electromagnetic force scales weakly with distance (relative to some other fundamental forces), which means that even far away from each other, two electric charges will still interact with each other.</p>
<p>Put most simply, the electrons in one molecule can be attracted to the nuclei in a different molecule--not necessarily enough for the two molecules to form a chemical bond and become a single new molecule, but enough that the energy of the system is lower if they are closer together. (Remember, all systems are trying to move to the lowest energy possible.)</p>
<p>The ways in which electrons and nuclei can become pretty complicated, and so you get all sorts of differently behaving interactions that can lead to friction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of theories I've heard. </p>
<p>First violent crime rates in general were much higher back then. </p>
<p>There's a theory that lead based gas in the 40's-50's lead to more cases where children would get lead poisoning and be more violent in the 60's, 70's, and 80's. </p>
<p>Gay sex was much more of a taboo and lead to some violent gay serial killers who didn't have an outlet. John Wayne Gacy and Jeffry Dahmer may have managed a normal life if being gay was more accepted, probably not, but it may have contributed to them becoming killers.</p>
<p>In general it was easier to get away with several murders before you got caught. A lot of serial killer stories you can read about how much the police botch their investigation into these guys. Also it was hard for different law enforcement agencies to communicate, so traveling from state to state killing people made it easy to get away with it. </p>
<p>People were more trusting, hitch hiking was considered a normal form of travel for many years, and often a way serial killers got their victims. Other times serial killers would ask for help moving furniture or something and trap people. Ted Bundy would pretend to have a broken arm and ask women for help moving things. Ed Kemper practiced picking up hitch hikers for months before he actually killed anyone. </p>
<p>There's probably even more factors than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

DNA was not available yet. We had fingerprints, but there were no connected databases.</p>
<p>In fact, without computers, it was a lot harder for law enforcement to share information between different districts, so it was harder to figure out which crimes were connected to each other. Nowadays, you collect fingerprints at a crime scene, you upload them IAFIS and within half an hour, you know if those fingerprints have ever been entered by any other law enforcement agency in the country either related to an unsolved crime or to a known perpetrator. That sort of thing just... didn't exist at all back in those days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, first of all There ARE serial killers around America nowadays but the media tends to be hush about them. The most recent I can think of is LISK/Gilgo Beach killer (Long Island Serial Killer) who operates in the Long Island/New York area, there hasn't been anything discovered in a few years but police found 10+ bodies in the same dumping grounds killed with similar MO's, he targeted prostitutes in the area. </p>
<p>The other reason is that the world has simply changed. With the internet and telecommunications, gps tracking and forensics and vast databases of criminals it's simply harder to get away with it for long periods of time, which is why we are seeing this turn from &quot;serial killing&quot; to mass shootings, people that may have had their homicidal urges satiated by killing a single person and getting away with in the past now realize the chances of them getting away with even a single murder aren't great, rather than rotting away in prison they commit a mass shooting, lots of serial killers in the past were often obsessed with their own public media image and nowadays a single mass shooting will take up 24 hour news stations for days, making the shooter forever infamous, while a killing of a few prositutes or taxi drivers over the course of months most likely won't even make local news.</p>
<p>There has also been a shift in culture and thinking where &quot;serial killer&quot; has become a bit of an older vague term, is a gang member or drug dealer who kills rivals a serial killer? How about a mujahideen who slaughters villagers and millitary personnel? Or a rapist or burglar who kills victims so they can't speak to the police? Cartel hitmen? People with mental disorders? Paranoid schizophrenics who snap? Religious terrorists? The word &quot;serial killer&quot; has become sort of an outdated term after the whole 60's-80's &quot;serial killer&quot; fad where every news organization wanted their own villian, and even a lot of serial killers of the past would probably lumped into rapists or terrorists nowadays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of note, the temperature difference you're talking about is an <em>average</em> for the <em>WORLD</em>. Local temperatures may vary wildly from this, which is part of the problem, as waters around corals heat up drastically on some days. It's not the 1-2C that's the problem, it's that couple of days at +10C (or more!) above normal temps that really cause the problems we're looking at. The &quot;higher on average&quot; is a way to show not just that it can/will have those unusual (and often unexpected, which can kill) temperature spikes, but also that there's some <em>underlying</em> issue raising temperatures steadily, as opposed to <em>just</em> spikes and things remaining relatively constant otherwise (denialists must find <em>something</em> that is also contributing to this process if they want to discount human-released carbon). Most people haven't spent much time digging into what &quot;global warming&quot; even means, but the above is just a taste - <strong>if temperatures are higher on average, that means there have been some much higher than normal spikes of high temps and a lack of low temps, which can kill anything. The speed of the change is a big factor, happening in decades rather than millenia or longer</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://data.aims.gov.au/aimsrtds/yearlytrends.xhtml" target="_blank">http://data.aims.gov.au/aimsrtds/yearlytrends.xhtml</a></p>
<p>(e; point being, coral can tolerate higher temp differences than 1C, just not spikes, especially not prolonged - and simply put, much of it <em>has</em> died in the past, but you often don't see such fast changes in temperature. It's not a guarantee, but it's possible that the coral would have enough genetic variation that something which can survive those higher temps has been generated, such that as the temps change, that variation survives and propagates while the rest of it dies - but often, it will all just die. The problem now is that it's happening so fast that the likelihood of variations which can handle higher temps actually occurring is low in the time frame they have given the speed of warming. Pretty sure there have been several similar die-offs, but if the warming <em>is</em> human made, and we don't change what's causing it, there's no expectation coral will survive at all.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Explanation as if you were actually 5:
Corals have roommates (zooxanthellae) who live inside them and do almost all the cooking. They have a lot of cooking equipment that is sensitive to temperature. When it gets too hot and the zooxanthellae don't cook well, the coral get rid of them and hope a new roommate will come along who can take the heat. This used to be a great way to deal with temperature change, but unfortunately it's gotten so hot recently that there are no more roommates nearby who can cook for the coral, and they die. </p>
<p>More in depth explanation:
So most reef building corals have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, a photosynthetic organism. The corals keep the zooxanthellae safer than they would be in the ocean, and are able to provide them with some of the nutrients they need. In turn, zooxanthellae create most of the energy needed for the production of the reef. There are slow growing corals that live without zooxanthellae, but they grow even slower than reef coral. </p>
<p>Zooxanthellae species are adapted to very specific temperatures (this is true of many single celled photosynthetic organisms in the ocean). They also live free floating in the ocean as plankton. </p>
<p>So the hypothesis is that corals expel the zooxanthellae when they are stressed out, and new zooxanthellae will colonize the coral that function better in whatever the new water conditions are. This made coral great at dealing with change in the past, because there was usually a different zooxanthellae that could help them out. But now, this strategy is maladaptive, because there are no better zooxanthellae nearby. So what has helped keep coral alive for so long is actually no longer useful when temperatures get this high. </p>
<p>As others have pointed out, pollution and ocean acidification also contribute to coral reef decline. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In one extreme case, it didn't. Back before the Permian we have rugose and tabulate. During the mass extinctions at the time they were wiped out and for millions of years the Earth just didn't have any corals. Then, sometime in the Triassic, a new type of coral called scleractinia evolved from a common ancestor with modern day anemones. These are the guys we still see around today. From what we think we know, the ancient coral varieties had similar relationships with algae as the modern day ones and it's possible that the climatic chaos of the Permian killed off that algae, leading to the loss of the coral.</p>
<p>While the Permian climate was much more volitile than that of today, the addition of man made chemicals into the ecosystem certainly isn't helping corals survive. The algae are generally thought to be the more fragile member of the coral partnership, so anything that detriments them can destroy the whole.</p>
<p>I realize now I forgot to answer your question. Just let that illustrate that corals don't always survive I guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5; TL;DR: Some drugs act directly, some indirectly. This one is more direct, and like what everybody said... <strong>there is just a lot more in your body than usual</strong> (making it harder to breakdown). I'm assuming DMT can just get to your brain without a problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>--less so ELI5... for just getting a base level understandign of how some stuff moves around If you want a scenario to something a little different (to compare to a more indirect action)... let's look at L-Dopa (a parkinson drug not meant to act directly but replenish Dopamine Levels in the Basal Ganglia of the Brain)
We cannot just give a patient Dopamine, because dopamine cannot cross the blood brain barrier.
Also... L-dopa itself can't really do anything, EXCEPT when L-dopa gets broken down into dopamine (which we already have) and that extra dopamine is used to help us out.
L-dopa won't function at all for parkinson's patients if it cannot cross the Blood Brain Barrier (or it is broken down into dopamine before crossing) so most patients receive C-dopa, which (for simplicity's sake) let's just say distracts the body from catching L-dopa so L-Dopa can sneak across the barrier to the brain. Although the actual mechanism is different, because we introduce dopamine in another form, the very general mechanism is the same, we overwhelm the body so it cannot break it down in the usal amount of time.</p>
<p>side note: i just learned ayuhuasca  contains it's own set chemicals that inhibit MAO from breaking down the DMT in ayuhuasca when taken orally</p>
<p>I'm sure i got something wrong somewhere, but i think it serves the purpose well enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It can become active orally only if taken concurrently with an inhibitor of MAO enzymes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter how you consume it, DMT by itself will never get you high. The MAO in the body instantly neutralise the DMT and restricts it's ability to act as a neurotransmitter. DMT is NOT a complex chemical, and is near identical to almost all neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine. DMT is one of the simpler ones, making it a common metabolite, and always present in the body in massive quantities. Monamine oxydase(MAO) is the only reason everybody isn't tripping every second of the day. None of this is simply unknown theory, it is a basic principal in all psychopharmachology. There is no debate about this in the scientific community. </p>
<p>This is also why monoamine oxidase inhibitors can dangerously interact with so many things like milk, soy sauce, and cured meats. The most common side effect of an interaction is serotonin syndrome, where the central nervous system can no longer regulate body temperature. Hyperthernia can take years to fully recover from. You know... if you don't die. This makes ayahuasca one of the most dangerous drugs, and should only be taken under supervision after 2 weeks of a carefully regulated diet.</p>
<p>Smoking DMT will have no effect at all. The only version of DMT that can be absorbed and used by the body immediately and unchanged is 5meo-DMT. It can ingested, insulflated, injected, or freebased. N,N DMT needs to be oxidized before it can be absorbed, and needs to be burned. </p>
<p>Edit: I could be confusing N,N DMT with 5meo-DMT. One of the two has to be oxidized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're ingesting it, when you inhale DMT vapour (or if it's injected) you flood your system with DMT so you send receptors sensitive to DMT into over-drive hence you blast into hyperspace. The trip is short because the body breaks DMT down to normal levels pretty quickly. </p>
<p>So the trip is your body's natural response to the flood of the chemical, which like you say is naturally produced by the brain. Hence the theories that spiritual experiences and such are related to the DMT produced naturally in the brain. </p>
<p>edit
Ayahuasca is a different way of consuming DMT, you drink it in a tea that contains other chemicals which allows your body to absorb the DMT orally and inhibits the breakdown of it, leading to a much longer experience </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people can have experiences growing up that &quot;teach&quot; them to be wary of situations that ohers haven't had a lot of bad experiences with so they don't think twice about it. Stuff as simple as having discussions -- if someone grew up in a place where they'd get treated badly if they said the wrong thing the wrong way then once they're an adult it will be stressful to be presented with situtions where the have to converse, and the stress might even make them say something strangely so even people who aren't trying to be abusive can perpetuate the defense with their normal reactions. And then where one person might see a harmless disagreement that people deal with fine all the time the other person perceives a stressful attack building up that they've been kinda trained to avoid as much as possible.</p>
<p>There's a lot of factors for sure (like just natural genetic or hormonal stuff) but that's just one way I've seen it. People adapt to growing up in certain environments, they have subtle techniques (without even trying) for avoiding situations that caused them pain before, and those adaptations don't always carry over to the larger world where those situations don't lead to the same things they've come to expect. And it can be hard for a person to separate their learned defenses from normal socialization and cues. Plus they can already be preparing defenses subconsciously before they're even aware of it consciously.</p>
<p>I have some mild anxiety that used to be a lot worse because my family moved around a lot and I got picked on pretty bad at one school at the start of freshman year (I had just arrived so I had no friends or anything yet). Eventually I moved from that school too but I had already &quot;learned&quot; to just stay out of peoples' ways and they wouldn't bother me as much. So through the rest of high school, even though I didn't get picked on very much again, I never made any friends or anything. So I didn't date either. Eventually I ended up just thinking I was ugly and weird and deserved to be by myself and the thought of having to have even a passing interaction with another human being made me sweaty and shakey. On top of home issues, I started developing a serious fear of people and having to interact/be judged by them. It wasn't until college, I was 20, that I started getting the sense that maybe I was kind of attractive and maybe I was smart enough to have conversations after all and maybe I shouldn't be so afraid of people. 4 years later and I have some solid friends and an amazing girlfriend (after a couple not so amazing ones lol) and I finally feel like how I think I SHOULD have felt years ago.</p>
<p>Lol I didn't mean to turn this into a life story, but it's a part of my views on anxiety. It also took me meeting people with anxiety worse than me (for way better reasons too...) to start examining my own issues</p>
<p>But also note that people can have anxiety over other things too. Someone can have all sorts of friends but still have massive anxiety about how to behave or what's expected of them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an early childhood teacher (specialise in understanding birth-5 years) and my husband's a clinical psychologist (across the lifespan). We talk a lot about the theory and research behind this and there is considerable overlap in our work. In a nutshell, a lot of stems down to the attachment you formed with your caregivers in early childhood, particularly from the age of 0-2. This is backed up by the work of John Bowlby, [Harry Harlow's experiments] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O60TYAIgC4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O60TYAIgC4</a>), (very distressing to watch), and the people who have extended and expanded Bowlby's work [Circle of Security] (<a href="https://www.circleofsecurityinternational.com/animations" target="_blank">https://www.circleofsecurityinternational.com/animations</a>), [Strange Situation experiment] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTsewNrHUHU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTsewNrHUHU</a>), [Still Face experiment] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzXGEbZht0&spfreload=10" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzXGEbZht0&spfreload=10</a>)</p>
<p>Everyone develops an attachment to their caregivers. 1) Secure (60% of people) or one of the three insecure versions (the other 40% of people): 2) Anxious-ambivalent 3) Avoidant-dismissive. 4) Disorganised. </p>
<p>Anxious-ambivalent attachment is what makes you more susceptible to anxiety disorders. It is characterised by a caregiver who is inconsistent in their approach - sometimes they are loving and responsive to your cues, othertimes they are emotionally unavailable (might have PND or are preoccupied with their own problems) and will respond in a harsh, unloving manner to your cues. The child at this young age has not yet developed the understanding of theory of mind, so they are very sensitive to the parent's emotions, they believe that they are the one and the same person as their caregiver. They cannot understand that a caregiver is a separate entity to themselves. If a parent is constantly sad, they will be sad. If a parent is constantly angry, they will be angry. If a parent is constantly anxious, they will be anxious. They internalise the parent's emotional state and it becomes their own. In infancy, they are also developing Mirror Neurons, where they imitate their caregivers behaviours. So if a parent has an anxious face, the child will mirror it (and feel that way). The Still Face experiment is a good one to watch on youtube to see this in action.  </p>
<p>Good news, is that attachment can change when you're an adult. It's called an earned secure attachment. Adult attachment styles in romantic relationships correspond with the one you developed with your caregiver (hence why you might always go for a certain type of person). You can change this by becoming aware of your own mental health and changing that by doing therapy to change these patterns of interaction. Medication will help with stabilising mood, but it's a bandaid, it won't fix the underlying wound.</p>
<p>TLDR; If your parent is/was anxious in your infancy, you probably developed it too. You can undo it and develop an earned secure attachment as an adult to prevent the cycle reoccuring. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Normal&quot; people still experience many of the same symptoms as people with psychological disorders just not the the extent that it interferes with our day to day lives. The only time something becomes a disorder is when it begins to interfere with a persons ability to lead a productive happy life. </p>
<p>There are many reasons for humans to feel anxious, however under the right circumstances these feelings may develop into a more chronic feeling of which may limit the person from doing things they normally would. At this point it can be considered a disorder. </p>
<p>IT IS PERFECTLY NORMAL TO FEEL ANXIOUS. If you don't feel even a little bit anxious when doing things that are out of your comfort zone you should probably go seek professional help because you may be a psycho. That being said just remember that it is perfectly human to experience extreme feelings, just not all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people are tall, some people are short.  Some people are nearsighted, some people have good eyesight.  I personally have one calf slightly longer than the other, and one thighbone slightly longer than the other, so that it causes my back to twist ever so slightly, and gives me some trouble running, but you can't easily notice it. </p>
<p>Our brains deal with things in various different ways.  Anxiety is a stress response.  The way we feel is mostly moderated by regions in our midbrain. As animals and the structure of the brain evolved, the more developed parts kind of grew on top of what was already successful.  The hindbrain is one of those early more successful bits, and its role is to coordinate some of the more complicated systems like motor control, our breathing, our sleep, autonomic behaviors.  Having this lets you be a more complex organism that can do things like breathe instead of needing a way to passively absorb oxygen.</p>
<p>Past that, one of the simpler successful structures that evolved was the Amygdala.  This is in the midbrain, so after the hindbrain, as part of the system that influences your behavior. The midbrain does some more sensory processing, so it handles things like vision and hearing, alertness, motivation, sensitivity to temperature.   The amygdala works in conjunction with your sensory perception does some processing and based on that processing, makes your body spit out hormones like adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol.  These go to other parts of your midbrain and which activate parts that tell you to be alert, to be motivated, to be careful and to be distrustful (more or less). </p>
<p>So when you see something that the brain has evolved to treat as bad (like the color of blood, or something very large), or more advanced, if you see something that causes you to recall something that has caused you stress (like a clown after seeing IT), it responds by spitting out these hormones and making you feel stress, anxiety, motivation, anger.</p>
<p>Next there's other parts of your midbrain that are a bit more advanced that have more to do with advanced planning in your limbic system, and they deal with hormones that moderate your feelings of satisfaction and drive to accomplish long-term goals, like seratonin and dopamine, or your feelings of attachment and family like oxytocin. These are less important for some animals, if an animal has to eat when it's hungry, run when it's hurt or being chased, mate when it's near a suitable mate, and ignore its babies, then you can get by without the energetically expensive parts of the brain.</p>
<p>But we're very social, and very smart, so we have the extended version.  And they conflict, sometimes long term planning means needing to override a stress response, so they interact, one suppresses the other. </p>
<p>Next there's the forebrain and this is where it gets really messy.  This is the part where we think, and plan.  While the midbrain gives us the motivation to go after longer-term goals, that's more in the Pavlovian sort of &quot;if I hit this button now, I'll get a treat soon&quot;.  The forebrain is what tells us &quot;If I take these seeds that I can eat and plant them, then in 6 months I can collect more seeds, and have a bunch of food to eat.&quot; and it needs to override the other parts of the brain that are saying that those seeds look good to eat right now.</p>
<p>So back to anxiety.  Everyone's different. And just like some people have longer legs, some people have more or less receptors for some hormones, or more or less sensitivity to them, or they make them at different levels. Not too wildly different, but a little bit.  I mean that's how we evolved to this point at all, our ancestors were a little bit different than them, and over millions of years, we're able to use our thinking to suppress our fear better than our ancestors of a million years ago could because that has been generally advantageous to our population.</p>
<p>So now fast forward to now, we're smart, we can think about a lot of things, understand things that are going on, we're asking questions about why people have anxiety disorders and others don't.  We can recognize that there's a difference.  At the same time, we have systems that allow different signals from different parts of the brain overriding eachother, but these systems are more or less sensitive from person to person because of just how they get put together.  So for some people, it takes a lot more contribution from the anticipation of good results from whatever it is you're trying to do to override the fear of something bad happening while you do it than it does for other people. </p>
<p>Most people are within a certain range. Not too anxious, and not too tolerant of risk. Some people fall a little further out so that it's noticable, and some people are so far out that it becomes obvious that it affects their ability to function. </p>
<p>Then you have the fact that our forebrain still goes and messes things up.  A big part of how we handle fear, stress, anxiety is based on how we recall memories. When we associate something with a stressful memory or conceptualization, it triggers that stress response, which then becomes a memory itself.  You can start to become anxious about becoming anxious essentially. So not only do we have the &quot;how your brain happened to grow?&quot; part of the equation, we have the &quot;what have you learned?&quot; part of the equation as well, and I think the majority of people can develop anxiety issues through experience.  Those that can't would be the ones whose brains are the most resilient to that, and who might start to have problems with ignoring risks.</p>
<p>But essentially, some people are going to have anxiety disorders no matter what they do because that's the way they're wired.  Many more people will have anxiety disorders through a combination of experience that triggers a sort of self-perpetuating effect and possibly a minor predisposition to it based on their neurology.  Many people will have no anxiety disorder because they've not been exposed to that sort of experience that triggers them, but could develop it under other circumstances, and few others might be very unlikely to experience anxiety, even under circumstances where it would be expected or beneficial. </p>
<p>If you do suffer from anxiety disorders, you can manage it with drugs that affect the way your brain handles those hormones in your brain, or you can learn how to break that self-feeding cycle and learn how to avoid triggering it.  However, depending on what's the cause, one or the other might be a better or worse choice.  If your issue is primarily related to an issue with neurotransmitters or receptors, it might be not enough to just learn to avoid triggers.  </p>
<p>But despite all of this, we're still really not very good at understanding or manipulating our brains.  It's hard to tell whether it's one thing or another that's causing it in any person, and treatment is often a bit of trial and error and going with the least worst solution. </p>
<p>But when we label something as &quot;anxiety disorder&quot; it sounds like it's some kind of problem like chicken pox with an obvious cause.  But in reality it's more like asking why some people have height deficiency disorder and others don't, where you define &quot;height deficiency disorder&quot; as when a man is shorter than 5'8&quot;. The reality is that everyone's just a different height, some people are 5'6&quot;, some are 5'7&quot;, some are 5'8&quot;, some are 5'9&quot;.  Some people are 4 feet tall, and some people are 7.  Some people are short because of malnutrition, and some people are very tall because of a hormonal problem. Sometimes it's genetics. Some are tall with long legs, some are tall with a long back.  But in the end, regardless of the cause, some people hit their heads on door frames.  </p>
<p>People have an anxiety disorder for different reasons. Unreasonable anxiety comes from the interplay of numerous systems, including your experiences. It's really hard to tell specifically why in any individual.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have severe ptsd and anxiety disorder. and this is how my psycgologist explained anxiety disorder to me (to pursuade me to do physical therapy):
&quot;People have a fright and fight mode, and a usual relaxed mode. In fright and fight mode you are alert and ready for a bad situation to occur any moment, where as when you feel safe, you usually are in the relaxed mode. </p>
<p>They trigger different areas of the brain. Most people can switch modes according to situation. Some people though, have trouble switching. They are always on a fright and fight mode and it becomes a disorder as you lost functionality to switch back according to situation. This can be hormonal, or in your (my) case, habitual.</p>
<p>Medication is less effective on you (knocks me out 20 hours a day without an effect that worths it) as it is not hormonal. Physical therapy would help better as it is an exercise to train your body to find ways to control the modes. It helps you to actually re-evaluate the situation instead of straight up panicking, so you can recognize that you are safe and helps you to have better access to your relax-mode self.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad is a project manager for a developer. I asked him this question a few weeks ago. Here's what he said:</p>
<p>I would think it is a combination of a lot of the items the article mentioned plus many other items. There is a current lack of skilled labor which is forcing contractors to work overtime to complete projects. Also, our government regulations and review, paperwork processes keeps getting worse. The states control many of these projects but they have to meet federal guidelines to get federal funds. Double government control. Double the paperwork to get plans approved and get paid. Doesn’t help. (I have a small project right now for 1000’ of new city sewer. I need Delaware City, Delaware County, Orange Township, Army Corp of Engineers, and OhioEPA approval. And I’m paying for the work, no government funds.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One thing that was mentioned many years ago. Public projects here are awarded to the lowest bidder because of the government. However, in much of Europe and Japan, they are awarded to bidders who provides best warranty. More care taken to complete work and much less work needed to make changes because you can reuse existing base.  May cost more to build initially in Europe, but much lower costs in future. Low bidder here figures they will make it up on changes. In US, we don’t care because we will just replace it… Lower bidder has to make profit so they hire lower skilled and less productive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a culture growing in construction trades to care less about others work. Trade A (electrician) doesn’t care about another Trade B(plumber)'s work. If Trade B does something that is in way of Trade A, they just cut through it and then don’t tell anyone. Eventually Trade A has to come back and fix. And at end of day, they don’t finish what they are doing, they just leave. Then next day they have to inevitably rework some portion of work they did yesterday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And I think our geography may play a role. Workers have to travel further because we are much more spread out. Makes for unhappy workers which equals unproductive workers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know I am late in responding but I work in the construction industry in both U.K. And USA.  Brief synopsis :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>More regulation / red tape in the us.  Permits are more complicated, inspection process is more rigorous whereas the U.K. Once you have planning permission and building regs plans approval your contractor is essentially self regulating their construction work and quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.K. And Europe has been doing it longer and has more construction case law, which people have learned from.  The process in the U.K. Is more streamlined and relies more on upfront reviews of design, cost and feasibility using cost and project managers as a key part of the design team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.K. Government in the 90's funded research into improving construction (Egan and Latham reports) and the result has been 20 years of turning what was a very adversarial industry into a collaborative partnership approach.</p>
</li>
<li>I would like to add that the us construction industry pushes more boundaries than the U.K.  There is no such thing as cannot be done.  The cost managers focus on cost in the U.K. often dilutes design (not the fault of the CM just the result).</li>
</ol>
<p>The people I have have worked with both sides of the Atlantic are equally passionate, the lazy guys are equally lazy, the demo guy's all drive range rovers, the architects all wear turn ups on their trousers and clarks desert boots.  Differences are slim.  The U.K. Has just got a bit more upfront process in place, is a bit more self regulatory and a bit less likely to push boundaries.</p>
<p>Both could learn from each other though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
