		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to appreciate the history of the bicycle. We didn't leap from nothing to the penny-farthing. The first historically verified bicycle was a German invention that was called a &quot;running machine&quot;. It had two wheels and was steerable, and you sat in a saddle and walked. The bicycle allowed you to glide and save effort. It looked much like a modern bicycle with two wheels of equivalent size, a frame, handle bars, and a seat between the two wheels.</p>
<p>The penny-farthing eventually evolved because people realized that driving the wheel itself might be more advantageous. At this point, if you can glide on a running machine, it doesn't take much more to drive pedals, you can already maintain balance. They used a gigantic wheel because machining and materials were not sophisticated enough to build chains and gearing, the large wheel allowed you to build appreciable speed. The style of bicycle of the penny-farthing is called a &quot;Standard&quot; bicycle.</p>
<p>There was a strong desire to build a modern bicycle, called then a &quot;safety bicycle&quot;, because the standard was quite dangerous in a few scenarios - it had the inclination to pitch you forward and drive your face into the ground. The only thing that held it back was the gearing and chain mechanism, because small wheels under direct drive can't go fast.</p>
<p>It was all an evolution, from one working concept to the next, and only a little daring. A lot of early innovation was like this, that the concept is sound, you just have to figure out what you're missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When an object is invented, it has a purpose. You already know what it is for. </p>
<p>If you want to throw a knife far away, and you work with strings and sticks every day, it's easy to imagine a bow. You will invent the bow. You'll probably be very bad at it at the start but you know what it is for and if you want to kill some animals without taking any risk, you will practice.</p>
<p>For object that are more complexe, like a bicycle, or musical instrument, the practice existed even before the object, it's just before there was a simpler object and we made this new one because it would be better at accomplishing its purpose. It might be harder to use but you will go faster, or you will make better music.  </p>
<p>String -&gt; harp -&gt; guitar</p>
<p>Wheel -&gt; Draisine -&gt; Bicycle </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Musical instruments are maybe the hardest to understand.  Many of them require thousands of hours to become proficient, much more to achieve mastery. But virtually every musical instrument evolved from something simpler, and that simpler thing from something even simpler still. An oboe is a difficult instrument to play well, but go far enough back and you understand that it evolved (in <em>many</em> steps) from simple flute-like instruments that were easy to learn.</p>
<p>Ten thousand years ago young people observed older people playing an instrument similar to a modern recorder, and were inspired that their own poor playing could someday equal the talent of the older player. Over time the instrument became more complex, perhaps more notes or a more complete scale. At every improvement more experienced players existed to inspire less skilled players. Woodwinds then evolved to flutes, to single reed instruments, and then to double-reed instruments like the oboe. But every step was slow and gradual, and at every step there were older skilled players to inspire - and teach - less skilled players.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The relevant fields are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>post-quantum cryptography</em>, and it refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. More specifically, the problem with the currently popular algorithms is when their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorisation problem, the discrete logarithm problem, or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm.</p>
<p>PQC revolves around at least 6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography#Algorithms" target="_blank">approaches</a>. Note that some currently used symmetric key ciphers are resistant to attacks by quantum computers.</p>
</li>
<li><em>quantum key distribution</em>, uses quantum mechanics to guarantee secure communication. It enables two parties to construct a shared secret, which can then be used to establish confidentiality in a communication channel. QKD has the unique property that it can detect tampering from a third party -- if a third party wants to observe a quantum system, it will thus collapse some qubits in a superposition, leading to detectable anomalies. QKD relies on the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics instead of the computational difficulty of certain mathematical problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these subfields are quite old. People were thinking about the coming of quantum computing since the early 1970s, and thus much progress has already been made in this area. It is unlikely that we'll have to give up communication privacy and confidentiality because of advances in quantum computation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are post-quantum classical algorithms which other more qualified people can comment on. The long and short of it is that quantum computers are not magic. They can do some things very well, and some things not well at all. In particular, symmetric encryption systems like AES are not vulnerable. Quantum algorithms such as Grover's algorithm do cut the brute force decryption down by a respectable amount, but that just means you need to increase the key size. The algorithm itself is not fundamentally vulnerable.</p>
<p>The other side of the quantum coin is quantum key distribution which is mathematically secure given assumed security of the communications channel (since it is essentially a one-time pad), and is also resistant to eavesdropping even if the communications channel is not secure. The best known such algorithm is called BB84 which leverages the superposition property of quantum systems but importantly <em>not</em> the entanglement property. This is useful because entanglement is quite difficult to maintain which is why quantum computers (which make heavy use of entanglement) are so hard to construct.</p>
<p>Basically, the idea is if Alice wants to share a secret key with Bob (for, say, the AES algorithm), normally she'd use something like RSA. But we're in a post-quantum computer world and RSA isn't secure anymore. Instead, Alice decides to use BB84. Roughly speaking:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alice generates a string of <em>2n</em> pairs of random classical bits. I'll call each pair <em>(a,x)</em>. These must be truly random, so maybe she measure some other quantum system or uses radioactive decay or something to get these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She then uses the bit <em>x</em> to decide how to encode the bit <em>a</em> on a  photon (a quantum bit, or qubit). Specifically, we use the polarisation of the light to encode <em>a</em>. If <em>x = 0</em>, then we say that <em>a = 0</em> means we send a photon polarised 'up' and <em>a = 1</em> means we send a photon polarised 'down'. If <em>x = 1</em> then we rotate this by 45 degrees and send a photon either polarised 'left' or 'right'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, Bob has received an email from Alice telling him she wants to send him some stuff. Therefore, independently he has generated his own set of random classical bits I'll label <em>y</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob uses <em>y</em> to decide how to measure the photon Alice has sent him. If <em>y = 0</em> he measures the photon along the 'up-down' axis. If <em>y = 1</em> he measured the photon along the 'left-right' axis. Once he has done this, he gets his own set of pairs of classical bits, <em>(b,y)</em>, where <em>b</em> is the result of his measurement: 0 if he measured up or left, and 1 if he measured down or right.</p>
</li>
<li>Now Alice and Bob communicate via email or WhatsApp or something about their values for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. If For a given pair <em>x = y</em> then they know their <em>a = b</em> even though they never talk about it, and they add this to their secret key. If <em>x =/= y</em> then there's a 50/50 chance that <em>a = b</em> or not, so they throw this away. On average they keep <em>n</em> bits and key a secret key of length <em>n</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why does this work? Well, if a quantum system is measured in the same way it was set up (up-down or left-right), then the result will always just be the same as the setup. If, however, you measure it differently (e.g., measure left-right even though Alice setup up-down), the result is completely random. Hence, Alice and Bob can know they have shared the same key even though they never talk about it.</p>
<p>In practice the difficulty with this is the bit I skimmed over (or didn't mention at all), which is how do you send the photon from Alice to Bob. You can't just push it down a fibre optic cable because you'll spoil the polarisation. This is where entanglement and quantum teleportation comes in, and is really the main barrier to large scale deployment. It is, however, still easier than quantum computing to achieve practically. Functioning networks have been set up in China, Austria, and Switzerland. Also in Canada they recently managed to use existing internet infrastructure to achieve QKD which is quite exciting because normally you'd consider it to be far too noisy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haha! Finally MY degree is useful here. I am a special education teacher and teach middle school high functioning autism. I also happen to teach for a cooperative, mrsningy (edit: most of my) students​ come from all around the area, covering multiple school districts each with their own set of expectations for student growth. I'm basically told each year &quot;figure something out&quot;.</p>
<p>Now this would be golden for most teachers who hate teaching from a required script but since I deal with students who hate school by the time they get to me, it can get tough. I'm also a veteran teacher so my admins just figure I know what I'm doing (sometimes I do sometimes I don't). I'm given a budget each year and expected to field an entire curriculum from that.</p>
<p>About 4 year ago I decided that having them read science fiction and fantasy books is over. They prefer that type of story because it's more fun to read, but I hate Harry Potter and the hunger games by now, so I decided to find books that would challenge them. We now read classics iny classroom like &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and 'Huck Finn&quot;, books that have far deeper meaning than anything they would ever read on their own, and books that even most middle school teachers avoid. </p>
<p>So for my experience, we read those books because I want them to. </p>
<p>Edit: We read Percy Jackson each year because I can tie in Greek history and they get a kick out of that. We do read plenty of books they enjoy but I HAVE to expose them to historical literature or &quot;classics&quot; such as The Outsiders which most may not consider a classic yet. Most of my students come to me because their home schools have given up on them and can't figure out how to teach them. I have a specialized classroom designed for their needs and while it is a relaxing place I force them to challenge themselves and at times the work is far tougher than in their home school because I do have that easier environment to learn in. But they all come out better people because of it. If I don't they won't be prepared for high school and I have yet to have a student not finish a book and love it after six years in this group. Yes it's hard and yes they fight at first but once we see in there I see the light in their eyes and I know I have them hooked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So educators are usually really <em>bad</em> at explaining why you read the things you read for school.  The core concept to grasp here is the <em>literary canon</em>: that is, the body of works that are the foundation of [Western] literature.  They are the most historically and culturally significant pieces of literature being studied currently.  But how do works get added to the canon?</p>
<p>The surface layer is that they get into the canon because old stuffy [usually white, usually male] scholars <em>want</em> to study them, so they do, so it's expected that their students study them, so they do, so it's expected that to prepare for college you have to study them, so you do.  It's not like a few Ivy League professors sat down in a dark, smokey room and discussed the future of the literary canon...but also it kind of is like that?  Keep in mind, there are multiple &quot;sub-canons&quot;.  There is the American literature canon (featuring Anne Bradstreet, Thoreau, Emerson, Faulkner, Hemingway, Whitman, etc.); the British literature canon (Shakespeare, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Donne, Jane Austen, etc.), the poetry canon (Frost, Emerson, Whitman, Donne, Herbert, Shakespeare, etc.), the historical foundational canon (Homer, Virgil, <em>Beowulf</em>, <em>Gilgamesh</em>, etc.), the science fiction canon (Mary Shelley, Frank Herbert, Robert Heinlein, etc.).  I know I'm throwing a lot of names at you; the point is that there is <em>the canon</em> and then there is &quot;I'm studying English poetry in the late 1800s, <em>these</em> are the people I should be reading&quot;.</p>
<p>Which then <strong>raises</strong> the question, why do those scholars want to study those works?  We have the benefit of hindsight, so <em>today</em> we might read Hemingway and [rightly] think he's boring and dry.  But at the time his writing style was revolutionary.  Before Hemingway, prose was all very <em>eloquent</em> and had propensity for verbosity.  Hemingway wrote in a short, clean, <em>different</em> style.  You may not like it, but he made it ok to <em>not</em> write in the old, stuffy way that everyone had been writing before him.  That's not to say Hemingway was the first, or the best, but he was <em>good</em> and he was famous and he showed everyone that you could write in a different fashion.  Suddenly everyone was writing in this new minimalist style, which in turn led to other changes in literature that allowed for the kinds of books we read today for fun.  Without Hemingway, our literature today would look <em>very</em> different.  Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson did the same thing for poetry.  Those are some very specific examples, but I hope they can demonstrate how authors can influence literature, and sometimes they're a part of the canon for those reasons.</p>
<p>The very old part of the canon is in there for much the same reason, but more in the sense of <em>inventing literature at all</em>.  Homer's Odyssey is the foundational work for <em>so much</em> of western literature.  Literally everything you've ever read, <strong>ever</strong>, was influenced by the Odyssey.  And Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest great work of literature - the oldest version of That Movie That Everyone Saw.  It's the first ever example of real literature, which is kind of a big deal.  Studying them can help you understand how storytelling evolved, by showing you how it started.  I won't go into too much detail here about what, exactly, you would learn (narrative structure, framing devices...) because I don't need to give you an English lesson, eh?  Suffice it to say, there's a lot there to unpack.</p>
<p>Some works are a part of the canon because they're just easy to digest.  F. Scott Fitzgerald is fairly easy to analyze and understand on a more abstract level, mostly because all of his symbolism is the same (that is, everything represents the &quot;unobtainable American Dream&quot;).  It wouldn't do any good to say, &quot;Here kids, learn how to analyze literature by <em>analyzing the most difficult literature possible</em>&quot;.  Of course, unfortunately that's often <em>exactly</em> what English classes do.  It's akin to saying, &quot;Here kids, let's learn how to do math.  Shall we start with calculus?  No?  Trigonometry then...&quot;  Which is unfortunate, because literature is awesome and there's some really cool stuff to learn...once you learn the tools you need to do it.  But I digress.</p>
<p>But most of the canon boils down to be cultural icons of the time when they were published, or sometimes later when people rediscovered them.  They can be both a window into the culture surrounding the person that wrote the works, why they wrote what they did, what symbolism they were using at the time, how they thought and viewed the world; and also a window into how that one piece of literature or author or movement changed the culture they were in, which trickled down to influence our own culture.  They can also be ways to understand ourselves by analyzing our own reactions to what we're reading, and the literature in the canon often elicits strong reactions in its readers.</p>
<p>None of that is to say that the canon is perfect; far from it!  I studied English and I hate huge chunks of the canon (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6de844/eli5_how_and_why_are_books_like_the_great_gatsby/di26o3c/" target="_blank">don't even get me started on <em>Catcher in the Rye</em></a>).  But that's the idea of it: important literature that had a powerful influence on people and the times they were from, which encourages others to study that literature, which is itself a strong reaction that encourages others to study why the first people studied it, etc., so that it continues to have influence and continues to be important literature worth studying.  TL;DR: The literary canon is literature that is &quot;worth studying&quot;.</p>
<p>EDIT: Important thing I totally missed.  The literary canon is also supposed to be an introduction to your own national identity.  When you so much as watch cartoons you'll be getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jDcWAWRRHo" target="_blank">references to cultural icons</a>.  Seriously, as an adult go back and watch Animaniacs (it's on Netflix!) and see how many references you <em>didn't</em> get when you were a kid.  When you read the American literary canon it's in part teaching you what it means to be an American.  It helps build a unifying web of understanding, because when you make a joke about how painting a fence is &quot;fun&quot; and someone else laughs, you think <em>This guy also read Tom Sawyer</em> and you feel a connection with that person.  Enough of those cultural connections help form the glue that is our national identity.  It kind of sounds like indoctrination...and it kind of is.  And that's not <em>bad</em> because it's teaching you about your country and how to be a citizen of that country, which is perfectly fine as long as it doesn't get out of control.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hemingway has one m.  I derped <em>so hard</em>.  Thanks for the guys that caught it.  EDIT: and Emerson, dammnit.  I am a derp, sorry for the typos.  Eventually I'll run out of names to misspell.</p>
<p>EDIT: for the pedants: <del>begs</del> raises</p>
<p>EDIT: Obligatory Thanks for the Gold, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gFLVgp4.png" target="_blank">I think they misspelled Emmerson</a>. ^^/s</p>
<p>Because people have been asking: <a href="https://rhynoreviews.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">This is my scifi reviews/essay blog</a>.  The responses have really been really encouraging, so I'm going to try to revitalize it and get to posting there again.  If you're into aquariums, <a href="https://amateurproaquarist.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">I also have a blog about aquariums</a>.  I do most of my writing on Reddit, though - right here in ELI5!</p>
<p>I have been convinced to reread <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> to see if age will give me a better perspective.  I stand by my dislike of Hemingway, but if you enjoy him don't let me stop you.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR - Like the rest of this comment, the books you are assigned to read in class are probably worth reading for reasons that will be made clear if you read the rest of that book/this comment.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They choose the books based of Historical/cultural significance and writing quality. Basically all the books you study should be chosen based on some important theme in them - of Mice and Men is about the depression, Gatsby is about the Roaring Twenties and To Kill a Mockingbird is about racism and the Great Depression. This can inform the students about important context (especially Mockingbird) and a 'real connection' often makes books more attractive to study. </p>
<p>The other reason is that these books are easy to analyse. They are full of symbolism, foreshadowing and the historical context. Books like Frankenstein might be a dry read but it is a goldmine for analysis, and the deeper themes present (social commentary, (possible) homosexuality) means you can go to town on them. It is far easier to study that (and will benefit your skills more) than to go for something more enjoyable and (often) newer - which are often more readable but less deep (or restrictively long). </p>
<p>Of Mice and Men is a really easy text to do analysis in, it's short and full of foreshadowing. Gatsby also has foreshadowing, but also themes of wealth, inequality etc. And some books can be 'read into' easily - that Nick is gay is not specific in the text but many student pick that up and believe it, it gives chances to develop skills simpler books don't have. </p>
<p>These make then qualify for the studying 'cannon', books like Gatsby and Of Mice and Men are chosen a lot because of the wealth of secondary literature on them, making critical opinion easy to find. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two reasons we read these books: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The books are part of a group of well-respected books called &quot;the canon.&quot; These are books that over the years scholars have studied again and again until they became &quot;classic.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>Out of all the books in the canon, some are easier to teach because  they are more obvious in their use of literary devices (tools writers use to make their points). The Great Gatsby, for example, uses metaphors and symbolism all over the place. They're easy to point out and kids get a quick win when they recognize them. </li>
</ol>
<p>Most high school reading fulfills both of these criteria. Occasionally you'll see teachers pick books that aren't classic but have a literary device they want to teach, or you'll see books from the canon that are harder to teach but important to learn (some Shakespeare). But you'll seldom see some of the denser  or more ambiguous books in the canon: I've yet to see a high school teacher try to teach Ulysses. </p>
<p>Edit: TIL that plenty of high schools were way cooler than my kinda crappy backwater public school and taught Joyce's Ulysses. Color me jealous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you have a field whose intensity is spread evenly over a surface (e.g. a gravitational field is the same everywhere at a fixed distance from a central mass), and the surface area of a sphere grows with the square of its radius, the field to remain evenly spread out must decrease with the square of distance.</p>

<p>As you move away from the source of any of those forces or effects that radiate outwards - the total area of all points that distance away does not increase linearly, but quadratically.</p>
<p>Imagine a ball anda sphere around that ball with all points exactly 1m away (i.e. a 1m radius).</p>
<p>Now imagine a sphere with all points 2m from the ball (radius 2m).</p>
<p>The surface area of the 2nd sphere is not double the first but proportional to the square (4πr^2 to be precise for the surface area - and you are increasing r).</p>
<p>As such, any force or effect in 3 dimensional space, assuming it radiates evenly will decrease in magnitude by the inverse square as you move away from it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drop a stone into a pond.  The energy the stone imparts on the water makes a ripple that travels outward.  As the circular ripple grows in diameter, that energy remains the same, but it's spread out over the circumference of the wave.  The length of the wave grows linearly because the circumference, in this case the length, is pi * diameter.  The energy at any point is just the total energy, divided by the total length, because it's evenly spread out.  So in this case the energy is inverse (not squared).  So 1/distance.</p>
<p>Now extend that concept to three dimensional fields.  Now instead of having a circular ripple travelling outwards, you have a spherical surface travelling outwards.  The sphere has an surface area (i.e. distance squared), instead of just a length.  So it's exactly the same as the stone in the pond, but instead of an ever increase one dimensional length, it's an ever increasing three dimensional bubble.  </p>
<p>It's not that hard when you think about it that way.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a video projector projecting solid red rectangle on a white wall.  If you double the distance from projector to wall, the image size doubles along both the X and Y dimension so that the red area quadruples.  However, the amount of light energy is fixed and the image appears dimmer.  How much dimmer?  If you measure the light energy in the original X by Y rectangle, you'll find it's reduced to a fourth the brightness because the other 3 fourths are busy making the rectangle 4x bigger.  Hence the inverse square law.  It's basically due to energy spreading out along a 2D front into 3D space.  If you want to capture all the energy, you need quadruple the surface area each time you double the distance, but if your capture area is fixed, you get 75% less energy each time you double the distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the part about retrieving it, difficulty in space is not a matter of distance: it's a matter of <em>speed</em>. Normally these two are related, as reaching farther requires achieving higher speeds, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>It's all because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation" target="_blank">Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation</a>: propellant requirements grow exponentially with respect to the speed you're trying to achieve. For normal missions to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) this is already too bad: consider, for instance, that the Space Shuttle used to have a gross mass of 2000 tons at take off (off the top of my head, each booster had 600 tons of fuel and the main tank had nearly 700 tons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen), but only 80 tons made it to orbit at a speed of 7.6 km/s. All that enormous amount of fuel means money.</p>
<p>Voyager I is getting away from the Solar System at nearly 17 km/s. It's a very high speed for an object that far away from the Sun. If a similar object were approaching instead, it would be accelerated by the Sun's gravity and get close to Earth at much higher speeds. Haven't done the math but a certain lower bound for this is 42 km/s (the Sun's escape speed at a distance of 1AU). Earth is moving at 30 km/s, intuitively you may think we have to match the difference of 12 km/s but this is not necessarily the case: if it's moving perpendicularly to our orbit at the time of crossing it then the vector difference will be much larger. You have to match its velocity precisely to get a smooth approach.</p>
<p>Rendez-Vous in space is hard if you don't have control of the other object. Would it even be still working after several thousand years in a journey through space? If the attitude control system is broken (most likely it will be), then it will be just tumbling freely, making it difficult to grab. It could even destroy the ship that tries to retrieve it. And assuming it was built by an alien civilization, we wouldn't have any idea of its interfaces or physical measures to attach to. Forget about a smooth docking like they do with the ISS. Probably have to think about a net to trap it, which could damage its sensitive parts (antennas, cameras, etc) if it's spinning.</p>
<p>And then you have to accelerate it in the opposite direction to bring it back. Twice the delta-v doesn't mean twice the fuel, but much more. Blame Tsiolkovsky again for that. Be ready to put down a lot of money for this, which will most likely require several launches and assembly in orbit (like they did with the ISS).</p>
<p>Then we'd have to think how to make it survive atmospheric entry, strong acceleration and the shock of landing. If it wasn't designed for this and we don't have precise documentation about the details of the design, I'd say forget it. The Space Shuttle could retrieve objects in orbit and bring them back, as it did with the station's MPLM modules, but only because they were designed specifically for the attachments and physical measures of the Shuttle's cargo bay. You cannot do that with an alien object. You cannot even do it with a man-made object that was designed for a different launcher!</p>
<p>Aaaand engineers would have to design the mission with a very tight time constraint, as an object &quot;passing through&quot; the Solar System is certainly above escape speed and won't come back. Any delays in the design and manufacturing translate directly into a mission failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As noted above the distance isn't really the hang-up. Fantasizing about the probe, we can say that it can communicate via our highest available technology - lets say its full-light spectrum signals. So, both the probe and us are able to send and receive data via the entire light wave length broadband. This would be the fastest form of communication.</p>
<p>The problem is, the probe would have to travel at such a velocity and vector as to: not be obscured by local bodies or phenomena; move, emote, or otherwise behave in such a way to distinguish itself from local bodies and phenomena; direct its signal towards a populated section of earth with detection facilities (a telescope or satallite range, or even an orbiting station lets say); said installation must be looking in the quadrant of space at the same time; this all occurs whilst humans spend very little (comparative) money on extraterrestrial life detection.</p>
<p>In theory, we could visually or electronically (radio etc) detect a probe leaving its original system/cluster. Thats to say current technology can do this. However, having the fortune of our planet and station, and the intervening other space bodies, cooperate to align our fields of vision is probabilistic low.</p>
<p>Think of this, you and a friend are playing hide and go seek in a football stadium. To win you have to align a laser pointer directly into the other person's eye. You two are not alone in the stadium, as a seemingly random number of strangers and objects litter different sectors of the stadium. Now, each object, person (including the two players), and chair (etc.) has its own spin-velocity and trajectory. Oh, and the stadium lights flicker in somewhat of a pattern onto each section - with various colors and bulb types. </p>
<p>You could think of yourself squarely in the middle of eveything, desperately shining your laser pointer into the stands. Thats a rough idea of what detecting a probe would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We could feasibly send a probe of our own to interact with it almost anywhere in the solar system, as long as we had a decade to plan and design the mission (assuming politics didn't get in the way of science). Plus a decade of travel time (it took Rosetta ten years to reach its destination and it's not even coming back). Depending on its size we could also feasibly bring it back to Earth orbit for further study.</p>
<p>If we wanted to grab it within a year or two it would need to already be in Earth orbit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a fantastic observation. In classical general relativity, black holes have &quot;no hair&quot;: there is only one possible microstate and so their entropy is zero. Therefore, throwing any object inside a black hole is a violation of the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>This is actually evidence for the fact that black holes actually do have an entropy S &gt; 0, in fact a very large one, and a corresponding number of microstates exp(S/k_B), but this is invisible at the classical level. These microstates are only apparent in the quantum gravitational description of the black hole.</p>
<p>The proof of this entropy and its exact value only comes about after you discover that black holes emit thermal radiation (Hawking radiation) at temperature T = 1/8πM (in Planck units) which means, by basic thermodynamics, that a black hole is itself in thermal equilibrium at that temperature. If so, then since its total mass is also its internal energy*, the first law of thermodynamics reads:</p>
<p>dM = T dS</p>
<p>If you plug in the expression for T and integrate, and ofc set S=0 at M=0, you will get the entropy (still in Planck units)</p>
<p>S = 4 π M^(2)</p>
<p>This is also equal 1/4 the event horizon area measured in Planck areas. Which is obviously gigantic for any reasonably sized black hole. In fact, this is the largest possible entropy that can fit in that volume - which is the Bekenstein bound. Black holes are not states of zero entropy; they are states of maximum entropy!</p>
<p>Then throwing stuff inside a BH is not only possible, it is also necessarily irreversible. It is impossible, in fact maximally so, to recover information lost in a BH, and in this sense (when interpreted in a more precise way) they are the most efficient scramblers of information.</p>
<p>So... where are those microstates? Depends on your preferential theory of quantum gravity. Any respectable candidate QG theory <em>must</em> reconstruct Hawking's temperature formula and the expression for the entropy, because these prediction are made in the semiclassical regime which is independent on whatever the true theory of QG is, for a certain technical reason I won't go into here. A very promising candidate is string theory. A BH in string theory admits a description as single, very excited string. The string is long and tangled into a Planck-length-ish-thick membrane above the horizon, and its possible configurations give the large entropy (which is proportional of course to the area of the membrane) and it is itself at a Planck-temperature-ish... temperature, and its blackbody radiation, redshifted from climbing out the potential well, is cooled down to the Hawking temperature and becomes Hawking radiation.  </p>
<p>* it's more sensible actually to map M to the enthalpy, but it doesn't matter now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple factors in play.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all water sources are contaminated to the point that they will cause a problem for anyone, humans or animals. Most mammals have a highly developed sense of smell and they can smell water that is very bacteriologically active and they won't drink it. A muddy puddle is full of mud, but not necessarily anything else. Also, a lot of waterborne illnesses are simple bacterial infections that are inconvenient, but not deadly to animals or humans with functioning immune systems.</li>
<li>Animals gain resistance and immunity to waterborne pathogens in their area due to exposure over a lifetime. Notably, sudden changers in the pathogens in the water (often due to human activity) can kill large numbers of native wildlife.</li>
<li>Animals routinely <em>do</em> get sick from drinking contaminated water. Sick animals usually hide until they either recover or die, so you don't see them very often unless you know where to seek them out. (House pets like cats have this behavior mechanism, as well.)</li>
<li>In placental mammals, immunity gained by mothers can be passed along to offspring in a single generation. Certain genetic adaptions can also provide resistance or immunity to pathogens found in the animals' native environment. Animals who did not develop these immunities are often dead as of several generations ago.</li>
<li>Modern humans in developed areas have lived for many generations without having to worry about most waterborne pathogens, therefore we have bred the immunity for these pathogens out of ourselves. They are not a factor in survival and reproduction; Everyone survives and reproduces regardless of this factor. In areas without access to water of modern levels of cleanliness you will find resistance to the local waterborne pathogens in the population. Probably the example most familiar to people from the US is &quot;Montezuma's Revenge,&quot; illness northerners tend to contract from the water in Mexico. Mexicans are resistant/immune to it, people who are not regularly exposed to it are not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit for further thoughts: All of these factors illustrate that, like many things in nature, the status quo is in fact a delicate balance of a combination of interrelated factors rather than a single simple mechanism. All of these act as a natural system of checks and balances that act to control populations of species by, yes, sometimes killing some of them. Upsetting one important factor among many can topple the entire web of interactions and result in the deaths of a lot of animals (or plants) or a permanent shift in which are the dominant species within an area. It goes without saying that most of the time this happens when we are able to observe it is due to human interference: A new foreign pathogen is introduced, animals are pushed away from their favored water sources by human development, parasites get moved from one location to another, etc. Natural disasters can have similar effects, too.</p>
<p>I've seen one or two comments suggesting gold for this post. If you're thinking about it, please don't. Reddit gold is ultimately pointless, and if those few bucks are really burning a hole in your pocket I suggest you donate them to some kind of wildlife or preservation charity instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have a ridiculously exaggerated understanding of the risk of contracting illness. In order to fall ill from dirty water, the contaminant has to actually be present in the bit of water you drink (it may not be mixed throughout it) in sufficient concentration. It has to survive your body's initial defences like stomach acid and proteases (another way of digesting and breaking down food, and also germs), and then take hold as an infection (in the case of germs - if the water is contaminated with heavy metals, say, this doesn't apply) and the infection needs to go unchecked by your immune system long enough that it presents as an illness. None of these stages are guaranteed, but there is a perception, presumably because in developed countries pretty much no-one drinks anything but clean water, that a single drop will make you ill.</p>
<p>Worldwide, 1.8 <em>billion</em> people only have access to unsafe, potentially contaminated water. They die from waterborne illnesses at a vastly greater rate than we in developed nations do, yes, but they are not in danger of extinction. Many people contract illnesses when young, fight them off, and gain immunity, as other people have said. Many infections are just asymptomatic - the infectious agent never takes hold enough to cause illness, or is of a strain which is less harmful.</p>
<p>EDIT: just in case it wasn't clear, this is not a good reason to drink dirty water. It's dangerous, just not as dangerous as a lot of people think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In part it's immunity gained by getting ill once, or a few times and surviving it. The immune system remembers what foreign organisms it encountered before and fights them a lot faster and efficiently when an infection happens again (with exceptions from the rule, not all pathogens produce a lasting immunity). </p>
<p>In part it's evolution at work. The wolf that couldn't handle half-rotten meat simply didn't live long enough to reproduce. Disadvantages like that get culled very quickly in nature. Most people living today have a genetic immunity to illnesses that were devastating a few generations earlier. The Spanish Flu wouldn't be as bad today as it was 1918 because we're the descendants of the survivors.</p>
<p>If there are few water sources, then those have an advantage who can use even the dirtiest puddle without major consequences. </p>
<p>But, you also only see the animals drinking, not hiding in the undergrowth puking their souls out, or dying prematurely from infections and poison. Just because they drink something doesn't mean it's automatically ok for them to do so. If there's nothing better to be had, they'll go for it and hope for the best, not like they can go to the next convenience store and buy a bottle of water instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would refute the top comment on this post. The largest part of our innate immunity (that which defends us all the time in regards to pretty much all organisms) is our natural flora- or basically the bacteria in our colon. Yes, our immune system interacts and accepts this flora but that's above the ELI5. Everyone has different ratios and compositions of this flora. However, in some regions of the world, some humans have similar species profiles of flora.  </p>
<p>For instance- think of Montezuma's revenge. This is a bacteria commonly found in water in Mexico that American's don't encounter. When the American guy (gut, but what a funny autocorrect) encounters this bacteria it causes diarrhea. When Mexican's drink it, it doesn't because this bacteria is already in their gut and they live with it, and it doesn't cause any problems!!  </p>
<p>There are some fun flora profiles that scientists are experimenting with right now that protect against certain diseases and provide unique amounts of nutrition to people in food-scarce environments. There even is a c-dif treatment called a fecal transplant where they take someone's poop that has awesome flora makeup and stick it in your colon to try and reset your floral makeup.  </p>
<p>Also: you have to get ENOUGH of the bacteria in you to get sick. Your body can handle small amounts of certain deadly or non-beneficial organisms. You eat bacteria in meat all the time. Some people are seemingly immune to food poisoning when others get sick. Maybe they are one less taco, maybe they ate their boogers as a kid because staph is commonly in the nose and staph is the MC food poisoning bug. Shigella is well known as a bug that has a very low threshold for infection, with some estimates placing the number of bugs needed to ingest for infection around 10!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But also important is simply a higher social tolerance for death rates.  Animals die all the time from this sort of thing - when you read about a flock of birds suddenly falling dead; or go out and see a bunch of carcasses around some water that looks a lot dicey.  In nature, drinking whatever water you find might give you some death rate (say 1-10%) which your species can survive.  Among humans, we'd notice and worry about that.  If your species does better on average by drinking whatever water is there and losing some fraction of the population (as opposed to limiting your population size to only safe water) then evolution might move you in that direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>See this paragraph from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Touch ID is built into the home button, which is built of laser-cut[9] sapphire crystal, which does not scratch easily (scratching would prevent Touch ID from working).[10] It features a stainless steel detection ring to detect the user's finger without pressing it. The feature does not work without contact with this ring. There is no longer a rounded square icon in the home button, nor is it concave.
The sensor uses capacitive touch to detect the user's fingerprint.[10] The sensor has a thickness of 170 µm, with 500 pixels per inch resolution. The user's finger can be oriented in any direction and it will still be read.[2] Apple says it can read sub-epidermal skin layers,[11] and it will be easy to set up and will improve with every use.[9] The sensor passes a small current through one's finger to create a &quot;fingerprint map&quot; of the user's dermis. Up to 5 fingerprint maps can be stored in the Secure Enclave.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has fingerprints, the loops and swirls you can see looking at your finger, and everyone's loops and swirls are different. Those loops and swirls are caused by part of the skin being higher and lower than each other. The button on the phone has a sensor, a thing that takes measurements, inside that can sense fingerprints by using a tiny amount of electricity, similar to when you run across the carpet in socks, touch door knob, and there is a spark, you are acting like the phone and the door knob is like your finger. You have electricity and it moves from you to the door knob. On the button, you don't feel it because it is so tiny, but it can feel the loss of electricity, much like you do when you touch the door knob. Except the button on the phone can see more  see all of the points where there was and wasn't contact with your finger. On the button, the electricity is picked up by the raised part of your fingerprint, the lower part doesn't get it. Knowing where the electricity was picked up from and where it wasn't, let's the button see what your fingerprint looks like. It does this by using a bunch of tiny squares called a grid and recording which squares lost power and which squares didn't. The first time you do it, it the button learns what your finger looks like, and the phone remembers that. Then when you or someone else touchs the button, it takes what it sees and sends it to the phone that asks if what the button just saw is the same as what it remembers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My answer from that thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the kid wants to be comfortable, and the water doesn't.  </p>
<p>Deadweight, like the water, is harder to carry because it doesn't do anything like, say, maintain it's own center of gravity---or, in the case of an older kid, actually hold on to you, thus distributing the weight across more of your muscles.  </p>
<p>As a result, you need to use your own power to do all the little things necessary to keep the weight oriented they way you want it to be oriented.  That makes it seem heavier.  The water might slosh around or get slightly off center from how you are carrying it some other way, and you then have to consciously or sub-consciously correct it.  The kid, on the other hand, probably wants to stay generally upright and generally in the same place/orientation as after you lifted them, taking that pressure off.*</p>
<p>*assuming not a toddler. Their weight is effectively quintupled from sheer madness. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you truly concerned with picking up the weight as much as holding the weight because there is a difference? And the method of picking up the weight will make a big difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you pick the up either the child or dumbbell with extended arms and hands it will seem to weight more than if you picked it up by hugging it. Hugging it has less impact on your arms and hands.</li>
<li>If you pick the up either the child or dumbbell with either extended arms and hands or by hugging it will seem lighter if you stoop down with bended knees than if you were bent over at the waist. Thus more parts of your body help to lift the weight.</li>
<li>As a tall slender mass, the child's weight is unevenly distributed, with the bulk of it in the torso, and can help support and balance his/her own weight, unlike a dumbbell of equal weight that is compact and is unable to help support its own weight.</li>
<li>The child is a tall slender object that can be held snug to your body with your arms wrapped around the child, which makes supporting the weight easier than holding in equal weight in a different shaped mass in your extended hands. And the child can hug you to help support the weight.</li>
<li>If you carried the child on your shoulder or back he or she would seem even lighter because doing so makes the child's weight part of your own weight and balance system.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers, but none seem to have mentioned an important factor: isolation. </p>
<p>When you do a bicep curl with a dumbbell, good form helps you use only your bicep, so you can specifically challenge that muscle. You intentionally minimize involvement of your triceps, pecs, delts, etc. Similarly for most other simple free weight motions. </p>
<p>When you reach down to pick up a child, you're making a complex movement and aren't intentionally isolating any one muscle. You recruit a bunch of muscle groups to share the load, and it feels easier. </p>
<p>Unless it's an angry toddler - then their bones just turn to jelly and suddenly all their squirmy uneven weight is focused on a muscle you didn't know you needed! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's because children have a natural ability to distribute their weight in such a way that's optimal for the person picking them up and that's why it's equally difficult to handle them if they go deadweight on you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the weight distribution, when you're holding a child your bringing it closer to your center of gravity, and making your body more stable this stability allows for less work to be done in muscles of your body . If you were to hold the child like you hold a dumbbell you would find that they feel about the same. This is the same reason why grocery bags feel insanely heavy, because often times you're holding them at an awkward angle away from your center of gravity. </p>
