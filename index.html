I found the following snippet at: <a href="https://marine-conservation.org/media/shining_sea/place_wpacific_mariana.htm" target="_blank">https://marine-conservation.org/media/shining_sea/place_wpacific_mariana.htm</a></p>
<p>&quot;Imagine the deepest, darkest place on Earth—an underwater trench plummeting to a depth of 35,800 feet, nearly seven miles below the ocean surface. The Mariana Trench is one of the least explored places on Earth. Deep enough to swallow Mt. Everest, the Mariana Trench was first pinpointed in 1951 by the British Survey ship Challenger II. Known since as Challenger Deep, it was not visited for nearly ten years. Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh descended in asubmersible called the Trieste, which could withstand over 16,000 pounds of pressure per square inch. Their descent to the bottom in cramped quarters took five hours, but provided our first glimpses of the seafloor and life at the ocean’s greatest depths. The Mariana Trench represents just one small part of the Earth’s last, great frontier. Less than five percent of the entire ocean has been explored, yet scientists have found that even the deep sea has great numbers of species—and the discoveries have only just begun&quot;</p>
<p>Interesting info from wikipedia:</p>
<p>&quot;As of February 2012, at least two other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120 minutes to reach the seabed.[28] DOER Marine, a marine technology company based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, plans for a crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 metres (330 ft) resolution.[2] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.&quot;</p>
<p>So we have mapped it roughly but their appears to be plenty more to discover.</p>
<p>Also a cool fact on the wiki:</p>
<p>&quot;The trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; its radius is about 25 kilometres (16 mi) less at the poles than at the equator.[6] As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This massive scientific endeavor was live - streamed on multiple cams (different vessels and you could select which cam to look at) the whole time they were in the trench. I didn't follow it religiously but  checked in a bit and watched some of the streams - saw some very cool stuff.  They had scientists on the boat and back on the mainland who were experts in various areas that would chime in and provide their knowledge. It was seriously interesting.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A hiccup is caused by a muscle spasm of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a thin muscle layer under your lungs that helps separate the chest space (which holds mainly your heart and lungs) from the abdominal space. The way air is pulled in during a breath is by flexing the diaphragm. The lungs themselves are not made of muscle so they don't actually do any of the pulling.
During a hiccup, the diaphragm has a spasm which causes a sudden contraction, just like a spasm in any arm or leg muscle, and this is paired with your throat closing in reflex to this spasm down below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/JustThisHoopyFrood answered your question about what hiccups are. Here's a bit about why they happen.</p>
<p>There’s an excellent evolutionary biology book called Your Inner Fish by Neil Shubin, in which he discusses the reason why we get hiccups from an evolutionary standpoint. [This article]( <a href="http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0812/features/fish_out_of_water.shtml" target="_blank">http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0812/features/fish_out_of_water.shtml</a>) is an adaptation of Shubin’s explanation (the part about hiccups is section III).</p>
<p>To paraphrase: The brainstem controls unconscious, rhythmic breathing, by controlling chest muscles and the diaphragm. But, the controls system originally evolved to control fish breathing, involving throat and gill muscles. The same nerves innervate the diaphragm that innervated the gill system. They come from the brain stem, which made sense in fish, because the gills were a short distance from the brainstem. In humans, though, the nerves have to travel out from the brainstem down to the diaphragm [(phrenic nerve)]( <a href="https://www.epainassist.com/images/what-is-phrenic-nerve.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.epainassist.com/images/what-is-phrenic-nerve.jpg</a>), meaning that things can easily interfere with them and cause diaphragm spasms. When the diaphragm spasms, the glottis closes, making the “hic” sound. It’s thought that this evolved in our amphibious ancestors, specifically for their tadpoles, which use both gills and lungs. Tadpoles have pattern generators in their brainstems that shuts the glottis when they pump water into their mouths. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spasm of the diaphragm muscle - super thin muscle that divides your lungs and heart from your abdomen.  It creates the negative pressure that lets you take a breath.  When it's relaxed, it's bent up, and when it contracts, it goes down, pulling open your lungs.  So that's why a hiccup - a contraction - makes you breathe in quickly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to study this, but current theories are that irritation of the throat, esophagus, and or stomach can stimulate the nerves that pick up signals from these areas and cause the brain to send signals back down to try and react in some way. These signals can also be sent down the pyramid nerve which goes down to the diaphragm, causing hiccups.
Another thought is that foods that can irritate the stomach or cause too much air to be swallowed simultaneously cause the stomach to get bloated or annoyed and press on the diaphragm, causing irritation in that as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Also, you'll find that when you have the hiccups for so long everyone you meet will have some sort of weird recommendation for trying to cure them and none of them will work. Controlled breathing was the only thing that would give me a temporary pause</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FM and AM manipulate radio waves in different ways (frequency versus amplitude) to encode the sound being transmitted. Ultimately, though, each station on FM radio has six times the bandwidth as AM. More bandwidth means more nuanced sounds are possible. Think of it like drawing with 48 colors versus only 8 colors. </p>
<p>Plus, because of how FM works, it’s less susceptible to interference than AM, so you’re also generally getting better clarity to begin with. </p>
<p>Edit: several people have asked questions about why FM/AM can't occupy other bands, e.g. move FM lower to increase its range.  <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/2003-allochrt.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a cool chart of the US' current radio frequency allocation</a>.  There's other reasons, but one big reason we can't just move the bands around is that nearly every sliver of wavelength is already being used or reserved for something else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some reasonable answers here, but none of them capture the essential reason.  They all talk about the difference between AM and FM, but not why FM sounds better.  Here's an ELI5:</p>
<p>Commercial FM radio sounds better because it gets more of the radio spectrum.  The reason it does is an accident of history.</p>
<p>When a transmitter transmits radio waves, they go, well, everywhere.  It works by shaking electricity up and down in a rod (an antenna), and that sends out waves at a particular pitch.  If you want to think about it like sound, think of a tuning fork in a room, singing out at a particular pitch by moving air up and down.   Receivers contain tunable tuning forks that shake up and down in response to the waves that hit them.  </p>
<p>Radio receivers then have to <em>decode</em> the shaking to create a signal.  AM radios measure how &quot;loud&quot; (strong) the incoming waves are, and use that strength to figure out where to place the speaker cone.  The transmitter makes its wave signal stronger and weaker very quickly, and that moves your speaker in and out very quickly, making sound.  FM radios measure the pitch of the incoming waves.  The transmitter adjusts its main tone slightly higher pitched, then lower again, and like that.  That makes the receiver move its speaker cone back and forth, and that makes sound. </p>
<p>So far so good, right?  Well, if there is more than one radio station around (hint: there are hundreds), they all work at slightly different pitches.  You adjust your receiver so it only resonates to one particular pitch, and then only one station gets received.  There's a whole branch of the government that sorts out whose radio transmitters are allowed to use which pitch (frequency).  Each station gets a range of radio spectrum it's allowed to use. </p>
<p>So here's the deal.  The lower the pitch, the less information there is in the signal!  Huh?  Well, if you have more than one radio station, you can't cram them too close together in pitch.   If the main pitches (the big kids call them  &quot;carrier frequencies&quot;) of two different radio stations are too close to each other, then receivers can't tell the two stations apart, and the sound that comes out of each receiver will be a mix of the two stations.  So you have to separate the radio stations' carrier frequencies.  The amount you have to separate them in pitch is about four times the number of times per second your speaker cone has to move.  So if you want to transmit high pitched sound at, say, 10,000 vibrations per second, you have to keep your stations more than about 40,000 vibrations per second apart in pitch.  AM radios transmit between 600,000 and 1,600,000 wave fronts per second, which limits the number of stations you can fit in the radio band.  The difference between those two numbers is about a million vibrations per second, so you can fit about 25 stations into the band if everyone wants to broadcast moderately high fidelity sound.</p>
<p>FM radios transmit at about 100,000,000 (100 million) wave fronts per second.  The band goes from 88 million to 108 million wave fronts per second.  The difference between those numbers is 20 million vibrations per second, so the FM band carries 20 times as much information in total as the AM band does. (thanks, /u/zed857!)</p>
<p>Instead of adding more stations (you could fit nearly 400 AM radio stations into the FM band!) we cut up the band into larger chunks.  Since each station can transmit over a band 15 times wider than an AM station, it can send 15 times more information into your receiver.  The receivers use that in two ways:  (1) with FM coding, which reduces noise; and (2) to transmit stereo (which uses twice as much of the radio spectrum as mono) and higher frequency sound (which doublesthe spectrum usage again:  AM is actually limited at something like 7.5 kHz, and FM goes to 15 kHz).</p>
<p>AM radio stations generally sound sort of washed-out and flat, because the highest pitch they can transmit is limited by the rules for radio transmission!  It's only about 7,500 cycles per second, which is not quite 4 octaves above middle C on the piano.  AM stations literally aren't allowed to transmit higher pitches than that. </p>
<p>FM radio stations have clearer sound because they can transmit higher pitches (like the difference between a telephone and a CD), and also because they can use even more of the radio spectrum to reduce the amount of background noise in your receiver.</p>
<p>AM came first because it's easier to make an electrical circuit that works a million times a second, than one that works at 100 million times a second.  Down in what we now call the AM band, there's just not a lot of room and technology like FM doesn't make much sense.  The whole AM band could only support about 5 FM radio stations operating at the same time.</p>
<p>When radios that could operate at 100 million times a second became common, everyone settled on the FM standard instead of using the same AM technique that was useful earlier -- because there's plenty of &quot;room&quot; up there at 100 million cycles per second.</p>
<p>If an AM station had the same bandwidth as an FM station, it could transmit sound just as clear as FM(!)  But AM is more susceptible to some kinds of interference (like lightning or electric motors) -- so FM was the natural choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;If you can imagine instead of a radio tower there is a giant lightbulb. This is essentially the same thing electromagnetic energy but instead of being in the radio part of the spectrum it is in the light part of the spectrum.</p>
<p>With the AM (amplitude modulation) lightbulb the signal would be varied by adjusting the brightness of the light. With the FM(frequency modulation) the light would change in color to produce a signal.</p>
<p>If you were trying to see this signal through static, say a bunch of trees it was be much easier to see what color was coming through than how bright the light was.&quot;</p>
<p>and the wonderful first comment underneath that, from /<a href="/user/TheRealBigLou" target="_blank">u/TheRealBigLou</a></p>
<p>&quot;At first I thought this was more of a metaphor but didn't really explain AM/FM. But then I realized that with visible light, amplitude IS brightness and frequency IS color.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the answers here have focused on the fact that FM has more bandwidth than AM.  This is true, but it's not the whole picture.</p>
<p>FM stands for Frequency Modulation.  The frequency you tune on a radio is the <em>carrier</em>.  Signals are <em>modulated</em> onto the carrier.  FM modulates the signal onto the carrier by changing the frequency of the carrier slightly from its nominal value.  In order to detect an FM signal, the receiver has to &quot;look&quot; at the carrier, figure out how far it is from its nominal value, and create a value based on that.  Millions of these numbers create a waveform which is the original signal--the music that was played at the station.</p>
<p>AM stands for Amplitude Modulation.  The carrier wave is simply louder or softer to reflect the signal.  The receiver merely tunes to the carrier &quot;averages&quot; it to reconstruct the signal.</p>
<p>OK, now consider what happens when interference is introduced.</p>
<p>In FM, a change in the amplitude of the carrier due to interference has almost no impact on the signal.  Take a thunderstorm, for example.  Lightning throws a broad spectrum of EM into the atmosphere, which plays havoc with AM because some of that EM is at the same frequency as the station.  Because any amplitude changes in the carrier represent signal, you hear lightning on AM.  The lightning is still putting signal in the FM band, band but you don't hear it because adding a momentary pulse of 100 MHz isn't the same thing as creating a slight variation in the 100 MHz carrier to which you're tuned.</p>
<p>When FM does have interference on it, it's slight variations in frequency.  It turns out that the human ear is less sensitive to subtle variations in frequency than it is to sudden shifts in amplitude.</p>
<p>To make it short, FM doesn't simply have more bandwidth.  It's an inherently more robust way to transmit audio for human ears.</p>
<p>Where AM shined was in the old analog TV signals.  The audio was FM, but the video was mostly AM (not sure how the sync was transmitted).  The result was that when TV signals were weak, they were &quot;snowy&quot; but still watchable.  FM video would have made analog TV receivers unnecessarily complicated, and weak signals probably would have had more of a sudden drop-out effect like you get with weak FM radio stations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chess is slightly biased toward white, given even skill levels. All other factors are identical, it's just that white gets to move first and thereby set the tone for the match. </p>
<p>Due to this inequality, white players tend to play for a win (+1), and black players tend to play for a draw (+0.5). Black often plays defensively, while white tries to break that defense (at the very highest levels of play). Right now, that's the Ruy Lopez variation. This means that the first 11 or so moves are pre-planned and already locked in. If a game isn't won within 30 moves or so, it'll likely be a draw (at the highest levels), which means white has ~20 moves to win. </p>
<p>Black's job is easier; all he has to do is trade pieces until the board is relatively cleared, making white's job much harder. White has to reposition and restrategize and constantly look for very slim edges. </p>
<p>What this ends up meaning is that black is typically successful, because he has a much easier task. It's very difficult to beat a person who is around your own skill level, is playing defensively, and actively aiming to sabotage the game in order to achieve a draw. He isn't trying to win, he's just trying to not lose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for the how: While Chess is not necessarily a 'solved game'--meaning every possible permutation of moves is recorded for an &quot;optimal&quot; response to every action--the predictive and premeditative caliber of high-end players is very similar. Their practise in determining the available decision tree, x-amount of moves in advance, often leads players of equal skill to stalemate a match. This doesn't just apply to top-tier players, any players of near equal skill will see the same effect.</p>
<p>As for the why: It's strategically advantageous to tie, rather than lose, and it's technically easier (based on how chess works) to tie, rather than win. This makes a tie game in peak-performance of non-binary games statistically more common. Kotama brilliantly explains why ties are also strategic choices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try this from a different angle than several of the answers here.</p>
<p>Imagine a chess game where both players have traded pieces, and only have their kings left.  As the kings cannot move into check, neither side can possibly checkmate the other, and while one could potentially be stuck to one side of the board, neither can advance, so the game, and several others like it, is a draw.  Neither side can force a checkmate.</p>
<p>Now imagine the same game, except white has two of his knights left.  White could theoretically checkmate black with these resources, but it would require black to actively move into a position where white could complete the checkmate, and it is trivially easy for him to avoid such situations.  As checkmate cannot be forced, the game is a draw.  There are many variants of situations where the side with the disadvantage in pieces can, with good play, maintain a situation where they cannot be forced into a checkmate position.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a few minor rules related to draws, namely the 50-move rule, threefold repetition, and stalemate.  In any of these cases, the game is a draw.  These situations (and the threat of causing them) can also be used by a player with inferior position to force a player in better position to lose his advantage.</p>
<p>A player who is losing (black by default, due to white's positional advantage granted by the first move) needs only to force the game into one of thousands of drawn endgame positions to avoid checkmate and thus avoid a loss.  At high level, a player with an advantage frequently is not able to prevent an opponent from doing so without giving up his advantages or risking losing himself.</p>
<p>Of course, you rarely see the actual endgames the top players are angling for, because they generally agree to a draw many moves before an &quot;obvious&quot; drawn endgame position is reached (or resign if a checkmate or massive disadvantage in material/position is inevitable).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer seems to be we really don't know, but there are several hypotheses.  From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#Hypothesized_triggers" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some scientists, such as Richard A. Muller, think that geomagnetic reversals are not spontaneous processes but rather are triggered by external events that directly disrupt the flow in the Earth's core. Proposals include impact events[33][34] or internal events such as the arrival of continental slabs carried down into the mantle by the action of plate tectonics at subduction zones or the initiation of new mantle plumes from the core-mantle boundary.[35] Supporters of this hypothesis hold that any of these events could lead to a large scale disruption of the dynamo, effectively turning off the geomagnetic field. Because the magnetic field is stable in either the present North-South orientation or a reversed orientation, they propose that when the field recovers from such a disruption it spontaneously chooses one state or the other, such that half the recoveries become reversals. However, the proposed mechanism does not appear to work in a quantitative model, and the evidence from stratigraphy for a correlation between reversals and impact events is weak. There is no evidence for a reversal connected with the impact event that caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.[36]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, immunotherapy has long been seen as a holy grail for cancer treatment. The immune system is naturally programmed to attack cells that have gone a bit weird (to use the scientific term). The problem tends to be that the cancer cells can also alter themselves so that they are disguised from the immune system, or in fact inhibit any immune cells that come into contact with them. This stops the immune system from seeing them as dangerous, allowing the cancer to grow. So the balance of the immune response is in favour of leaving the cancer alone.</p>
<p>What this treatment does is inject the tumour with molecules that tell the immune cells in the vicinity of the tumour to wake up and start doing their job, overcoming the inhibition that the cancer cells have put in place. This means that the balance of the immune response is now to attack the tumour, which seems to work very well.</p>
<p>The really cool thing is that now that the immune system is trained to see the tumour as bad, and will attack similar cells in different sites. This is why it behaves in some fashion like a vaccine.</p>
<p>It's perfectly viable, and very exciting. As always, there is always the question of how well it translates into human biology but it is still very promising. I think one problem is going to be how specific the immune response is. In the paper, they see the immune cells are trained to attack cells with protein markers unique to the tumour cells, which is a good sign. One concern might be that if you accidentally trigger the immune response to normal cell markers, it could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells which would obviously be a very bad consequence. Another would be how readily a tumour can evolve to overcome the immune system attack. If the immune system only ends up going for certain markers, it could miss tumour cells that don't have the same ones. These could then continue to grow and cause the cancer to return.</p>

<p>This type of cancer vaccine is kinda old news. What's really cutting edge are the personalized cancer vaccines based on mRNA that are in clinical trails in humans <strong>already</strong>. Basically, these vaccines are tailored to an individual's cancer. You see, your cancer and my cancer may have the same name, lymphoma for example, but they may be very different in terms of their susceptibility to drugs and especially to vaccines. Using personal genomics to tailor mRNA to program your own cells to make a vaccine against your very unique form of cancer is the real key to all of this. Adding on top of this is that mRNA is just a superior way to produce vaccines. As it turns out, when your body makes the vaccine inside its own cells, it stimulates your immune system more effectively than a vaccine made in a factory and injected (this has to do with MHC1 and MHC2 activation). </p>
<p>These clinical trials are looking promising. If they work, this can be combined with checkpoint inhibitors and other mRNA therapies (that also boost immune response against cancer) and it's bye-bye cancer. </p>
<p>Let's just say that it's the most promising thing I've seen in cancer therapy ever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While this would technically be considered virotherapy, the immune system plays a huge role in the outcome.</p>
<p>They are now in phase 2 trials, and still only for brain tumors, but I believe the assumption is that it could be widely used among many different solid tumors in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I worked on a project and helped publish a paper that also showed this exact effect (even showing it attacked tumors in other locations) several years ago (PMID: 25179345).</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues with directly translating this to therapy is that directly injecting a vaccine into a tumor cell is not necessarily a wise choice and not commonly done (I think, my clinical exposure to oncology isn't large). The main fear is something called &quot;tumor seeding&quot;, which can also happen when they aspirate or biopsy, or do something otherwise invasive with a tumor that could cause cancer cells to dislodge and make it to the blood or lymphatic systems. If the tumor is well-demarcated (ie. enclosed), you don't want to open up a channel to your blood supply for cancer cells to spread throughout your body (hematogenous spread). Clinically the chance of this is probably very low and this is a consideration when physicians consider how to biopsy a tumor, but if you start making it standard procedure, who knows what could happen. </p>
<p>Even if the cancer is metastatic, it is possible that it's in a compartment that is very well isolated from the rest of your body. For example when testicular cancer is suspected, a biopsy is almost never performed and the suspected testicle is straight up removed because it's in a very well-enclosed portion of the body (referring not to the skin scrotum, but another membrane separating it from the inside of your body). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm a pilot and I think I can answer your question. </p>
<p>In the cockpit we have a little instrument called a turn coordinator that looks like a little plane above a curved tube with a ball and fluid in it. Most airliners, for the safety and comfort of their passengers will perform &quot;coordinated turns&quot;.</p>
<p>before we continue you must know that to turn a plane you need to be able to alter the yaw, pitch, and roll of a plane.</p>
<p>Most people think that to turn, pilots just roll their aircraft to a side, and that the plane just follows. However, the plane can't actually turn effectively like this (and it would lead to the aformentioned spilled drink). During a turn we actually pull up slightly and use the rudder to make the plane turn faster. if we properly combine our control inputs, we perform a coordinated turn, in which the force pulling your to the outside of the turn due to inertia works together with gravity to make the force you feel go straight through your seat, and not straight down.</p>
<p>Remember the instrument I talked about? Well, that instrument helps us perform these turns. By keeping that little ball and fluid right in the middle of the tube, it indicates that we are performing a coordinated turn.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, I'm on mobile at the moment, so can't really do this too thoroughly, but here goes.</p>
<p>The airplane is banked by ailerons, and yaws with the rudder. In any &quot;standard&quot; (not just standard rate or 3 degrees per minute) turn you'll experience in a commercial flight, the bank and yaw are input to perform a coordinated turn. The long and short of this is objects on the plane will feel as if they are being pulled &quot;down&quot; through the vertical axis of the plane rather than down to the ground.</p>
<p>So imagine you're in a car. If you have a cup of water and initiate a turn, the water would spill to the outside of the turn. If this happened in a plane (too much yaw, not enough bank) this would be called a skidding turn. If you were to apply only bank with no yaw, the airplane won't really turn (it won't turn very well, but it will turn) this would be the same as just tipping your cup. This is called a slipping turn. </p>
<p>Back to the coordinated turn. Imagine the first scenario where you're driving a car. You initiate a turn to the left. The water wants to spill out to the right. If however the road at this moment banked to the left such that the &quot;tipped&quot; angle now counteracted the centrifugal force of water spilling right, no water would spill out. </p>
<p>That's how it's done. You can look up coordinated turns in airplanes. There's tons of info on this and it's one of the first things you'll learn in flight school. Also, one of your main instruments is the turn coordinator that shows if you're skidding, slipping, or coordinated. </p>
<p>Sorry I can't spend too much more time on this. As a former CFI, I'd usually do this with drawings and charts and pictures, and then we'd do a demonstration in the plane. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in haemoglobin that causes red blood cells to have a sickle shape rather than the very recognisable biconcave disk shape. This faulty haemoglobin doesn't carry oxygen as well and the sickle cells can aggregate and block capillaries. This is obviously bad, but it's rarely life threatening. 90% of affected people live until 20 and around 50% make it past age 50.</p>
<p>This highlights the first reason the sickle cell trait still exists; evolution only &quot;cares&quot; about a trait if it affects whether you can reproduce. You could be the epitome of human health, a theoretical perfect genetic specimen, but you're not influencing the gene pool if you don't have any children in this hypothetical extraordinarily long, healthy life of yours. Similarly, if you die at 30 after having children, you've already passed on your genes. Whatever negative traits you had weren't enough to kill you before reproducing (or stop you from being able to reproduce).</p>
<p>The second main factor is the resistance to malaria that the sickle cell trait confers. Let's go back to genetics 101. In all your cells, you have two copies of each gene, one from each of your parents. Sometimes you need two faulty copies of a gene to get a condition, like with cystic fibrosis. This is called a recessive gene. If you have one working copy, you'll be fine. Some traits are dominant, like dark hair. If you have dark hair, maybe you've received a dark hair gene from both parents, or maybe you've got a fair haired gene that's being overpowered by one dark hair gene. This is how two dark haired people can produce fair-haired offspring.</p>
<p>The sickle cell trait is commonly thought of as recessive because people with one copy of the sickle gene generally live normal lives. However, the trait is actually codominant, which means that in a carrier (a person with one sickle gene and one normal gene), they have equal concentrations of faulty haemoglobin and functional haemoglobin. This functional haemoglobin is generally enough to get the job done, but athletes who are carriers will have decreased performance compared to their potential and there is some evidence it can contribute to negative health if there's other factors.</p>
<p>The sickling of red blood cells happens mostly in low oxygen tension (i.e. in muscle tissue, where respiring muscle cells use up lots of oxygen). This is where the malaria resistance comes in. The exact mechanism isn't known, but it's guessed that a few different factors have effects: because the malaria parasite consumes oxygen from the cells it affects, it increases sickling rates of infected cells. These sickle cells are then more easily eliminated by the immune system. It's like the parasite is waving a flag saying &quot;hey, I'm here!&quot;. Additionally, sickle trait cells produce greater levels of chemicals that are toxic to the parasite. Overall, this leads to lower levels of parasite infected cells.</p>
<p>This mechanism only has a 50% chance of stopping you from getting any malaria, but it has a 90% chance of stopping severe malaria. Given that malaria kills so many people, this is a pretty big deal. Remember from earlier that the important thing in natural selection is whether it actually kills you and prevents reproduction. A fully affected person with sickle cell anemia is very unlikely to die before reaching reproductive age and a carrier is even less affected. Malaria however, can and does kill and prevent many people from reproducing. The sickle cell trait confers a selective advantage in areas where malaria is endemic.</p>
<p>A last bit I want to talk about is the concept of population genetics. When we're talking about natural selection and the prevalence of certain alleles (different versions of the same gene, i.e. faulty vs. working), individual lives don't matter all that much. Even if you have the genes for a long and healthy life, that doesn't account for accidents that could kill or disable you just because of bad luck. Evolution takes a long time, because gene pools matter more than genes. The gene pool is the collection of traits in the population and the &quot;health&quot; of that matters more than any one individual. </p>
<p>Let's consider a mini model. Only a very small proportion of people have Sickle cell disease (SCD), 1% seems like a reasonable ballpark. Let's say someone with SCD has two children with a healthy person. Both these children would be carriers. If these carriers had children with other carriers, then there would be a 25% chance of a child being healthy, 25% chance of having SCD and a 50% chance of being a carrier. In a place where malaria is endemic, carriers are probably in the best situation. Phrased like this, we might actually ask &quot;why is the sickle cell gene not <em>more</em> prevalent in malaria affected areas?&quot; The answer to this is partly because evolution is slow and can only change a population as fast as people are born and die (and we humans are rather good at not dying, all things considered), but also that malaria affected populations intermingle with others. Some isolated African tribes had as much as 40% of the tribe being carriers of the sickle cell trait! Natural selection is ultimately a brutal and lazy master. It doesn't care if one of your four kids has a horrible, crippled life with low life expectancy, or if you die once you've had your kids, only about the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Slightly off topic genetics conjecture now: along these lines, some traits are bad on an individual scale, but helpful not just for the gene pool, but in a community. Humans are social animals, so the well-being of the tribe is very important. Some people theorise that homosexuality is beneficial(the &quot;gay uncle hypothesis&quot;). You can probably guess from the name, but basically if the &quot;gay uncle&quot; doesn't have children himself, then he can help care for his niblings (I so rarely get the chance to use this word and I love it). They do say &quot;it takes a village to raise a child&quot;, after all. Other similar theories exist for autism, ADHD, anxiety disorders, insomnia etc.. Obviously a society entirely of gay/socially awkward scientist types/novelty seekers/jumpy scared people/night owls would be unsustainable, but a few quirky individuals help the community. </p>
<p>This concept of genetic diversity is also one of the few valid points against genetic engineering of crops and animals: it reduces genetic diversity which means the gene pool is overall weaker and less resistant to changes such as disease, environmental changes etc.. One disease could wipe out entire populations of monoculture plants (though this issue isn't exclusive to genetic engineering, as we've been manipulating animals' and plants' traits through artificial selection for millennia).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In other words, people with 2 copies of the gene in the US will tend to get sickle cell anemia, while they have less of a chance of getting it in Africa, even though genetically they're the same. So it appears to both be more advantageous in Africa (in protecting against the ravages of malaria) and less disadvantageous in Africa (in not having the worst symptoms of the disease).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a common misperception here is that sickle cell is protective for malaria. It isn’t. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499995/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499995/</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand being heterozygous is protective. The mechanism is still being worked on but the idea is roughly that heterozygous red blood cells are more likely to sickle once infected and be quickly cleared by macrophages. Thus protecting the heterozygous from malaria. </p>
<p>If the heterozygous are being selected for then mathematically homozygous sickle cell disease will be passed on at some rate when heterozygous indivisos mate. Thus keeping the disease around even when it the homozygous sickle trait is being selected against.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Generally people don’t get sick from the flu virus types that infect birds, but pigs can get both. And if a pig gets both, their cells can be infected by both viruses, both adding stuff into the cell’s DNA. Then a new virus emerges. This is why most epidemic versions of influenza have strain names of Asian cities.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veterinarian here, the true flu H#N# viruses are pretty common in horses, birds and pigs (hence bird flu/swine flu) though they do not always cause significant disease in those species. There are currently multiple outbreaks of canine influenza (H3N8 and H3N2) around the US though this really isn’t very common in general. </p>
<p>The flu virus mutates frequently and participates in genetic recombination. This means genes from multiple flu viruses can recombine into a virus with a unique/uncommon genetic make up. This is why they make a different flu vaccine every year and why that flu vaccine doesn’t always work (they have to predict what strains will be most common in any given year). It’s also what makes the flu virus able to cross species in all sorts of different directions. </p>
<p>In general, however, our pets don’t have as much of a problem with viruses like the cold and flu. (With the exception of what I mentioned above regarding canine influenza). Both of those viruses rely strongly on many individuals of the same species having close contact with each other. That just doesn’t happen as much for dogs and cats as it does for humans. Diseases that are sort of in the same vein however include kennel cough in dogs and herpes and calicivirus in cats. They can all cause upper respiratory infections and are contagious. </p>
<p>Other viral, infectious diseases that we really worry about are parvovirus and the feline equivalent, panleukopenia, as well as things like distemper and rabies. Good news is there are vaccines out there for those bad boys. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For colonial insects and animals you see flu epidemics, cold seasons, etc exactly as in people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see some people citing psychological stuff, personally kinda skeptical that they &quot;hide the symptoms&quot; of disease. As a soon-to-be-graduated microbiologist, ive seen it being just a case of &quot;it happens a shitton in animals, we just don't care enough to study it&quot; leading to a large gap in information in animal diseases when compared to human diseases. Lifespan also plays a factor of course, leading to (many) animals having drastically lower rates of cancer than humans purely because they die to other things before cancer would normally appear. Fun fact, though I'm sure many already know this, but it's worth pointing out that basically every one of the biggest diseases we deal with are diseases spread and maintained in animal populations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though im not 100% sure this fully awnsers the question at hand it helps shed some light in the right direction . </p>
<p>Some animals are susceptible to the human cold and can experience most, if not all the symptoms associated with humans.</p>
<p>While dogs are not known to catch the human cold virus, cats occasionally do and will display cold symptoms much like a human would. Cats have even been proven to contract the H1N1 or swine flu strain from humans and their environment.</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, large primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees have also been known to contract pneumonia from humans, which is not too surprising considering the close genetic ties.</p>
<p>However, the viruses that affect plants are rarely known to be transmitted to humans or other animals given the genetic distance between plant and animal DNA. --Tony Hegar, MPH with emphasis in Epidemiology</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
