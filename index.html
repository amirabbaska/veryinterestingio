		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple explanation - </p>
<p>This has been done before.</p>
<p>&quot;In the most dramatic stages of the Cold War, Russia and the United States were testing nuclear bombs left and right, and due to fears of a long-range nuclear missile or a satellite delivery system for a nuclear warhead, all eyes were on the skies. </p>
<p>The United States had launched a series of tests code named Project Fishbowl, which were high-altitude nuclear weapons tests. The most impressive and historic test in this Project was Starfish Prime. On July 9th, 1962, a 1.4 megaton nuclear bomb was detonated approximately 250 miles above the surface of Earth.</p>
<p>What would happen if a nuclear bomb went off in space?</p>
<p>First of all, since there is no atmosphere in space, there was no iconic mushroom cloud, nor a blast wave (which is where most of the damage of a nuclear bomb comes from on Earth). Instead, there was an intense outpouring of not only heat and light, but high-intensity radiation in the form of gamma rays and X-rays, with no atmosphere to interrupt their path. Visually, the blast was roughly spherical, and the wave of radiation and light expanded to light up the sky.</p>
<p>On the surface of the planet, vivid auroras of light would be seen for thousands of miles within minutes of the blast, because the charged particles from the blast would immediately begin interacting with Earth’s magnetic field. Imagine the aurora borealis, more commonly known as the Northern Lights, except spread across thousands of kilometers above the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Those ribbons of light and charged particle streams would continue to be seen for hours or even days after the blast (depending on the size of the explosion). In a nuclear blast, there is also quite a bit of debris, which would burn up in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, and heavy ions would also be absorbed by the atmospheric molecules of the planet. These extra radioactive molecules are actually useful in certain ways.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more worrying than the huge amount of radiation being dropped into Earth’s atmosphere is the detonation’s impact on electromagnetic signals in a massive area beneath the blast. Essentially, those highly charged, rapidly moving electrons will create a small and incredibly powerful magnetic field, also called an EMP (electromagnetic pulse). You’ve probably seen this in sci-fi movies many times; an EMP bomb cuts off all electronic power within a given area (most famously, perhaps, in The Matrix Trilogy).</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the long-term effects of a nuclear weapon detonating in space, that radioactive material falling into the atmosphere isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it dissipates and spreads around the entire planet. Those extra molecules imparted by that nuclear blast can now be accurately measured as a means of dating things, such as trees, wine, and animals. While that may be one useful thing about nuclear testing in space, that certainly doesn’t make the whole process any more sensible.</p>
<p>There were only a handful of high-altitude nuclear detonation tests in the 1950 and 1960s, but in total, more than 2,000 nuclear detonations were conducted on Earth between 1945 and 1998.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, nice. At first a thought &quot;Crap, chemistry, I have nothing to add&quot; but then found this is a physics question.</p>
<p>As others have stated there was a test in 1962 of just that.</p>
<p>The radioactive particles are high in the atmosphere, that means they are distributed far, and as such do not cause a great spike in local measurements, as such they are relatively harmless. They can still cause bad things (cancer) in unlucky individuals, but given the explosion is high the material isn't forming a local cloud as you have with closer-to-earth tests. Of course if the fallout happens to get in some jetstream-winds they might kept closer together and do not distribute that far. </p>
<p>The particles would decay in the atmosphere or land wherever over time (weeks, months, years).</p>
<p>You get some radiation (belts) in the atmosphere, mostly high-energy electrons that can last for days or traces for some few years.</p>
<p>The effect of such a blast is not in the physical fallout but in the EMP (electromagnetic pulse) and in said radiation belts that can damage electrical systems, as power lines or satellites. In the 60s there was a lot loss of satellites due to the EMP and the radiation. It is unclear if something would happen again today as satellites are better shielded against natural radiation (back then they did not know that the natural levels could be higher than the ones of the blast). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the yield. The US did several exoatmospheric nuclear tests in the 60's. The radiation would get trapped in the Van Allen Belts and stay there until it decayed. It would also produce an electromagnetic pulse that could disable any nearby satellites and cause damage or destruction to any electronics on the ground in a wide area underneath the point of the explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is referred to as a HAND (high altitude nuclear detonation) and is the Pentagon's worst nightmare - it would be much worse than just putting the nuke on the ground somewhere due to the EMP taking out power lines across America.  The fuses are designed for lightning strikes and wouldn't trip in time to save the transformers.  Basically the whole country would lose power, can you imagine how long it would take to build enough transformers to replace them?  This is the &quot;how fast does society turn to post-apocalypse&quot; question.  Luckily there are few nations capable of getting a nuke to the specific altitude required.  </p>
<p>In somewhere like the UK where the govt put power lines underground, they'd be fine, but America did it cheaper so we have essentially huge antennas above ground :-(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So anything that causes a rash of pimples could have been named xxxxxx-pox. Smallpox, cowpox and some other variations are all caused by very similar viruses. In fact infecting someone with cowpox was the first way to vaccinate someone from smallpox. Because they are so similar, our bodies antibodies work similarly on the multiple viruses. If the viruses are not similar enough, the body will not recognize them and therefore won't fight them off as readily. Chickenbox is not related closely enough to smallpox for one vaccination to work against the viruses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The Great Pox is actually syphilis. The Small Pox is smallpox. Chicken pox is unrelated to smallpox and is a herpes virus called Varicella Zoster virus. Vaccinia is a closely related true poxvirus (a class of viruses by that name) and things like Cowpox are in fact true poxviruses as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey OP, was just learning this stuff:</p>
<p>Chicken Pox (Varicella Virus/VZV) belongs to the Herpesviridae family. They're actually more related to Herpes Simplex Viruses, HSV as these are all alpha types that remain latent in neurons. Shingles is varicella zoster virus VZV, the same exact virus that reactivates later in life. &quot;Pox&quot; is related to the pustules/rashes - classification has gotten much better since the golden ages. Symptoms wise, small pox will have all pustules simultaneously at the same stage whereas chicken pox will have postures in different stages. They're related by symptoms and observation but when you look at virus classification, they're different. </p>
<p>Tldr: chicken pox is a completely different type of virus (look up HHV/human herpes virus for more info) whereas vaccinia is <em>practically</em> an &quot;attenuated&quot; form of small pox that is similar enough to elicit an applicable immune response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, infinitely many. Consider for example a man that lived, say 30,000 years ago that had some recessive genetic disorder. He could pass this gene on for 1000 generations, and assuming no one else in the tree carried that gene, none of his descendents would developed this disease. Until after 1000 generations, a distant descendent of his has a child with a woman that also carries this gene and their child has a genetic disease. </p>
<p>There is no length of time where genetics or medical history becomes irrelevant. That said, the further back it goes the less influence it has. First of course, because with more generations you have more ancestors, and it is less likely you would have inherited a gene from any one ancestor. And second, because it becomes increasingly unlikely that a disease that was present in your family 30,000 years ago would not have been present in any of the 1000 generations before you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Practically, we only really care about two generations (so back to your grandparents). It all depends on the particulars of the situation, though. Generally, if your great-grandparents' health issues didn't affect your parents, aunts/uncles, or grandparents, they're pretty unlikely to affect you.</p>
<p>But, if they <em>did</em> affect someone else, it can be a little significant. I had a patient recently whose mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother all got endometrial cancer in their 40s or 50s. Knowing there were three consecutive generations of cancer made the case for a hereditary cancer syndrome even stronger (Lynch syndrome). It didn't really change our management at all, but it made us even more certain. </p>
<p>You can probably come up with some contrived scenarios with recessive disorders or in-breeding where maybe you'd care if it was just the great-grandparents, but those are pretty rare. If it's just that your great-grandparents had diabetes or heart disease, we don't really care about that at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to sound like an overtly religious person, but in ancient India, people realised that certain diseases arise more commonly out of marriages within a family. They studied this concept mathematically, and realised that the probability of a couple having a child with a genetic defect approaches to extremely small levels by seven generations. So they theorised that seven generations of separation is what it takes to prevent certain genetic diseases which ran in families. So they came up with the system of a 'gotra' that still persists in Hindu society - where you are separated from others by at least seven generations, and put people in certain 'gotras' or 'clans' - with the belief that you must not marry within your gotra. It proved quite successful at decreasing the incidence of recessive disorders, but was not perfect - as your gotra was only determined by your patrilineal descent and not matrilineal.</p>
<p>The problem now is that these gotras aren't updated with every generation, so people even within the same gotra are often separated by MUCH MUCH more than seven generations, and because of social religious norms, struggle to marry even if they want to. This has led to some people working for the abolition of the gotra system from society, although legally in India you can marry anyone (of the opposite gender).</p>
<p>Hope this helped! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really big question that gets very complicated and political.  </p>
<p>Basically, it had to take any number of complicated corporate systems with all fine print, discern what was needed and important, then translate that into a unified marketplace.  It also had to do it perfectly, because any misinformation meant the federal government helped a corporation kill grandma because she didn't know her heart pills weren't covered.  </p>
<p>Insurance companies are betting you $/yr that you'll spend less than that on healthcare this year.  They profit by winning enough bets over a given populace. To help their odds, they will pre-negotiate lower medical costs with larger medical groups and put in exceptions like &quot;We don't cover elective surgeries&quot;, then get shitty with the definition of &quot;elective&quot; in the fine print.  Shit like &quot;That cancer surgery is &quot;elective&quot; because you haven't tried drug therapy yet&quot;.  </p>
<p>Healthcare.gov needed to read ALL of that fine print, for every level of every policy, filter out the ones that don't 100% meet the 15,000 pages of ACA standards and then post the differences using less than a tweet's worth of characters.  All of this needs to be back checked with teams of lawyers to make sure it's presented in a way that a reasonable person can make an educated choice.  </p>
<p>Then there's the technical side.  The website had to plug into at every participating insurance provider's unique and universally terrible corporate sales databases, transmitting application and payment information perfectly, and again making sure there's no fine-print switcheroos for every policy.  Think of the worst corporate management software you've ever seen.  Then consider a the slickest and most user friendly.  You get to write software that works with ALL OF THEM.  Each interface is it's own special shit-snowflake that you get to automate.  For every policy. For every company.  </p>
<p>Oh, and every state has their own branch of the company, and set of state standards, so your fix for Aetna New Jersey isn't going to work for Aetna Missouri, because that has to flow through Mo.Gov's shit website too AND Aetna MO's database didn't get the update yet so they're still using the system from 2003 which is totally different anyway.  So now your shit-snowflake work just went up by a factor of 50.  Also, not everyone speaks english so everything for all policies, fine print, marketplace summaries, and user interfaces has to be accurately translated into a couple dozen languages.  Don't fuck that up or you're killing grandma again.  </p>
<p>While the backend guys are designing a shit-snowflake shoveler, another team has to program a web interface that grandma can use.  See, for the first time EVERYONE was REQUIRED to have health insurance.  That includes your grandmother who browses family photos by dragging them into word documents because it's the only way she knows how.  It also includes the homeless guy who literally cannot read and was genuinely unaware that computers could be used for anything other than porn.  Your interface needs to be so simple that they can figure it out on their own.  </p>
<p>Oh, and since it's collecting SSN's, addresses, and health histories, it all needs to be super secure and require a secure username/password when logging in.  If you're in the identity stealing business, it's goddamn christmas morning in there.  So the site needs to be easy enough to access that illiterate grandma can get in, but also hard enough that 1337HackerBoi69 can't.  </p>
<p>Then it also needs to be ruggedized against political enemies that want the site to fail.  Obama's been telling everyone Sept. 29th is opening day, so how bad would it suck if the site was hit by a DDOS for the first week? Oh, and any fuckup from the aforementioned issues before will
definitely be blown way out of proportion, so build some lawsuit budgets into any work you do building the site.  </p>
<p>And all of this needs to be done ideally within a year or two, because we've got a political schedule to keep.  Oh, also, Aetna MO finally got their system updated to the 2009 version so the plugins you hacked together for them stopped working and need to be rebuilt.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was not part of this specific disaster, but have been involved in other multi-billion dollar non-profit/government entity IT projects.   I have also been involved in many successful projects, so have seen the glaring difference.   The lifecycle of the non-profit project has been as follows;  </p>
<ul>
<li>Management are given low budget, and hire in high paid high skilled consultants.   Work is scoped out, and above average pricing provided (driving work to high priced firm).  In this case, could have been given a $50 million budget, and then consulting firm says they could do it for $80 million.   </li>
<li>Managers then have cheaper firms, especially large offshore types come in and undercut.   They say they could get it done for $10 million, and win the project.   </li>
<li>The firm who underbid, don't have any experience in this type of project, so spin their wheels for 6-12 months, achieving very little.  </li>
<li>More underbidding firms get parts of the project, to help speed things up.  As the baseline has been set for very low cost resources, the only firms bidding are more offshore type firms.  </li>
<li>The multiple firms start competing with each other for each part of the project, bring in more and more resources.  </li>
<li>A small number of highly skilled independents by the this stage are likely doing most of the work.  The offshore firms are spending all their time on presentations to management on why their firm should see increased scope.  </li>
<li>Management sees their $50 million budget has evaporated, and they have nothing to show for it yet.  To save face, they make a great case on why budget needs to increase.  Each firm helps management make the case.  </li>
<li>Now 12 months in, prototypes are produced, which look nothing like what requirements set out.   Turns out lowest salaried grads hired offshore (to maximize firm profit), are not as familiar with new healthcare law as firms had promised.   </li>
<li>Initial firms start to be phased out due to non performance, and new offshore firms start to come in and take scope.   New firms are at same price point or lower, and many of the same offshore resources shift to new firm (since they already have ACA experience).  </li>
<li>Eventually after many iterations, prototypes start looking closer to what is needed, but are as buggy as all heck.   No one realized all the great grads offshore went to work for tech companies at multiples the income.   </li>
<li>Government managers by this stage are so deep, that they are committed to following through on solution.   They have become experts at asking for more money in the budget.    </li>
<li>A few years after it was due, a solution is eventually produced.   Original firm that could have provided it for $80 million are working for private firms.  A strong team of independents who came from $80 million firm could have done it for $20 million.  </li>
<li>Project is declared a success.  Budget issues are swept under rug.  </li>
<li>Firm quietly hires a local firm or independents to correct issues left in original solution.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of the major factors that I'm aware of:</p>
<p>1) Changing Requirements: In the time between the announcement of the ACA, the signing of contracts for website development, and the actual roll-out of the website the law went through several policy iterations, which requires redevelopment of aspects of the website related to those policies. So if you design the website for policy A, but policy B is actually enacted, you have to changed everything related to policy A. Those could be significant impact changes.</p>
<p>2) Lack of Oversight: The program was managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which does not typically handle large-scale, customer-facing government IT projects. </p>
<p>3) Scope Creep: I don't know about this project specifically, but one of the major problems with government projects is scope creep. The government lays out requirements that usually range between &quot;way too much for what we actually need&quot; and &quot;everything we could think of related to this project.&quot; So the cost is already elevated above what a private program like this would run. Then you add the contractors coming in and saying &quot;but you didn't think of X, Y, and Z&quot; and the government says &quot;you're right, we definitely need that too!&quot;</p>
<p>4) Government Regulations: Not saying this as a political statement, but being a government contractor means dealing with government regulations. Many times these regulations become very expensive, as opposed to developing things in the private sector. This leaves some of the best programmers on the sidelines, since they are working in the Silicon Valley sphere, not the Contracting sphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In any huge IT project, government or corporate, there are typically hundreds (if not 1000's) of people who can add complexity to a project (Janice in Accounting says it needs to do &quot;X&quot;) but very few who can remove it (VP Bob says &quot;no, it really doesn't need X&quot;)</p>
<p>That means over time the scope of the project grows enormously.  There is a term for this &quot;scope creep&quot; that people in IT are very familiar with.</p>
<p>A lot of these additional requirements come in after the project has already started, which means that changes impact multiple teams of people working on multiple parts of the project.  Something as simple as adding a new field to capture &quot;mother's maiden name&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to change the UI layer</li>
<li>you have to change the database</li>
<li>you have to change the validation that tests for required fields</li>
<li>you have to change the data layer that talks to the UI and database</li>
<li>all of the db maint scripts have to be updated</li>
<li>all of the test scripts have to be updated</li>
<li>all of the translations for different languages have to be updated</li>
<li>reports have to be updated</li>
</ul>
<p>So one little change may impact 8+ teams.  Multiply that by 10,000 - and keep in mind that some changes are much more significant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Like a lot of veggies, man figured out roasting can help the flavor, or that it tastes good with a broth. When they felt its effects it was then used to stay awake for night prayers. Check out the great travel-ethnobotany book The Devil's Cup for a really cool history of coffee</p>
<p>Edit: There's been some speculation that the origin was Ethiopia, a theory which has its sources, too, and is close enough to the Arabian peninsula connection most historians pin the origin to. Also, shout-out to Kaldi, the herder who legend says was the one who noticed it; I believe those sorts of legends </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The history of many foods that are...errr...challenging is largely lost to history. But the easiest explanation is that happy accidents happen. The story of the goat eating coffee beans is apocryphal, but it's probably not far off from the truth. Either the goat or some other animal ate it and a human noticed, or a human was really desperate and tried eating the beans with interesting results. Over time, experimentation led to better ways of processing to get desired results. Drying (as in the case of coffee beans) is a natural because that's one easy, primitive way to store something past its growing season. It's possible that someone tried drying the beans by roasting them over fire, which would have brought out more flavor in the beans than just sun-drying. And coffee is born.</p>
<p>Chocolate needs to be fermented to make it palatable. Again, this is a natural progression. Most organic matter will ferment unprovoked in the right conditions. Chocolate likely began as an accident, and someone liked the results of the accident (or thought the chocolate had potential as food) and started experimenting as well as introducing the foodstuff to other members of the community who also experimented. Those who first consumed chocolate (in Mesoamerica) drank it in unsweetened, fermented form, so it would have been bitter and strong, but Europeans started adding sugar to it and brought chocolate back to Europe. </p>
<p>There are lots of other fun examples mentioned here by other users--in <del>South and Central America</del> Mexico corn was nixtamalized to free up nutrients and make it more digestible (also consider that before corn even became corn as we know it, it went through thousands of years of breeding--initially, it was a wild grass that was extremely labor-intensive to harvest and prepare, so part of the history of any of these foods is intensive breeding and selecting for traits that we--humans--find palatable).</p>
<p>I always think of artichokes too. A spiny thistle that many of us now find extremely enjoyable. How many thousands of years of breeding did it take to get the artichoke into its current, delicious, but still labor-intensive, form? Fascinating stuff to contemplate. My takeaway is that humans are hungry and clever. If it can be eaten, omnivores will find a way.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you for my first ever Reddit gold, kind stranger!</p>
<p>EDIT #2: Nixtamalization originated in Mexico. Thank them the next time you enjoy a street taco (which I hope is often).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Both of these are edible and consumed by animals. So there were reasons to nibble on them even if you discount the bitterness of the beans.</p>
<p>Humans have also been eating and processing foods for a long time, we've probably tried eating damn near everything on this planet at one point or another. Neither are particularly toxic nor require advanced processing, so they're pretty edible as things go. There may be specific events that lead to cultivation of these, but it's no more strange than the fact that we eat olives or beans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shortly after the Recombination era - the era from which cosmic background radiation originates - the cmb was bright orange. </p>
<p>To understand what exactly happened, let's backtrack a bit.
Until 380 000 years after the big bang, the universe was too hot to form neutral atoms. Electrons and protons whizzed through space which such high speeds, that electromagnetic attraction wasn't strong enough to bind them together. Thus, space was filled with a hot plasma, that gave off thermal radiation. During this time, the universe was opaque to photons. Photons would bump into electrons frequently. This scattering of photons results in a mostly in-transparent universe with a visibility of a few thousand lightyears at most. (Which sounds a lot but is very small at cosmic scales)</p>
<p>Due to the expansion of the universe, this plasma finally cooled down to around 3000K. Which is cool enough to form neutral atoms around 400 000 years after the big bang. Since neutral atoms don't interact with photons that willingly, the universe became transparent. Thus, the thermal radiation of the plasma in the recombination era was emitted into all directions and from all points in space. And since the plasma was around 3000K at that time, and the black body radiation at that temperature is orangy, the hole universe was filled with orange light for a few million years.</p>
<p>The universe during the first few million years after the big bang saw the first stars being formed, but during this time, the only radiation emitted was the hydrogen line.</p>
<p>Over time, as the universe continued to expand, the cmb got redshifted. Now, ~13 billion years later, the cmb is redshifted down to around 2.7K, which is in the microwave part of the spectrum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>so if you want something blue then that's a colour temp of about 20,000K (i'm hoping that colour temperature is defined in a physically sensible way!) which would correspond to a redshift of around 7,400.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pop up ads have somewhat died down over the past 10 years or so. This is because most people now understand exactly what a pop up ad is and why they didn’t actually win 1,000,000 or whatever.</p>
<p>You will notice now that the most recent try of ad is the ‘FBI Virus’ or similar. This ad claims your computer is broken or you did some bad thing and must call this number and pay lots of $$$$ or you will be arrested etc.</p>
<p>There is also the ‘browser hijack’ style where some ad seems to appear as an error message, something to the effect of “you need adobe flash player to view this” and then you click on it to supposedly download adobe flash. You’re actually not. Your downloading a very stingy piece of software called a PUP, or Potentially Unwanted Program. These will change your homepage, search engine, even cause more pop ups.</p>
<p>But basically, to answer your question, these ads preyed on the lack of knowledge the general public has towards computers and cyber security. Because we now pretty much all know what a pop up ad is, we close it, but back when they first started they were just as successful as today’s fake Microsoft support technicians from India. The reason they are still around is some people still don’t get it, and the people running these ads like to cling to their old ways haha.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once was producing a marketing company conference for a huge marketing company out of the UK. There was a woman pushing pop-up ads who gave a talk about the &quot;Value of Pop-up Ads&quot; (This was about 15 years ago when Pop-ups were relatively new). </p>
<p>The talk spiraled into a rather spirited Q and A session where about 90% of the marketers in the audience told stories of how their clients saw the use of pop-ups as denigrating to their brand. They said that respectable companies didn't want their brand associated with them as they were seen to be intrusive and annoying. </p>
<p>The upshot of the comments was that the companies gave them the thumbs down, despite reading about the favorable ROI in using them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, let me first say all the answers that have already been posted are interesting and insightful, and what I’m  writing is not to override them. That said, I have a slightly different perspective on these than most.</p>
<p>In political psychology (the field in which I am a graduate student), there have been quite a few studies of the influence of ads like this, and the consensus is that they work. I’m not tapped in to the world of research in commercial advertising, so I don’t know if it would directly transfer but, to my mind, a candidate is just another product.</p>
<p>What we know is that, no, people don’t really read these ads. They even see them as annoyances a large portion of the time. But through the use of carefully selected imagery, colors, sounds, etc. it is fairly easy to manipulate emotional reactions and, perhaps more importantly, core affect towards a candidate (and presumably a product). </p>
<p>Let’s tie this to a tangible example to illustrate it. If I have a candidate, John Smith, and I want Senator Smith’s vote total to go up, I would begin by researching what causes people to have more good feelings (positive affect) toward a candidate. One strong variable in that regard is familiarity. That is, as people become more accustomed to seeing Sen. Smith’s name and face, the more familiar her seems and the more name recognition he will have, which translates to higher vote totals. So in this case, I don’t care if the “customer” is clicking the article that’s popping up, or reading the text that says “get out and vote for a great American blah blah blah”… I simply care that they are seeing John’s name and face over and over so they recognize it in the voting booth. At least theoretically, this should play out on the shelves of the supermarket as well. </p>
<p>Emotional manipulation is quite successful and fairly common as well. I don’t need you to click on an article saying how Trump did scary things A through Z. I simply need to create an ad that uses a deep red color, bold and sharp text font and features a picture of Trump with a menacing face. This will result in increased levels of anger. The same can be done to induce anxiety or enthusiasm. It’s not hard to imagine a pop-up advertisement that is aimed simply at having the viewer see the brand name for a laundry detergent, for example, with tranquil images of a field of flowers and a cloudy day. They don’t care if you click through. You will still associate “Downy” with “peaceful, happy”. </p>
<p>Now, of course, the effect size of these methods is fairly small, but with the relatively low cost of online marketing for any sizable company, they can afford to cast a rather wide net. Even if these emotional and affective appeals only substantially work on one percent of people, if you’re advertising to 100 million people, you’ve won yourself a million customers. Now imagine what an effect that could have on a vote total. That’s why so many political advertisements have migrated to the web. </p>
<p>TL;DR- I could be drawing connections that just aren’t there, but it seems to me that the same psychological mechanisms at work in online political ads could feasibly play a similar role for pop-up commercial advertising online. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's an entire industry built up around trying to increase the click-through-rate (CTR) of ads from 1% to 1.5%. If an ad has 100,000 impressions, that's the difference between 1000 clicks and 1500 clicks. Ways to do this are by conducting multivariate tests on the content of the ad (images or text) and picking a winner as soon as it's statistically significant, or experimenting with placement (banner ads across the top, towers on the margins, interstitial ads, etc).</p>
<p>As far as placement goes, no ads have higher CTRs than pop ups.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A big part of it is culture though.

Content may vary depending on your country's domain. These sites track your location, so it will still present relevant content to what you are searching for, and probably won't change that much, but there are slight variations. Additionally, these servers in other countries are hosted in those countries. The top level domains (.com, .net, etc) as well as IP address issuance are managed by ICANN. In a similar way that all home addresses in the world will vary, as do internet IP addresses and top level domains. Finally they will provide less latency to those in said countries. Try pinging google servers around the world, the fastest will be in your home country. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I remember a documentary in the 90s where a guy would take a large tarp of plastic or cloth and stretch it out underneath a large tree in the Amazon rain forest.  They would then shoot some gas up into the air that would kill like 99% of all creatures it contacted....or maybe it was just insects, I can't remember but I think it only affected insects.</p>
<p>Anyways, for the next several hours the jungle would &quot;rain down&quot; the carcasses of dead insects onto the tarp and these scientists would collect the insects and categorize them.  </p>
<p>They said that every time they did this they would get something like 20,000 different insects but what was surprising to them was that <del>90%</del> (correction it's 80%) of what they found were &quot;new to science&quot; every time they did this experiment.</p>
<p>It didn't seem to matter where they went.....they repeated this many, many times and every time they did it, <del>90%</del> (correction it's 80%) of what they catalogued was new to science.</p>
<p>It literally blew the top off of the previously held estimates for the number of species on earth and at the end, the scientists had to conclude that they simply had no idea where it would end nor how many species of living things were on the earth anymore.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the way you calculate it is with a bit of estimation.</p>
<p>Say that we have a box with a hole, and the box has 1000 colored balls inside you can take out through the hole. What we don't know is which colors, or how many colors the balls are.</p>
<p>So we take out one ball, and it happens to be blue! So now we know there's blue balls in the box. Great!</p>
<p>Now imagine that there's only blue balls coming out. You pull out 10 balls and they are all blue, you keep pulling out 100 balls and they are all blue. Now we've only seen 10% of all balls inside the box, but we can start guessing that the chance that we never got another color means that most, if not all, balls are blue. Maybe we got lucky and only found the 100 blue balls first, but the chance of that happening are really small, theres 5958926632240478155489389057946132722598279588777288866613428027720091866834339557556406953783393337191792337384343797137527180562707601151082428455887739138152983603695993602780124665235348032787297990137398327480690965409929969664334240631387010833309096272433060469800960000000000000000000000000 different permutations (that is groups of balls we would pull out in an order) of balls we could have had, but only 1 of them would be if all of the balls were blue.</p>
<p>Now lets imagine what would happen if instead the second ball we pulled out was a red ball. This time we know there's more than just blue balls in the box. Now imagine that every time we pull a ball it comes out a different color, and after pulling out 100 they are all a different color each. Now there's a chance that there's 100 colors and nothing else, and we just happened to pull out one ball of each color with no repeats. The chance of this is a little bit higher than taking out all the balls of one color, but it still is very very very small. You'd have to be very lucky, it's a better guess to think there's still many colors we've yet to find. Maybe not 1000, but certainly more than 100.</p>
<p>So we can use the history of how many new colors we discovered as we saw each ball and create a good guess of how many colors probably exist in the box, and how many we know already.</p>
<p>The same thing can be done with organisms. We know more or less how many insects, fungi, plants, animals, bacteria etc. exist on earth by knowing how many resources they need, how much spaces is available, doing thermodynamic studies, etc. From there we notice that as we look at animals and see what species they are, we find new species every so much. Just like with the colors, we can guess how many species we probably haven't seen yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Statistics like this are created based on looking at what is identified within a group.</p>
<p>Perhaps an easier example.</p>
<p>Let's say people are inspecting defects in a product.  Someone in charge intentionally adds 10 defects.  Then they watch and see what comes through the line, what is discovered by the process.  If people only find 3 of the defects, then they can estimate they're catching 30% of the defects overall, letting 70% of the defects go through.  On the other hand, if all 10 defects are discovered, then they know they're catching all or nearly all of the defects.  The percentage of things they know about should roughly match the percentage of things they don't know about.</p>
<p>It applies to other statistics as well, like crime stats.  They can look at crimes they know happened but weren't reported through official channels, and look at crimes they know about and were reported. Looking at the difference shows about how many crimes go unreported.  It is not exact, but if people are careful about how they create the stats they can be fairly accurate. </p>
<p>For counting species there are several ways it can be done.  One way is like above, to have one group track the number of species in an area and another group figure out how many are new. Another method is a linear regression, figuring out an approximately how many species there should be based on estimates and comparing it to how many have actually been identified.</p>
<p>Also, most of the species that aren't discovered are small things.  We're down to small numbers of new birds and mammals, often they are sub-species that get reclassified as a new species, or they're highly specialized species living in a remote and small geographic area.  </p>
<p>It is mostly bugs, fungi, and other small organism that are being discovered in large numbers. These are things that are hard to spot and identify, many only identified because of genetic testing on tiny or microscopic organisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Many of the worlds species are insects, and many of those are thought to be beetles.</p>
<p>One bit of information that supports this theory comes from an attempt to document the number of species within a, relatively, small forest encampment. The researchers found that with each tree that was shaken to gather the insects on them, that there were many unique beetle species. Almost a new species per tree.</p>
<p>Aditionally, and unrelated to beetles, is that fact that we havent explored our oceans all that much. And that means that we've yet to find all the species that inhabit the oceans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If the number is much larger than the number of species we already know, that would get your 14%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For three particles, two interesting and different way you can entangle them with each other is in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state" target="_blank">GHZ state</a> and in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_state" target="_blank">W-state</a>. But as mentioned elsewhere, all kinds of different entanglements are possible for any number of particles.</p>
<p>In condensed matter physics, we are very interested in phases of matter where the entanglement is long-ranged, meaning even though you have some enormous (~10^(23)) number of particles, they all share some sort of entanglement with each other, even at &quot;far&quot; distances microscopically. So yes, you can have way more than a million particles entangled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
