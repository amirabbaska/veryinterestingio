		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if you're not swishing it around in your mouth, it's still going to touch your teeth at some point. If you don't drink soda or any carbonated drinks very often, then this boasts no problem to your dental hygiene. However, if you're drinking carbonated beverages every day, then you could see a problem start to develop. </p>
<p>The way this works is through a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and saliva. When these two reactants meet, they form carbonic acid, which brings the pH level in your mouth down. This means your mouth is now more acidic than it is basic. The extra acidity begins erosion of enamel, which is the part of your tooth that protects the dentin from bacteria &amp; what not. </p>
<p>Edit: So obviously any kind of soda is going to be worse for your teeth than just straight up carbonated water. OP had just asked about &quot;fizzy drinks&quot;, so I assumed he/she was concerned about the fizz aspect and not the sugar or anything of that nature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I got the impression then that the above actually leeched calcium from your bones and teeth, but I just googled it and learned that an excess of phosphorus can instead lead to a decrease of calcium and the diseases associated with it. Also that the carbonation itself isn't the cause.

Stress tends to cause a great deal of tension in the abdomen. That tension can tire out abdominal muscles and squeeze organs in a way that creates a feeling of ache or pain.</p>
<p><strong>Digestion</strong>
Stress affects hormone levels, and hormones are used to aid digestion. When you're stressed, your body's hormones start to cause your digestion to suffer, which may lead to bloating, intestinal pain, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Irritable Bowel Syndrome</strong>
Anxiety has been linked as one of the most likely causes of irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. IBS occurs when your body's gastrointestinal system is no longer processing foods correctly, and it can cause stomach discomfort even without anxiety present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends is a sports caster out in Nebraska and I asked him the same thing years ago(he casts football games). He said that he spends an average of 20-30 hours studying for every game he calls, from memorizing the pronunciations of players names, the number they wear, stats they are known for as well as interviewing players to get little known facts about their lives. In addition to this, the casters have producers who are constantly combing though a database about these players and feeding this information to that caster though an ear piece. They can give them up to date facts about the players, as well as what was seen in different shots and different camera angels. He let me see the inside camera once from their booth and hear the audio feed from the producers(This is what they use to help themselves get better and even have a breakdown session after each game). It may seem like a great gig from the outside, about the amount of work and stress that actually goes into calling a game well is incredible. Much respect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matching is just putting things together without clashing colors or patterns. Now the harder part- what clashes and doesn't . Starting with colors, generally things on opposite sides of the color wheel-  (just search it) will go well together. Those next to each other on the color will as well. Those in some other position may not. You shouldn't put the same color on all the clothes because then it's just too much of one hue.  As for patterns, usually only either the top or the bottom can have them as an easy way to stay out of trouble.  </p>
<p>(There is a lot more like accessories which can add third color to make it more interesting but you are just trying to survive here not become a fashion designer)</p>
<p>Now for the easiest way: just use opposites.
Well if you start with the bottoms, let's assume no pattern just color. The easiest is black or white because nearly everything will match with it as a top. So black pants, white top. White pants, black top. If something has to have a pattern- choose only the top or bottom and the other is a plain color.</p>
<p>Oh and tell your gf - pick your own damn clothes out next time too</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Flashman's fashion advice is spot on.  Realize that aside of the rules he mentions, there are cultural elements too.  Suit and sneakers doesn't necessarily look stupid from a purely aesthetic standpoint but the formal/casual contrast is dissonant.</p>
<p>I often recommend &quot;Dress for Success&quot;.  Aside from a lot of good (if dated) fashion advice, the book explores why people judge clothing the way they do (in a nutshell, &quot;nice&quot; clothes are ones that make you look wealthy and like a good choice as a mate).

<p>The primary colors will &quot;match&quot; with the secondary or tertiary colors that touch it. </p>
<p>The colors across the wheel from each other will &quot;pop.&quot; Wearing yellow and purple (across) will make both colors stand out more. And yellow really doesn't need to stand out any more than it already does. But this is why redheads look so striking in green clothes. It makes their hair look super red. </p>
<p>Clothes that match are always a safe bet. Wearing clothes that pop can be great, or it can be jarring. I would probably stay away from popping yellow or red. They're already very loud colors. Buuut, a pair of bright red socks under blue slacks can deliver just a pinch of &quot;bold, and also daring.&quot;</p>
<p>Also... this is why you see <strong>SOO MANY</strong> movie posters saturated in orange and blue. They are across, so they pop really well, which draws your eye to the poster, without being obnoxiously loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Styles should be all the same or quite different. Colors should either be exactly the same or rather different. Go all the same and you'll look very matching, but rather uninteresting (just buy all black everything and you'll always look pretty good). Go all different and you'll look a bit crazy (generally don't use more than 2 strong colors). So find your spot in between. Generally, I try to go mostly the same, and diversify in one area, like a colorful shirt or jacket over commonplace pants and other items. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The Greeks didn't have a <em>word</em> for blue but they certainly could see that color. They just lumped it in with &quot;bronze&quot;, something they would use to describe the sky and ocean.</p>
<p>Think about how you consider colors now. If you go to a paint store they will have a huge number of additional color names which you don't know and don't use, just considering them another shade of a color you already have a word for. This is the same sort of thing they did before the word &quot;blue&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, this is my observation so I guess we can address whether its true or not.</p>
<p>I understand that if you took me ~150lbs trying to overpower a larger man ~250lbs in an &quot;oklahoma drill&quot; situation, its clear that I would most likely lose.  the speed of my moving X 150lbs vs the speed of him moving X 250lbs is what were dealing with in that situation.. right? </p>
<p>However i don't know how this translates to certain exercises. in my experience lifting weights, I've found that heavier people tend to be able to push more weight from the start when it comes to the bench press. I can logically understand that their muscles are stronger due to the increased  burden of carrying around extra weight all the time, but they're also carrying that weight while exercising, so I don't fully understand how that helps.</p>
<p>TLDR; How does one's mass come into play when performing strength exercises in a stationary position?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that they generally have a greater amount of the non-impressive muscles and postural muscles that can't really be worked in the gym, they <em>also</em> generally eat more, have more energy stored in cells (called glycogen), and have more cellular creatine available.  Creatine helps the muscle cell make use of the energy it produces.  However, people with less body fat typically produce more testosterone and growth hormone (which helps them build/retain muscle) and are more sensitive to insulin (which helps sugar/energy sources get into their muscle cells).</p>
<p>This phenomenon can be observed in bodybuilders.  They &quot;bulk&quot; (eat more &amp; gain weight purposefully to fuel muscle growth) in their offseason then &quot;cut&quot; (eat less to slowly lose fat) to prepare for a show.  As they eat less and lose weight, their testosterone and growth hormone production increases.  This helps them to build and retain muscle.  Think of it as a built-in way of preventing our bodies from losing muscle when food is scarce.  They also have more insulin sensitivity, meaning sugar can get into their muscle cells more effectively.  For this reason, bodybuilders may actually get <em>stronger</em> as they begin to lose weight.  However, after significant weight loss, their energy stores and creatine (which we get from food and/or supplements) become depleted.  This means that after bodybuilders lose a lot of weight, they actually begin to lose some energy, become weaker, and even lose some muscle mass.  However, their fat loss generally &quot;outweighs&quot; the muscle loss, and they end up looking... like a bodybuilder.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<li>Leverages. No doubt, it's impressive to be extremely strong at a certain weight (i.e. Pound for pound strength or wilks score) But the strongest people in powerlifting tend to be extremely fat. It's easier to squat half a ton of weight when you have basically have a mini monster truck tire around your waist for support and to push off from.
1a. I didn't know how to describe this, so I'll describe it as a subpoint of leverages. When you're fat, your lifts also tend to have less distance to travel. For example, if your chest is extremely fat, how far does the bar have to travel up, vs if your chest is extremely lean? Doing partial reps of powerlifting exercises is a frequently used method, used partially (no pun intended) because they teach you to work through sticking points while not taking a huge toll on your body (vs compared to if you did the entire range of motion). So if you're fatter, you're probably limiting your range of motion inherently.</li>
<li>Body composition. While it's possible, it's unlikely two untrained people will have the same lean body mass at different weights. The fatter guy will probably have a higher overall lean body mass because he has to lift more weight overall on a daily basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, it's unlikely you will have two people of the same overall health at different body weights. Overall health encompasses many factors. But let's isolate two: cardiovascular health and overall strength. I'm currently 200 lb @ ~15% body fat, or 170 lb lean body mass. I can run a 6 min mile, but at a heart rate of 170 bpm. That's pretty good for someone my weight, but I would no doubt be faster or have a lower bpm at the same running rate if I was lighter. But I would also lose strength. Someone of identical height who is 170 lb @ 10% body fat would be able to run a faster mile if they trained for it. Because he'd be carrying less weight. But no doubt, he would also not be as strong as me.</p>
<p>As just a small example, based on my Fitbit data in the past, going from 200 lb to 185 lb, maintaining the same LBM, my resting HR would decrease by about 10-15% (which is good). But looking at my work out logs, my strength took a hit of about the same %. </p>
<p>Ultimately, based on changing weight alone (while using similar lean body mass), overall health is dramatically affected. If you changed overall lean body mass, the effects would be even more drastic. Then there are many other factors to consider.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Everyone first learns how to do something by watching someone else do it and then copying that.  For some reason, (science isn't sure because it doesn't understand it well yet,) some people are more sensitive to this than others and when they see someone doing something it triggers their muscles to try to copy it before they realize what is going on.  This can even make it hard for someone to stand still if they are being told a story about how someone else is moving.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very good answers so far. Let me attempt to add a couple of things.  </p>
<p>Let’s break out a couple of items. First it isn’t super relevant that the chamber is anechoic. But to explain all of this, anechoic means without echo. In ELI5, the walls absorb sound. This is to take better acoustic measurements. For example if you are using a microphone to measure a speaker,  to get the purest measurement of the speaker, you don’t want sound waves bouncing off the walls. Quiet and anechoic often but not always go together. </p>
<p>The rating for the room is -9dB(a). To understand this we need to understand the -9, the dB, and the (a) </p>
<p>First the dB. This is a logarithmic ratio between two values. Fun fact. The B is a Bell named after Alexander Graham Bell of the telephone fame. The d is for Deci, 1/10th</p>
<p>A missing item is dBSPL. Here the SPL is sound pressure level, this defines one of the two ratios, in this case 20 micro Pascals. So you can just say, for example 94 dBSPL and understand what the value is (you don’t need the second number from the dB ratio). </p>
<p>Now here is where we get back to the (a). humans can hear a range of frequencies, from bass (kick drum)  to treble (very shrill sounds). To talk about the total sound pressure over the range of human hearing, a specification tells us how much each bin of the frequency spectrum “counts for” towards a single number. There are several different methods, but know that the (a) is called A weighting. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-weighting#/media/File%3AAcoustic_weighting_curves_(1).svg" target="_blank">helpful Wikipedia </a> this Wikipedia image shows the most popular ratings. </p>
<p>tl;dr a long time ago folks picked some sound level as a reference point. Sound measurements are expressed in ratios via logarithm.  If something is quieter (lower) than this chosen reference level, the number is negative. Only in a perfect vacuum would there be “zero sound” as sound needs something to propitiate through. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's the same reason as why we can have negative pH acids, as pH is a logarithmic unit too. (edit) actually now I think of it, pH is the <strong>negative</strong> logarithm of a quantity, but the analogy still holds as pH can be negative or positive because logarithms can be positive or negative (respectively)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of reactor. Most plants are so ridiculously automated it's not even funny. Even the older ones.</p>
<p>As someone stated though the lack of load would cause the generators to trip and with that happening the reactor would trip because there's nothing to take the load. Nuke plants aren't great at varying loads so a sudden drop off in load usage would cause it all to shutdown for safety reasons automatically. When we had that big power outtage many years ago on the east coast the plants all went into shut down because the systems all tripped as there was a sudden lack of load as far as the generators were concerned and all the reactors went into safety &quot;OH shit our powers got nowhere to go&quot; mode and started shut down processes. Which sometimes causes problems as the back ups for some plants are primarily fed from the grid (backups used if not acailable) but because the whole grid went down some back ups didn't do what they should have.</p>
<p>Source: Am Nuclear Operator </p>
<p>Edit:
Few questions were asked.
1) Depending on the age of the plant, in a perfect world they should technically run without any human intervention for quite awhile. That said no plant runs perfectly so it could be as short as a day before lack of humans causes it to shut down or a few weeks. As someone said they have entire shifts of people for the reactors I'm at at all times and they're integral to making sure it runs smoothly but even without us it generally can run for awhile before issues arise and it shuts down, but it's also a much older so without us it'd fall apart.</p>
<p>2) The simulated load is incredibly low as the plants can't really run if there's nothing to draw the load. It's hard to just have electricity go to nothing and it's hard to pretend there's a load that can use up the pure energy a nuclear reactor puts out. Nuclear reactors do not handle adjusting their power very well and at relatively high numbers begin to poison themselves out if the level is too low. Something like 60%, I think I can't remember, reactor power causes it to be overwhelmed by it's byproducts to the point where it can't keep going and has to basically be shut down restarted after x amount of hours so that it can decay enough to not cripple the reaction. The simulated load would have to be equal to a load above poisoning levels and that's obscenely high. Generally if the generator detects no load drawing from it, it has no choice but to basically be like &quot;Mr reactor you need to turn off or shit going to go Cray.&quot;</p>
<p>3)Most reactors built nowadays generally have a ton of safety features to hopefully power cool the reactor and poison it out to the point where the reactions stop. However... the fuel is still hot. Really fricken hot. Without the water circulating through it constantly there could be some huge issues. I work at a CANDU reactor. We use heavy water as our heat transfer medium. One of our in case of emergency cool and poison the reactor mediums is a large eater tower that gravity feeds normal light eater into the reactor as that cools and absorbs the reactor faster than the current heavy water in it. However.. It's designed for 1 reactor messing up hard and hoping people can shut the others down (all reactors are independent system wise so that faults on one isn't faults on all 4). Another feature they have assuming 100% lack of power (no back up generators for emergencies) the system is designed to go for as long as it can on a thermal flow option... like, the hot water will flow through the system cool and return back, which they got to test in real life by accident during the black out because the faults were so bad. However it only last so long. The systems probably would never breach containment if it got too hot honestly however the plant itself would be a terrible place to be with how their systems are set up. A meltdown on the levels of what has happened with 3 mile and fukushima are interesting edge cases of poor decision or poor design. Fukushima actually caused my plant to put safeties in place in case something were to happen here... Even though we are nowhere near fault lines. Meltdowns are honestly a hard thing to judge. It depends on how containment is built. It's such a plant by plant basis that it's impossible to say how every plant would react.</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>First off sorry I don't have much for sources. It's mostly the courses we took in training and operating procedure and most of it's not really linkable.</p>
<p>Most plants are designed yes to just shut down the reactor if a problem arises and no human interaction occurs. The rods at most meant for poisoning the reactor out and shutting it down are gravity held up by electronic means. If no power, rods drop and kill the reaction really fast.</p>
<p>Also the reason the load matters isn't for the reactor itself. It's for the generators. If they aren't using the steam from the reactor to power anything there's almost no reason for the reactor to be running so it would begin to shut itself down.</p>
<p>Also my plant will never be re-tubed if that helps. Too old. On her last legs. Which is why we have to be more involved with plant operations, older plant with lots more terrible manual valves and etc.</p>
<p>Plants are designed to have as much automation in its processes as technologically available at the time of construction, and as such as time goes on newer plants have more sustainability assuming peak conditions.</p>
<p>Side note: If you want to get into it go for it but be warned rotating 12 hour shifts which we have are absolutely the worst. Anyone who says it's okay is an edge case.</p>
<p>Edit 3: I'm currently out, I'll try and have answers to what I can actually answer when I'm at a computer.</p>
<p>Edit 4:</p>
<p>Is CANDU the best: Eh. Depends. Its a system that works, its pretty safe, can run off not just enriched fuels, but its not necessarily the best or most efficient. It uses a Heavy Water Moderator for the heat transfer, as light water (normal ol' h20) tends to absorb a lot of the neutrons in the reaction, whereas Heavy Water does not. This is both good and bad, as the inventory of water for cooling has to be maintained and can't just be pumped from a lake (the water in most systems is never recycled back to the lakes, mind you) Edit edit: Biggest advantage of CANDU? Online refueling. We Refuel while she runs. Think of it like pushing the rods through a tube. Push one in, out comes one on other side. They very carefully balance the load with new/old fuel and which sides fueled for each tube to make sure there's no spikes in reactivity. Very neat stuff honestly.</p>
<p>If the plant tripped and had the resources, could we restart?: Absolutely. Most plants are designed that way. If its been down long enough, though, it has to start up -really- slowly. Most reactors take hours / days to start up and get to full power due to the nature of nuclear reactions. It has to be super controlled (which nuclear is very controlled and safe in that matter) so as to not cause problems (or to detect problems and either fix them if possible, or power back down as happens from time to time). The biggest issue is most nuclear plants don't really start up without external power from the grid kind of keeping the systems going and jump-starting what needs to be before you're getting any real power from the Generators. I honestly don't know if we could cold start, with 0 external power. That said, there's still Natural Gas and or Coal depending on where you are (no coal here) to act in the interim, so the power companies could basically shunt the power to the plants to help them start up, which is what happened during the blackout as people mentioned (Some plants were able to keep 1 or more running and used those to basically restart the others) and then from there do what needs to be done, but without any real power source the plant would be unable to keep going, let alone start up.</p>
<p>As for those who DO like shift work, honestly good on you. Legitimately. I found it tiring, staying concentrated for 12 hours isn't easy, and on a night shift on the last even 3 or so hours, you'll notice very few people doing anything that isn't urgent / mandatory outside of the control room.</p>
<p>As for water getting contaminated: I can only vouch for CANDU, but we keep our steam flow separate from the other flows. We used heavy water as mentioned in its own flow, and it basically is used to heat up a boiler, which then heats up normal light water, which then turns the turbines. The heavy water, which flows through the reactor, never leaves containment. It's not allowed to unless there's a breach of some sort, or the vacuum building (a containment device) gets triggered, and at that point there is a lot of &quot;oh god, we got a lot of clean up to do&quot; going on.... But even that is a large, sealed, concrete building. It's a lot safer than people realize. They monitor any air going into and out, all water, etc. Some newer plants don't even let you near the core itself while in operation at all, where as some older ones kind of do but for obvious reasons you don't. Very safe.</p>
<p>As for &quot;Melt downs&quot;, it depends. Only if containment was breached (it takes a lot to breach containment under most circumstances) would there be risk to the outside, and if there was a breach, how big? There would be a lot of signs if there was, and you'd have plenty of warning. Radiation is fast, but linear in its motion. It would have to literally spill out and or explode everywhere, and exploding is something they're designed generally to not do.</p>
<p>Oh this post got too long, had to cut two answer... I'll post as a comment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear engineer and senior reactor operator here. </p>
<p>Current day nuclear plants are not designed to go for more than 10-30 minutes post transient without human interaction. The logic and safety systems are only designed to respond to transients for immediate core protection and plant safety and do not bring the plant automatically to a cold shutdown condition. </p>
<p>Generation 3+ plants (none in commercial operation yet), do have up to 1 week of walk away safety, but require operator actions to ensure long term core cooling. </p>
<p>The bottom line is you can't leave a nuclear reactor. It takes a year or more before decay heat is low enough to prevent a zirconium fire and core melt or spent fuel pool fire. </p>
<p>Operators like myself are licensed at the plant and we cannot leave our watch station until someone else with a license turns over with us. So every day I go in, I cannot leave until someone else who is licensed and qualified for my position takes over. I've done some long shifts due to people calling in sick. </p>
<p>As for the plant side: you have to monitor and maintain equipment. Pumps need oil. Tanks need water filled (or drained). Systems need pressure vented. This stuff happens day to day, so without operators, equipment will fail and the plant will trip. </p>
<p>Best case scenario, you cool the plant down to cold shutdown and leave it in shutdown cooling mode. If power trips off or anything malfunctions you'll lose core cooling again though, as shutdown cooling typically doesn't have auto restarts. </p>
<p>Bottom line: you can't leave a nuclear reactor. And they won't be left unattended. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would somewhat depend on the plant and the exact situation. Most plants built in the 60s and 70s are designed to operate with no human interaction for at least 10 minutes. And that would be during what is called a &quot;design basis accident&quot;, which is some sort of large pipe break in most plants. In a situation where the plant is running fine and all the operators just <em>poof</em> disappeared, the plant would keep running normally for a while. If it lost output connection to the electric grid, the plant would automatically shutdown and maintain itself. If it lost electricity coming from the grid, the backup diesel generators would startup and provide power to emergency and safe shutdown systems. Nuclear power plants have enough diesel fuel on site to power emergency systems for at least a week at full load, so in a non emergency situation (ie  nothing breaks) probably longer than that. As for cooling water, it would depend on the plant, but every plant in the US has at least 30 days of cooling water available without makeup in an emergency situation. </p>
<p>Of course nuclear safety systems assume that every human doesn't just up and disappear forever, but they will keep themselves cool for quite a while without human interaction. I'd imagine in this scenario  you would start seeing serious issues at nuclear power plants sometime beyond the week mark once plants started running out of diesel fuel. And even then the decay heat would be pretty low and it would take a while after before you started seeing fuel damage. My guess is most plants would eventually end up with some fuel damage without long term cooling, but it likely would be far less than something like fukushima. There would likely be some elevated doses around the plant, but I would imagine they wouldn't be life threatening. Doses would be worse if there were a hydrogen explosion inside containment like fukushima unit 2, and there would definitely be some hydrogen generation once fuel gets exposed, though as long as containment stays intact, there shouldn't be any explosion. I'd hazard a guess that the end result would suck, but pretty much all nuclear material would remain on site and environmental damage would be minimal. </p>
<p>As for spent fuel in the spent fuel pools, eventually all the water would boil away without any makeup or cooling, but pretty much all but the most recently discharged fuel would be cool enough to not melt via air cooling. Even in fukushima, the spent fuel pools remained intact, though there was some boil off and a lot of debris in the pools. Some of the hottest spent fuel might experience damage and long term violate spent fuel pool integrity, though radioactive material would remain on-site, and the bulk of the radiation would be directed up from the spent fuel pool. Long term I wouldn't expect any major environmental damage. </p>
<p>Everything above of course doesn't look very long term, where the plant eventually collapses and nuclear material leeches into the environment, but we would be talking likely decades before ant plant experienced major structural issues. The real take away is the longer power and therefore cooling to the environment lasts after shutdown, the less bad the end result is. For fukushima they had less than an hour of power after shutdown. In this situation you are looking at likely a week or 2 before power is lost. Even after, core cooling would remain for a while until all that water boiled away. Long term you would still see core damage and elevated doses around the site, but the magnitude would be far less than fukushima. But you are also talking about all 400+ nuclear reactors having the same issue simultaneously, so the end result would be multiplied by that number. </p>
<p>Source: former reactor engineer, current nuclear plant operator in training. </p>
<p>Edit: HiddenCamper is more correct. While the plant would still have power for quite a while, containment cooling is not automated and therefore containment would eventually overheat and cause system failures well before the 7 day mark. Were there an operator available to put suppression pool cooling in service, the plant could feasibly keep the core cooled automatically for quite a while as I said above, though I am assuming nothing breaks after running continuously for days and days. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>When he answered, he mentioned that anything running on electricity won't last more than a day (if running from a nuclear power plant).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“Hunger” is actually, loosely, a few different things.</p>
<p>Your body has structures that can track and maintain a natural circadian rhythm, not only involving when you sleep or wake up, but also when your brain is active, when to raise or lower your body temperature, and when you are eating or resting.</p>
<p>Your body learns to estimate the time and amount of certain food that comes into your body, and appropriately releases hormones like insulin to deal with this intake of food.</p>
<p>When you tend to shock your body with energy-dense food every lunchtime, your body will release large amounts of insulin around that time every day. This large amount of insulin causes your blood sugar to quickly leave the bloodstream, as well as trigger other food-digestion-preparation things in the digestive system.</p>
<p>The experience of “hunger” you describe is when your body starts doing this food-anticipation thing, but the food is nowhere to be found. In this situation, you can experience hypoglycemia (really low levels of blood sugar, or low levels of absorbable blood sugar) which can cause the nausea.</p>
<p>Arguably, hypoglycemia to the point of nausea isn’t “normal”.
If you eat a more balanced diet and significantly less sugary stuff on a regular basis, you body will learn to not overdo the insulin. And you should experience a normal craving for food, rather than weakness and nausea. That’s ideally speaking, anyway. Different people’s bodies can have different quirks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A different perspective:  you have two brains.  One is in your head.  The other is mixed in with your gut, end-to-end.  Both are connected to each other.</p>
<p>Eating is critical enough to your survival that when you don't have enough food, it's critical that eating be a priority above all other thing.  So it's like having both flashing lights and a loud alarm.  </p>
<p>The criticality is linked to the reason you have two brains - <strong>the gut brain actually came first, evolution-wise, because simple animals could do without a &quot;head brain&quot; but not without a &quot;gut brain&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>So nausea is the gut-brain equivalent of pain associated with hunger.  The head-brain version you are conscious of, as a human, is the tacked-on after-thought version that evolved from having a gut-brain first.</p>
<p>This dichotomy probably has something to do with eating disorders.   It's also related to other head-gut experiences as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Gut-feelings&quot; are when a deep, emotional reptilian brain sense kicks in, and that's the part most directly connected to your gut-brain so you get queazy.  </p>
<p>&quot;Getting Butterflies&quot; when you fall in love is something you feel in your stomach and gut.  Again, the part of your head-brain involved in emotions is most directly connected to your gut-brain, so you feel it there as well.</p>
<p>This also has medical implications - you have the same neurotransmitter receptors in your head-brain and gut-brain, so often when you take a medicine for your head, you have side-effects in your gut.  And vice versa.</p>
<p>There is also evidence now that your bacterial friends in your gut can affect your health rather profoundly.  It's also very likely that includes mental health indirectly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
