		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I should begin with the disclaimer that I'm not an expert in the subject. That being said, I do have a very strong interest in geopolitics and can hopefully provide a half-decent answer until someone better educated comes along. Of the top of my head, I can think of three potential reasons for why Oman is relatively stable compared to other Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<p>First, most Muslim states (in the Middle East and elsewhere) are either predominately Shia or Sunni. Oman is the one exception to this, as it is primarily Ibadi. As such, it has largely stayed out of Shia-Sunni conflicts.</p>
<p>Second, it has a relatively diverse economy, which means that it is more stable than if it was solely based on oil. You can also see this is the UAE (particularly in Dubai) and other areas of MENA with a diversified economy.</p>
<p>Third, I think that your original premise is based on a flawed assumption. You said that it's in the middle of chaos, but it isn't. Oman borders 3 other states: KSA, Yemen, and the UAE. Of these, Yemen is the only one that is currently undergoing significant strife. Compared to other parts of the Arab world (Somalia, Palestine, Iraq), the Gulf States (with the exception of Iraq) are relatively stable and prosperous.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also not an Oman expert, but I have a reasonable grasp of Middle Eastern geopolitics. </p>
<p>/u/entropydecreaser has made some good points: Oman's economy is relatively stable and its geographic position is advantageous- away from major lines of conflict in the region. It is a long way from one end of the Arabian Peninsula to the other, and Oman have no reason to get themselves too closely involved with what is happening over a thousand miles northwest. Oman is also tucked away behind the 'empty quarter', the largest sand desert in the world, which makes external interference, particularly military action, extremely difficult. </p>
<p>I would say that the major factor, though (in my opinion) is the fact that Oman has existed as an entity for centuries. Almost no ME states preexist the 20th century and even those which can claim to, such as Egypt or arguably Iran, have been shaped by colonialism and revolution over the past hundred years or so. It is in stark contrast, therefore, that Oman have not only been free of colonial domination for over 250 years, but at one point had a sizeable empire of their own.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Oman has been entirely free of conflict or upheaval (it has not), but it is a far more 'natural' state than those created by colonial powers in the Levant, and they have a degree of institutional continuity through the monarchy that is unmatched in the Middle East. This is in stark contrast to those states created by treaty in the early 20th century, which have been highly unstable since, and because of, their drawing on the map. </p>
<p>Obviously I may be corrected my someone with more expertise, but that would be my take on the question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants move all of the time even if it's not to face the sun. I put a web cam on my indoor hydroponic garden for a few months to take a time lapse. It was scary how much plants like mint explode outwards and wrap around everything around it. The plants also move to a rhythm like a beating heart, rising up, and relaxing down at regular intervals in time with day and night cycles of the lamps. </p>
<p>The way that plants move is actually kind of cool. They use hydraulics! An increase in pressure forces movement over time much like squeezing a tube of toothpaste causes it to move. Not all plants follow the sun exactly but some do orient themselves east or west in order to maximize their exposure throughout the day. Other plants are shade loving and avoid direct sunlight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was playing some catch the other day with a friend of mine. He would run off down the field, and I would throw the ball, and 90% of the time it was an accurate throw to him. The other 10% was due to wind difference, so I would adjust the throw and make it to him. All of that is done automatically in our brains, and it works pretty fast. </p>
<p>Now, why is it that when we see the same situation, but on paper, it takes time to calculate all of that information. Is it because our brains see the actual numbers compared to real world events that are happening right there? Or shouldn't our brain be able to pick that information and automatically translate it, as if it were happening right there? </p>
<p>Edit: fixed wording. But man, this blew up, and got a lot of great responses for this. Initially had it marked as physics, but I see it got changed to psychology. Very interesting. Thanks for all that took time, and made the explanation better for me! </p></div></div>

<a href="http://www.livescience.com/3445-baseball-players-catch-fly-balls.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/3445-baseball-players-catch-fly-balls.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Physicist Seville Chapman proposed a model to explain how players manage the path of a fly ball so that  they arrive to intercept it at just the right time. His theory, called Optical Acceleration Cancellation (OAC), used the acceleration of the ball through the vision field as a guide for player movement.</p>
<p>As a fielder watches the ball rise, he moves either forward or backwards so that the ball moves at a constant speed through his field of vision. If he moves too far forward, the ball will rise faster and may eventually fly over his head. If he takes too many steps back, the ball will appear to rise slower and will drop in front of him. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly what you were asking about, but it does show what kind of mechanisms are at work, which we are quite unaware of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here focus on the fact that most of the free porn out there are either samplers or low quality amateur work. However, the proliferation of these tube sites with an indigestible mountain of freely available porn points towards other factors as well.</p>
<p>Why doesn't the porn industry crack down on copyright issues as hard as Hollywood? To get to the root of this issue, we have to think about the role of a movie/film versus that of porn.</p>
<p>Let's first agree that both pornos and blockbuster films are scarce goods. They are limited, and they have some value to consumers. The point I want to make is that porn is commoditized; movies are not. What I mean here is that, for an average consumer of porn, it doesn't matter if they are going to watch Lusty Milfs 5 or Busty Soccer Moms 7; they're just going to pick the one that's most easily available to them. On the other hand, movie goers definitely care if they are watching Star Wars versus Star Trek.</p>
<p>There a variety of reasons for this, but the net result is the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pornos are commodities, and they are priced at commodity prices. Within a certain porn genre, all else being equal, one film is more or less indistinguishable from another.</li>
<li>Movies are hard to commoditize. Even within the same genre, you'll be hard-pressed to convince someone bent on watching the new Star Wars movie to settle for Star Trek, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are certain exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fans of a certain porn actor/actress will have a stickier (heh) preference towards certain films, and to them, they are not indistinguishable from other films.</li>
<li>Certain genres of movie films are nearly commoditized. For example, people who go for one rom-com probably wouldn't mind if they were told that they had to settle for another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, there are two sets of dynamics we need to look at. First, we need to discuss what the outcome of this type of market is; next, we need to discuss why this is the way things are.</p>
<h3>So what if Porn is a commodity good?</h3>
<p>Well, since porn (especially within a specific genre) is more or less indistinguishable from other porn, they undergo heavy competition. In particular, the competitive nature of the market tend to push their price down towards a nearly-optimal commodity price. That is, porn in its current form tend to be lowly-valued and directly selling porn (in the current state of affairs) is a low-margin affair. This can be seen not only by the proliferation of cheap studio access passes ($1 a month specials are pushing it these days), but also by the fact that most of the porn that are consumed costs absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>Therefore, since porn is valued so cheaply, it's actually very inefficient to sell them directly. Instead, porn producers and distributors have realized that selling the attention of users of their pages to interested advertisers actually captures higher revenues. This is why you see some of the most clever ad-blocker workarounds on these porn sites; that's where they get most of their revenues from, even the more reputable sites.</p>
<p>In addition, because producing porn is a low-margin affair itself, there's really no reason to spend a lot of money towards a high-production film. As a result, the porno landscape is dominated by near-amateur level work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because block-buster films cannot be commoditized, they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are much pricier, and they</li>
<li>Tend to be higher production value, because in order to price their films at a higher price, they need to give some justification that their goods are higher quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, companies like Hulu and Netflix are trying to create revenue by commoditizing the movie/film sector, so our perceptions may change in the future. Additionally, porn wasn't always a commodity. When distribution cost (the problem of getting a porn film to the hands of a consumer) was a significant bottle-neck, they couldn't be sold at a commodity price because their supply was much more limited than today.</p>
<h3>So what changed?</h3>
<p>The internet. Let's look at the major way in which porn and films were consumed before the rise of the internet. Blockbuster movies were usually viewed in a movie theater; porn usually in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>Once internet speed and bandwidth were fast/large enough, it was able to &quot;commoditize&quot; (here, improve the efficiency, hence lowering the price of) the distribution of movies to your home. Porn was hit hard by this innovation, but movies were still more or less something that you still had to watch in theater.</p>
<p>Because the porn industry was suddenly able to streamline their supply-chain, porn-sites started popping up. This lowered the barrier of entry into the porn industry, because now you don't have to negotiate deals with brick-n-mortar Adult XXX Videomax store fronts. You just need a website.</p>
<p>With the main distribution bottle-neck solved, content started to flood the internet. As a result of the increase of the supply, its price dropped significantly. As a result, the internet commoditized porn and made it a relatively cheap (discounting opportunity cost) venture to go into.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyways, other digitizable goods that were/are commoditized by the internet includes video games, music, news, journals, and to a certain extent, movies and television shows. For each one of these goods, you'll often find a similar content pathway. You have way more green-lit Steam games than what has been stocked at Game Stop; Spotify has more music than you can fit on an iPod; etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pornhub, youporn, redtube, and most other main porn websites are all owned by the same company, MindGeek, that owns major porn production cimpanies such as Babes, Brazzers, etc. It is basically a monopoly of producers and distributors, which means that the movies are uploaded directly as they are produced, since the views end up as revenue for the company either way.</p>
<p>Many others producers also upload incomplete videos to these websites in hopes of attracting premium customers. it's the equivalent of handing out movie trailers to cinemas, but the trailers themselves are usually enough to satisfy most viewers.</p>
<p>Since they can't stream in cinemas and the rental industry doesn't pay ad well, the production of online videos is prominent in the industry; that also makes it easier to pirate, and it is difficult to win lawsuits against a large company such as mindgeek so I doubt people would try. You also have a steady production of free videos like amateur porn.</p>
<p>You can find many regular movies online for free, it's just that they are lower quality or not protected by copyright. The movies that are nkt readily available are the ones produced by huge distributors, who make their money off official sales in cinema and dvd stores. </p>
<p>Also, With porn, the demand for higher quality is lower, and the production process is easier (budget and time wise) so there are a lot more movies being produced on a regular basis. You could probably make 100 movies in the time it takes to plan out and film a blockbuster, no bureaucracy to stop the process in its tracks, and the budget is minimal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that most of the free porn out there is either amateur porn (which costs almost nothing to make), free samples from a pay site, or pirated.</p>
<p>Think about it this way. Literally anyone with a camera can make a serviceable porno for literally or almost nothing, but even a half-decent independent movie takes at least a couple hundred thousand dollars to make. Usually millions.</p>
<p>So naturally, there are going to be more porno movies than regular movies to begin with.</p>
<p>Since it costs so much less to make, you could potentially fill an ad-supported site with thousands of user-made videos, free samples from pay sites, or straight-up pirated porn (especially on sites that allow user uploads, since you get plausible deniability) for little or no cost, and then collect all that sweet ad revenue.</p>
<p>To do that with a movie site, you'd have to either pay to make the movie, or pay to license the movie. Which could cost you more than it costs to upload thousands of amateur porno clips. But you'd still only have one movie! So it would be very hard to do it 100% on ad revenue. Since a movie is much longer (two hours +) than a typical porn clip (5-20 minutes), your bandwidth costs per user are also much higher. Especially if, you know, they finish browsing early.</p>
<p>It's also the reason why YouTube is FULL of people talking about their opinions into their webcams but only has a handful of properly free ad-supported (not pirated) movies. Any moron with a mic and a camera can become a YouTuber, but making even a shitty movie requires a budget and at least basic film-making skills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the problem is you are comparing Pornhub with Hollywood when you should be comparing Pornhub with youtube. </p>
<p>Youtube is full of free content made by people who just wanted to make something and put it out there or to rake in a little revenue from ads / merchandise / exposure. It's also a dumping ground of stuff that nobody owns the rights to anymore (or the people who do don't care to challenge anyone for it). </p>
<p>Porn sites are the same thing: amatuer videos made by people who just wanted to make something, or companies uploading shortened clips of their professional stuff for exposure and advertising reasons. When you see professional stuff on these sites it's either a clip of a much larger video uploaded for the reasons I stated before, a movie made by a company that doesn't exist anymore (porn companies come and go like the tides) or doesn't have the resources to constantly challenge pirate uploads, or a pirate upload nobody has caught yet (many porn sites aren't as helpful with fulfilling take-down requests as youtube is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hope this helps a little but I watched an interview with this crazy porn recruiter once. The man claimed to be Ron Jeremy's cousin and I feel that might have been one of his trust-inducing lines though he did look a bit like Jeremy. His 'job' was waiting at the Hollywood bus station and recruiting witless new 'actresses' into the porn business.</p>
<p>Anyways, he explained porn in such ELI5 ways. He simply explained that in fact they are totally aware that 99% of porn viewers actually do not care about the topic, theme, fetish (or no fetish). Typical guy would just as easily watch &quot;Spanking Lesbians part 76&quot; as he'd watch 'Shaved Juggs' <em>and</em> that they (porn makers) they know full well 99% will pay the lowest price or watch free.. whatever is quickly available. </p>
<p>But wait.. see, he explains, the money is totally in that tiny 1% fraction. All the money. 99% of the cash comes from a tiny little group. Obsessed, niche-market infatuated 'fetish' kink people. </p>
<p>So what they do is make &quot;Lactating Jugs parts 1-110&quot; because they will barely make a penny from the 99% of viewers who are totally satisfied seeing ANY Jugs. They are a 'wash', a neutral, nothing either way.</p>
<p>BUT holy hell.. whoever is the 1% (or.0001%) he explains are psychofans. Yes, they will watch the free episodes but more importantly if they are who signs up for the mailing lists, notifications of new episodes, the exclusive 'lactating jugs VIP memberships' and they will drive across LA in rush hour to be the very first to stand in line paying $59.99 for the new Blu-Ray release of Lac-Jugs 111. Oh and hoarding 110 previous DVDs and Blu-rays like they were made of gold. </p>
<p>In a real way, they actually want to make 99% of their movies available for free HOPING that big free net catches 1% who will then gladly pay a lot of money for the 1% of movies they hold back as pay-only for a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes dust will get into your respiratory tract all the time.  Luckily, in the lining of your trachea (the tube that links from your throat to your lungs) the cells there produce a lot of mucus.  The cells also have a bunch of little motorized hairs called <strong>cilia</strong> that push that layer of mucus upwards.  Much of the dust that gets into your respiratory tract gets stuck on the mucus, and the cells' cilia will push that mucus upward, and upon swallowing that dust-clogged mucus goes into your tummy where it's digested.  This is called the <strong>mucociliary escalator.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the dust will get deeper into your lungs past the mucociliary escalator, but there are white blood cells deep down in there that will gobble up and destroy much of that foreign material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all the time actually. As long as the lungs can expel the irritants it's not a problem. When you get sick and cough up nasty stuff it's kind of the debris left over from the battlefield. Your body attacks and kills the invaders which may be bacteria, fungus, or virus, and all the damaged junk gets expelled through coughing or re-absorbed.</p>
<p>When you get an irritant in your lungs it causes the body to respond by producing more mucus which helps collect and pull the junk out where it can be coughed up. </p>
<p>There are substances which can get into your lungs though and the body cannot expel them, and instead they can stick around for years and decades damaging the lungs and resulting in scar tissue and lung damage. Asbestos is a really good example of that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a really interesting question. I'm not sure if I know the ultimate answer, but I can make an educated guess.</p>
<p>When it comes to our senses, vision and, to a lesser extend, hearing are pretty dominant. What this means is that when we process the world around us, we rely much more on vision and hearing to know what's going on around us than, say, taste. This also means our mind's representations of the world is much more in terms of vision and sound and not so much in terms of taste.</p>
<p>However, our brains aren't passively registering the world, but are rather busy predicting what's going to happen next as well. What's even more remarkable is that they are able to represent, or imagine, things that aren't even there at the moment. Those predictions are the most useful if we make them in the same way we register the world and, as said above, we mainly register the world visually and auditory. (This is not entirely true, we are also really good in senses like proprioception that play a major role in our action control.)</p>
<p>This means that a big part of our brain is good at representing visual and auditory stuff and we have few parts that are very good at representing taste stuff. That's why it's harder to imagine taste or smell, because we just have fewer brain regions that are actually specialized in that.</p>
<p>Edit: You might also say vision and hearing are dominant because of all the extra processing power we have for it. Why it actually evolved this way is another topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Basically, some people are more visual, some people are more into sounds and melodies and rhythm, some about space and dimensions and some about smells and tastes.</p>
<p>Try to cook more, smell to things. Smell to spices before you add them to food, smell to food before you eat it. Try to identify various smells and tastes. In time, you would be able to combine tastes and predict which could be nice together, almost feel the combined taste.</p>
<p>Our world is quite visual. You are forced to remember images all the time. With music readily accessible everywhere, you might be well trained in music recognition and remember (and recreate from memory, such as whistling or humming) various patterns. But you are not forced to remember and recreate smells, if you are not working in food industry or you are not utilizing your smell in other way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

However the majority of the dust in most households is not dust at all, it's dander which is a collection of dead skin cells, hair, and the stuff our bodies cast off through daily activities. </p>
<p>Your skin is constantly growing and old dead cells are shed every time we move, scratch, touch something, etc. The dead cells are very small and float freely in air currents until settling on your un-used copy of Battlefield Earth. </p>
<p>The dust outside and in the wind is usually from dirt and sand but what is dirt exactly? What is clay is another good question and the answer is metals, silicates, and minerals. Much of the clay you find outdoors is made up of things like  aluminum compounds and silica. Sand is usually made up of ground up minerals. And of course soil is dirt that also contains organic matter like decaying plant and insect matter, compost, manure, etc. </p>
<p>When  an area has a good covering of plants and dense root systems and plant coverage dust is kept to a minimum because the roots of all those plants act like a net that holds the top soil together. When land is cleared though it exposes the top soil to the elements and the wind can carry it for thousands of miles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any content that Netflix licenses/purchases from a third party, those shows follow industry standards of 23 min / half hour and 42 min / hour run times.  However, any show that Netflix funds and produces can vary in length.  They have no standard run times for their original series, so while shows can go up to the 30 min / 60 min limit, they allow the show the time it needs in order to complete the story.  This is why run times of Netflix shows can vary by 7-10 mins from episode to episode (on an hour show).</p>

<p>Edit: Whoa, I step out for a 30 minute meeting and this goes wild.  Yes, there are many levels of producer, but, fortunately for me, I am at the &quot;coffee-receiving&quot; level - for the record, I almost entirely get my own coffee.  I work on Netflix original documentary series, but also had a position on Master of None.  </p>
<p>Edit 2:  For clarity, I work in post-production, not development, so I'm not the source for pitch meetings, auditions, or in with the development team.  RIP Inbox.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mistake you're making is assuming there's an advantage to using up &quot;the full 30 minutes&quot;. Why is there an advantage to using a round number? Why use more time if you <em>don't need it</em>?      </p>
<p>One thing you might notice is times on Netflix shows can vary quite substantially. As an example, the latest episodes of House of Cards run from 42 to 57 minutes long. Traditional TV shows won't vary that wildly because each episode needs to fit snugly into the commercial slots. To illustrate, every recent episode of The Simpsons is either <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/episodes?season=28&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_28" target="_blank">21 or 22 minutes long</a>     </p>
<p>Since they don't have to weave in commercials, Netflix <em>wants</em> their creative staff to be free of formatting constraints. It gives the writers, directors and editors more freedom because they don't have to pad or cut scenes for set runtimes. They get to tell the story however they feel is best. Netflix feels this allows for higher quality programming.     </p>
<p>When you understand what they're going for, you see that &quot;using the full 30 minutes&quot; isn't more freedom - it's just a new time constraint, something they want to avoid.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While other have pointed out that actual original Netflix shows do often vary in length; it's also important to note there is some element of the production/post production systems that are already in place that influence the running time:</p>
<p>Shows have to be shot </p>
<ul>
<li>there are already models on how to budget for and shoot a 40-50 minute program including pages per day to hit in a typical 5 day schedule, union rules (so many unions are represented on a shooting set!) and facilities limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shows have to be edited </p>
<ul>
<li>again models on how to budget for editorial, online and color correction, sound editing and mixing already exist.  When you have varying running time for episodes far outside these existing workflows you often encounter overages or might even have trouble fitting you show into the workdays of your vendors (and again union rules that mandate professionals be booked on a daily or weekly basis that don't allow much wiggle to add a half day to finish that extra 12 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<p>So as much as it can vary; the whole production and post production world is largely ruled by scheduling and budgeting; and those are often based on numbers and workflows very much based on the typical commercial television running time ballpark so it can be a bit difficult to stray too far...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other reasons given, there's also the considerations of cost and form.</p>
<p>Increasing episode length by 50% is obviously more expensive than not doing that, and there's nothing saying that a longer episode is inherently better.  TV shows aren't hour or half hour long episodes cut down to 42 or 23 minutes, they're written to be that long and have been for a long time.  A lot of shows will keep being made that way because that's how they've been made for decades and the people making them aren't freshly hired out of college by Netflix, they've been in the business for years.</p>
<p>Oftentimes Netflix original shows will stray from exactly hitting TV time because they can, but they aren't going to dramatically change the episode length on a whim.</p>
<p>There's also a lot to be said for creating within limits.  Letting a creator go completely wild often ends in, well, the Star Wars prequels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From an outside point of view, we see that time is dilated and the astronaut is moving very slowly inside their spaceship. But we see the spaceship take a full year to reach its destination, and gets hit by all this radiation along the way.</p>
<p>From the astronaut's point of view, there is another effect - length contraction. From their point of view, the reason it only takes an hour to reach the destination is because the distance has shrunk down by a huge amount. So, from the astronaut's point of view, they still have to move through the same amount of &quot;stuff&quot; - interstellar gas, radiation, whatever - it's just that this &quot;stuff&quot; is packed really close together, and the astronaut hits it all really quickly.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not all that simple - you have to deal with redshift and all that - but it does often work out that length contraction and time dilation basically cancel out, and that can allow different reference frames to not contradict each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Radiation engineer here.</p>
<p>The entire premise of this is a bit flawed, in multiple ways, because it assumes the constancy of things that are in fact variable.</p>
<p>What radiation is, at its core, is moving particles. In outer space, this is mostly ultra-high-energy protons and gamma-rays.  Now, when you're going at almost light speed, you run into an effect where protons that are hitting you head-on are now hitting you with <em>much much</em> more energy, and those hitting you from behind are now being outrun.  Gamma-rays have a similar issue, but instead of changing speed so they'll be outrun (they travel constantly at c in all reference frames), they'll be blue-shifted and red-shifted.  Red-shifted enough, and those gamma-rays won't have enough energy to do anything to you. Blue-shifted enough, they're not going to give you way more dose than they would if you weren't moving so fast.</p>
<p>So &quot;cosmic radiation&quot; is not constant, and &quot;one hour's worth of cosmic radiation&quot; is not a meaningful unit.</p>
<p>Secondly, you assume that time is something that is absolutely comparable.  That it is either &quot;one year <em>or</em> one hour&quot;, and that it can't be &quot;one year <em>and</em> one hour&quot;.  Just because something is &quot;one year&quot; when looked at one way, in no way shape or form precludes it from being &quot;one hour&quot; when looked at another way.</p>
<p>So to answer your question--You get one hour (spaceship time) of cosmic radiation, but the cosmic radiation you get is not &quot;normal&quot; cosmic radiation, but heavily shifted in various directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Presuming the astronaut has been inside the ship for the duration of its travel, how does it make sense that his time would have been an hour and not a year? Time taken to travel a light year at c = one year. Where's the hours coming from? I understand time dilation with relation to speed/space, but this questions doesn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>HOW this works is a bit more interesting, your eye lens is flexible, (even though you might have thought it was hard in that cow eyeball you dissected in high school) and is able to change shape by consciously or unconsciously changing the muscles in your eye. A rounder lens is able to focus on closer objects, as seen <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GKYvQgW.jpg" target="_blank">here:</a> and a flatter lens is able to focus on things that are further away as seen <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sIVIL54.jpg" target="_blank">here:</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with the how. How this happens is that the lense in the eye is soft. It's shape and therefor its focal point (focus) can be changed by muscles in the eye. The more the lense is squeezed by these muscles the thicker and more convex it becomes, reducing the focal distance. </p>
<p>When looking at something, the brain judges the distance to the object you wanna focus on and adjusts the muscles around the lense to put that object into focus. The focus point has to be just right for this to work. If its too close OR too far away the image won't be sharp and vision will be blurry. </p>
<p>As for why vision sometimes goes blurry, there are lots of possible reasons, but I'll go over a few. One is simply tiredness, your brain is tired and can't quite controll its muscles. Your limbs feel heavy, you can't keep you eyelids from closing, this affects the muscles around your lense as well. </p>
<p>One other reason is you're under the effect of some kind of substance. This might be alcohol, medication or narcotics. It's really too general to get into to as every substance causes different reactions in the body. Some prevent the muscles from contracting correctly while others distrupt the brains vision centre (located in the back of the head).</p>
<p>Muscle fatigue might be the cause of blurriness. You've spent too long reading or staring at a monitor too close to your eyes. Just like most other muscles the ones around your lense can get tired, when they are it's harder to get them to do what you want. </p>
<p>Tears or water directly infront of the eye. This is a topic of how light bends in different materials and that question has been asked before, with people giving far better explenations than I every could.
