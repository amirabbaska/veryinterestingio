It's not like the landfill <em>enabled</em> you to build that. Unless it strengthened the foundation that otherwise wouldn't have supported the structure. But landfills involve digging which involves dislodging soil that's had thousands of years to compact tightly together. It is not obvious that tearing all that up and then filling it with waste will make it stronger than before.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's only sustainable if the trash turns into soil faster than we're putting more in the earth. If they can be reused that helps a lot too. Not an expert on this but I don't know, it still seems like such an inelegant solution that just runs the risk of contaminating all kinds of processes. Brainpower spent devising workarounds and harm mitigation seems better spent exploring methods that don't make the planet filthy from the ground up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While technically correct, &quot;proton mass measurement&quot; is a bit misleading. At this level of precision, the uncertainty of the relation between different mass units has to be considered. What they actually did is a comparison between the mass of a proton and the mass of C-12. The latter happens to be used in the definition of the atomic mass unit by a historical accident. Instead of a proton mass measurement, you could also call it a better calibration of the atomic mass unit. If the measurement can be repeated, and the deviation and smaller uncertainty turns out to be accurate, then it will make the uncertainty in unit conversions smaller. Nice to have for precision measurements. It won't change how we understand the universe. Measurements that can do that (e. g. antiproton to proton mass ratio) have larger uncertainties from elsewhere (e. g. the antiproton mass), they just rely on very accurate units to avoid uncertainties from that side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine putting 22 oranges into your cart, then put orange juice next to that.  Notice how much space each takes up?  If you weighed them, the oranges would weigh more (because of skin and other things that are removed when juicing).  The same thing goes for shipping!  That's why &quot;flat packed furniture,&quot; like what's sold at Walmart and Ikea, is so much cheaper than pre-built furniture stores.  It's also why a package of dehydrated or condensced food costs much less.  Like dry beans vs canned beans.  Or Gatorade powder vs Gatorade Bottles. </p>
<p>When shipping, 2 things matter: Size and Weight.  Decrease either of these, and the costs go down.  If you imagine a semi-truck, one full of packing peanuts and one full of bricks, which costs less gas to move?  The one full of packing peanuts.  However, it still costs money to move the semi truck full of packing peanuts. </p>
<p>The other thing to know is that not all Produce is created equal.  The produce that shows up at the grocery store is often larger and is <em>much better looking</em> than the produce used to make refined goods like juice.  This means that if you used pretty, large oranges, you might use less than the 22 needed, and they'd all look pretty, but only the juice-maker knows that. </p>
<p>If you can find a local place that sells &quot;ugly&quot; produce (that tastes the same), you will save a lot of money.  The reason for this is that you essentially pay for all the ugly food that is thrown away.  <a href="https://youtu.be/i8xwLWb0lLY?t=470" target="_blank">John Oliver did a piece on it.</a> The link takes you to the part showing a field after they've gone through and picked everything.  This is also why baby carrots are a thing... baby carrots are the ugliest carrots trimmed into the &quot;baby&quot; shape! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>here's a tropicana &quot;pure premium&quot; orange juice tank farm. each tank holds one million gallons.

<p>not freshly squeezed, right? nope. pure premium, and other &quot;not from concentrate&quot; is a marketing <del>gimmick</del> scheme designed to get consumers to pay higher prices for possibly not so good juice. </p>

<p>edit: if you want fresh orange juice, look for a higher end market, and see their selection.  the best ones will be hpp, high pressure processed to kill germs, and preserve fresh flavor.  the second best ones will be pasteurized, but pasteurization involves heat, and that will cook the orange juice (Trader Joes is pasteurized).  cost maybe $7/half gallon to $9 in major american cities.  </p>
<p>edit: still interested in orange juice, but can't afford the more expensive fresh squeezed juice, yet don't want flavor packets in your orange juice? here's a list of brands that use/don't use them <a href="https://www.toxinless.com/orange-juice" target="_blank">https://www.toxinless.com/orange-juice</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There were also &quot;Grade B&quot; oranges which were perfectly fine to eat but couldn't be sold in America because they were &quot;ugly&quot;. I.e. Have slight marks or be differently coloured. These usually went to less economically developed countries. </p>

<p>The theoretical constraint on how strong a material can be is (surprise) a function of the speed of light. Since the force holding atoms together propagates at the speed of light you can very easily see that no matter what material you use, the rod MUST break before the end accelerates to the speed of light. If the rod doesn't break, then the material itself violates all of the rules of physics and it doesn't make any sense to describe what is happening at the tip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Nothing could move in the clockwise direction at all. This includes movements of the atoms making up the disk.  The edge of the disk would therefore appear to be a singularity to a stationary observer.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you have a straight rod at t=0. You apply a torque at the middle of the rod. In a rigid body, the rod would start to rotate according to the moment of inertia as t = ia. </p>
<p>But since rigid body only works in certain assumptions, like not being a significant fraction of the speed of light, instead of the rod rotating according to the total moment of inertia, the torque instead propagates out from the center to the ends at the speed of sound in whatever material you pick. </p>
<p>So at t=0.01 or something, you have a rod that is slightly twisted (with the distance d1 from the torque equal to v*.01, where v is the speed of sound of the material). At t=.02, the center is now twisted a little more and the distances from the torque to the new extent of the action being d2, the part of the rod from d1 to d2 will be less rotated than d0 to d1. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>If you carry this out you realize that your rod actually behaves a little like a spaghetti noodle floating in water. You twist the center, and the outside takes a while to catch up. Eventually you wrap it up in a spiral around the torque point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>They are also &quot;primed&quot; to react very quickly, very potently, and very specifically to certain pathogens. As you may infer, these 'resident' immune cell don't circulate as much, and thus don't give the same reaction if the pathogen is introduced elsewhere.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I was a grill cook in everything from pub to steak house and even a Grillardin in a fine dining restaurant.</p>
<p>Steak grills are sloped and higher at the top, lower at the bottom (this is adjustable). Then the cook adjusts the level of heat for each burner (anywhere from 2 to 6) so he has a range of heat levels, usually from right to left. They usually make the lower right corner the hottest and the upper left the coolest on average. There is some variation due to size of the gas outlets and how clean they are.</p>
<p>All steaks start on the right side for their initial sear then moved to an appropriate area when they get their first turn (what makes the diamond pattern) The more well done the steak the <strong><em>slower</em></strong> you cook it or <strong><em>it drys out</em></strong> (so many people and cooks don't know this). So well done are moved towards the left upper corner and are started soonest. Then you use the most well done steak of the order to take your timing for starting the other steaks from. </p>
<p>Most steaks (not blue rare) are turned when you first see the fluid start to appear on the surface. Let too much of it appear and it burns up when you flip the steak and you again end up with a dry steak. You can tell when a steak is done by pressing on it and <strong><em>should never cut it</em></strong> to check because it lets out the liquid. Cooking tightens the fibers so a well done has more resistance than a rare when you press on it. <a href="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/the_finger_test_to_check_the_doneness_of_meat/" target="_blank">This is how you learn how it feels like.</a> </p>
<p>After your second turn on the other side you keep checking its state and moving it on the grill so that all the steaks on the order start reaching the level you want together. Meat also needs a resting state to allow juices to redistribute and the longer it's been cooking the longer this needs to be. So well done often go to a warming rack or what I did, put it on top of a rarer cooking steak. When this is done the steak is pretty much no longer cooking and will stay at it's level from that point on unless it receives too much heat again (why most cooks <strong><em>hate</em></strong> heat lamps)</p>
<p>After that it's all about timing. Knowing how fast your grill is running because the more or less you have on the grill the more this changes. Noting which steak is which and sometimes substituting one steak for an order for anothers if necessary (no steak has a customer's name on it till it's plated). Knowing what else is with the order, and most importantly communicating with all the other cooks. Because depending on volume the grill cooks responsibility can range a lot. After that it's pure hustle and memory.</p>
<p>Most people don't know how hard being a good restaurant cook is. It's pretty much not worth what you make, that and the stress (has one of the highest incidents of substance abuse of any career) is why I quit doing it.</p>
<p>Edited to add: To give you an idea how much resting a steak helps with timing, there's been times, rare, but still times where I would have two steaks on top of a steak of the same order. Only ever did three a couple of times when I was swamped or had a big table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please bear in mind one fact: If I'm your grill cook, cooking 15 steaks (on average) to medium rare or medium, then I have a little give, don't I? Behold:</p>
<p>1.) 3 orders come in for medium well, 5 for medium, and 7 for medium rare. </p>
<p>2.) Grill 'em all.</p>
<p>3.) REST ALL THE STEAKS. See, this is where the wiggle room comes in. When you order your steak, a ticket rings into the kitchen telling me to start cooking the steak. Even with a well-done steak, if you have a salad or an appetizer, I've bought myself about 30 minutes to get that steak cooked and then rested (vital for proper cooking of meat). </p>
<p>4.) Oops. This one I THOUGHT was a medium was a little over (by &quot;poke testing&quot; it or using a cake tester - more info available upon request). I'll move that over to the &quot;medium well&quot; pile, and this one over here... well, I can use that as medium. Perfect! </p>
<p>5.) When it's time to bring your entrees to the table, the grill cook will flash the meat on a grill (getting the surface ripping hot - the meat inside should not have cooled terribly).</p>
<p>6.) Slice (possibly) and serve!</p>
<p>So in other words, what /u/gearhed said is totally spot on. But to add to his/her point, I get a little insurance, because I don't take the meat directly off the grill and put it on your plate, or else when the plate comes to your table, it is just a puddle of meat juice with a steak on top. Resting is key! And during that resting period, I can quality check and correct if needed.</p>
<p>Also, I can't emphasize this enough, cake testers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was doing it, organization, practice and minithins (pseudoephedrine). Different areas of the grill run different temps, and different doneness needs different heat and cook times. Well done goes on first at medium heat, everything down to medium is the same but timed out accordingly. Medium rare needs a good sear but not a lot of cooking and rare even more so, so you put those on late on hotter parts of the grill. You also keep a warming section just in case you mess up the timing a little bit and need to slow something down so the others can catch up. It's remarkably stressful during a rush, especially considering the $5.20/hr I was being paid to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a cook, I had to get to know the grill. There are different hot-spots and cooler spots on most grills. I would have 10-15 cuts of meat during busy periods. You really just have to keep track of each one. There are no shortcuts in this tbh. A few tricks I learned while managing everything..If blood is sweating from the top-uncooked side, its ready to flip for medium/well to well. In the trash for a rare/medium rare if that happened. For medium/rare use the hot spot of the grill to sear then move to a cooler section to cook a little more. Also, with a knife, cut a tiny slit in the thickest part an pry the meat open to check before plating. It really is a skill (I have mostly lost) that you acquire. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although I've not cooked in a steak house, I've managed a few, 2 large corporations, actually. Both these gentlemen are correct. The surface area of the grill has a variation of heat ranges, and the Grill Cook will continually rearrange the cuts depending upon: volume/size/mass, the type of cut ( leaner cooks faster, like a piece of shit filet vs a deliciously marbled Kansas City Strip), whether the cut has a bone in it or not, and the serving temperature, or doneness, requested by the guest.
In Chicago, I once had the pleasure of working with a gentleman who, on a busy Friday night, grilled over 500 different cuts, without a Single re-fire...( meaning: every steak, chop or filet he grilled, was served at the desired temperature to the guest that ordered it, no one said that their steak was over or under-cooked)
And, if you really value a correctly grilled cut of meat: give some Fucking Respect to the Cooks!! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also, the electronic ones are spring based, and can suffer somewhat from drift errors when their springs age. They need periodic calibration.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During cardio the heart increases its workload and all the body's other systems adjust to help support that endeavor.  The blood vessels dilate, the muscles do their best to help the blood along, hormone levels change, some non-critical processes stop or slow down to redirect blood flow to main channels.</p>
<p>It's all hands on deck to keep the heart cruising powerfully and efficiently.  Over time, those support processes will get even better at their job and further decrease the load on the heart.</p>
<p>When the heart is just resting at an elevated rate due to obesity none of that support structure is active.  Instead of a wide open pipe with pumping stations along the way, the heart is now trying to force blood through hundreds of miles of constricted tubing all by itself.  Over time that excessive workload damages the heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;paper-bag heart&quot; is a result of volume overload. So if there's too much blood in the heart, it stretches, similar to how a balloon would stretch if you filled it up with water. As it stretches, the walls get thinner, hence the paper bag comparison.
A common cause of this is long-standings high blood pressure. The heart has to push against the pressure in your blood vessels to pump blood around, but if this pressure is high all the time, the heart has to work harder to do so and often there's more blood than there should be left in the heart after each beat. The excess blood leftover starts to build up and eventually causes the walls of the heart to stretch.</p>
<p>Now when you exercise, your muscle need more oxygen, which is transported in your blood. It's thought that maybe your body gets your heart to beat faster/harder preemptively when you're going to exercise, but I don't think they have anything concrete about this yet. Anyway, when you use oxygen in the blood during exercise more of it goes back to the heart. There's a mechanism in the heart that makes it pump harder/faster in response to more blood coming back into it, so obviously your heart now does so. This action is similar to working your muscles during a session at the gym and it strengthens the muscle of your heart. Just to clarify that last bit, your heart can't actually get NEW muscle cells, to it strengthens by making the ones it already has bigger - in response to regular, intense exercise/physical activity. </p>
<p>Hopefully that makes sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart you saw was a 'failing heart'</p>
<p>Heart muscle stretch is like elastic. If you stretch it more, it will recoil more. However - stretch it too far and it snaps (or in the heart's case, becomes baggy).</p>
<p>Obesity will cause a persistently higher pressure in the blood's circulation. The heart needs to pump harder to get the same volume of blood into the vessels. This initially leads to the heart getting stronger to compensate. But over time, the resistance gets too high for too long and your heart's chambers stretch beyond the maximum.  The heart has passed it's maximum stretching point and 'de-compensates'.</p>
<p>On the other hand, exercise causes heart muscle to become more efficient and grow healthily. Cardio also improves your entire body's metabolic efficiency, meaning the heart doesn't need to pump as much blood to meet the body's requirements. </p>
<p>So exercise can cause the heart to become bigger (like a failing heart), but the increase in size is from growing muscle units and building the muscle, rather than stretching it out. As a result, exercise will improve efficiency of the pump by challenging it intermittently. Meanwhile, obesity will slowly increase the heart's workload in a persistent manner until it reaches breaking point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer one specific part and let the exercise people give you an explanation for the rest. </p>
<p>For the state of the heart, when you are obese, you are probably hypertensive. When you blood pressure is too high for years, you'll have one of two processes going on in your left ventricle (which pumps the blood through most of the body) and which one takes place is determined by a variety of factors.</p>
<p>Concentric hypertrophy is when the muscle thickens and the amount of fluid the ventricle can contain at once is reduced because the walls are thickening inward. This is very bad in its own way.</p>
<p>The other which is the case here, is eccentric hypertrophy. The increased pressure inside the ventricle keeps pushing on the walls and the ventricle enlarges and enlarges, like a balloon, getting thinner as it goes. </p>
<p>Both of these lead to heart failure in their own way</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the pressure drops, the equilibrium of CO2 dissolved in liquid should favor the atmosphere. That's the opposite of what you are experiencing.</p>
<p>When you moved, is it significantly hotter? Or are your drinks not staying as cool as they were? Higher temps would also make the CO2 favor the atmosphere over being in solution. </p>
<p>Another thing you might consider is that your sense of smell and taste vary, given humidity and altitude. I grew up in high altitude Albuquerque NM, and currently live in Austin TX, which is about sea level. I always feel like soda is &quot;crisper&quot; when I'm in Albuquerque, compared to when I'm in Austin. Same with water. I'd guess it probably has something to do with the difference in humidity, at least in my case.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> /u/fraghawk points out that it may be mineral/contamination from water. If you get soda from fountains or use ice, this may be the difference as well. There is a limited amount of stuff you can dissolve in water, so if there are a lot of minerals in the water, it can make the CO2 less soluble as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law</a></p>
<p>When you open a carbonated beverage it starts to come back to equilibrium, that's why there are bubbles.
Increasing the atmospheric pressure will increase the amount of a gas that will dissolve, decreasing the rate that bubbles form. Decreasing the temperature will also increase the amount of a gas that will dissolve.</p>
<p>This is how carbonated beverages are made, the beverage is passed through an atmosphere of pure CO2 under pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the air pressure things been touched on already by the top comment, wanted to explore another avenue. While pressure might be higher at lower altitudes and theoretically your soda should take longer to go flat, another factor to consider is temperature! For gasses, the solubility actually decreases at higher temperatures! So another thing you might want to look at is purely if where are living now is generally warmer than where you were before. Maybe you are comparing your sodas summer fizz vs your usual winter fizz. Just a thought :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Even a couple grams in bottle weight (given the same shape bottle) will have a strong impact to CO2 retention, (and big cost savings for packaging)</p>
<p>Ask a friend in your old area to weigh an empty bottle and compare with the new area, bottle shape/volume has to be the same though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

He shook up a can of soda while inhabiting a pressurized chamber on the ocean floor. He approximated the pressure as 2.5 atmospheres. After shaking the can of soda, it did not overflow its can upon opening. The ambient pressure prevented the soda from fizzing vigorously after being violently agitated.</p>
