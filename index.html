		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way the new ad system works is, a person at YouTubereviews the video some time after upload and detirmines its &quot;friendliness&quot; and how suitable it is for advertisers, so they can be safe the video isn't showing on innapropriate content. The issue is, people have found that saying the word &quot;fuck&quot; once, or talking about sensitive topics once throughout a video, gets them not demonetised, but &quot;unsafe&quot;. What this means is that the YouTuber is not told why they lost monitisation, and even when they lose monetisation. The majority of larger Youtubers who are vocal about this issue often create &quot;questionable content&quot; and as such do not loose all income, but earn sometimes 100x less. This all began when The Wall Street Journal reported that ads were showing on white supremacist's videos(which turned out to be false) and advertisers became scared of a backlash from this and pulled their ads from youtube. YouTube has really been trying to recover :/

<p>Ad's were showing up on videos containing hate speech.</p>
<p>Advertisers pulled $1.4 billion of funding from Google.</p>
<p>Google owns YouTube. </p>
<p>Google has $1.4 billion less to pay professional YouTuber's.</p>
<p>Google enacted strict and incredibly restrictive content classifications on what now counts as advertiser friendly content. </p>
<p>Many professional YouTuber's now fall outside those guidelines so they cannot monetize their videos, meaning they can no longer afford to create content.</p>
<p>Those who do fall under the umbrella of advertiser friendly content are now seeing 1/5th of the money they did before advertisers backed away from google en mass. This means channels that employed multiple people to upload daily content can no longer afford to do so. </p>
<p>YouTube is no longer a source of sustainable income, meaning we have less quality content and less active YouTubers. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of companies were not liking their ads being attributed to very controversial topics. Such as violence, sex, drugs... so on.</p>
<p>So they decided to boycott Youtube of all ads until they provided a more robust way of the companies to decide what kind of content they would have their ads put on.</p>
<p>The result was that when a business buys ad space on youtube now, they have a bunch of criteria boxes they can tick or leave empty, signifying what they are okay with and not. </p>
<p>Meaning the business has more power over the kind of exposure they are having.</p>
<p>There is also a &quot;demonetising&quot; process. Where and by if a video gets a significant number of views and reports for being controversial, it can have an amber dollar sign placed on the uploaders view of the video. Showing that no ad money can be earned on it. Unfortunately there isn't much explanation given with this, and so they are left in a guessing game as to what made them &quot;ad-hostile&quot; many people like Philip Defranco have spoke out about this and complained to Youtube, with Phil explaining he's just giving the news, he's specifically trying to facilitate a discussion, asking his channel to explain their thoughts in the comment section. </p>
<p>When he was told that the reason for one of his recent videos was demonetised because it spoke about the recent London Bridge attack, he pointed out the hypocrisy that established media channels like BBC had videos showing the graphic pictures (which he didn't) and yet they were showing ads before the clip. Asking why that channel can upload and monotize content, that he couldn't. Personally I think it's because those other videos didn't have anywhere near his exposure, so less reports. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with embryology (how the embryo develops into a human).
An embryo starts out as a flat disc with 3 layers of cells and then &quot;folds&quot; in on itself (imagine wrapping a burrito).</p>
<p>The innermost layer forms a tube, which will develop into the internal organs, and the outermost layer forms your skeleton, bones and connective tissues (pretty much everything that isn't your organs)</p>
<p>The outer layer develops symmetrically about the midline. 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 arms, 2 legs. Interestingly, your brain is also symmetrical about the midline (although the right and left brain do have different functions)</p>
<p>As the inner layer of cells (the tube) it becomes squashed against the walls of the body cavity. This causes the tube to twist and bend as it develops. Eventually different parts of the tube differentiate into different organs. The lungs, liver kidneys and spleen branch off the midline. The gut does a whole bunch of Gymnastics. Interestingly the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot; of this tube (the mouth and anus) ARE symmetrical.</p>
<p>The heart is a good example of this. It starts out as a symmetrical tube, but bends and folds as it develops, ending up in the 4 chambered configuration of a mature heart.</p>
<p>The reason the outermost layers are bot symmetrical is partly because they are not space restricted like the internal organs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated, speaking as a physician for the last 45 years and a field biologist for 55.</p>
<p>Essentially body structure is that based upon our worm ancestors, which are ancestral to most all animals, but a few primitive ones. This structure is repeating segments of structures starting with the head and then spreading downwards. We have spinal bones and nerve roots coming off each, just like worms, fish, amphibs, reptiles etc. Repeating segments is a VERY efficient way of building up a body, and this least energy rule is deeply imbedded in our embryology as well. Even the gill slits our embryos have are repeating units. Cells are repeating units ultimately, but are greatly differentiated.</p>
<p>This dfferentiation is the basis of embryology and how our bodies develop. Even our ribs are segmented. The sensory nerves and blood vessels and muscles are all segmented, too, just stretched out.</p>
<p>Why and how? It's a least energy series of configurations, largely. so, we're highly efficient in the way we are organized. Evolution is least energy driven, largely, which is the basis of why animals look like they do. Efficiency creates stability and longevity as well.</p>
<p>So, that's largely why each creature and plant look like what they do, a series of least energy solutions to environmental stressors and conditions. Very complex, but with LE we can easily navigate thru the complexities of most all of it, tho there is STILL a very great deal to learn.</p>
<p>Least Energy Rules.  SOA biology, very likely. Others are still trying to catch up.</p>
<p><a href="https://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/evolution-growth-development-a-deeper-understanding/" target="_blank">https://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/evolution-growth-development-a-deeper-understanding/</a></p>
<p>Hierarchical systems are found also throughout our bodies, as THOSE are least energy, too. The arteries, veins and nerves are created in neurovascular bundles, starting out large, centrally and then branching out, Hierarchies, the further out they go. And our bodies are hierachically arranged as well.</p>
<p>The body of trunk, arms, and legs are hierarchies. The trachea, then divides into two main bronchi, then into the bronchioles, also are hierarchically arranged down to the alveoli, and there the large pulmonary veins come in split up branching, then absorb the O2, lose some H20 and CO2, and then become the pulmonary arteries to the left ventricle of the heart. All branching hierarchies you see?  Even our understanding is an organization of our knowledge the hierarchies.</p>
<p>The key to this deep, universal structure can be seen as least energy as well (roads, electric power lines, gas lines, sewer and water systems, etc.) in the way water runs downhill, reaching lower and lower gravitation energies as it flows. least energy again. Springs become rivulets, those become creeks, then streams, the small rivers, and then the large river systems. All branching, all least energy forms, down to the meandering low land rivers, which meandering is least energy turbulent flow to the sea, where the deltas break up into the various channels (branches) as in the MS delta and the Nile Delta, once again, the roots are seen as the various deltoid branches of the great rivers.</p>
<p>It's all least energy driven, you see?</p>
<p>That's the Grand Design of our bodies, reflected in the natural hierarchies, and the vast hierarchies of our understandings, the dictionaries, telephone and city directories, the periodic table of elements, etc., etc., etc. All least energy forms, Just like our bodies!!</p>
<p>The Grand Designs of Least Energy rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're going to get a lot of long winded answers about this and it's very complex.</p>
<p>The reason is that we initially develop as a worm like thing with a gut tube running mouth to butt. This worm grows things on both sides which become the pairs of stuff like arms and legs. </p>
<p>The gut tube gets too long and lumpy so it gets stuffed back inside your body as a coiled mess to become your intestines and stomach. The stuff that grew off the gut tube gets put on one side of the other to become other things in your belly but they all started out as something right off the gut. </p>
<p>The worm has other tubes like the &quot;heart&quot; tube that kind of flops back on itself which is why your heart looks weird. All of the heart and artery weirdness are later improvements to deal with breathing, moving, crawling, and walking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your blood doesn't move in a circle, but a figure 8. The right side of your heart pumps blood to the lungs, where it can pick up oxygen. Then it goes back to the heart. The left side of the heart pumps the blood around the entire rest of your body, where it drops off oxygen, and then back to the heart.</p>
<p>The left side of your heart has to pump blood much farther than the right side. To do that, it has to have a lot more muscle, and that makes it bigger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Pliny the elder (and many others) noted that these shocks could be transferred, that objects when rubbed often attracted things, that so did magnets, and that the three phenomena were connected. Thales of Miletus came up with the theory that when Amber underwent friction, it became a lodestone, and if rubbed further produced lightning proving it was a magnetic force behind lightnng. Both though in terms of &quot;Gods&quot; or &quot;Souls&quot;, which in terms of philosophy might be better thought of as a &quot;motive force without a clear origin&quot;.</p>
<p>Which is a pretty solid conclusion if you discount Thales mixed up electric fields and magnetic ones. And, you know, thought everything was water (not as stupid as it sounds.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Is there some economic principle that will prevent this or has prevented it before?  Are we heading towards a future where nobody owns their home?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the answers, all of this is super fascinating and much of it is totally counterintuitive to me, so I'll try to do a tl;dr of things I learned from this thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the most part, it's as simple as supply and demand.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supply and demand are not simple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scale - there are too many houses, the market is too big.  You can kind of make this happen on an island or in a community with really onerous restrictions on building.  I now see building restrictions and regulations differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I assumed that housing demand is totally inelastic.  It isn't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My hypothetical situation involved too long of a time scale for good investors.  I assumed a small but guaranteed cash flow forever is the best outcome.  It's not.  I would be a bad investor.</p>

<li>Government at every level can play an important role in markets.</li>

<p>After the housing crash of 2009, they went out and bought up homes in different cities.  They put them all under the umbrella of a REIT (real estate investment trust) called &quot;Invitation Homes&quot; and then spun it out in an IPO a few years ago. $INVH is the stock symbol.</p>
<p>Here's the website:
<a href="http://www.invitationhomes.com/" target="_blank">http://www.invitationhomes.com/</a></p>
<p>You can see from the website, they own and rent out 50,000 homes in 13 different areas.  The company's total market cap is $6.7 billion.  </p>
<p>However, it's no where close to controlling a significant part of the housing supply.</p>
<p>To do what you are suggesting, you would need just one or two companies to control all the housing in a city.  I just don't see it happening.  Even if you get down to 10 companies controlling all the housing options, you'll have plenty of competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest reason is the idea of &quot;continually acquiring housing&quot; just doesn't work out.  There is almost $15 trillion in mortgage debt in the United States.  If we ignore all the equity in houses, this means to buy even 1/15th of the housing market would require $1 trillion.  Apple, one of if not the richest companies as far as cash on hand, has about $250 billion in the bank.  So if it went all in on buying houses, it could only buy 1/60th of the market.  Hardly enough to make a dent as far as locking up rent.  So for even 1/10th of the market to be locked up, you would be looking at 20 or 30 of the richest companies in the world investing all their capital in real estate.  Also, the scarcity driving up cost would also work against the companies attempting it.  You would start driving up the cost of purchasing houses but you would reach a point where you could not pass this on to consumers in the form of rent.</p>
<p>Secondary reasons it would never happen is there are fairly strong consumer protection laws for renters (owner covers most maintenance, difficult to evict non-payers, etc) which decrease how much of your rent income is actually profit, laws you would have to adhere to vary heavily by state and even city making it a compliance nightmare, long-term (30+ years) in many areas house values decrease relative to inflation reducing what you could charge for rent or make off of selling them, etc.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the simple answer is: They see motion better than shape or color and they can't see very far.</p>
<p>Humans can sense motion two ways: Something moves in relation to something else (like mountains in the distance far away move less than the tree you're driving past) and motion relative to the eye (if you look at the blue sky and a plane flies by, you can tell it's moving even with nothing in the background to compare to). So we can zoom right in on something and walk straight to it.</p>
<p>A lot of animals have eyes that are more sensitive to the second kind of motion sensing. When something moves in relation to their eyes, they see it 'better' than if it's standing still.</p>
<p>For an insect with compound eyes (hundreds of tiny eyes sitting on two eyeballs) each little eye sees a slightly different area of the whole vision.</p>
<p>As the insect flies past something, at first only the front eyes see it, then the side eyes, then the back eyes. The insect sees the object 'move' as different eyes see the object then don't see it.</p>
<p>As an insect flies forward, things in front are getting closer, but not changing much... not 'moving' in relation to the eyes. Things to the side, however, are whizzing by, so it sees them better. If a bee were to fly back and forth (left/right), things in front would be very clear and things on the side not so clear.</p>
<p>So if an insect flies forward in a zig-zag, it can see where it's going, what it's passing, and what's behind it pretty well. Here's an example:</p>
<p>Dogs follow a scent in the same way. Someone tested it by dragging a pheasant (with a light on it) through a field at night, then letting a dog (with a light on it) find it. He caught the whole thing on one piece of film:</p>
<p>It does a lot of zig-zagging.</p>
<p>Now.. why the random changes and even circles? Well, most insects can't see very far in the sense of focusing. The sun is VERY bright, so it's easily seen. A bee searching for flowers can sense big changes in light (Like white flowers next to dark green leaves) from a good distance, but they can't really tell if it's flowers or someone's tennis shoe lying in the yard. So insects do a LOT of searching around.. seemingly random movements, even circles, as they try to find something they want.</p>
<p>There are other things, too.. like the fact that they also follow smell.
Moths keep an eye on bright objects like candles and light-bulbs. If the moth keeps the moon on its right, then it'll fly in a relatively straight path as the moon is very far away. If it keeps a candle to its right, then as it flies past the candle it has to turn right to keep the angle the same. It keeps doing this and spirals right up to the flame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer, that is true among the majority of species: it's easier for a predator to catch and eat something that's moving in a straight line.</p>
<p>This is especially true in fish, as 99% of the time only the biggest fish swim in a straight line. Almost all smaller fish zig and zag out of instinct to not be predictable to predators, such as bigger fish or birds or whatever predators may be around.</p>
<p>Wild animals are all about energy in (food) and energy out (movement). Thus, most predators would prefer to ambush their prey while using minimal energy. It takes much more energy to chase down something that is moving erratically compared to intercepting something moving in a straight line. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Of course, it could also be that they have a microscopic brain and are just plain stupid. That would also explain why they are buzzing against a window pain for an hour, without noticing the open window right next to it...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is not one right answer - This phenomenon can be caused by various reason among which include genetic mutation as well. </p>
<p>That little pepper inside a bigger pepper is called an “internal proliferation.” Its form can vary from irregular and contorted to a near-perfect but sterile fruit.</p>
<p>A pepper growing inside a pepper is a type of parthenocarpy, which is the formation of fruits without fertilization or the formation of seeds. No one is sure what causes them, but temperature and nutrient levels have been ruled out.</p>
<p>Plant breeders, who consider this anomaly undesirable, keep an eye out for it when selecting for new cultivars, because the trait is inheritable.</p>
<p><em>More Details</em></p>
<p>During the normal development of bell peppers, seeds develop from fertilized structures or ovules. There are a multitude of ovules within the pepper which turn into tiny seeds that we discard before eating the fruit. When a pepper ovule gets a wild hair, it develops an internal proliferation, or carpelloid formation, which more resembles the parent pepper rather than a seed. </p>
<p>Normally, fruit forms if ovules have been fertilized and are developing into seeds. On occasion, a process called parthenocarpy occurs wherein the fruit forms with an absence of seeds. </p>
<p>There is some evidence that suggests there is a correlation between the parasitic pepper inside a pepper. Internal proliferations most often develop in the absence of fertilization when the carpelloid structure mimics the role of seeds resulting in parthenocarpic pepper growth. </p>
<p>Parthenocarpy is already responsible for seedless oranges and the lack of large, unpleasant seeds in bananas. Understanding its role in engendering parasitic peppers may end up creating seedless pepper varieties.</p>
<p>Whatever the exact cause, commercial growers consider this an undesirable trait and tend to select newer cultivars for cultivation. The pepper baby, or parasitic twin, is perfectly edible, however, so it’s almost like getting more bang for your buck. I suggest just eating the little pepper inside a pepper and continue to marvel at the strange mysteries of nature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How would Puerto Rico becoming a US State work? </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Puerto Rico would have a referendum and decide if they want to be a state. </p>
<p>Congress would vote if they want to start the statehood process for Puerto Rico</p>
<p>Congress and Puerto Rico's territorial congress would work together to create a state constitution.</p>
<p>Once that constitution is agreeable to both Congress and Puerto Rico a final vote in Congress happens to admit Puerto Rico as a state.</p>
<p>The President signs that bill and The US has 51 states</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would the powers that be of USA want this to happen?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest hurdle the powers that be would have is adding Puerto Rice adds 2 senators and 4 or 5 congressmen, along with the 6 or 7 electoral votes that go along with those.  This would concern one party if the other was more heavily represented in PR also this would diminish the voting power of smaller states especially the 3 vote states.  Puerto Rico would also probably be a net taker of federal taxes but that depends on a lot of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What would the impact be to the country as a whole to gain a new state? </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Day to day nothing really changes, Puerto Rico is basically a state now. There is free travel to and from the territory and free work access.  it would really only effect election time.  Taxes would increase for Puerto Ricans as they don't pay Federal Income Tax, but their tax burden may shift around to even that out, it depends on the exact way they are admitted as a state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

With training any person would be able to replicate smells inside their heads as well as any visual or auditory input. The main problem is cultural. Our western society does not value the sense of smell as highly as other senses: children are not taught to notice odors, our olfactory &quot;vocabulary&quot; is really limited, we are not used to rely on our sense of smell on a day-to-day basis etc.
The Jahai people in the Malayan peninsula is the best example I can remember of a culture that highly praises the sense of smell, having even specific vocabulary to describe odors: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771300214X" target="_blank">an article on Cognitive magazine about that</a>
edit: formatting.
edit 2: removing link to non-scientific article.
edit 3: changed &quot;remembering&quot; to &quot;replicating inside the head&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive scientist here. Keep in mind that the pathways involved in memory recall are very different depending on the type of information intended. Visual information is easily recalled and recognized due to it being objectively useful to remember (navigation, object recognition, food seeking, mating, etc), however certain sensory information is rarely required to be recalled in such a way so the pathways are much weaker/nonexistent. You are able to recognize a smell very easily, especially with other cues (if you smell something and see the name, you will easily state that the name is correct or not). Likewise, you can detect if that smell is beneficial or harmful very easily. However there is not much use in, and thus you don't get a lot of practice in, remembering the smell or taste itself. Humans do not use smell for object recognition (we prefer to rely on vision information for this, unlike other animals such as dogs) nor for communication (we rely on audiovisual information, unlike ants) and so these pathways, while able to exist (see blind case studies) do not get as much use and so recalling a smell or taste can be very difficult for us (without practice).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, thanks for all the replies! Secondly, I think, due to the poor phrasing of my question, that not everyone in this thread is talking about the same thing. What I meant to ask is why, and, as people have pointed out, I understand that this is a very subjective topic, I cannot recreate a scent or taste in my mind.  I can recognize the scent of a hotdog when I smell it, but when I'm hungry and sitting down in my bed, I can't just &quot;smell&quot; it like I can picture the shape and color of the hotdog. </p>
<p>People have attributed this to differences in culture and our dependence on hearing and sight for survival. I have also heard that the way we use a sensory system shapes the system itself. So, in theory, if I trained my scent or taste at a relatively young age such that I hadn't already developed a rich system, I would be able to recreate scents or tastes within my mind. </p>
<p>I find this all very interesting, so once again, thanks for all the amazing responses! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychology undergrad here: The big problem with your chemical senses (especially with smell) is that you can't properly assign a specific perception of an aroma to a certain stimulus. You know very well which porperties a stimulus for your eyes must have for you to perceive it as &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;red&quot;, but what properties does a molecule have to have for you to perceive it as &quot;cherry&quot; or even more difficult, which specific molecules do produce the aroma of &quot;coffee&quot;? Turns out that this is a very complex question, as many chemically very similar molecules are perceived as drastically different smells or vice versa. Taking this difficulty into account, a complex cognitive representation of the aroma stimulus in your memory seems very challenging. However, your smell is the only sense that doesn't connect with the Thalamus before reaching its corresponding cortex area and limbic structures like the Amygdala or the Hippocampus, therefore the emotional memory of an aroma is much more directly accessible, thus more intensive, and in some way that's compensating for a complex cognitive representation as your sight or hearing can offer. </p>
<p>Edit: Linda Buck and Richard Axel won the 2004 Nobelprize in Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering research on olfaction, you might want to take a look into this, as it uncovers the complexity of olfactory encoding:
<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2004/illpres/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2004/illpres/index.html</a></p>
<p>The idea of a certain cell assembly representing an aroma, thus creating an &quot;olfactory map&quot;, is further explored in this article:
<a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)00021-0?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867400000210%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank">http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)00021-0?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867400000210%3Fshowall%3Dtrue</a></p>
<p>All of this shows that neuronal representation of aromas is very complex and enigmatic, much more so than stimulus representation in the visual or auditory system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Obviously, because it's so cold, it doesn't really stay in the gas phase, but all of the water particles cool so quickly that they don't have time to form large water droplets, so they instead form a very fine mist, which also freezes into this thick white fog. It's like ice fog.</p>

<p>As others have already stated:
The fog from dry ice is actually caused by water vapor much like clouds are made from water vapor.  There are hundreds to millions of tiny water droplets suspended in the cloud that refract and bend the light as it passes through which is how the white color is created. </p>
<p>How it happens:
Water in the air condensing at the surface of the dry ice and then being carried away by convective currents. Imagine a cold glass that accumulates condensation. That's what's happening at the surface of the dry ice and why you don't need heat! But as the dry ice sublimates (changes from solid to gas) it creates a kind of CO2 gas current that blows the moisture away. This happens at a very small scale so the moisture droplets are incredibly  small. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
