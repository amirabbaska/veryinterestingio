<p>The wind driven pumps in old movies had many blades filling that disk. </p>
<p>Doesn't the 3 blade approach mean some useful wind is wasted between the blades? </p>
<p>The obvious answer is because this is the most efficient design, but how is that conclusion reached?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try my best to answer this because I studied this in school.</p>
<p>In theory, the most efficient turbine would be with one blade, because there are no other blades to create turbulance in front of the blade. However, in practice this creates an unbalanced rotor, so it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Then, the next most efficient blade system would be a two bladed system. However, these tend to vibrate on a third plane, losing lots of energy to friction. To overcome this, some turbines have a teetering hub, but that is more expensive to manufacture.</p>
<p>A three blades design allows for the most efficiency in practice. More blades would create more turbulance, so the costs of making more blades on a turbine would outweigh the benefits of the extra electricity being created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a lab at work (science centre) about this.</p>
<p>More blades gives more electricity, but with diminishing returns, and blades are expensive. Therefore, you want to find a number of blades where the return on one more blade is less than the increase in service cost.</p>
<p>The difference between two and three blades is large. The difference between the and four blades is slight.</p>
<p>One of the largest service costs is due to different wind speeds on different parts of the mill: wind speeds tend to vary in relation to distance off the ground squared. Turns out, with 3 blades the force on the mill from wind is more evenly distributed than with 2 or 4 blades. This reduces wear on the axle to a noticeable degree.</p>
<p>At the end of the day you get a bigger return building a larger mill than adding another blade when you have 3 blades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More blades generate more lift to spin the turbine. This means blades of lesser surface area can be used by increasing the number of blades. Having more than 3 blades can be less efficient in terms of manufacturing costs since the blades are often very large and expensive.  </p>
<p>You may also be interested in an efficiency limit on how much power a wind turbine can harvest from an airflow called the Betz Limit.  </p>
<p>Source:   <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/lifteq.html" target="_blank">NASA</a> has lots of very good pages on aerodynamics and such on their website. When looking at the lift equation here, keep in mind that the blade has much greater velocities as you go further out and that the blade has different surface areas throughout. We must therefore break down the blade into sections, calculating the lift for each section for it's different properties. Also note that the complexities of air compression and wind conditions are hidden in the lift coefficient.</p>
<p>Computational Fluid Dynamics, which often make use of Navier-Stoke equations are also used in calculating these things.</p>
<p>Why do wind turbines typically have 3 blades but helicopters typically have even numbers of blades (2 or 4)? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>While the AC is running, the evaporator coil gets really cold which also reduces the evaporation rates of the smelly compounds in the mold. The rate at which the mold releases it's sockyness is much lower when the evaporator coil it's colonized is cold. When the compressor turns off and the coil warms up to room temp, the mold holds a kegger and gets back into business making smelly compounds which can evaporate from the now warmer surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The bit where you'd put modern crocs' earlid muscles was greatly developed in land-based cousins called notosuchians, and even further in a subgroup called the baurusuchids. This implies they had <em>something</em> over their ears that needed to be wiggled, and they weren't exactly keeping water out of their ears regularly.</p>
<p>So yeah. Possible land crocs with ears, big enough to hunt dinosaurs. Mesozoic be whack yo.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is, we can't know for sure 100%, from dinosaur to dinosaur. But there are some things we do know. Impressions left by dinosaurs haven't shown us anything weird yet. Birds tend not to  have cartilaginous ears and noses, so it's unlikely their ancestors did. And also, cartilage leaves very minute traces of their existence in the form of bone shape, and stress points.</p>
<p>For an example, look at the skull of an elephant. We can guess just by examining it really closely how much weight the muscles surrounding the skull were supporting, and where a protrusion was likely based on tiny grooves left on the bone near the nose left by muscle. Logically, if such grooves were present in dinosaur bone, we could conclude similar protrusions. Nothing we've found so far seems to suggest cartilaginous protrusions, but that could change with just the right specimen.</p>

<p>So the only valid answer is that the chance of the center square of a Sudoku puzzle being 3 is exactly 1/9.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could equally well play Sudoku with the symbols being &quot;1&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;α&quot;, &quot;ℵ&quot;, &quot;⊢&quot;, &quot;𐤀&quot;, &quot;ᚠ&quot;, &quot;𐡀&quot;, and &quot;अ&quot;</p>
<p>(that's the first symbols of the positive integers, the capitalised Latin, lower-case Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Ogham, Phoenician, Elder Futhark, and Imperial Aramaic scripts, and the first (well, top-left) vowel of the Devanagari script. </p>
<p>What order would you put them in? What's special about any of them? Nothing, right? So it wouldn't matter which one we put in place of 3? In particular, the probability of any one of them being in any particular position is exactly 1/9. </p>
<p>However, given a particular Sudoku puzzle that already has some values placed, the probability is not necessarily 1/9: it's either 1 or 0 (assuming it's a well-formed Sudoku puzzle with a unique answer): for example, if there's a 3 already in that row/column/square, it's 0. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The gas makes the bubble expand until it reaches the maximum size it can as the pressure forcing the bubble to expand becomes weaker the water pressure causes the bubble to collapse on itself before expanding again (this can also result in a flash of light as the bubble collapses). This actually happens a few times, each time the &quot;bubble&quot; gets smaller in size until the energy is depleted. I will try to find a video explaining it as I may not have done a terribly good job of explaining it.</p>
<p>Edit: What I am talking about happens at the three min mark of this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/OubvTOHWTms" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/OubvTOHWTms</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: a more in depth video of the bubble side of things, <a href="https://youtu.be/cp5gdUHFGIQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/cp5gdUHFGIQ</a> starts explaining it at the 6 min mark.</p>
<p>I couldn't think of the word but the video reminded me, the bubble oscillates in the water. The size of the bubble would depend on the energy released by the explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first lets start off with what happens for a conventional explosive. Ill choose gun powder since its simple and people come into contact with it on a regular basis. It is composed of a mixture of carbon sulfur potasium nitrogen and oxygen all of which is in a solid form. When lit it rapidly decomposes from its former structure into most notably carbon dioxide, molecular Nitrogen and lots of heat. These are gases thay are very hot and would create a bubble underwater. </p>
<p>For a nuclear bomb you start with uranium 235, a neutron comes along and attaches to u235 and makes u236 which is very unstable. u236 decays into several things differnt elements including Xenon gas plus Strontium and 2 neutrons. As Xenon is a gas it will form a bubble. How stable this bubble is im not sure, but since both gas and heat are produced a bubble will exist. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes - </p>
<p>There are a few different &quot;alternative&quot; sleep cycles out there. One is the Uberman cycle, where instead of taking a long 8 hour nap, you take 20 minute naps every 4 hours for a total of 2 hours per 24 hours.</p>
<p>The idea is to get your body trained to reach REM sleep quickly, as that is when your body rests and repairs itself. In a standard sleep schedule, it may take your body a few hours to reach REM.</p>
<p>There haven't been really any side effects reported, although data is limited. I did this for about 6 months and I felt great and well rested. The amount of time I had everyday was incredible.
The only thing is that school and work tend to fit around a normal sleep schedule, so it makes it difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it's the most famous polyphasic sleep style, the Überman was suggested by a woman in a forum who claimed to have done that during her university times. For really looking into it you should start with something easier like the Everyman or a simple biphasic schedule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
