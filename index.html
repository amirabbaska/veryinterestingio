		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who buy cars generally do not like sounds intruding in the cabin. Although modern cars have many forms of sound deadening from simple to carefully engineered, the carpet remains a large part of that sound deadening. More cleanable floor coverings would tend transmit more sound to the cabin, or would be heavier than carpet.</p>
<p>People who buy cars generally like them to feel luxurious. This feeling of luxury probably began with horsedrawn coaches but moved to cars and other vehicles. If you have never really seen a car with its carpet gone, its a fairly naked and ugly sight, appealing to certain people, but not at all to most. Floor coverings that are not carpet would not have this effect, and don't sell all that well in the general market.</p>
<p>Carpet in a car insulates the feet from metal, much as home carpet insulates the feet from cold boards. Like any fabric blanket, it helps trap heat inside the car in the winter, and at the very least gives the illusion of warmth to the occupants in low temperatures which is almost as important.</p>
<p>The adsorbent nature of carpet that makes it seem like a bad choice is in fact a sort of boon. Something like a thin sheet of formed rubber in place of carpet would seem a better choice to use when moisture is expected. But water, trash, and dirt would still collect on such flooring, while water would slosh around the floorboards in all but the driest climates. Trash and dirt would be easier to see, and the car would look nasty sooner. Instead carpet traps any water and dirt so that they can be contained and removed later. </p>
<p>Cleaning some sort of rubber or other floor would probably involve lots of scrubbing around on the surface with towels in order to clean, and in practice would not be much less odious. No, you cannot hose out the car. The whole car interior would have to be designed for hosing/powerwashing, meaning materials that are either very expensive or very unpleasant to deal with. Electrical systems in the cabin would need to be even more expensively designed and likely heavier in order to resist an expected regular bath. In the end, no matter what you make the flooring out of, cleaning a car interior is a hassle. Minus the powerwashing, you are still down there scrubbing away at your rubber floor.</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but the average car's carpet can be pulled all the way out with a minimum of trouble by the properly equipped. If the carpet is utterly ruined, it can actually be replaced without much trouble, or it can be vigorously washed. Other solutions, like rubber, could do the same, but would be either be thin enough to rip and wear through, or thick enough that they add significant weight to the car compared to carpet. Excess weight is undesirable for economy and performance reasons. As many have pointed out, carpet is not actually that hard to clean, even in the car.</p>
<p>The addition of drains to floors seems obvious, except that the modern car floor is full of bumps, depressions and ridges meant to increase rigidity and serve engineering purposes other than channeling water. Either floors would be more expensive to design without carpet, or many drain holes would have to be strategically added, adding failure points to the floor for leakage, cracking and encouraging rust. Rust needs no encouragement and must be strenuously battled. Carpet covers all this ridged unsightliness well while asking for very few favors from the engineering process and adding no problems mechanically. </p>
<p>Carpet is actually the easiest, most effective way to solve the problem of car flooring, pleasing the owner and making things easier, and thus less expensive to the manufacturer, which results in lower prices, and there we go pleasing the people who buy the cars again. The modern vehicle carpet has been exhaustively designed to do that job very well. Many, many smart people have asked why carpet, and yet, we always return to fuzzy stuff on the floor, for all the reasons I mention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I doubt you'd particularly enjoy being in a vehicle without carpet either... The noise reduction is a lot more than you are thinking it is. You'd end up with an echo filled, extremely loud vehicle without it, while with it you have some degree of insulation from the noise... And it should perhaps be mentioned that no single material can be manufactured cheaply that does all these things.</p>
<p>That's basically all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example my 1964 Ford Falcon had this weird vinyl floor, but carpet was available as a paid upgrade when it was new.  Having carpet in your car was a status symbol. </p>
<p>Over time, the &quot;upgrade&quot; to carpet became the norm, as everyone wanted the upgrade in status. If a car didn't have it, it simply wasn't competitive.  Now it seems only work vehicles tend to have rubber flooring in them, where practicality trumps status. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did it for a while. There's a lot to it, but here's how I can simplify it easiest:</p>
<p>There's a complicated math problem that a lot of people are trying to solve. You run a program called a miner on your computer that repeatedly tries to find the answer to that problem. When it does find the answer, it gets shared between all the other people who were also trying to answer it, and when they confirm that it's the right answer, you're rewarded with whichever type of cryptocurrency you were mining (e.g. bitcoin). The answer also includes the next math problem everyone has to solve, so all the miners start working on that. Rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>It's actually very simple to start mining on any computer, but you'd end up spending more money on electricity than you'd ever earn, so don't bother. I can go into more depth if you have specific questions but the actual cryptography is over my head. I have done a lot of reading about the various hashing algorithms used and how they work but I couldn't explain it well enough. It's been over 2 years. There are also a lot of cryptocurrencies with different methods, so I understand some better than others.</p>
<p>Edit: For everyone informing me of the existence of altcoins, yes, I know, I only ever mined those (until multipools got big and then I took my payouts in bitcoin and let them decide what was worth mining). I meant it wasn't worth it to CPU mine them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That is a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Mining a cryptocurrency means using your computer to perform all those operations, eventually finding the answer, and then you can use that answer to buy stuff.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't mine, but it does a decent job for an ELI5 answer </p>
<p>&quot;look, it's simple. you have a Happy Burger brand fast food establishment, and sometimes kids come in and want their Happy Burger brand Happy Kiddy Burger, which according to the Happy Burger brand franchise operating instructions is supposed to be 4oz of usda utility grade hamburger lightly grilled and pressed into a poppy seed bun with two slices of mild pickle and a slice of tomato and a piece of iceberg lettuce and the name of the kid written on the top in half an ounce of Happy Burger brand special sauce about which the less said the better</p>
<p>so naturally what you do is, you post an ad saying, cooks wanted, please bring your own grill and meat and bun and pickle and tomato and lettuce, we'll supply the sauce</p>
<p>and you get an applicant, and you send him down to the Hall of Cooks, which is a featureless infinite plane that you keep in the unlit basement of your Happy Burger brand fast food establishment. and you tell him to just keep making burgers and handing them up, and if he hands up a burger that satisfies your standards, you'll pay him a bonus, which is $100,000, plus the price of the burger, which is $.50</p>
<p>now the cook can't see too good down there, and he keeps handing up burgers that are more like pickly meatballs with a swastika painted on the side in tomato sauce, but as long as the meat's cooked the health department won't shut you down, so you keep taking them and dutifully handing down briefcases of cash with a few quarters tossed in. and the cook's pretty happy, even after you summarily declare one day that you're only going to pay $50,000 per burger in the future</p>
<p>so the cook calls in a friend, and she sets up in the Hall of Cooks and starts handing up burgers, and now you're getting acceptable burgers faster than you can sell them. so you raise your standards a bit, and you insist that burgers have to be on a bun, and that cuts production back down to a manageable rate. but the cooks are still pretty happy, even after you cut the burger bonus again to $25,000</p>
<p>this goes on for a while, and now you're got a hundred cooks down there, and you're started demanding that they spell out the kid's name correctly, and that's not easy. so now they're not just making burgers to your increasingly exact specifications, they're racing each other to be the first to get the kid's name right. but you're still paying $5,000 a burger, and apparently the cooks are still happy, because more and more keep showing up</p>
<p>you get curious one day while you're squeezing into your franchise past the giant mountain of rotting discarded hamburgers, and you head down to the Hall of Cooks. the last time you came down here, there were only six cooks, and they were just standing around in a disorganized circle; but now they're organized into these large groups. in one of them, you find your first cook, and he shakes your hand. &quot;remember when we just started out and i was lumping up store meat by hand and cooking it on that tiny old george foreman?&quot; he laughs. &quot;That was before we figured out cookie cutters and rolling pins.&quot; he's standing at a huge professional-grade charbroiler with twenty-four different patties arranged on it; suddenly, in a single efficient flash of movement, he flips them all over. of course, the dull glow of the grill isn't enough in the utter blackness of the Hall, and most of the patties end up on the ground, which you suddenly realize is a lot spongier than it's supposed to be. also, doesn't the ceiling seem lower? you shake it off and head back upstairs to start taking orders, wondering when it'll be the right time to cut the bonus to $1,000</p>
<p>it's been another year. there are tens of thousands of cooks in your basement. you're rejecting burgers for sloppy handwriting. you're rejecting burgers for having too thick a slice of tomato. you're rejecting burgers for excessively clustered poppy seeds. seven months ago, the cooks started building floor-to-ceiling ovens with internal robotics custom-designed for making Happy Kiddy Burgers; now there are whole fields of them, each making ten thousand burgers a second. of course, it's still pitch-dark down there, and the cooks aren't exactly susan calvin, so almost all of those burgers get added straight to the end of the Great Greasy Mountains, but it's amazing how quick they come now. you overhear a few of the cooks talking excitedly about the orders they just placed for massive new ovens from Barbecue Labs. you don't know how any of them can afford this when the burger bonus is only $100&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically because it never affected Western society as much. You notice how people crack Nazi jokes about the Germans all the time - and none about Imperial Japan? It's because the Japanese Empire and their atrocities simply aren't well known. It's important to recognise that it's the same way in China; if you were to fly the Rising Sun Flag in Beijing, you would quite rightly get a proper thrashing. Fly the Swastika? Weird looks at most. It's just that things matter a lot more when they happen to people close to you, who are similar to you. </p>
<p>In addition, the West has made a (justified) concerted effort to completely destroy Nazism's reputation. Nothing of the sort happened in Japan. There just wasn't an awareness of what happened in the East, outside of those actually involved in the Pacific theater, so Japan never had the reputational demolition that the Nazis had. I don't mean to imply that Western media intended to &quot;protect&quot; Japan as such, or that they swept it under the rug. It's just that there was both a lack of awareness, and also just a lack of fucks to give in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is the comfort women, Chinese and Korea women taken as sex slaves. I'm willing to bet the same thing happened in the Philippines and Singapore. </p>

The situation after the war were also quite different. Germans were angry at the Nazis and a lot of them even switched sides at the end of the war. Whereas in Japan the feeling was more of a &quot;we tried but did not make it&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as a warning this is a HIGHLY simplified version of how they work:</p>
<p>(most) solar panels are made from two thin sheets of silicon.  Silicon has a very regular crystal structure, but each layer has been mixed with a small amount of two other elements.  What this accomplishes is that one layer has a crystal structure with some extra electrons and one has a crystal structure missing some electrons.</p>
<p>When you connect both layers the extra electrons move over to fill the holes and it just sort of sits there.</p>
<p>If you put this silicon sandwich in the sunshine, that sun has enough energy to knock an electron loose from one side, and then the electrons all shift places to fill in the new hole.  If you hook a bunch of these small cells together into a big panel you can get the electrons to flow through a wire and you get electricity out of it.  </p>
<p>Keep combining more and more panels (made up of lots of tiny cells) and you can get a lot of energy.  When the sun goes away all the electrons find all the holes and the whole things just sits there waiting for the sun to shine on it again.</p>
<p>If you hook a battery into the mix you can charge that battery with the electrons (again very simplified) if you connect it to the grid you can power your home, or you can use it for anything else that you would use electricity for.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br />
A lot of people have asked about &quot;where the electrons come from&quot; or &quot;can the panel run out of them&quot; etc.  As I stated above this is a VERY simplified explanation.  The electrons don't actually move around, and again this is highly simplified, but think of it more like they bump into their neighbor which bumps into its neighbor, etc.  They are not actually moving around the wire, or the panel.  Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Someone also asked why not one big panel instead of lots of little ones, and the answer to that is that no matter how big your panel is, it will always produce the same voltage.  A little tiny solar cells pumps out about .5 volts so does a really big one.  So if you want 12 volts, or 120 volts, etc you have to string the smaller panels together. In the same way you can take a whole bunch of AA batteries and get enough voltage to run something large, you can take a whole bunch of small solar cells and put them together in such a way that you can get the voltage you need.</p>
<p>Different solar cells work with different efficiency in different wavelengths of light.  Most commercial solar cells work best in full sun, but can still function in diffuse light.</p>
<p>Solar cells seem to degrade a bit after about 25 years, and then slowly degrade after that, some very old solar panels from the 50's are still going strong with relatively minor degradation.  With the current dramatic price drop in solar cells, it is very likely that the roof or the stand you have them affixed too will wear out before they do, and even then it will be nearly free to replace them in the future (assuming costs keep going down and efficiency keeps going up, which it can still do for a long time before we reach limits imposed by physics).</p>
<p>Here is a cool chart of all the different solar cells being tracked by efficiency. (how much sun they turn into electricity).  <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png" target="_blank">https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png</a></p>
<p>as you can see some cells are doing pretty good (46%), although they might be very expensive.  </p>
<p>Roughly 1000 watts of solar energy falls on 1 square meter of ground, so at 46% a meter of that solar cell would make (roughly) 460 watts of energy.</p>
<p>As you can see as the price of the cells comes down, as does the price of battery and inverter tech, solar has a very real chance of powering just about the entire world.  Combined with smart grids, grid energy storage, electric car energy storage, and increases in efficiency, solar and other renewables are clearly the energy supply we should be backing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So most of these responses are generally along the right lines, but vague. I'm starting my graduate research focusing on solar (photovoltaic) cells, so I'll try to explain a different way.</p>
<p>The core principle of solar cells is the p-n junction. The n-type material has impurities consisting of atoms that add more electrons than silicon atoms normally have, and the p-type has added atoms with fewer electrons (quantized as &quot;holes&quot; with the opposite charge of electrons). When these are stuck together at the junction, the extra electrons from the n-type diffuse across to the p-type, and the holes diffuse across to the n-type, so the number of electrons balance out.</p>
<p>However, since the n-type atoms have lost electrons, that side now has a net positive charge, and the p-type side now has a net negative charge. An electric field has been created through the crystal that tries to push electrons back into the n-type side.</p>
<p>As others have explained, when light hits the cell, it &quot;knocks&quot; electrons free. They absorb the energy of the photons and are free to move through the cell, leaving behind holes where they used to be. The electric field separates the electrons and holes, pushing the electrons to the n-type side and holes to the p-type side (a process similar to diffusion, known as drift). The more light, the more charges are separated to collect on opposite sides of the cell. This is the photovoltaic effect! The cell now has a voltage across it, and when you connect a light or battery or other load, the voltage pushes electrons out of the cell and through the load.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many materials absorb light when it hits them. When a solar panel is hit by light it also absorbs the light, but it does this because the light knocks into an electron and makes the electron excited (which absorbs the light). This excited electron wants to move around a lot and it jumps around from atom to atom. But because of the way solar panels are built the electron can only move in one direction. If you have a lot of light hit the solar panel then a lot of electrons will be knocked around and &quot;freed&quot; to flow through the material, but only in that one permitted direction. Hook something up to the panel so the electrons have somewhere to go and they'll flow right through whatever you hooked up. And there you have electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the reactor and is turbines were meant to undergo a test to find out whether the spinning steam turbines and generators could produce enough electricity while coasting to a stop to run the reactor cooling pumps while the diesel generators were brought online.  This test, far from routine, was derived because, if, for example, the West attacked electrical grids and the plant was disconnected, the reactors would need to be E-stopped, like RIGHT now!  Decay heat would still need to be dealt with.  This test was supposed to have been done during unit 4s commissioning in, like, '83 or '84.  The paperwork was pencil-whipped (extremely kommon in the USSR bekause ahead-of-time konstruction delivery resulted in bonus of many roubles.)  Turns out, the communists were preeetty corner-cutty.  </p>
<p>The reactor design itself is loaded with flaws.  Let's put it this way... The USSR used a cheaper-to-build reactor design than LITERALLY THE WHOLE REST OF THE WORLD!  It lacked a heavy steel and concrete containment building, it used the steam directly produced by the uranium fuel to run the turbines (water turned to steam IN the reactor core and there was no heat exchanger separating irradiated steam and water from, fuckin... NOT radioactive water), it used hollow graphite blocks as a moderator to maintaining the nuclear chain reaction (US and West European reactors use pressurized water, so no water, no nuclear reaction), the boron control rods were graphite tipped (which briefly increased reactor output upon insertion, this is important for later) and about 57 other glaring flaws... like safety systems THAT COULD  BE OVERRIDDEN!</p>
<p>The test was scheduled for April 25th.  It didn't happen on the day shift; because Kievs electrical grid controller asked for it to be done later in the evening, after peak demand.  It didn't happen on the evening shift, either, for unclear reasons.  So when the night shift started at midnight of the 26th, the dude from Moscow who had been there all day and was to oversee the test was... well, testy.  The night shift guys were the youngest and least experienced (the reactor operator was 26 years old) and they'd just been handed a procedure binder loaded with annotations and crossed out procedures.</p>
<p>Note*
Xenon poisoning occurs when reducing capacity in nuclear reactors.  Xenon is a fission byproduct that actually absorbs the zooming around neutrons, preventing them from slamming into another Uranium 235 atom, splitting it, and setting even more neutrons free to go slam into other atoms.  During stable operation, Xenon is &quot;burned off&quot; at a rate that allows the chain reaction to continue.  If control rods are inserted and the reaction slowed, there's an excess of Xenon and it has a control rod like effect, further reducing output.  The nuclear chain reaction will nearly stop because of the excess neutron absorbing shit in the reactor over-coming the nuclear chain reaction itself.  The reactor should need to sit for 48 hours before attempts by to restart the reaction, giving the Xenon a chance to naturally decay. </p>
<p>So, with that fully explained, let's continue!</p>
<p>The reactor had a thermal output rating of 1500 megawatts (1.5 gigawatts).  The test was to be conducted at 1500, but must not to go below 700MW or reactor instability could occur.  The reactor had been running at full capacity, but the decision was made to slightly reduce capacity before starting. </p>
<ol>
<li>To begin, manual control was taken and the control rods were partially inserted into the core, reducing reactor output.</li>
<li>The operator switched the control rods back to automatic control, thinking the computer would hold the desired output. </li>
<li>The automatic system saw the sudden output reduction as a power failure and began plunging the control rods to their fully inserted position, nearly shutting the reactor down.</li>
<li>The Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) tried to start.  It was manually overridden and turned off. </li>
<li>Reactor output dropped to between 0 and 30 MW (depending on which report is read.)</li>
<li>The previously inserted rods were retracted.</li>
<li>Reactor output didn't increase. </li>
<li>Serious Xenon poisoning had occurred, further slowing the nuclear reaction.</li>
<li>The operator was ordered to bring the reactor back up to power, he REFUSED!  It went against written procedure.  (Poor guy, tried to do his job right, and was blamed for the whole thing)</li>
<li>Cranky Moscow dude yelled and made the 27 year old shift chief bring reactor back up: he did.  (Being so young, and being a nuclear plant operator or chief was pretty much a dream job in Soviet Ukraine. To argue with a senior official could cost you everything)</li>
<li>About half the control rods were now fully retracted, but reactor output was only up to 200MW... too low to test. </li>
<li>The coolant pumps were sped up, and additional pumps brought online to try to counteract the Xenon poisoning, this increased water volume, decreased steam volume, and slowed the turbines as a result. </li>
<li>Additional control rods were retracted to try to bring steam output up to speed the turbine back up. </li>
<li>The equivalent of only 8 fully inserted rods remained in the core.  15 was the minimum.  The reactor had over 211 control rods...</li>
<li>Hot spots began developing in the core, but instrumentation wasn't present in the interior of the core.  The operator noticed the computer was demanding the reactor be shut down.  Every safety system had been bypassed. Power output was still too low, Moscow dude insisted they continue. </li>
<li>Output finally increased enough and the turbine was disconnected and began its coast down test. </li>
<li>Once the turbine was disconnected, the condenser couldn't keep up and raw steam entered the condensate (steam turned back into water) return pipes and caused cavitation in the pumps. The steam in the pumps intermittently stopped pumping water into the core.  As pockets of steam collapsed inside the pipes, loud banging sounds could be heard in the turbine hall and near the reactor.</li>
<li>The already unstable core began violently producing pockets of steam. Output began surging. </li>
<li>4 of the 8 pumps were still running on the decelerating turbine and began slowing.  Even less water was available for core cooling. </li>
<li>The core temperature and pressure gauges were pegged.  The steam condenser should have kept up and cooled the steam back to water, but it was overworked - pockets of steam continued entering the pumps. The reactor was idiotically kept online to repeat the turbine test if necessary.</li>
<li>The core suddenly surged way past its maximum output. </li>
<li>Between the noise and power surges, operators decided to &quot;SCRAM&quot; the reactor - SCRAM means, Safety Control Rod Axe Man.  It was to plunge ALL control rods to their fully inserted position and stop the reactor. </li>
<li>The graphite tipped control rods began descending.  Soviet nukes used control servo motors that were notoriously slow, taking 18 seconds to fully insert the rods.</li>
<li>The graphite (graphite increased nuclear reaction) tipped rods acted like Vin Diesel hitting the &quot;NOS button&quot; in that first Fast and the Furious movie/turd.  The reactor went bonkers. </li>
<li>The sudden increase in output fractured the core and the rods became stuck only partially inserted.  There was now nothing to slow the reaction. </li>
<li>Reactor output soared well beyond what instrumentation could even remotely measure. </li>
<li>Pressure built so high it blew the 450 TON lid clean the fuck OFF THE REACTOR. </li>
<li>Air and steam rushed into the core, reacted with the zirconium jacket around each uranium fuel rod, created a ton of hydrogen, then blew the whole roof off the building in a second explosion, spewing tons of radioactive material into the atmosphere. </li>
</ol>
<p>It took awhile for what had happened to sink in.  They though the explosion was from a separator drum.  They continued trying to operate and cool the core, pumping tons and tons of water into it, all of which blew into the night sky as radioactive steam.  </p>
<p>The soviet government blamed the shit out of the operators.  There was no way they could, or would, admit that ALL their mighty RBMK-1000 reactors were gravely flawed.  They couldn't afford to shut their entire nuclear fleet down because of shitty design!  They lied.  They knew the reactors were seriously flawed, but they built them anyway.  They just decided to build controls to deal with the shortcomings... Then made them by-passable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a student in Nuclear engineering, so I'm not an expert (yet). But this is how I understand it:</p>
<p>They were not intentionally operating at low power, as the linked article says they were trying to operate at a higher 20-30% range. But because of reactor poisoning it was slowing down. Reactor poisoning is the buildup of unwanted fission products. These fission products will slow down the reaction by increasing the average distance between fuel atoms and absorbing neutrons that otherwise would've caused fission. The operators didn't fully understand why the reactor was slowing down, so they started pulling out control rods to attempt to bring it back up to power, leaving them unable to react quick enough when it started going wrong.</p>
<p>If I understand the situation correctly, they had the backup generators off because they were trying to run a test of the reactors accident tolerance. They knew that the backup generators would take about 60 seconds to turn on if power was lost, and that 60 seconds without coolant was long enough to cause problems. Basically they were trying to see if, when power was lost, the turbine would be able to keep spinning from it's own momentum long enough to power the coolant pumps until the backup generators came on. So they were trying to simulate a LOCA (loss of coolant accident), meaning the main coolant system is down and the backup one hasn't come on yet. </p>
<p>On top of this, I believe there was a problem with the test that forced them to delay it a few hours. Over that few hours a shift change occurred, meaning that a good chunk of the people that were trained for the test and knew what was happening had left. </p>
<p>So to put it bluntly, the operators didn't appear to understand basic reactor physics like poisoning, they were operating the reactor knowing full well that if something went wrong their backup generators would not come on in time to fix it, and their incredibly dangerous test that they were running occurred during a shift where very few people were trained and aware of the test.</p>
<p>I hope this helps, but definitely do your own research. I may have misremembered something, and I definitely didn't give full detail on anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are a lot of good comments here. I just want to add that boiling style reactors exhibit thermal hydraulic instabilities when they are in high power and low flow conditions. If you have too little forced coolant flow, natural circulation on its own isn't enough to force the steam bubbles out of the core at a reasonable rate, which then can have neutronic effects on reactor power. </p>
<p>Traditional boiling water reactors exhibit core oscillations when these instabilities start, which if not suppressed can lead to violation of the MCPR safety limit and transition boiling which can damage the fuel. Bwrs have restrictions on their operating power/flow map along with oscillation detectors which can trip the reactor before these instabilities can cause core damage. </p>
<p>Graphite moderated cores like chernobyl's RBMK can have power excursions, because voiding in these reactors causes power to continue to increase. This was a known issue and is why there were both coolant flow limits AND minimum control rod insertion limits, to prevent a thermal runaway event from occurring. Chernobyl explicitly violated both of these, placing the reactor in a state where thermal runaway could occur, and having insufficient coolant flow as a result of the test they were doing which induced the instability which grew into the power excursion which caused core damage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, let this be a lesson in humanity. If humans can screw it up, they will.</p>
<p>The whole situation came about because the reactor was to be taken off line for routine maintenance and they took the opportunity to see if the slowing main steam turbines could provide enough power to cool the reactor before the backup diesel cooling system took over. Preparations were made and staff was trained on what to expect. <strong>Actually not a bad idea, and they had a reasonable protocol on how to do it safely.</strong></p>
<p>Now the fun starts. The Evening shift begins making preparations required for the experiment. This means that they start shutting down many of the key safety systems designed to prevent exactly what happens. Separately, Soviet electrical authorities delayed the shut down due to power grid requirements. The test is delayed and moved from the trained staff of the Evening shift to the largely untrained (and more inexperienced) Night shift. <strong>The experiment should have stopped here and waited for trained staff.</strong></p>
<p>Now, the experiment begins. And so do the mistakes. Due to operator error, the power output is no longer stabilized in the 30% range but rather more like 1%. To fix the issue, the plant raises the control rods higher than allowed and has fewer engaged than allowed. This produces a &quot;stable&quot; output level and the test proceeds. <strong>Several trained personnel tried to abort the test here but were overridden.</strong></p>
<p>Several things begin happening. There is a build up of Xenon. This is a by-product of the reaction and under typical operation it is &quot;burned off&quot; by absorbing radiation and decaying further. Several emergency systems are disabled as they would have engaged at this point and ended the experiment. The operators engage all 8 of the cooling pumps. This is actually a bad thing. These reactors were not designed to be completely flooded with water but with a mixture of water and steam. By flooding it, they reduced the power output (reducing power available to the pumps) as well as created conditions the core isn't designed to work with. <strong>Good god, please stop the test.</strong></p>
<p>The test begins. Terrible things happen. The power surges. The Xenon built up begins to burn off, which increases the rate of reaction, which increases the rate of Xenon burn off. The additional heat being made starts to boil off water at the bottom of the core (not where it is designed to be converted to steam). Steam is much less dense and has a much smaller thermal carrying capacity per volume than water. This is also a positive feedback loop where the steam causes rising core temperatures which creates more steam.</p>
<p>The bubbles in the coolant start to cause cavitation within the cooling pumps (really good way to shred a pump). The pressure tubes where control rods are inserted have been deformed by the steam pressure. <strong>Too late now.</strong></p>
<p>They realize things have gone really, really badly. They try to insert the control rods to slow the reaction but they cannot be inserted due to the deformation. Fuel rods begin to burst. This causes an even more massive increase in steam pressure that causes the 1000 ton cover plate to burst off the core. This further damages the control rods and starts to allow radiation and steam pressure into areas not designed to handle or contain it. </p>
<p>&quot;The 1000 ton lid above the fuel elements is lifted by the first explosion. The release of radiation starts. Air reaches the reactor and the oxygen results in a graphite fire. The metal of the fuel tubes reacts to the water. This is a chemical reaction which produces hydrogen, and this hydrogen explodes: the second explosion. Burning debris flies into the air and lands on the roof of Chernobyl Unit 3. (There was barely any attention paid to this hydrogen explosion in the Soviet report about the accident. In studies commissioned by the US government however, it was concluded that the second explosion was of great significance, and that the original explanation of the accident was incorrect. Richard Wilson of the Harvard University in the US said this second explosion was a small nuclear explosion.)&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The initial plan was to have this test run during the day, during planned maintenance. The idea was to see if the turbine generator could supply enough power to keep coolant pumps running while the generator was spinning down (there's a lot of spinning mass, so even with no steam being supplied, it will still produce power for some time) before the diesels could come online.</p>
<p>The electrical grid operator refused to allow them to perform the test, however, citing too much demand. So, they shifted the test to be run during the night, when demand was lower. Unfortunately, night shift wasn't briefed to the same extent as day shift.</p>
<p>Reactor power was lowered by lowering steam demand, i.e. electrical power output. If I recall, the emergency cooling system was disabled because it would have kicked on during the transient, and they wanted to see if normal cooling means could handle it. Don't quote me on that part.</p>
<p>Reactor power dropped too low for the test, however; assumed cause is operator error. We don't know everything about the events. Attempts to raise reactor power back up were then stymied by a combination of Xenon poisoning, and RBMK (of which Chernobyl was one) reactors having a positive void coefficient. </p>
<p>Chernobyl is of a style called a Boiling Water Reactor, or BWR. These exist in the U.S. as well, although their design is entirely different, and inherently safe. The other style is a Pressurized Water Reactor, or PWR. The US Navy uses this latter style exclusively, and there are some commercial examples as well. To ELI5, a BWR allows for boiling of the water inside the core, a PWR does not. There are pros and cons with each. Mind you, the pressure of the water is well above atmospheric, so the temperature of it can be raised above 212 F / 100 C. Anyway, as more boiling occurs, more steam is produced, and therefore more voids, or gaps, in the coolant channel occur. With a positive void coefficient, therefore, you get a positive feedback loop as you raise power. Since Chernobyl was at a very low power level, there were fewer voids, and so the reactor was sluggish to respond.</p>
<p>Xenon is the other contributor. To simplify, when fissioned, U-235 produces I-135, which itself decays into Xe-135. The time for the Xe-135 to be born depends on the transient, but to generalize, say ~6 hours. Xe-135 is a neutron absorber, meaning power is reduced even further. To counter this, the operators raised the control rods up, but as the RBMK design has a very slow emergency shutdown (scram) insertion speed, it couldn't respond quickly enough when they finally tried to abort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Super short answer:</strong> Sheer numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Krill are very small, but tend to form <em>huge</em> swarms, so to a whale they're like giant clouds of food. It's similar to how rice grains are very small but you can get full from eating a heaping bowl of rice.</p>
<p><strong>Full Answer:</strong> The main difference between plants and animals is that usually plants just need sunlight and water while animals have to eat.</p>
<p>Some animals eat plants, some animals eat other animals. In order for an animal to survive there must be enough food for it to eat.</p>
<p>In many places it works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plants grow from water and sunlight</li>
<li>Animals eat the plants</li>
<li>Other animals eat those animals</li>
<li>Other animals eat <em>those</em> animals</li>
<li>And on and on and on...</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two important things to understand:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All</strong> of the food originally comes from plants.</li>
<li>Not all food that's eaten gets turned into new food that another animal could eat.</li>
</ol>
<p>When an animal eats it uses food to grow, which means it creates more food if another animal eats it. But not all of the food an animal eats becomes growth. Some food gets used up when the animal runs around, and some just becomes poop.</p>
<p>For every 10 ounces of food an animal eats, it only produces 1 ounce of food for another animal to eat. This means a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to be a big animal you have to eat a <em>lot</em> of food.</li>
<li>There is a <em>lot</em> more food if you eat plants than if you eat animals.</li>
<li>There is a <em>lot</em> more food if you eat an animal that eats plants than if you eat an animal that eats other animals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Krill eat plants, specifically algae, and algae grows <em>incredibly fast</em>, which means krill have <em>huge</em> amounts of food to eat when algae is growing. The krill grow very fast, and have lots of babies because they're completely surrounded by food and can eat as much as they want all day long and never go hungry.</p>
<p>This turns into a giant swarm of food that other animals could easily eat, and whales can get absolutely gigantic because all they have to do is swim through the swarm with their mouths open and they get an easy mouthful of food.</p>
<p>Easy food for krill means giant swarms which means easy food for whales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No good answer.. so i googled up that shit.</p>
<p>Tldw:
Whales eat only during 4 months a year. Krill multiplicate in those months. There are lots of krill. Whales accumulate so much fat that they survive the &quot;winter&quot;</p>
<p>During the antartic summer the water gets warmer and the currents pull up plancton from ghe bottom. Thus is the core meal of the sea. Krill will feed on the plancton and in the arctic summer krill will proliferate and multiply. Now these little fuckers are like 2 inches long. Yet during the summer the total mass of all krill will surpass the mass of all humans on earth. Krill are the feast of the seas because they travel in tight packs. Since there are billions of them you have a tight patch of krill that spans for literal miles.</p>
<p>Makes easy to hunt and eat... just drive thru and open wide.</p>
<p>Now (not only)the whales will travel to the krill area in the summer and use some tricks to trap krill and will eat about 2 ton of krill every day building up fat.</p>
<p>This spectacle repeats every year. The ciecle of life</p>

<p>You've eaten rice, haven't you? A single grain of rice isn't going to fill you up or give you a lot of nutrition, but you don't eat just one grain of rice, you eat a bunch of them. Similarly, whales eat a (figurative) ton of krill to maintain their nutritional requirements.</p>
<p>Edit: Might be a literal ton too. I'm unwilling to do the math on the subject at 1:47 am.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a Bioligist, but I did just return from a National Geographic trip and this is what I learned from the naturalists. </p>
<p>Let's look at the humpback whale. The humpback whale has baleen on only its upper jaw that it uses to filter out the massive amounts of sea water it can take while swimming up to the surface (Up to 15,000 gallons, or about the size of a swimming pool <a href="https://postimg.org/image/8udbjkptb/" target="_blank">1</a> ). Baleen are made up of the same material as our fingernails, keratin, and there are numerous long strips of them that can be taller than a grown man.

(<a href="http://alaskatrekker.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bubblenet_feeding1.jpg" target="_blank">http://alaskatrekker.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bubblenet_feeding1.jpg</a>)
As you can see in this diagram, the part under the whale's bottom jaw is able to expand due to its accordion like skin. <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/84/63/65/8463654cda8c3436a997506fdae84528.jpg" target="_blank">3</a>
The whale then filters out this massive amount of water by using its tongue to push out the sea water through its baleen which is located on its upper jaw. The krill and other small sea creatures are trapped in the baleen while the sea water is able to exit the mouth with ease. While krill is a part of their diet, it is not their only source of food. We saw the humpbacks also target herrings as another option. Rinse and repeat and this is how these whales are able to sustain themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: Before commenting and telling me to read the fucking article about this, please read the SECOND PART OF THE SENTENCE. </p>
<p>I mean, Jesus. The question is about ALL the people who were on the malfunctioning machine, not the one who claimed a jackpot</p>
<p>Snapchat and Reddit crossing the streams today. Shout out to Will Honeywell, Calvin H, Giannigreco, Ethan_Fedors, Cody, Dawson, and Leo for entertaining the hell out of me on Snapchat.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Don't forget tomorrow is Reddit's Global Meetup Day and AZ redditors are meeting at Encanto Park. Find me and let's do a shot.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: This is the answer to the specific question I asked, although I really enjoyed learning so much today.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Software developer here,</p>
<p>I wrote software for these one-armed bandits for ~5 years. Detecting a fault in the machine isn't too hard, I suppose, though I never had to do it. If the machine is a &quot;participation&quot; game, then some of the winnings of each game are paid out to the manufacturer, because just making and selling machines isn't profitable enough to stay in business. The catch is the manufacturer pays out the jackpots, not the casino. So the casino doesn't give a shit if you hit 10 jackpots in a row, and neither do the commissioners, for them, they're just doing their job.</p>
<p>When a jackpot is hit, the whole bank of machines are roped off and kept under guard. A poor (EDIT:) sonofabitch engineer or two are dragged out of bed in the middle of the night, or pulled out of their children's birthday party, whatever, and they're stuffed into a plane with all sorts of gear and shit. They will systematically diagnose, test, and dismantle that machine down to the rivets to make sure it wasn't tampered with or flawed. It's the company's responsibility to prove the win was false if they want to save their cash.</p>
<p>But even the manufacturer plans for payouts, it's all part of the budget. My employer designed the math behind their games so one of their participation games, in the entire market, like a Wide Area Progressive, would hit every 6 months. We had one WAP hit twice in one month just after release once, the execs puckered up so tight they shit diamonds to cover the bills that day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you are referring to the $43M ticket from the other day. </p>
<p>One aspect is the nature of the error. That $43M ticket could never have happened under normal operation. The maximum payout for that machine was $10k. So, a factor of 4,000 smaller than the erroneous ticket. That makes it clear it is an error. A single spin not winning is a pretty normal state of affairs. It may well be in error, but it would be very difficult to prove either way. </p>
<p>Then, we put all sorts of checks into those machines. When it attempted to issue the ticket the server will (most likely) have replied that it couldn't issue a ticket that large. At that point the machine has a balance it can't pay out and will go into alarm. At that point the machine will have been rebooted.</p>
<p>Also against that girl is the fact the only photo is of her collecting her &quot;winnings&quot;. Why take a selfie of the boring ticket print screen rather than the jackpot screen itself? Seems to me like the error occurred well after the game ended, she hit collect <em>then</em> something went wrong. </p>
<p>We do our best to make sure that nothing goes wrong with the machines, but errors do slip through. The logic for us is that it is better to fail in favour of the machine. People who are down money will complain and tell us. Then we can check the logs for the exact time they won, see what went wrong and how much they are owed. It may take longer but it can be put right. If we fail in favour of the player then odds are they will never tell us, or worse they will attempt to repeat the circumstances for free money. It could be months before we even find out something is wrong. This leads into what /u/mredding said - if the machine has been actively tampered with, why the hell would a casino feel obligated to pay out? Fail in favour of the machine and check the logs later. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do have to pay anyone who lost on a broken machine. And they can't just claim a machine is broken, it actually has to be broken. The state runs a gaming commision that audits machines and is in charge of things like broken machine issues.</p>
<p>If a machine is broken, all transactions on that machine are void, wins and losses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago, my brother came home for the holidays. We went to MGM casino after a night of partying in Detroit. He won a jackpot at a Roulette machine, but it didn't payout the $1,000 or so he won. I stayed by the machine as he went to complain. They said they couldn't do anything and said we were lying. </p>
<p>The only reason we were there is because we were waiting to get picked up as e took an Uber there the day before. As you can probably agree with, he was pissed off, and I was confused since there are hundreds of cameras lined all over.</p>
<p>We finally called the police, one of which we knew worked at the DPD from high school. They came and the money was given after they wanted to check the eye in the sky. I thought they'd need a warrant or something, but the panic caused by two police officers showing up made them eat their bullshit and pay my brother what he won.</p>
<p>It sounds unbelievable, but I hate casinos, so this is imprinted in my brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The law isn't written to be fair, it is written to be just. A lot of people equate these terms, but they aren't actually the same.</p>
<p>A fair system would be the one you just described, where if a machine is faulty, all transactions should be considered void and reimbursed.</p>
<p>A just system means everyone has the same legal rights and responsibilities. The just system can have a rule like &quot;if you think a transaction was faulty, the onus is on the person who wishes reimbursement (or the refusal of payment). Any party that wishes to seek these measures must go and prove the transaction was faulty.&quot; Here, the law applies the same to everyone. It is just that the casino has the impetus to test the machine in the case of a huge payout, and you do not have the impetus every time you lose ten cents. If a person would go back to that casino and show evidence that they played 100 dollars on those machines after the casino has proven it was faulty, they would be reimbursed. </p>
<p>TL;DR: You have to seek reimbursement to be reimbursed. Everyone has to, and the casino does when it refuses a jackpot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have lived here and asked that same question to other scientists and learned more about it myself in my studies.</p>
<p>There are several reefs in the Gulf of Mexico (<a href="http://classroom.sanibelseaschool.org/coral-reefs-in-the-gulf-of-mexico" target="_blank">http://classroom.sanibelseaschool.org/coral-reefs-in-the-gulf-of-mexico</a>).  Just none along the north side and all the way down till you start getting into South east mexico.
The flower gardens are reefs.  They are on top of salt domes that brought the depth to a shallow enough level that coral could thrive while being far enough off the coast that the sediment load has settled and light is able to penetrate well.</p>
<p>MOST Coral is very dependent on light and water quality.  Most near shore waters in the Gulf of Mexico are very murky due to the Mississippi River sediment load.  General water circulation in the gulf is counter clockwise so the sediment load is taken to the west along the shore.  By the time you reach south Padre Island the water starts getting clearer on a more consistent basis.
You can actually find numerous pictures of the boundary of water density because of it.  By the time that happens away from the coastline the water is too deep for coral to form and thrive.  </p>
<p>edit: added a link and some clarity, modified per u/biochemthisd (added most).  also thanks for Gold kind stranger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Coral Reefs need warm water to survive.  The water temp in the keys for example might drop to the very high 60's/low 70's in the middle of winter.  Off Pensacola it will drop to the mid 50's</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common reason in the region is water depth which controls sunlight penetration and mineral content brought in by ocean currents but also water temperature/pH/salinity, human activity to name a few factors. Coral is extremely sensitive and is only able to thrive in perfectly habitable conditions. </p>
<p>Many causes of coral degradation is attributed to the natural cyclicality of the environment which can increase sediment content, alter salinity, change tide exposure to name a few. </p>
<p>Of course human activity can contribute to its lack of growth or existence/degradation as well. Overfishing, toxins brought in by runoff (both can be attributed to human activity and naturally occurring toxins), human disruption to name a few. One cause of coral bleaching most people are unaware of is caused by sunscreen. When swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving in any ocean or body of water it is best to use biodegradable sunscreen as this does not contain oils that will stick to corals and inhibit growth. Just an easy tip to help do your part. </p>
<p>I also didn't mention climate change (until now) as a human based cause because that can be and has been debated in plenty of other threads. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I've lived there for 25 years. One side on the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico on the other with the last key being in the Florida Straits. The Keys themselves are a chain of reef that has built up over millions of years and rising above the water able to sustain life (which is the defining difference between an island and a key). There is coral reef on both sides of the chain.
Are the Keys not considered in the GOM for some reason?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
