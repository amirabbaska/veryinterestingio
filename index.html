		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct!</p>
<p>But the relationship between matter and energy is even deeper than you might think! When we say that &quot;energy is mass&quot;, we literally mean that <em>all energy is mass, and all mass is energy.</em> You can seriously increase the mass of a glass of water by microwaving it.</p>
<p>For instance, say you microwave a 12-oz glass of water that was at room temperature (293.15K) to just slightly under boiling point (373.15K) <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-room-temperature-in-Kelvin" target="_blank">source</a>.</p>
<p>That's a change in temperature of 80 kelvin. The thermal capacity of of water is <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/heat-capacity.html" target="_blank">4.184 joules per kelvin per gram</a>. (That is, it takes 4.184 joules of energy to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree kelvin).</p>
<p>Finally, our 12oz glass of water weighs 354.882 grams.</p>
<p>Throwing this all into the math-blender, we get:</p>
<p>Total energy added = 354.882 grams <em> 80 K </em> 4.184 J/(gK) = 118786.10304 J, or 118 kilojoules of energy.</p>
<p>Now, we may apply <del>Mr.</del> Dr. Einstein's famous equation:</p>
<p>E = m * C^2</p>
<p>Solving for mass, we get:
m = E/C^2</p>
<p>Plugging in our values (including the speed of light), we have:</p>
<p>m = 118786.10304 J/(299792458 m / s)^2 = 1.32167364 * 10^-12 kg</p>
<p>In other words, the weight of your cup of water <em>will</em> be increased by roughly <strong><em>one millionth of one thousandth of a gram</em></strong></p>
<p>Not nearly enough to be noticeable, but interesting nevertheless.</p>
<p>This works for <em>all</em> forms of energy too, including potential energies, such as the charging/discharging of a battery or capacitor.</p>
<p>The key thing to understand here is that, even in extremely high energy processes like fission and fusion, we're not creating or destroying <em>matter</em> at all -- instead, we are either releasing or trapping energy, which also happens to be mass, causing the matter that is <em>already there</em> to become either heavier or lighter.</p>
<p>However, if you can get the energy of your interaction high enough, like in the case of the LHC, matter itself <em>can</em> spontaneously appear, releasing some of the energy as true, physical mass/matter, rather than just increasing the weight (and speed) of any matter that was already present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So in theory, yes. But it would be unimaginably complex and take a truly ridiculous amount of energy to make an everyday object. Even with huge improvements in technology, this will probably never be more efficient than just going out and finding the material you need to make it in a more conventional way. It would probably be used to make tiny amounts of extremely rare matter, or maybe stuff that doesn't form naturally. Even then, there are or probably will be easier ways to do it (such as smashing existing stuff together in a particle accelerator).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In reality it's more complex. E=MC^2 (or M=E/C^2 has it was originally presented) Proves that Matter is a propriety of energy: The more energy a system has the more it weights.</p>
<p>Most of the registered mass of an atom comes from the energy holding the sub-atomic particles together. The rest comes from &quot;regular mass&quot; of those sub-atomic particles.</p>
<p>But yes, It is possible to make matter from energy. Not as a regular 3D printer because we are talking about stupid amounts of energy. associated with radiations and extreme temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

(For simplicity I'm glossing over hypothetical ways to change the total baryon number, if only because doing it on a large scale would be challenging.)

<p>He said it was not necessarily a big deal at the time, in terms of media coverage or public debate.  However, most people supported it.  You have to realize how emotional the country was following Pearl Harbor.  People were scared and extremely angry.  The big worry at the time was that the Japanese would invade the west coast of the USA, especially since almost our entire Pacific fleet was destroyed at Pearl Harbor.  </p>
<p>The Japanese were able to get detailed intelligence on Pearl Harbor by having operatives blend into the large Japanese-American population of Hawaii.  With the threat of an invasion, the powers that be decided to not take any chances.  They did not have a way of ferreting out operatives, so the only option was to isolate the entire Japanese community in internment camps.  They tried to give them good living conditions as best they could (in their opinion at the time).  Everyone was just so focused on the war, that they really didn't think twice about these Japanese-American citizens.</p>
<p>That basically what he had to say.  Interpret it as you will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidifiers and the like do it because they contain a fan.  In all of these cases, it's a safety feature.  </p>
<p>Fans run at different speeds by using different sets of windings in the motor.  These are literally wires that are wound to form a coil, which is part of how an electric motor works.  Using more or fewer windings in a coil changes the speed and torque of the motor/fan.    </p>
<p>If you suddenly apply a voltage to the low speed winding (1), a very large surge of current will flow through it.  If you suddenly apply a voltage to the high speed winding, the surge current will be much lower. </p>
<p>So electric motors almost always are wired so that you go from Off to the high speed winding to reduce the surge current.  This minimizes the chances of the surge current causing a problem (like a fire); it also makes the motor have a longer lifespan. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When plastic items leave the factory, these hydrocarbon chains are semi-randomly entangled, like a drawer full of computer cables or a well-stirred bowl of spaghetti. This is called an amorphous crystal structure, and it happens to be rather transparent to the human eye. </p>
<p>Bending/stretching/slightly heating this amorphous crystal leads to the hydrocarbon chains aligning with one another, meaning the crystal becomes more ordered, more tightly packed (density increases), and harder (work-hardening). This is like the dry spaghetti when they're still in the box: long chains running (mostly) in parallel. This changes the refractive properties of the plastic, making it opaque. Another effect of this process is that the plastic becomes more brittle, which is why if you bend it back and forth a few times, the piece of plastic will break in two along the hardened line you have created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Plastic may seem smooth, but if you look through a microscope, it's a little rough, and reflects only certain colours to your eyes, these are the colour we see to begin with. When you bend or stretch it, it becomes smoother, likens polished surface and reflects more light, and if we see all the colours at once, we see white.</p>
<p>Extra: the reason it becomes smoother is because plastic is made of lots of little long chains of plastic and when we stretch it, they slide over each other to hold on, but it makes the plastic a little thinner as they all squish up and become smoother. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of plastic involved because not all colored plastic items turn white when bent or broken. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>I am holding in my hand a broken 12-inch red rigid plastic ruler that is broken at the 3-inch mark. The broken edge is red all the way through. I just bent the broken ruler enough to make it no longer flat and no white is shown where I bent it, and if I bend it enough it will snap to reveal a broken edge like the one it already has that is red all the way through. </p>
<p>I am now holding a blue bendable plastic straw that I bent and it did not turn white when I bent or cut it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Unconstitutional&quot; = contrary to the Constitution.  &quot;Illegal&quot; = contrary to a law (including contrary to the Constitution).  To some extent both of these things are a matter of interpretation, of course, but when it comes down to it they're either decided in a court of law or not decided at all.</p>
<p>As for &quot;impeachable&quot;:</p>
<p>Before Gerald Ford became President, he was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  At that time, he made a famous, quotable saying about exactly what &quot;impeachable&quot; means:</p>
<p><strong>An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.</strong></p>
<p>That is, in my opinion, actually a pretty accurate summary of the situation.  &quot;Impeachable&quot; is not terribly well defined.  The Constitution doesn't define it at all.  It does define some related ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The House of Representatives is the body that has the power to impeach.</li>
<li>The Senate is the body that has the power to try impeachment cases (i.e. after the House impeaches somebody, the Senate says whether they're guilty or not).</li>
<li>Some detail about how an impeachment case is tried (for example, it's required to be heard before at least 2/3 of the Senate (<strong>Edit:</strong> misremembered this - it's 2/3 for conviction, not 2/3 for hearing)).</li>
<li>Some detail about the limits of punishment of a conviction for impeachment (can't be more than removal from office and barring from holding future office, something like that).</li>
<li>If the defendant is a civil officer of the US (e.g. the president), and the impeachment is for &quot;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;, then conviction will result in (at least) removal from office.</li>
<li>The president's pardon power does not extend to impeachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it's silent on what a person can be impeached for.  The &quot;treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; thing is the closest it comes to doing that, but it's not really that.  It's just saying IF that's what you're impeached for, then here's the minimum punishment.  It doesn't say those are the only things you can be impeached for.  And even ignoring that, it doesn't say what &quot;other high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest difference is that &quot;illegal/impeachable&quot; is meant to refer to actions that are &quot;criminal&quot;---things like theft or corruption or graft.</p>
<p>Many of those things might be unconstitutional as well (if done in an official government capacity), but unconstitutional is a larger umbrella that covers official government actions that turn out to be unconstitutional but aren't &quot;punishable&quot; except in that the courts will tell the executive it doesn't have the power to do that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Nixon hired private goons to break into his oppositions headquarters to steal documents. </p>
<p>In the first case the president is trying to change law to fit with his and his constituents beliefs. Elected officials are always trying to push the law one way or the other and that this constitutes a healthy democracy. </p>
<p>In the second case a paranoid man is hiring people to perform illegal activities. Any person should know better, and the president more than anybody should know he's not above the law. </p>
<p>That's an anecdotal attempt at the difference as far as I see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is predicated on either the legislature or the courts doing their constitutionally mandated job, the issue is they do not do this. Or they only do this when it is for &quot;questionable&quot; personal behaviour or when it comes to the internal affairs of the US and/or the rights of US citizens and not when it relates to foreign affairs or the rights of foreigners.</p>
<p>When the Reagan administration ignored the law and congress to trade arms with Iran, via Israel, to use the profits to fund right-wing death-squads in South America, or should i rephrase that, cocaine smuggling right-wing death-squads in South America, the legislature and the courts let him get away with it.</p>
<p>When the whole Bush administration was involved in the most horrific war crimes imaginable, torture, kidnapping, waging aggressive war, based upon lies, the Democratic party controlled legislature and the Obama administration did nothing, despite these crimes fall under federal stature for which the death penalty applies (causing the death of a protected person as defined by the Geneva convention is a federal capital crime). </p>
<p>The people that ordered the torture that resulted in the death of innocent people should of hanged based upon the Nuremberg principle. The US government hanged top Nazi's for the same type of crimes.</p>
<p>The courts also let the government get away with murder when national security is invoked or the evidence is deemed so secret that the plaintiffs can't prove the evidence exists or that they have standing.</p>
<p>Given these facts I think it is fair to say that the President and his administration are for all intents and purposes above the law and in the modern era there is no such thing as unconstitutional and or illegal/impeachable and executive privilege is unfettered and limitless in practice if not in theory.</p>
<p>The worst part is you can't even really blame the current administration, they are only taking advantage of &quot;facts on the ground&quot; created by a succession of previous administrations, Republican and Democrats alike who pushed the boundaries over and over without holding each other to account.</p>
<p>Speaking personally it angers me a lot that Obama and the Democrats had a opportunity to end this but chose instead to codify many of the abuses of the Bush administration into law and by default or design handed the current administration a turn-key system of oppression. The current administration is also safe in the knowledge that even if they start illegal wars, even if they engage in mass-surveillance on a global scale, even if they murder and torture, then the next Democratic administration, the one that is protesting loudly now, will do nothing to punish them once they get voted back into power.</p>
<p>I know this is not what people want to hear but it is reality, so please consider the facts before you react to me reflexively or defensively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are wondering if Trump can be impeached if his Executive Order regarding refugees is declared unconstitutional, the answer is &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>Likewise if Congress passes laws that are later declared unconstitutional, the members of Congress who passed or drafted that law are not criminals for having drafted and passed an unconstitutional law.</p>
<p>The Constitution grants certain rights to people by forbidding <em>the government</em> (not individual people) from infringing upon those rights, with language such as &quot;Congress shall make no law&quot; and &quot;no State shall&quot; and &quot;shall not be denied or abridged by the United States.&quot; The Constitution places limits on the actions of the government, not individual people.</p>
<p>The remedy for a law or executive order that is declared unconstitutional is to strike down that law or order, not to criminally charge the people who passed it or issued it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If the release of dopamine is too low you will end up being sad, if it ends up being higher you will be glad.</p>
<p>Essentially you release the dopamine based on a subject then once you get that subject if it pleases you less than imagined you are sad due to being use to that level of dopamine or less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who are not happy, especially those who are just incapable of genuine, self-generated happiness, believe that something else will make them happy. The next toy, the next car, the next house, the next job, the next SO, whatever. It's always some other thing that will cause their happiness. They're not unhappy because they're unhappy people; they're unhappy because they don't have the right external thing. </p>
<p>When they get the next thing, after experiencing a brief &quot;happiness,&quot; they realize that it only makes them happy for a little while. It brings fleeting joy, at best. It isn't an answer, it is merely a distraction. </p>
<p>That thing stops making them believe they are happy, so they need to move on to the next thing. Worse, the first thing reminds them that they can't be made happy by the things they thought would do it, so they want to discard it entirely. </p>
<p>In a child, with a toy, this is understandable and good. Adults should, but unfortunately often do not, grow out of the expectation that the rest of the world should cause their happiness, rather than expecting them to find their happiness within. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A case of be careful what you ask for, because when you get it, you may not like it.

Or how the Republicans wanted to win the presidential election at any cost, but the candidate from their own party that won may do more damage to their party than anyone expected. Or the management position you always wanted, but once you got it you realize the stress of being a manager isn't as personally rewarding as you thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love and excitement of a challenge or power grab, but once you get it there is no challenge to get excited about. Like the guy who hopes to date a specific girl, but once he does looses interest.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there,
I used to be a sound engineer and then a hearing aid repair guy for a few years after so here's my input anyway. It may be tinnitus, but just to be sure, check your electronics in your quiet room, It could be a telly or a power adapter or something as well.  You could try unplugging everything and seeing if you still hear it, you'd be amazed the noises some of these things can make. Also if the noise goes away after while on its own then its an effect  being around too much noise during the day and your ears are readjusting, as someone else mentioned in the comments (You should still take precautions if this is a regular occurrence). If however it doesn't go away you should look at making some adjustments, like turning your headphones down, or wearing earplugs if your workplace is too loud etc..
Tinnitus is in fact repairable to a certain degree, but if the damage to your ears does go too far, it can be irreversible and cause you a lot of trouble in the future.</p>
<p>So TLDR theres no need to panic, but you should start looking after your ears</p>
<p>Hope this helps you</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a medical professional, but my best guess would be that your ears are acclimating to the silence (relatively...it's never completely silent). You're bombarded daily with a cacophony of noise and when it suddenly goes away, your brain is trying to makes sense of the lack of sensory input. Another idea might be just the blood flow in your ears, like when you &quot;hear the ocean&quot; in a sea shell. Since there isn't something to amplify it, you just get a general wall of unidentifiable sound. I think another thing to consider is the fact that most of us live in close proximity to many different electronic devices. They make noise, albeit small noises. Even the lights themselves make noise. When the power goes out in your home, you hear that 'pop' and a sound like the noise draining from the house, everything powering down. You may hear the &quot;silence&quot; of electrical static in the background. Just a few thoughts though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

First, it's worth noting that honeybees have largely bounced back from the Colony Collapse Disorder (presumably what you're referring to by &quot;dwindling population&quot;) epidemic of ~2006-2013. CCD was a weird, difficult problem and we may never truly understand what caused it, but neonicotinoid pesticides combined with varroa mite infestations and subsequent disease seem to be the general suspects.  </p>
<p>We have indeed genetically modified honeybees for desirable qualities using good ol' fashioned selective breeding. Bees are considered domesticated, and there's several major lines in production that are cold-tolerant, honey-producing, etc. Noteworthy to decline is we have produced lineages which are termed &quot;hygienic&quot; and behave in such a way to reduce the impact of varroa mite infestation. We can and do artificially inseminate queen bees, but it doesn't seem to take well. We probably could genetically modify bees with modern gene techniques to be even better, but honestly that's a load of paperwork, effort, and funding to fix a problem that's not really a problem.  </p>
<p>Lastly, honeybees are already an &quot;invasive&quot; species in the United States. They were brought over from Europe a couple centuries ago. You could release a ton of them but there's really no point. There are already feral colonies pretty much everywhere filling the available niche. Interestingly, they don't seem to compete with native bee species but actually have synergistic effects in some areas such as pollination. Right now dwindling native pollinators are the big issue and there's a bit of effort to conserve them and utilize them in agriculture, but by and large honeybees do a great job so there's little economic incentive and probably not much hope in the long run.</p>
<p>Edit for Clarity: Bee populations tanked rapidly over ~6 years due to CCD which stopped in 2013. Populations of bees have recovered and remain stable <em>HOWEVER</em> bees are failing to overwinter or otherwise die early at increasing rates. Right now, we can compensate by simply producing more bees. We don't know exactly why, and as CCD showed us, we don't want to be caught in a situation where we suddenly have no bees and no alternatives. It <em>is</em> a cause for concern, but we are not presently in any sort of &quot;beepocalypse&quot; <em>for the moment</em>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we will kill them again! And because bee populations aren't as endangered as they are portrayed.</p>
<p>Anyway half-related story time: My parents own a house that was owned by an extremely old couple. The back yard had raspberries, roses bushes and sunflowers etc all neatly kept. Well the lady that sold the house to my mom told her not to kill the bees under the shed and to protect them from the neighbors, because they were the reason she had the most beautiful flowers in the neighborhood. This bee hive was massive, and the bees would form a constant black cloud in the far corner of the yard, but they never hurt us (four young kids), so my mom left them. The nosy neighbors next door complained about the danger constantly (I would guess that they were 50-60, never any children around) but their entire back yard was an industrial garage and five feet of patio where the set up chairs facing our yard and watched us play all day (creepy nosy fucks). We moved and my mom let her brother (who also has young children) rent the house. Same complaint from the neighbors about his kids being in danger, but nobody ever got stung so the bees stayed. Eventually the neighbors waited for them to leave the house and went into the yard and killed every single bee, even though the bees were on the opposite corner of the yard from where their patio bordered and they never went near their plantless yard. The house has crappy plants now, and all the fruits and vegetables in the yard stopped producing. Bees will be fine if people would let them live. I think all the endangerment fuss is aimed towards stopping needless destruction (not creating more bees) because they would be fine if everyone wasn't so hell bent on killing every bug in sight. In a way, it scares people into stopping their stupid behavior, rather than putting money into making them people proof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We basically can/are. As a beekeeper here I can tell you that while there was and is still massive death, we have the ability to create more bees quite easily. The total population isn't so much down, as the death rates are massively up. </p>
<p>Bees are constantly dying year round. We try and start the summer with around 1000 hives, by fall we usually have about 800 left, and after a few months in California we usually hit a low point of about 600.  For some bad years those numbers would be 1000, 600, 300. </p>
<p>Once spring rolls around we split one hive in half, buy a new queen for the &quot;baby&quot; hive, and turned one hive into two. On a good year we can split hives once and by the time spring rolls around our remaining hives are get back up to 1000. On a bad year we might have to split all our hives, wait a few months and then split them all again. </p>
<p>Splitting one good hive results in two weak hives, and spitting a weak hive results in two barely alive hives. The more times you have to split a hive, the longer it takes to reach a productive size. They spend the whole summer growing to the size of a good hive and don't end up making as much honey as a larger hive would. </p>
<p>TL;DR: The CCD problem isn't as bad as it was made out to be. We do have the ability to create new hives but it is expensive and results in less efficient bees.However, If the downward spiral gets out of control it may become impossible to keep up the bee population. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me preface this question by saying I have always been a firm believer of evolution. However, I've puzzled over many strange results of evolution and how they got to be where they are. Carnivorous plants are one example. How can a plant GRADUALLY evolve the ability to trap insects and absorb them without use of its roots? Did it just start out as a mutation that made a plant kind of sticky? It seems like such a radical change and the intermediate steps don't necessarily seem beneficial enough to ensure greater than average reproductive success.</p>

The carnivorous trait did not happen at a single event, but rather occurred multiple times. Theory for enzymes: plants needed to develop chitinase and proteases to destroy fungus pathogens from invading their tissue. The enzymes and the glands producing them ended up being used in carnivorous plants to breakdown insect exoskeletons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most plants are capable of absorbing at least some nutrients through their leaves, which is why foliar feeding works. There are also many plants that evolved the ability to stick insects to them as a defense mechanism, and in areas with low nutrient levels such as sphagnum bogs or up in trees the plants that were able to trap and absorb insects most efficiently survived very well compared to their cousins who could not.</p>
<p>This is why carnivorous behavior has evolved in several different kinds of plants that are not that closely related to each other, such as Cephalotus and Nepenthes looking very similar despite not being related, Pinguicula using a similar mechanism to Drosera, and Byblis, and so on. There's even an orchid that's debateably carnivorous, but it needs more study to confirm or deny this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing you have to remember is that the &quot;adaptation&quot; is what causes the advantage, unlike Lamar's theory. </p>
<p>The ancestor of the Venus flytrap was probably a plant like any other, but down the line one of it developed a sticky substance around her &quot;flower&quot;, by a conjunct of &quot;random mutations&quot;. Some did something similar, but one that wasn't too sticky let the fly flew away, other was too sticky, and not even one fly got away, preventing it from polimerazing. Others had leaves that close when touched, something other plants can do actually, and when a fly was trapped by this it died and feed the plant. With the past of time, whatever change was tested, and the &quot;better suited&quot; (wrote on the broad spectrum) had descendants that could have a new change. This is a very simplistic explanation though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It’s produced in the adrenal cortex in response to stress (physical or emotional) and to natural cycles that tend to correlate to circadian rhythms. Cortisol makes the body respond more to normal levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, and can therefore cause vasoconstriction which in turn can cause chest pains (which can mimic angina). </p>

Unfortunately, it soon became evident that nothing had changed, and we started arguing over the same stupid crap we always used to. Sometimes the arguments would become so escalated, I could feel the area where my surgery had been done starting to feel sore. That freaked me out to the point where I knew this person and I needed to stop communicating again.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MD with significant clinical experience with pain and close relations with world renowned pain researchers here.  The simplest answer I can gave that it's very complex and any answer on Reddit will be at best incomplete if not totally wrong.  The simplest &quot;wrong&quot; answer is that there is a process that can be simply termed hyperalgesia, which means noxious stimuli that causes pain in a &quot;normal&quot; person causes more pain in a person that has undergone a hyperalgesic process.  So my pain score is 2 and yours is 8.  The process can be so significant that non-noxious stimuli can be interpreted as pain (allodynia).  This process is complex and has a lot to do with central (nervous system) and peripheral sensitization of the nervous system.  Another element of hyperalgesia can come from mood disorders (such as depression).  The biological framework of this is extremely complex and cannot be simply explained by any single process.  To be even more simplistic and incorrect, but kinda true, is that when you feel emotionally down you are more aware of noxious stimuli that was always there but now your threshold for experiencing this as pain decreases.  On top of all this is pain is subjective and placebo effects in treatments are far higher than that of other medications, again tying emotional cognitive aspects to the experience of pain. Hope that helps.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
