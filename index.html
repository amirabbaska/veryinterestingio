		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes. There are a few types of underground water supplies. The first is the water table. </p>
<p>When it rains where does that water go? Well you do see most of it run down the sidewalks, and streets. Where does the rest go? Underground of course. It drains through cracks, and soft soil till it reaches the point of saturation. The bottom of that point is the water table.
For example this water table is at 75ft. You take a drill,or even shovels, and started digging a hole you will hit water (depending on the last good rain) anywhere from just below the surface of top soil to 75ft.  Where you place the pump in that type of well will give you so much water. If you go into a drought that type of well goes dry rather quickly. </p>
<p>The second type of underground water supply is an aquifer.  Aquifers are deep. My example will be the one near me in San Antonio Texas. Surrounding San Antonio you have rivers. Comal, Guadeloupe, San Antonio, etc. They start in the hills, and flow down to the sea.
Rivers are the blood vessels of the earth.  What you see on the surface is just one vain. Underneath them in the cracks in the bedrock are the rest.
All that water from the rain that didn't soak into the ground runs off into the creeks that supply most of the river's water. As time goes on between rain storms the upper layer of soil drains the rest of the water tables into the river. Then the river supplies the underground aquifer.
The San Antonio aquifer is larger than the city itself by hundreds of square miles. Test wells drilled into it at several locations is how it is measured. Every night the local weatherman on the news will tell you what the level is. On average it is around 640 feet.
The water dept keeps an eye on that daily to make sure the population and agriculture have adequate allocations. If it gets low you have restrictions put in place. Like not watering your lawn on certain days. To extreme examples of limiting total number of gallons used per day.</p>
<p>Sorry if I put you to sleep. I know a five year old would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogeologist here.</p>
<p>Generally, groundwater is present in most places across the Earth's land surface. Unlike the picture in most people's heads of underground rivers and caves, the water is usually trapped in the tiny pore spaces (gaps) between rock particles, or in fractures and cracks in the rock.</p>
<p>Part of my job is telling people where to drill wells to get the water they need. Most of the time, it is possible to get groundwater unless the rock is something extremely impermeable like a mudstone or claystone.  Even these rocks can sometimes have fissures that may contain water.</p>
<p>One interesting relationship you can see on maps is the one between river networks and the potential for groundwater.  On mudstone, drainage is terrible, leading to most water getting whisked off by rivers before it has the chance to make it to an aquifer. The density of the river network is far higher.</p>
<p>On a very permeable rock like the chalk here in the U.K., there are far fewer rivers - most of it soaks into the ground and ends up in the chalk aquifer before rivers can form. It's possible to drill wells in the chalk that yield millions of gallons of clean water a day.</p>
<p>Here's a link to an old log of such a well dug in the chalk. It's made of several boreholes, a dug well and a connecting tunnel that they had to lower people down to dig:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wells work by accessing aquifers. Aquifers are not underground lakes, pockets of water, or underground streams. None of those actually exist. Instead, aquifers are usually made of loose or consolidated sand or gravel. There are small spaces (pores) between the grains, like in a box filled with marbles, and water fills these gaps. The pores are connected, which allows the water to flow to areas of lower pressure. Wells are basically holes in the ground, so water flows into them to fill that hole.</p>
<p>How deep you have to drill a well varies by aquifer. To give an idea of how much they can vary, u/Juanfartez said that the wells in San Antonio were about 640 feet deep, but in the town where I am in western Minnesota, the wells are usually about 80 feet, and the aquifer itself starts at about 20 feet below the surface. </p>
<p>Not all places will have aquifers, because not all types of rock store water and allow it to flow. Clay, for example, stores water pretty well, but it doesn't allow it to flow. You can see this by squeezing a handful of wet clay. Igneous and metamorphic rocks like granite or marble only allow water to flow through fractures in the rock. So while they can be aquifers, they generally aren't very good because they can't hold much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello. Pilot here. There are a LOT of inaccurate replies to this post. Let me clear some things up.</p>
<p>Concord stopped flying for a huuuuuuge range of reasons. No one factor or reason killed it by itself, but as a combination they mounted up and where eventually too much. I will list the main reasons that killed it off.</p>
<p><strong>1. A tiring airframe</strong></p>
<p>Aircraft have a shelf life of sorts. Unlike a car, an aircraft is exposed to a lot of stresses and strains during its operational lifetime that weaken it's structure and components. Different parts of the aircraft have different life expectancies (The engines being the largest components with the shortest life expectancy) but generally an aircraft lifespan is measured in something called cycles. Depending on the aircraft, one cycle is either one complete startup and shutdown of the engine, or one take off and landing (Regardless of how long the aircraft is actually in the air). An aircraft can only do so many of them before specific maintenance has to be carried out to extend it's life so it can do more cycles. The more it is extended, the more expensive and in depth that maintenance becomes. Eventually there comes a point where it's just not worth it and it has to be retired.</p>
<p>Concord was getting close to this point. She was an old aircraft and extending her life further and further would soon have come with complications like shortened flight hours, restrictions of movement/speed and all kinds of things that is undesirable in a commercial aircraft. I will allude to this more later, but many people view the Paris Air France crash as the end of the Concord. It wasn't. Her airframe cycle life would have killed her off a few years later regardless, but we will touch more upon that later.</p>
<p><strong>2. A reluctant maintenance company</strong></p>
<p>Airbus had a contract to maintain the Concord and it was said that they where somewhat reluctant to continue on with it beyond its renewal date. Maintaining the Concord required extremely skilled people and sophisticated facilities only a company like Airbus could bring to the table. When Airbus indicated they did not want to do it any more, that was a big problem that did not really have an immediate solution.</p>
<p><strong>3. A downturn in it's economy</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Concord was always profitable. It can never be said to have been a huge source of profit for BA/AF and it might be fair to say it sometimes was closer to breaking even but it never ran at a loss. The reason for this was economy of scale. It ran on a schedule that allowed it to break even. Concord never flew with empty seats. The price of a ticket was astronomical and that reflected its operating costs. The upside of this was that flying on it was almost a zero wait experience that got you from London to New York in 4 hours 15 minutes once check in time was calculated. There where no queues at the airports or checking in three hours early or anything like that. Minimum check in was 45 minutes before the flight, it had it's own baggage check lines and security for only 160 people. Your time in the airport was kept to an absolute minimum. The downside of this was you couldn't book a flight to fit your dates, you fitted your dates round flying on Concord. An aircraft on the ground that isn't flying and carrying passengers absolutely haemorrhages money for an airline, but in the case of Concord the time spent on the ground was unavoidable so it was factored into the cost of a ticket.</p>
<p>That being said, there was a downturn in it's economy that began to pinch into this. As fuel prices and maintenance costs rose, the ticket prices couldn't really begin to keep up, high as they where already and it was predicted its maintenance costs would outstrip what could reasonably be claimed back in it's ticket costs in the near future. This meant at some point, the aircraft WAS going to begin operating at a loss.</p>
<p><strong>4. A loss of confidence and increased safety measures after the crash of an Air France Concord in Paris</strong></p>
<p>Many people like to believe that the loss of the Air France Concord in Paris was the final nail in the coffin for Concord. It wasn't. In fact all other things being equal it would barely have phased BA/AF in terms of worrying about the aircraft's future as the aircraft had a near flawless safety record at that time. At some point in time, every airframe has a crash for some reason. The fact Concord had operated for so long before it's first fatal accident was a testament to the aircraft.</p>
<p>However it was just one of the factors that weighed up against the aircraft.</p>
<p>A lot of safety measures had to be retrofitted to the aircraft after the crash. It's worth noting though if the crash had been directly to do with a fault in the airframe then Concord would likely have been scrapped there and then. It's no secret in the aviation world that the damage to the engine and resulting fire from the tyre debris striking the fuel tanks did not destroy the Concord. Had it remained on the ground and come to a stop it would likely have been possible to get some or maybe all of the passengers off. Sadly what destroyed the aircraft was that the plane took off before it's take off speed had been achieved and the aircraft basically stalled into the ground. Therefore BA/AF where confident that with the adaptions to the engines and fuel tank strengthening the aircraft would be as safe as it could be. However they where hugely expensive to implement and BA/AF where never fully sure of being able to recoup the costs against a potentially nervous and very small (Due to the cost of a ticket) customer base. Then 9/11 happened which further had a bad ripple effect across the airline industry and Concord unfortunately had to take some of the brunt of that as well (One of the huge impacts was no longer being allowed to visit the cockpit of Concord mid flight which was often a big part of the experience).</p>
<p><strong>5. BA/AF did not want to share their toys</strong></p>
<p>After it was announced that the Concord's would be retired, British Airways and Air France had a multitude of offers from several aviation companies to take or buy the aircraft and continue flying them. One of the most likely offers was  from Virgin Atlantic. However Richard Branson did not believe he should have to buy them after they where basically gifted to BA/AF by the French and British governments. As it turns out BA where not willing to continue operating them but they sure as hell wheren't going to let anyone else have the prestige of operating them, and as they legally owned them, they said no. It was entirely feasible they could have had a few more years in them, but BA did not want them appearing in someone elses livery.</p>
<p>Hopefully this clears up the main reasons why Concord stopped flying. It was a shame she stopped flying when she did but make no mistake, her time was coming to an end regardless of any crashes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For two reasons. </p>
<p>Firstly, was the France disaster, where a Concord took off, suffered some major malfunction, and wound up upside down on the ground, with everyone onboard dead. While it was a genuinely magnificent plane (and I did get the chance to see one arrive at my local airport once, when I was a kid), such a well-publicized disaster occurring to one of the very few Concords in the world (iirc, there were only 12 in commercial operation) killed the brand stone-dead. </p>
<p>Work was done go recover things. After years of investigation and reengineering, Concord was prepared and readied to fly once again. A press event was arranged, and a crew of press, enthusiasts, and airline senior bods were assembled for a flight from London to New York, which they hoped would reestablish the Concord as the premier choice for those who wanted fast, luxury travel. The flight was successful, the landing event for the press went exactly to plan, and everything seemed poised for success. And then, just thirty minutes later, the first plane hit the World Trade Centre. Concord's return was overshadowed by about the single worst thing that could possibly overshadow it. </p>
<p>The aviation industry took a long time to recover from those attacks. Concord's relaunch didn't stand a chance, and was given up on in mid 2002.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Concorde was never a financial success.  It cost as much as a 747 to operate, with a third of the passengers.  And when you figure all the non-flight time involved in door-to-door travel across the Atlantic, it wasn't that much faster, you are still going to waste most of your day in transit.  Finally, because of the sonic booms, it could only travel at full speed over the ocean.</p>
<p>Then in 2000, Air France flight 4950 hit some debris on the runway during takeoff, ruptured a fuel tank, and wound up crashing into a hotel.  Over 100 people died. The Concorde was grounded for a while, and by the time it returned to service, 9/11 happened, result in a decrease in air travel.  The airplane was also badly outdated and due for a major upgrade.  British Airways and Air France instead decided to pull the plug at that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of what other people have been saying, the relative time advantage of a faster flight disappeared.</p>
<p>Let's say the flight is 3 hours vs 6 hours. That's twice as fast, that's a big deal. You could easily wake up in the morning, fly to Europe for an afternoon meeting, and fly back home in time for dinner with your family. Indeed, this is how they originally pitched it.</p>
<p>Over the years, airports have become busier, security has become tighter. You can't just hop on a plane anymore. You need to show up for your flight a couple hours in advance. Factor in the extra time you spend getting to/from the airport because a lot more people fly these days. Pretty quickly, the whole advantage of having a flight that's faster starts to disappear.</p>
<p>Even if you had the Concord available today, you couldn't really fly to Europe for your meeting and get back the same day anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually TWO effects here.</p>
<p>One is evening out the <em>aerodynamic</em> stability.  If you have a bent arrow shaft, it drifts to the right.  If it rotates 90 deg, it drifts up to the left, another 90 deg, back to the left, another 90 deg, drifts down, and over the long range, it just takes a spiral path but the center of the spiral is dead-on in the long run, but it's hard to gauge how wide the circle of a bent arrow will be, and what the angle of that offset will be where it actually hits.  Net result, if you're a master archer, the bent arrow may spiral in a 1ft radius and basically hit with +/- 1 ft accuracy of a perfect aimpoint at 10 yards AND 100 yards.  If it did not rotate, it might drift 2ft at 10 yards and 50ft by 100 yards.  And you'd have no way to know which way it'll drift, or how far, it's random.</p>
<p>The other is <em>gyroscopic</em> stability, which requires higher RPM.  It keeps the bullet from turning.  This is always accompanied by aerodynamic stability, already covered.</p>
<p>Arrows don't do that second one, BTW.  Commonly they only rotate about once per 20 ft.</p>
<p>Early musket balls and cannonballs got limited benefit from this.  They have a nasty instability in back which spinning only helps marginally.  Yes, golf ball dimples would have improved them greatly, but they didn't know, and would have trouble manufacturing it.  </p>
<p>In the 1840's the Minié ball (which isn't a ball, it's a &quot;bullet shape&quot;) was invented and changed everything.  Those were revolutionary for a number of reasons, but really benefiting from rifling was a big one.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile</a>)</p>
<p>Cannonballs were spherical until the mid 1800's.   Initially, cannonballs were just iron balls, bouncing and rolling through a crowd smashing through people.  They did use rifling in later cannonball-firing cannons.  Those NEEDED to be spherical to maximize bounce.  Since about 1800, they'd been using spherical &quot;shrapnel shells&quot;, exploding cannonballs, which didn't technically need to be spherical because they didn't bounce, but they didn't quite figure that out.  Mid 1850's, they realized they could make a cylindrical shell and the now-familiar pointy nose and fit more volume of explosive inside and it would benotably more accurate and longer-range.  Pretty much all cannons were rifled by then anyhow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most bullets will not be perfectly symmetrical sure to flaws in the manufacturing process. These flaws will cause a bullet to naturally veer during flight. Think of a plane with the tail kinked slightly to one side, it will not fly sight without constant adjustment from the pilot. Since bullets cannot be stress once shot, one way to deal with this natural tendency to veer off is to spin the bullet to balance out the veering. If a bullet would normally veer slightly to the left, then spinning it causes it to spend half that time upside down as it were and it veers back to the right.</p>
<p>Think about an American football thrown in a spiral. The football is not a perfect ovular shape, because it has stiches on one a side that create increased drag. Spinning the ball causes those stiches to spend the same amount of time create drag in every direction rather than throwing it without a spiral where the stitches always stay on the same side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically things are lazy, they don't want to move, but you can motive them and once you do, they don't want to stop. </p>
<p>They also have a hard time changing directions, because that would imply in stopping in one direction than having to move in another. </p>
<p>Rotations are changes in direction in time, every moment it's slightly different. </p>
<p>Now like I said, thing are lazy, if they have to move, then so be it in only one direction and at a set speed, any changes are annoying. But if they have to change directions, then let it be in very small ways, so it's acceptable to them rotating. </p>
<p>For the last part of this basic understanding, is that the faster it is made to move, the harder you need to motivate them to pick up speed AND the harder it is to get them to chill, making them stop (this is key to the question at hand). </p>
<p>This is true for the bullet and for the air, so when interacting, the one that's the laziest will win. </p>
<p>Air is an whole country's army, but it's in peace so the soldiers are dispersed. </p>
<p>The bullet on the other hand, is a small but firm gang trying to bring havoc into the land. </p>
<p>If the bullet goes in one direction and just pushes the air, then they'll start uniting (accumulating) and can more effectively stop or change that direction. </p>
<p>Now if a bullet goes foward but is ALSO rotating, then you did a lot more motivational speech to it, so not only is it flinging the air soldiers all over the place and thus they can regroup, it will take a lot more soldiers to make it change it's direction! </p>
<p>TLDR: Motivated objects will fling the air soldiers so they can't regroup and will need a lot more soldiers to contain it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Not well, because of many factors, namely wind resistance.</p>
<p>Ok, so crumple up the piece of paper into a ball and throw it. How does it fly?</p>
<p>Not well, but slightly straighter. Still because of wind resistance. This time it slows down too quickly.</p>
<p>Ok, so throw a ping pong ball, and how does it fly?</p>
<p>Again, not well, still because of wind resistance. This time it flies further and straighter, but still slows down too much.</p>
<p>OK, so make it denser. Take a musket ball and shoot it. How does it fly?</p>
<p>Better. Much better. But it still flies off in one direction. This is still because of wind resistance. As the ball flies through the air, it hits patches of air that are different pressures, temperatures, or velocities (wind speed), and it pushes the bullet off path.</p>
<p>OK, so let's make the bullet really aerodynamic. Now how does it fly?</p>
<p>Better, but still gets pushed off too one side or another.</p>
<p>OK, so what happens if we spin the bullet?</p>
<p>Ah, now we get to the good stuff. When you spin the bullet, a certain amount of energy is stored in the rotational energy of the bullet. Because of the physics of centrifugal/centripetal motion, any effort to turn or move the bullet is resisted by the energy in the spin of the bullet. So if the air wants to make the bullet turn, and therefore veer off to one side, it gets resisted by the spinning energy of the bullet. Now, the bullet can still turn, but the forces acting to turn the bullet need to overcome the rotational energy of the bullet in order to get it turning (and therefore veering off path).</p>
<p>So in the end, a bullet that is spinning will (to some degree) stay in the same orientation as it flies, and the biggest factors affecting its motion will be gravity and wind resistance that slows it down (since neither of those two are affected much by rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's all pretty mysterious, even to doctors, but one theory is that it has something to do with the way our brain stores &quot;taboos&quot; in a separate part of the brain. An example of this is when you see Alzheimer's patients devolve into using foul language. They've lost access to their normal vocabulary, but this separate storage unit is untouched by the disease for now. So, if you think of TS as random muscle twitches, corprolalia is a twitch of the &quot;say bad words&quot; muscle. </p>
<p>The most common response when I have to explain my TS is &quot;I wish I had that, so I could curse whenever I wanted.&quot; I don't have corprolalia, but I still say &quot;Fuck You.&quot; That's like saying you wish you were in a wheelchair, so you could park in the handicap space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to have moderate/severe Tourette's, with swearing as one of my tics. There are two subsets of tics: vocal tics and motor tics. Both of them are caused by uncontrollable muscle movements, either in the vocal chords or other parts of the body. To diagnose Tourette's, <a href="https://www.tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/what-is-tourette/" target="_blank">at least two motor and one vocal tic must be witnessed over the course of a year (top of second paragraph)</a>. This means that you can have swearing tics (known as Corprolalia) without Tourette's.</p>
<p>Vocal tics have another subset, known as phonal tics. Vocal tics are grunts, sniffles, or other non-word related noises, whereas phonal tics are either words or more complex phrases. Coprolalia falls into the phonal category, as well as random or out-of-context words.</p>
<p>According to tourette.org, <a href="https://www.tourette.org/resource/understanding-coprolalia" target="_blank">fewer than one third of all people with TS exhibit this symptom at some time during their lives. (bottom of first paragraph)</a>. There have not been many studies on Coprolalia, and our understanding of it is limited. All we know is that it is neurological in nature (it's encoded into the nervous system, not something that can be controlled).</p>
<p>Tourette's in general is a difficult subject for researchers to understand. Because of the complexities of the brain and nervous system, it's hard to determine what causes Coprolalia to happen in some patients, but not in others. We do know Tourette's is hereditary, but unfortunately, we do not know what causes it to happen.</p>
<p>Hope this response helps!</p>

<p>Tourette's is a neurobiological disorder characterized by physical (motor) and/or vocal (which doesn't mean words, just sounds) tics.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, but close.</p>
<p>For a detonation to occur, you need a nuclear bomb, which is a very complex and precise machine. This is probably too complex to be assembled by random natural processes. The closest which happens naturally is when Uranium ore deposits form, and then reach a supercritical concentration of fissile isotopes, which is rare. Then, you get a runaway fission reaction. It doesn't go &quot;Boom&quot;, but it releases a lot of heat and radiation, as well as daughter isotopes.</p>
<p>The best known examples occur in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" target="_blank">Oklo</a>, in Gabon.</p>
<p>It has been discussed in previous posts:</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>
<p>We're getting a lot of posts in the thread along the lines of &quot;How is it possible that the formation of a nuclear bomb by natural processes is impossible when the formation by natural processes of complex intellects such as our own has occurred?&quot;  </p>
<p>This is a false equivalency. In simplest possible terms: both examples are not under the action of the same processes. The concentration or fissile material in ore deposits is under control of the laws of inorganic chemistry, while our own existence is the product of organic &amp; inorganic chemistry, plus Evolution by natural selection. Different processes obtain different results; and different degrees of complexity ensue.</p>
<p>That being said, the current discussion is about natural fission and whether it may or not achieve detonation by its own means. Any posts about the brain/bomb equivalency will be ruled off-topic and removed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Naturally occuring conditions on earth are unable to create supercriticalities - you dont get a proper fissile mass compression, and fissile mass will not be homogenous, nor will it have proper isotope composition (for uranium weapon grade fuel, think 93-98% U235 purity. For comparison, reactor grade is ~3-5% enrichment, and natural ore that is deemed economically viable, is within 0,01 - 0,1%).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How can we estimate that the golden record on Voyager will last a billion years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can't, really. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As the pre-poster wrote in space you have a barrage of &quot;small particles&quot; that might wear anything away. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have radiation that also wears material away, it is little, but it is there. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not know what exactly is out there at the fringe of the solar system, there's theories/observations that there's an area (large!) with solar winds, we have no idea what the effects/long-term effects of this are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, at the end of the solar system, is the Oort cloud. It is icy particles and... stuff? We don't know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really do not know about our solar system and much, much less in specific about what is beyond. </p>
</li>
<li>A billion years is a very long time. A <em>very</em> long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we do assume that because the record is from gold there are not many chemical reactions happening. As we assume that there is not that much radiation out there and gold is pretty robust (the gold atoms are pretty heavy) we assume it cannot really wear it down. As it is pretty cold out there we assume there is not much happening inside the material (&quot;heat&quot; is basically just movement of atoms and as it gets cold, they move less). As we assume that, while it is &quot;stuff&quot; out there it is not &quot;dense&quot; in any way we use the term here on earth, there is not much physical interaction (note that even gas clouds and asteroid fields still constist of &quot;basically nothing&quot; if we use our earth-bound terms for &quot;a lot&quot; and &quot;basically nothing&quot;). Couple 1.-5. with 6. and... we can assume it will survive a very long time - but we really don't know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The golden record is an interesting topic, and I read a cool <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/11/11/9702090/voyager-golden-record-pictures" target="_blank">article</a> about it recently. As far as it last a billion years, we would never really know. There is of course not that much to hit it, except of course some dust. In fact, the record actually contains a piece uranium that can be used to date it. For all we know, some other life form could find it before a billion years has actually passed. Could probably always get hit some rock anyways, although that chance is extremely small.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most computer scientists would say yes. The brain occupies a finite amount of space and since the universe is discrete, there is a finite amount of information in there. Personally, I'm not too comfortable with the number of assumptions being made with that logic, but my position on that matter is controversial.</p>
<p>I do know that to say the brain's storage reduces to the number of neuron connections is probably not correct. It's far more complex than that. There is also a dynamic electro-chemical state between and within the synapses which has some information storage capacity--various ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, for instance. Things like &quot;are you happy&quot; probably aren't stored in a chart showing which neuron is connected to which other. You can take a pill to change that variable.</p>
<p>Then, unlike a regular computer, the brain and the body has evolved an extremely integrated interface with its environment such that it's often difficult to tell where you draw the line between brain and not-brain. For instance, what about your body temperature? It effects cognition, and is in a feedback path with the brain. Could that be considered a form of storage? There are many examples like that.</p>
<p>It's often forgotten that information is specific to context. A forgotten language can only be deciphered if we actually share something with the lost civilization-- feelings, biology, environment.  The brain is weird because it creates its own context.</p>
<p>Since the brain is so closely integrated with its environment, its identity can become blurred and it can become unclear <em>where</em> the brain actually is. Your brain organized your room and now your room effects your cognition. Is your room information storage? You have a romantic partner. Your brain interacts with them and changes them. Now they interact with you and change your cognition. Are they storage? The [transactive memory hypothesis] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactive_memory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactive_memory</a>) builds on this idea and suggests there are memories that we can only have or have better when we're together with someone we've interacted with before.</p>
<p>You could say that these external sources are just external and thus we can ignore them. But your environment, which your brain is changing, effects you whether or not you ask for it. In that way, the external is really not so external. Your environment is not like a USB flash drive. You can't unplug it. There are numerous examples of what happens when you try to unplug it. Extreme isolation for example. The brain just breaks down in these contexts.  So environment is actually part of you.</p>
<p>If the brain doesn't have well-defined limits, then measuring its capacity is going to be incredibly difficult. It could still be a number in bytes depending on which physics you subscribe to. It's commonly believed that the whole universe has a finite storage capacity. If so, then even a brain without a skull limit still has a universe limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Computers store information as states of &quot;on&quot; or 1s and &quot;off&quot; or 0s. A single one or zero is a bit, and 8 of these put together (at least in most modern computers) is a byte. But brains don't work like that at all. We store memories as connections between nerve cells, so bytes is not a very applicable unit to measure brain capacity with. A more accurate measure of brain capacity is the number of connections in the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i think this is a bad comparison. our brain seems to plot experiences into the neuronal network and thereby is able to see similarities to a previous experience. thus, we have no &quot;storage&quot; and &quot;processing&quot;. the overall activity at one moment is the information experienced.</p>
<p>technically, the brain is non-binary (it does not store bits and bytes), it measures time between activities (neuronal firing) which is a complex number, and quantifies this information (threshold levels for input triggering activity from the cell); it can multitask and consider various levels of analysis at the same time -- this allows it to be fuzzy and very apt at pattern matching.</p>
<p>when you count how much a person can learn, you get bytes, but this is really not the good way to see the brain. it does not store things in this way. the more you learn from one thing, the easier is the storage for still more, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a hard question to answer.  Of course, since we occupy finite space, our properties must be finite.  But the exceedingly complex structure of the brain and other systems (such as the nervous system) makes it hard to calculate the amount of &quot;data&quot; that we can store. </p>
<p>We don't have a way to measure resolution of life or the quality of everyday noises.  Such a calculation can vary extremely on a person's perceptive ability.  Most of our memories are vague recollections, barely any measurable data, linked in a series of firing neurons that connects those vague ideas into one clear thought in our RAM (Short-term memory).  </p>
<p>However, we can estimate average capacity, although it has no clear meaning in our terms of cognition.  That number would be 2.5 petabytes (2,560 terabytes, or 2.814×10^15 bytes).  </p>
<p>Even so, this number varies as well from person to person.  The memory space used is also selective based on a subconscious &quot;hierarchy of importance&quot;.  Some people remember numbers best, while some people remember images best.   These have a direct impact on how much we can know.  Other factors can influence it as well.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most large rockets use very cold propellants. What you see is mostly ice due to the condensation of water in the air on the very cold tanks. As the rocket engines start it falls off due to the vibrations.</p>
<p>In a rocket you need to bring not only your fuel, but also the oxidizer (oxygen) to burn it. You also need a lot of it while keeping the whole rocket as light as possible. The reason you want very cold (we call them cryogenic) propellants is to be able to store more in a smaller and lighter tank.</p>
<p>There are two options to make the propellant take as little space as possible. If the propellant is a gas you can compress it. The issue is that then you need very strong and thus heavy tanks. The other solution is to use a liquid. However a lot of the good rocket fuels (like hydrogen) and oxidizers (like oxygen) are gases under normal conditions. The solution is to cool them enough (-183C for oxygen for example) that they become liquid and then launch the rocket before it boils off. To give you an idea of how much space you save, liquid oxygen is 861 times denser than gaseous oxygen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I just wanted to write this to clarify the difference between a shuttle launch and say a Saturn V launch. The shuttle launches never had ice fall off of them. The orange tank was well insulated with a foam layer and to my knowledge never had any significant freezing condensate form on any of the tanks. The solid boosters didn't have cryogenic storage. </p>

<p>We have learned to rely more on visual stimuli than on tactile so in the brain visual stimuli is superior. That means that if we kiss with our eyes open what we see will be at the center of our attention rather than the subtle feeling of kissing. If we close our eyes on the other hand it's a lot easier to focus on the kiss.
You can try this on your own. Have someone kiss an area on your back. You won't feel much. Then close your eyes and try again, the feeling will be more intense ... </p>

<p>So my guess is that it's not innate because it's not universal, but I don't have a hard-and-fast study to back this up.</p>
<p>1: In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman points out that when faced with a question we can't answer, we often substitute a similar yet easier question <em>without realizing it.</em> For example, if we can't answer the question, &quot;is this behavior innate?&quot; we may instead answer the question, &quot;is this behavior influenced by some biological limitation which makes the result of closing our eyes more likely?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, my understanding is that kissing is thought to be an entirely learned behavior for modern humans, despite some evolutionary basis for the practice.  But those explanations (kissing was about pre-chewing tough food for infants and grew into a sign of affection by representing this maternal behavior) still revolve around the kissing <em>symbolizing</em> something, so I would classify it as a cultural trait rather than some sort of innate behavior like sneezing or seeking valuable nutrients in food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We tend to close our eyes any time we are really enjoying a sensation.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ever smelled something. Like really, really smelled something? What did you do? You closed your eyes, leaned back, and probably let out a big sigh after.</p>
<p>When we do things, especially sensory things, we use body language to express what we are doing, even if doing so doesn't really help us achieve the task. We close our eyes when we use the other parts of the face so we can focus on what we are doing and ignore everything else.</p>
<p>Also try kissing with your eyes open sometime. It's kinda fun. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
