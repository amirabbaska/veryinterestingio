		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider your feeling of a persons &quot;attractiveness&quot; as a unconscious evaluation of that persons health, success, ability to take care of him/her self, potential as a mate etc etc. </p>
<p>These are really only relevant in the initial stages of a relationship. As you get to know them further you get more information from other sources than looks and your relationship (whatever it is) becomes more established. The relevancy of your attractiveness rating becomes diminished and it is therefore no longer benificial for you to judge them as harsly in either direction. </p>
<p>For example: &quot;Attractiveness&quot; can be a good tool for figuring out which potential mate it is best to invest time &amp; resources in on limited information. But once you're in a commited relationship judging the attractiveness of your partner as harsly is less relevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you meet a really really good looking person for the first time, the only thing you know about them is their looks. Since that's all you know about them, you will first think, &quot;Wow, they're really really good looking. Every other part of them must be just as good looking.&quot; But, after a while, you start talking to them and getting to know who they are. And maybe from those interactions, you begin to find out, &quot;Oh, maybe they're not as great after all.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you meet a very ugly person for the first time, you will first think, &quot;Ew, this person is ugly! Gross! Every other part of them must be ugly too!&quot; But, after a while, you might start talking to them and getting to know them too. And maybe from those interactions, you begin to find out, &quot;I was wrong, this person is actually pretty cool!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if you weren't five, I'd say it's all about first impressions and either holding high or low expectations of a person purely based on looks. Getting to know people over time changes those impressions and depending where you first hold them, it's easier to go to the opposite side.</p>
<p>However, this phenomenon isn't always true. You'll meet people in life who can be both attractive on the outside and inside as well as ugly on the outside and inside. Everyone's different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allmost all genetic traits like eyecolor or skin color are influenced by many genes. In this specific example, most genes that code for skin color also code for eyecolor. Fair skinned people have brightest eyes way more often, and dark skinned people with bright eyes really stand out because of its rarity.</p>
<p>Bright skin was adaptive to sustain vitamin D production in the skin with less sun. Bright skin contains less melanin, which gives the skin and the eyes it's darker color. Bright eyes don't have an optical advantage, the iris always blocks light, no matter the color.
Maybe after the first bright eyes appeared, there was some sexual selection because they were outstanding, or it made communication easier because the pupil increase due to arousal is much easier to see in bright eyes.</p>
<p>Tldr: bright eyes are a side effect of less melanin in the skin to allow Vitamin D production. Also Sexual selection</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All eyes are brown eyes. The posterior most layer of the iris (posterior pigment epithelium) is brown in all eyes. Lighter color eyes appear the way they do because of a difference in the more anterior layers of the iris. The difference between light and dark eyes is not due to different pigments. The tyndall effect, similar to why the sky is blue, is the primary reason light eyes appear the way they do. Light colored eyes dont actually have a definite color. Since The color the iris is perceived to be is dependent on scattering of light, the ambient light will influence what color the iris appears to be. Some one can appear to have green eyes in certain lighting conditions  but more blue in others.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the effect of color on peacocks. Their feathers are all brown but it is the microscopic structure of their feather that create various light scattering effect producing what we see as vibrantly colored feathers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Migraine medications, for example, do not actually take migraines away but prevent them from starting. Imitrex is a popular one. It works by being taken when &quot;warning signs&quot; start for migraines, mainly called auras - as a sufferer, you usually see rings or glowing outlines to dark objects in bright light. Once you notice these symtpoms, you have to take the Imitrex to prevent the blood vessels in your skull from dilating and opening up. If you're too late, then the blood vessels will expand and the medication specifically PREVENTS them from expanding - they won't constrict the vessels back down if they already inflated.</p>
<p>Other headaches are variations of this, and for most people, avoiding foods that cause blood vessel dilation throughout the body (nitrates and nitrites) and staying thoroughly hydrated can keep headaches as rare as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most headaches happen in the nerves, blood vessels, and muscles that cover a person's head and neck.

<blockquote>
<p>Assuming they’re evenly spaced out across the world’s cities and towns, and maybe a village or two, this will annihilate 94 kilometers (23 cubic miles) of land immediately – but that’s nothing compared to what happens next.</p>
<p>232,000 square kilometers (90,000 square miles) of infrastructure will be blown away by the air blast. That’s about 295 metropolises the size of New York City turned to dust.</p>
<p>A fireball 79,000 square kilometers (31,000 square miles) will vaporize literally anything it touches, and anyone within a 5.8 million square kilometer (2.2 million square miles) area would get third-degree burns. So everyone in the same space as 3,700 cities the size of London would be scorched.</p>
<p>Lastly, the fallout and ionizing radiation would contaminate an area of the world about 284,000 square kilometers (110,000 square miles) in size and give most of the initial survivors radiation sickness. Of course, a lot of this fallout would reach the lower atmosphere and spread across the world, so casualties would be far higher in the long term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means that a fireball adding up to the size of Maine would be instantly vaporized. </p>
<p>People would get 3rd degree burns in an area the size of half of Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

On a planetary scale the earth is small, but on a nuclear explosion scale it's pretty big. Depending on the spread and altitude of the nukes you could easily kill 99% of all life but not the entire planet.

<p>Space is a bit different and poses other problems. The explosion in space would do little immediate damage, but the after-effects could be very very bad. </p>
<p>The blast wave would likely destroy the orbits of almost every satellite orbiting earth, either by directly knocking them out of their orbit or by causing a chain reaction of collisions in space. Basically, a massive sphere of space junk would make future space launches almost impossible. </p>
<p>Then you've got the emp and radation that would slam into the earth. Best case scenario is temporary electronics blackouts and a total loss of GPS. Worst case is blasting the entire planet with radiation. So we all die, but slowly and painfully. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, just wanted to clarify some things. Severe malnourishment has several sequelae (outcomes) depending on what exactly is lacking in the person's diet. The two that most people are familiar with are (1) Kwashiorkor - the kind with the really big belly and (2) Marasmus - The kind where the people look like walking skeletons.</p>
<p>In marasmus, there is generalized severe malnourishment. These people are sick because they are lacking sufficient calories, thus they become incredibly skinny - they are literally wasting (actual medical term) away.</p>
<p>In Kwasiorkor, there is sufficient/close to sufficient caloric intake, BUT there is INsufficient PROTEIN intake. This means that the diet is mostly rice, corn, etc. Your body needs proteins for countless things such as building muscle etc. It also needs proteins to transport fats (not soluble in blood/water) throughout your blood stream. These 'transport' protein are called lipoproteins and are made in the liver. Without these proteins, the fats consumed by the body get trapped in the liver, leading to fatty livers (contributing to the big bellies). Also, proteins are needed to maintain the proper fluid volumes in your body (I won't get into this now) and without it, you retain water, contributing to fluid retention (medically called edema), and thus also making the bellies bigger. </p>
<p>I hope this helped :) </p>

<p>Interestingly enough, kwashiorkor gets its name from what an African tribe called it.  Translated, it means &quot;disease of the deposed child&quot;.  What would happen is that when a 2nd child was born, the first child would be abruptly cut off breast milk and put onto a more adult diet high in carbs and low in protein.

Plastic surgeons work on the hands, the face, sometimes the skin in general, as well as doing cosmetic implants, etc. Some sub-specialties get very specific, and each specialty encompasses multiple more-specific sub-specialties.

I've seen so many specialists its really inter how specific you can get in subspecialties.
I've seen a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon, a thoracic surgeon that specializes in hepatologic medicine who mainly does pediatric liver transplants and surgeries. He wrote an article about me and my surgery that he performed. Check out the spring edition of pediatric surgery 2007. Im 16 year old female with giant hepatocellular adenoma secondary to oxycarbazepine therapy. Published by Drs Superina and Feingold iirc. </p>
<p>I've seen a pediatric/adolescent psychiatrist. Was so sad when I aged out because they're not very common and in demand so he couldn't keep seeing anyone once they turned 18. He's now head of peds psychiatry at that hospital.
I saw a pediatric rheumatologist and several infectious disease specialists. (got my pic in a medical book for that, it was cool) </p>
<p>As a transplant recipient I see a hepatologist (liver doctor) a dermatologist (skin) a neurologist/epileptologist (brain/epilepsy) and gynecologist (reproductive) now, as well as a GP. In pretty good health 8 years post transplant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, most perfumes are alcohol based.  Alcohol is very volatile, and the majority of it evaporates quickly after leaving the bottle.  That's why if you ever talk to someone selling perfume (sometimes you can't help it), they tell you to let the scent mellow for a little bit before you really know what it will smell like.</p>
<p>The compound that gives things like onions and garlic their potency is released when you cut into them, and is intended as an irritant.  This was to ward off things that would otherwise eat the onion in the original habitats.  Side note, these compounds have the ability to destroy the cells of dogs and cats, so should never be fed to them in any form.  </p>
<p>The compounds released by cutting onions convert their amino acid sulfoxides to sulfenic acid.  This what makes you cry, but also what sticks to your hands, and is very difficult to remove with normal washing.  Most guides say stainless steel will help to remove the odor, and I've found it usually works for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How do you convince bodybuilders to get recorded? How do you victim's to get recorded? How do you convince anyone to get recorded? </p>
<p>Most documentaries about freed criminal revolve around either their experience in prison or what led them to be in prison (and its usually something negative about the situation). If you ask someone who believes they were wrongly convicted to talk about their wrongful conviction to educate others, then a lot of them will talk about their negative experiences. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey cool I do this for a living. I'm a Producer/Shooter for documentaries and have landed interviews with some dangerous folk.</p>
<p>I'm actually starting production on a docu-series on hate crimes in America and have some interesting interviews coming up.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ways this happens.</p>
<p>Ideally you have an in or connection of some sort that can vouch for you. That's usually huge, but difficult depending on the project.</p>
<p>If not, first you have to find them, usually they don't want to be found. Luckily I work with a wondeful team of researchers who do this part for me most of the time. Once you get their contact, then you basically just ask and explain that you are a journalist/documentary filmmaker who wants to get their side of the story out. One of my colleagues just went on a fishing trip with a subject so they could talk and convince him to be interviewed on camera. It's all about trust and explaining that their story and perspective is worth telling, and that if they don't do it, people will never know it. It's tricky, it doesn't always work. Some people just don't want to talk on camera and will avoid your contact and depending on how badly you need that specific person you usually just fiind someone else who fits the credentials. If you really need that person you work at it for a long time sometimes establishing the trust.</p>
<p>Then you just gotta do it. I'm a pretty friendly guy so once people meet me in person it tends to get pretty easy, I can usually get people talking in a relaxed way that will help them open up a little more comfortably.</p>
<p>Edit: Some really good questions coming in. Will try to answer them all but I'm prepping for a shoot this weekend so I'll have to come back for some</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR Criminals are people. People want to be heard, they don't think they are evil. You just have to gain their trust, make them trust that you won't reveal their identity.</p>
<p>It's not as difficult as people assume.</p>
<p>I always explain to people when they ask about this that even &quot;dangerous&quot; people aren't usually crazy. When thinking about murderers, drug dealers, smugglers, and other general criminals the violence associated is usually targeting a specific group (rival gangs, police, etc)</p>
<p>When I interviewed some gang leaders in Brazil they were actually happy to talk about the issues affecting the favelas and their way of life. They felt like they were the good guys protecting their neighborhood.</p>
<p>In one instance I walked into a neighborhood in Istanbul and had a bunch of masked men hold molotov cocktails up to our faces while threatening us for trying to film. The next day we had a local call a shop associated with the guys and they apologized to us and invited us to have drinks and do the interview.</p>
<p>I know one guy who actually went to get drunk and stoned with some militant extremists for a few days so that they would trust him (potential ethical violations for sure)</p>
<p>But that being said, it is hard sometimes. In my experience black hat hackers are the hardest to get on camera because these people tend to be smarter than your average criminal and won't risk breaking OpSec for a TV spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Researcher here.  It's dangerous but basically you have to show them you're honestly not going to turn them in.  There are data collection protocols and legal protections for researchers to study criminals and crime.  Essentially, the government can't force you to hand over information that is deemed confidential through research.  It's called a certificate of confidentiality, but there is still some debate as to how much it can protect you legally.</p>
<p>Good research protocol will obtain only the necessary information and avoid or later destroy unneeded sensitive information.  We don't want to harm those we study and are ethically bound to protect subjects.</p>
