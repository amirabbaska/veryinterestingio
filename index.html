<p>An orgasm is, partly, an uncontrolled muscular spasm. By tensing up your legs, you're tensing up other things, and by other things, I mean your ass, since it's hard not to when you're tensing your thighs.</p>
<p>When you tense up your ass, you also tense up everything in the general pelvic area, including the muscles involved in the orgasm. In this way, you're helping those muscles reach the point of necessary release faster than they would on their own, leading to a quicker pay-off.</p>
<p>It also seems more intense because you're involving more of your muscles in the process, combined with the relaxation of everything once you finish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measurements of G are affected by a large uncertainty ultimately because gravity is very weak.</p>
<p>You would think it would be fairly easy to extract an estimate of G from orbital dynamics. However, all gravitational effects from a body of mass M are proportional to the combination μ = MG, the standard gravitational parameter. The μ of a celestial body is very easy to determine once you can measure orbits around it (or, if you're lucky enough to be standing on it, the surface gravity), and indeed the μ of most solar system objects is known to great precision. </p>
<p>However, to extract an estimate of G from μ you'd have to divide by M... and you don't know M. We do not have very precise independent estimates of the masses of planet and stars. The G extracted from this method has a relatively huge error.</p>
<p>Thus G can only be measured through the gravitational effects of <em>prepared</em> bodies with well known masses, which need to be much smaller than planets. So you are now measuring extremely weak gravitational fields generated by man-made objects in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment" target="_blank">Cavendish</a>-like experiments. This gives a more precise estimate of G, but still with an error comparably larger than all of the other fundamental constants simply because of how small the forces to be measured are, and how hard it is to shield from noise.</p>
<p>Going back to the planets, G measured from Cavendish-style setups is the most precise determination, so you actually use <em>that</em> estimate to extract one for the masses of celestial bodies through M = μ/G. That's how you get the known figures for the masses of the Earth, Sun, etc.</p>
<p>For contrast, hbar is known to definitely better precision because it can be determined directly through a variety of not-as-fragile experiments. An example (not necessarily the best) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_balance#Measurements" target="_blank">Watt balance</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measuring G is hard*. It's extremely weak, it can only be measured if you have first found the mass and distribution of <em>everything</em> you're working with, and even then, you're in danger of thinking you're measuring gravity when you're actually measuring magnetic interactions. Or static electricity. Or floor tilt. Regardless, you can do an experiment where <em>your</em> value of G look like it's accurate to, say, a few parts per million, but for some reason it doesn't match the value of other peoples' measurement of G. Since we don't know who is right, we have a very large uncertainty in our value.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When measuring hbar, you are working with point particles, something with an explicit position with relatively small errors. </p>
</li>
<li>When measuring G, you need a collection of point particles to obtain a detectable signal. Usually you use a sphere, which has symmetry which allows you to say it's an effective point particle with all of it's mass at the middle, but this is an imperfect assumption because your sphere is most likely imperfect. And here is the main point: <strong>Because you cannot prove your spherical mass is perfect EVEN if it is perfect, your uncertainty on its results are going to be bigger.</strong> You could literally measure G to its true value (whatever that may be)  to 100 decimal points, but you would never be able to believe your result well enough to express your value to as many decimal points as we know hbar. </li>

<p>Might be a dumb question, but it's bugging me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An excellent question in my opinion, or at least one I've wondered about on my own before. </p>
<p>There are a few ways to look at this, and it is often far more illuminating to see a problem from multiple sides so I will briefly talk through two lines of thinking.</p>
<p>The first is to consider the balance of energy; the motivation for your question is that the water molecules must have gained energy in order to move upwards. It is certainly true that the gravitational potential of the water+paper once the water has soaked upwards is higher than before, so this energy has come from somewhere.</p>
<p>The truth is that the total energy of the system clearly includes more than just the gravitational potential energy, it also includes the surface energy which is the energy inherent to the interface, the bonds, between two substances.  The easiest way to imagine surface energy is to consider a droplet, it is obvious that the bonds between water and water is stronger than water and air because otherwise water would not clump into a droplet, it would want to spread out, to maximize it's surface area in order to decrease the total energy of the state. This means that water-air has a high surface energy. This is not the case for the water-paper interface which is very low energy since the water molecules can have strong intermolecular forces with the molecules of the paper.</p>
<p>As such, our water wants to increase the amount of contact it has with the paper as it will be at lower energy but doing so increases it's gravitational energy so you reach a new equilibrium where the water will soak up the paper just far enough such that the increase in gravitational energy of the system is equal in magnitude to the decrease in the total surface energy.</p>
<p>Another way of exploring this is to consider the force of adhesion; if you have ever looked at a glass of water then you will notice that the fluid at the very edge clings to the side slightly, lifting the surface at the edges in opposition to the surface tension which wants to minimize the surface area. This is because the molecules of the glass have stronger bonds with the water than other molecules of water so they pull the edge of the liquid up slightly. This is another manifestation of the lower surface energy of the water-glass interface compared to the water-air interface.</p>
<p>If you had a narrow glass tube then you could imagine that around all sides the water is being pulled up. If we imagine a column of water being lifted, the extra gravitational potential will be proportional to the radius of the tube squared (pi * r^2 * h) and the adhesive force will proportional to the radius of the tube (2 * pi * r) then there will very clearly come a cross over point where, as you reduce r, the adhesive force overcomes the gravitational force.</p>
<p>This is the origin of the upwards force in a capillary tube and your paper, which essentially is entirely constructed of small channels, or tubes which water can flow through, also has a capillary force in it. Allowing it to suck up the water.</p>
<p>Hope that was interesting or at least answered your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Adhesion of water to the walls of a vessel will cause an upward force on the liquid at the edges and result in a meniscus which turns upward. The surface tension acts to hold the surface intact. Capillary action occurs when the adhesion to the walls is stronger than the cohesive forces between the liquid molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy for the water to go into the napkin is similar to the energy that dissolves sugar in a glass of water, the favorable between-molecule (aka intramolecular) interactions between the individual water molecules and the napkin molecules - which as long strands of carbohydrate cellulose. The energy for the water to go into the napkin also has to do with entropy - the statistical likelihood of distribution of matter as well as energy. Water has an uneven charge distribution because the oxygen atom has more of a pull on the electrons than the hydrogen atoms. This makes it have a net negative end and a net positive end - an electric dipole. Cellulose is made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen true to its name. It also has many dipoles. The oxygen-hydrogen motif lends to a relatively strongly interacting dipole called hydrogen bonding because of the magnitude of the electrical charge distribution difference.</p>
<p>Though water does indeed interact energetically favorably with itself due to these dipoles, it can also hydrogen bond with the cellulose fibers of a napkin which also contain oxygen-hydrogen patterns which are called &quot;-hydroxl&quot; groups. It is such that water-water interactions can be similar to the interaction between the water and the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. </p>
<p>But if it's similar in interaction and presumably about equal in intramolecular energy profiles then why does the water spread up the napkin? Our universe follows the law of increasing entropy. If you put a drop of dye in a glass of water, our intuition says that the drop of dye will spread through the glass with time. Things and energy tend to spread out. Like I mentioned before, this is terms entropy and it has an associated energy as well. </p>
<p>So let's do the reverse - getting water out of the napkin. You squash the napkin with your hand and the water boops out into a pool. Clearly you've put energy into the water-napkin system. Your hand energy broke up the water-hydroxyl intramolecular energy and got the water to go back to interacting with itself. If you leave the squashed napkin in the pool of booped water then the napkin probably won't reabsorb like it did unless it's a premium brand paper towel. What's different? </p>
<p>Well a new dry napkin doesn't have hydroxyl groups of the napkin interacting with each other, it's more fluffy so the hydroxyl groups interact with the air. When it's wet and squished however, the situation is changed - the hydroxyl groups of the napkin are probably interacting with other hydroxyl groups of the napkin with something resembling hydrogen bonding but probably not exactly like it as the oxygens and hydrogens won't be able to line up just right. So there's a reduction in bond energy here - the water isn't coming in and making new hydrogen bonding interactions anymore, it's coming in and breaking up hydrogen bonding style interactions to replace them with hydrogen bonding interactions - not as favorable. The smooshed together fibers also have less room for the water, so the water can't spread around as easily in an entropically favorable way. When the smooshed napkin dries it still has its fibers interacting with each other and so it can become kind of hard in texture. </p>
<p>Summary: The energy comes from water molecules interacting with the hydroxyl groups of the napkin which were previously interacting only with air, and from entropy - the universal law where things spread out (or assume the most probable microstates).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horrible answers so far. Mortgage Loan Officer Here!</p>
<p>There are only two things (there's more, but that's getting into nitty gritty and this is ELI5) that determine how much money they will loan you, specifically for a mortgage.</p>
<p>1) Debt to Income Ratio. Take all of your monthly obligations THAT ARE REPORTED ON YOUR CREDIT REPORT (no your phone bill doesn't count as a debt. Yes, your car loan does), add them up together, and divide by your GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. That is your debt to income ratio (or DTI). Your DTI needs to stay, generally, under 45% for you to qualify for a Conventional mortgage. There are exceptions though, like if you have large cash reserves then we can increase the DTI threshold for you.</p>
<p>This all went into effect in 2010 through the Dodd-Frank Act and the Ability To Repay Rule (ATR).</p>
<p>2) Appraisal. Lenders will only loan you an amount for either the Appraisal or Sales Price, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>Those are the only two factors that influence the loan amount. Credit score has a role in it, but it's insignificant for ELI5 purposes. Credit score just influences the interest rate and there is a minimum credit score. However, someone with a 600 credit score can qualify for just as much as someone with an 800 credit score as long as they have the income for it.</p>
<p>Of course, there is much more to mortgages than just these three pieces, but this is the answer to your question for United States Mortgages.</p>
<p>Edit: I've been answering questions for a bit now. I need to get back to work. I'll answer more when I get home. In the mean time, I'd like to invite you all to check out /r/mortgages</p>
<p>Edit 2: Alright, I'm back to over 120+ messages and comments. I'll try to answer them all. Just know that I can't answer everything simply because they're too complex and would require me asking you for an entire cabinet of files to prove various things. Common questions I will edit back into this original post.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different countries have very different rules. As a simple overview, the UK <em>generally</em> lends 4.25x your gross income as long as that is no more than 95% of the house value. If you earn £20k, we'll lend about 85k, so you need to put in about £4,500 of your own funds you can buy a house at just under 90k.</p>
<p>Due to new rules (refered to as MMR) we now also check how much money you'd have each month if your mortgage was charged at a high interest rate (normally 7%), after accounting for bills/creditcard/Loans. If it's below a certain amount, we'll decrease your lending amount until it fits the bank's threshold. </p>
<p>The less (as a percentage of the house value) that you put in yourself, the higher the risk to the bank, so the higher the rate you get charged. In the above example you'd likely be around the 5% mark. If we leant you the 85k, and you put in 85k of your own, the bank's risk is seen as much lower, so your rate would likely be around 1.5% instead. </p>
<p>Credit doesn't come in to the amount we'll lend to be honest. It's pretty much a pass/fail test, it doesn't say what we could safely lend you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the country. </p>
<p>Here in Norway the bank has a pretty easy way: They can only lend maximum 85% of total purchase sum, and no more than 5 annual salaries. And you should also be able to withstand a 5 point increase in interest rates. (i.e if the interest rate goes from say 3% to 8%) </p>
<p>So this means that you need a 15% down-payment, and can't borrow more than 5 times your annual salary. </p>
<p>Before the housing crash, the down-payment was lower. But the gov. figured out that by regulating the down-payment rate, they could save themselves from a disaster, and shield obviously underfunded people from buying property. </p>
<p>Thought I'd give you an perspective of how it works around the world. </p>
<p>edit: Also, you get 27% deduction on all the interest you pay. So that makes the loans a bit cheaper in the long run, and makes ownership even more appealing from the start, than renting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Man, American terminology is weird, &quot;debt to income&quot; ratio doesn't make sense to me the way you guys use it.  In Canada, we have debt service ratios (DSRs), which represents the amount of your gross monthly income that needs to be used to service your debts.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a Canadian perspective...</strong></p>
<p>There's three high-level considerations that need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>1) Will you make your payments?</strong>
We essentially consider income and credit.  If you have good credit (Beacon/FICO of high 600s and up), you will likely qualify for something.  From there, a lot of it comes down to DSRs.  There's a Gross DSR (GDSR) and a Total DSR (TDSR).  Your GDSR is calculated as your monthly housing costs (mortgage(s), property tax, strata fees, hydro) divided by your GROSS income (before tax).  TDSR is similar, but you include all of your debt obligations (housing + car payments + loan payments + CC payments, etc).  Generally, banks want GDSR &lt; 35% and TDSR &lt; 45% (but this can very a little by bank or if you're using an alternative lender).  Obviously your house price will be directly tied to this calculation, so there will be an inherent cap created here.</p>
<p><strong>2) Are we safe if you do not make your payments?</strong>
This comes down to the security, i.e. the value of the house.  On a purchase, typically loan-to-value (LTV) is capped at 95%, i.e. you need to put at least 5% down.  On a refinance or equity take-out (ETO), LTV is frequently capped at 80%.  So if you are purchasing, you will be limited to a mortgage equivalent to 19 (95 divided by 5) times your down payment (i.e. the house price can't exceed 20 times your down payment).</p>
<p><strong>3) Are the regulators okay with it?</strong>
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) has many different rules, but a common one has to do with LTV ratios.  They are particularly concerned about people with weak credit, self-employed, not citizens, or large home prices (in the millions... so a big deal in Toronto and Vancouver right now).  On those, the bank will generally limit mortgage amounts accordingly to stay compliant with the rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a banker in the retail and private banking sector for over 3 years in the UK. This is how it works here.</p>
<p>Firstly, you either have a sole or joint income to take into consideration. They will use your gross figure you earn. They will work out your monthly outgoings such as food, council tax, bills, childcare and anything that will remain once you have a mortgage. The bank will give you a decision in principle, a decision in principle is known as what indicative figure the bank will lend you. It can be up to 4.75x your income, it's dependant on lender and what their criteria is. You won't get credit searched for a DIP, it's soft scoring and won't leave a footprint say for a full credit search such as taking out a lending product.</p>
<p>Example: Mr A earns £20,000 per year.  In principle a bank could lend him 20k x 4.75= 95,000. The bank wouldn't normally provide a full 95,000 and you would contribute a deposit towards a property. The larger your deposit, the better for the loan to value ratio. The more deposit, the cheaper your mortgage will be in the long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The magnetic field is an entirely unrelated (at least, for all intents and purposes) force reliant on the movement of the inner and outer metallic cores of Earth creating a dipole magnetic field. As /u/iorgfeflkd said, the magnetic field pulls towards the poles, versus the monopole of the gravitational field simply pulling bodies towards the Earth from any point on it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How did humanity physically discover that space has no breathable atmosphere?</p>
<p>By the time we had high altitude balloon tests and jumps in the 1950's, we were aware of the vacuum of space to an extent and were testing experimental space suit technology with the US Air Force. They were concerned for the safety of pilots who had to eject at more and more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird" target="_blank">extreme heights</a> as aviation technology progressed. </p>
<p>They were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_military_parachuting" target="_blank">HALO jumps</a> of a sort, and we discovered never-before-recorded effects of high altitude, low atmosphere environments. Temperature, radiation, chemical composition, thickness, none of this was available to scientific bodies prior. </p>
<p>It was called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Excelsior" target="_blank">Project Excelsior</a>&quot; and, had NASA bore their advice to heart concerning 100% oxygen environments, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1" target="_blank">Apollo I</a> disaster would not have occurred. They may not have 100% escaped the atmosphere, but their findings paved the way for the technology that made the Saturn V series possible.</p>
<p>How did we know about the vacuum of space before that? As primitive as it sounds, dogs and primates were launched into space via rocket to verify conditions before the human attempts that followed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika" target="_blank">Laika the dog</a>, for example. On-board sensors (SUPER  basic computers by today's standards) recorded vital signs and conditions within and exterior to capsules after launch.</p>
<p>And finally, before that we could postulate and hypothesize about what space is made of, but had no practical way to verify it outside of mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using only existing transmissions - you'd get to around 2-3 light years before even our strongest current TV, radio and etc. signals become indistinguishable background noise from the cosmic microwave background radiation. This can be calculated using the inverse square law as /u/lunchlady55 mentioned.</p>
<p>However, these are broad transmissions that use lots of power to make sure the transmission reaches the largest area possible. This is great if you want to send data to many different locations that are relatively close, and if you aren't exactly sure of the coordinates/location of where you want to send the data - you want a wide range so anybody close by can tap into your signal.</p>
<p>But we have ways to extend that 2-3 LY range by a lot. With our current technology, we could aim the signal in a very narrow beam at a specific location instead of an expanding &quot;sphere&quot; of transmissions centered on the broadcaster; this would extend our range to somewhere in the realm of 500 LY.</p>
<p>Here's a visualisation: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/f6s93yv.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/f6s93yv.png</a> - Earth being the blue circle, and the range being the green area. The targets are the red rectangles. This is horribly, <strong>horribly</strong> not to scale - only to show a concept.</p>
<p>See how the green area has a much smaller area even though it reaches further away? This means we can get much further out with less energy, since we're sure of where we want to aim it and don't have to send out a huge 'sphere' of communications to reach the red rectangle (our target) - it's unnecessary. </p>
<p>So, in summary - if we set another Earth around 2-3 LY away we'd only be able to detect the transmissions barely. However, if they shot a very focused beam directly at us, we could set them much further out - around ~500 light years, depending on factors like the transmitter, receiver, what part of the EM spectrum you used (radio, micro, infra etc.) and size of the detector.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, I made that graphic in Microsoft Word... it got the job done, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No need to make your TV signal so strong it can still be received around Vega. Our best bet for detecting a &quot;twin Earth&quot; would be looking for signals of early warning radars. Their signals are (or used to be) enormously strong and, by design, have to be aimed into space. They're also more directed than omidirectional antennas, reducing loss over distance. But I couldn't tell you how far their signal reaches. My educated, unscientific guess would be a few dozen lightyears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without going to much into detail (this is ELI5 after all):</p>
<p>Why Japan is not facing a crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japans debt has a very low interest rate, which makes it easier to pay off.</li>
<li>Japan is a rich country, and so it can afford to pay off the interest it owes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> thanks to u/mustbemoney for reminding me:</p>
<ul>
<li>A significant amount of Japans debt is owned by the Bank of Japan. In effect one branch of gov owns the others debt, obviously BoJ is going to be more lenient with the Gov than EU with Greece.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why Greece is in trouble:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its debt is at a high interest rate</li>
<li>Its debt is attached to a currency it has no control over, the <strong>EURO</strong>. If their debt was in Greek Drachma's (currency prior to euro), In an extreme and unlikely scenario,It could print out more money and pay off its debt (this would of course make it harder for them to raise money in the future, since investors will not trust them. This would also lead to inflation. It would also cause other stuff I am not qualified to ELI5 because of their complexity)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I'm pretty sure you're thinking: &quot;But isn't GDP the Wealth of a country? I mean, if I'm making 50k a year and I owe 50K in loans, aren't I better off than a guy who makes 100k a year but owes 300k?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, GDP is an indicator of a Countries Wealth, <strong>not its Governments Wealth</strong>. Greece's government doesn't &quot;make&quot; the GDP, it makes what it can tax from the GDP, and then after it is done with government spending it can use what's left to start paying off debt. What's left is very little because of multiple factors, some of which but not all are:</p>
<p>edit: to be clear, the </p>
<ul>
<li>The Governments inability to get people to actually pay taxes (they're doing better than they used to).</li>
<li>The fact that raising taxes and/or cutting social programs <strong>will</strong> slow down the economy making it harder to make more money.     </li>
<li>Some social programs cannot feasibly be cut (e.i: the Greek version of social security) or risk destroying the country
-Greece is not growing very fast for various complicated reasons (aging pop is one)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>To use the example of :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guy A</strong> that makes 50k a year and owes 50k </li>
<li><strong>Guy B</strong> that makes 100k a year and owes 300k</li>
</ul>
<p>If <strong>Guy A</strong> has expenses of 45k a year (rent,food,etc..), he will only have 5k left to pay off debt. </p>
<p>If <strong>Guy B</strong> on the other hand could have expenses of 60k a year and will have 40k a year to pay of his debt, making him better off than <strong>Guy A</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to add that Japan's huge debt is a big concern, but since they are able to afford their interest payments, they have lower interest payments, which makes their interest rates lower, which makes it easier to afford their interest payments, which....</p>
<p>Because I just had this argument with a friend I'm going to add something here:
The <strong>BoJ</strong> has the power to print more money to fulfill interest payments not the Japanese government. This means the BoJ could refuse to print money to pay debt obligations (in a worst case scenario), but in reality wouldn't because of the negative effects (i.e Japan defaulting). Clarifying that here.</p>
<p>Also typos...
more typos...
Jeeze... so many typos !</p>

<p>Greece had debts in the Euro. It's debts were controlled by foreigners.  The Greek economy went bad, and it was German and French banks that wanted money back. The economy went down and it couldn't pay its citizens or the debt. And it couldn't get more money from its own citizens. </p>

<p>Greece is an assistant manager at Kinkos, who lied on a bunch of credit card applications and lived too large for a few years until it all caught up with them.  Even though they owe less than Japan, even as a ratio to their income, their job is much less stable, so the interest is higher and their creditors are much less patient.  They also live in their parents' basement, so they have no house to sell to get them out of trouble.

It's like they owe 200,000 USD at 0.05%, and have an income of 100K a year, so they need to pay 100 bucks every year. They can afford that.</p>
<p>Greece owes most of its debt to outsiders and at a much higher interest rate. It's like they owe 5,000 USD at 10%, with a 5K a year income, so they must shelve 500 USD every year. That's already a much more significant amount.</p>
<p>So Greece must pay five times what Japan has to pay although its debt is much smaller. Then you consider that Japan's population is 12 times higher, this means, per person, Greek people must pay 60 times what Japanese do.</p>
<p>That's the reason why Japan is not in dire straits but Greece is: Japan owes money to itself, at 0% interest rate while Greece owes money to the mafia at high interest rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Japan can print their way out of debt should they wish, but doing so increases their costs of lending and is not sustainable long-term.  Which is why the Japanese have taken steps to decrease their long-term debt.</p>
<p>Greece, on the other hand, owes a bunch of countries, mainly Germany and France, a shit-load of money in Euros.  Since Greece can't just print Euros, they have to actually earn them through tax revenue.  Additionally, the Greek bailout came with onerous terms for the country that many, including the Greeks, believe will make the debt impossible to payback.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, B.A. in psychology here.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this: if a person with schizophrenia doesn't ever hear speech, would they still hear voices? </p>
<p>The thing about schizophrenia is that it falls under the categorization of psychosis, that is, a departure from reality. In order for someone to be classified as a schizophrenic, their separation from reality would be identified given an already established reality, namely, that people should not hear a person's voice talking when there is no such external stimulus. &quot;I can hear my own voice in my mind though,&quot; you might say. That is not the same since it is not a perception. It is not an external stimulus interpreted by your brain. In a schizophrenic or other psychotic individual who hears voices, the brain perceives the voice as if it is an external stimulus, or at least that is what we are able to determine based on individuals' descriptions of said voices. However, the individual is still aware in most cases, depending on the intensity of the psychosis, that the voice is in their head.</p>
<p>Thus, the issue can be anywhere in the brain areas related to auditory sensation, perception, and of course all other related mental networks, such as those of memory, speaking, language analysis, etc. The way our brain functions is that we perceive what is happening in the world outside our minds by complicated processes in our brain and body that TRANSLATE an external stimulus like sound into patterned signals that we can understand. </p>
<p>Something to consider - If a person DOES hear voices given they have never heard human speech, including their own, as a result of drug use or mental illness, then we can conclude that there is a very strong genetic component, something in our DNA, that &quot;remembers&quot; what human speech is. Guess what? Studies have shown that a deaf person who has never heard human speech in their life and has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, DOES describe hearing voices. Isn't that fascinating? Given this information, this means that the cause for hearing voices may not by a separation from reality... it may not have to do with external stimuli. Perhaps, it is something very deep in our DNA. No surprise there, schizophrenia is quite heritable. In the case of paranoid schizophrenia, 30-40% of siblings will share it. That is, your chance of having Par. Schz. are significant if your sibling has it. Amplified by the use of drugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To understand why hallucinations occur, you must first understand how the brain works on a fundamental level.</p>
<p>The brain is what we would call a 'feedback mechanism'. Essentially this just means that is primary function is to take in inputs (stimuli / 'the feed') from its environment (the world) and then produce an appropriate response ('feeding back' input to the world) through moving your body. Afterward the results of your movement result in new stimuli from the world. Essentially it results in a constant cycle of action and reaction. </p>
<p>There is obviously a lot more to it which I don't cover, but more relevant to this subject, the brain itself is composed of various sections which all control and perform different functions. Some process thought, some process your visual sight, some control and process memories, and some process sound. </p>
<p>All of these various sections are linked up together, too. They constantly reference each other, feeding input and output to each other. So, the brain is also composed of its own internal feedback mechanisms, with its own unique cycles.</p>
<p>Essentially, all reality as we know and experience it is controlled by all of these loops. Everything you hear, everything you see, and everything you feel is composed of these loops. This is the primary key to understanding where hallucinations come from.
Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>During an auditory hallucination, what is actually happening is that rather than the usual feedback cycles in the brain simply processing inputs, some sort of stimulus causes a loop which is referencing the exact same auditory processing functions as the ones which create 'sound' in one's mind, along with some semi-cognitive functions or memory retrieval (or likely both). Basically, it's a 'broken loop'. </p>
<p>In other words, instead of a simple stimulus travelling its normal route of pathways in the brain, it striggers a sort 'detour' route through different pathways and along the way it collects both sounds and 'ideas'. The result is someone experiencing thoughts in the form of spoken words, or other sounds, in a way that would seem 'real' in exactly the same way as any other sound would feel real. This is because it is created within exactly the same methods as everything 'real'.</p>
<p>tl;dr version:</p>
<p>Your brain creates reality through a bunch of loops and when one of these loops gets mixed up it creates a different kind of reality that seems just as real as the one you normally experience every day.</p>

<p><strong>The answer is we don't know</strong>. Searching my institutions medical database says there is preliminary data indicating that strange activity in the auditory part of the brain (superior temporal gyrus) is partially responsible. That's it? </p>
<p>Yes, sounds dumb and it's certainly disappointing, but that's it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I don't know where they come from but I hear it with my ears like it's outside of me.  Usually tells me to do akward or bad things.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between an inner dialogue and hearing voices is typically the voices they &quot;hear&quot; are derogatory or command type. No idea why. Worked with this population in hospitals. We dealt with effect not the cause.
