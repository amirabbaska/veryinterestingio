		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a very quick summary of the new science reported today, and what it means for the future of gravitational wave astronomy. </p>
<p>This event, <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/P170814/public" target="_blank">GW170814</a> is similar to the three events seen before. The black hole masses are in the 20-30 solar mass range. </p>
<p>The remarkable thing today is that this event was seen with 3 detectors. Past events had all been seen with just the two LIGO detectors, in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA. This event was <em>also</em> seen by the European VIRGO detector. </p>
<p>So why is this important? First, it allows you to make measurements of gravitational wave polarization. Just like light, gravitational waves can be polarized. The detectors are slightly tilted with respect to each other, allowing us to resolve 'more' of the signal, essentially. </p>
<p>Additionally, the three detectors allow us to localize the event far better than before. This means we know what direction in the sky it happened. For past detections, events were <a href="http://www.ligo.org/images/faq-localization-comparison.jpg" target="_blank">localized to a ring</a>. We get this by knowing that gravitatoinal waves move at the speed of light, so if the signal arrives slightly earlier at one detector, we can localize it to a ring in space. With three detectors/detections, you can do proper triangulation. This has made the localization 20x more accurate (<a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P170814/public/main" target="_blank">see Fig 3</a>). See <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/913090863164645376" target="_blank">a comparison of the localization of all 4 events here.</a></p>
<p>Improvements in localization will be necessary for studying new gravitational wave sources, such as neutron star mergers. Gravitational wave detectors are passive. They just sit and wait, and will detect any event that's loud enough, no matter the direction. That's fine for black hole mergers, because they're 'dark' events so you don't expect a big explosion to accompany it. In contrast, a neutron star merger would produce a wealth of electromagnetic signals. If LIGO observes a neutron star merger, and then can localize it well, it becomes possible to do electromagnetic followup observations quickly, giving us more detailed information about how the merger occurs and evolves.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it could. But we already have <a href="https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/#" target="_blank">moon rock samples</a> from various depths (up to about 200 m for the drill core samples) from the Apollo missions.</p>
<p>The surface material of the moon is fairly homogeneous and the samples from different areas such as mare's and highlands are broadly similar. The interesting thing would be to get samples from deeper in than we already have. Unfortunately you would need a large impactor to get material from below 200 m, and unlike the cores there would be no way of telling if there are chemical changes with the depth. Given that we can land core-drilling robots on mars, I would think the best way would be to do a robotic sample return mission if we ever needed any more moon rock.</p>
<p>It's definitely a good idea though, and has been done for a comet with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Impact_(spacecraft)" target="_blank">deep impact</a> mission, although they used refection spectroscopy instead of transmission spectroscopy.</p>
<p>:-)</p>
<p>Edit: So I misread the table and confused cm with m :-(. So the impactor required to get deeper would be way smaller than what I originally thought :-). It may actually be a better idea than a sample return mission (for fuel requirements etc). I know that the Apollo missions had a look at some crater walls (which would tell you something about the bulk composition) but information from an undisturbed region would go a long way to testing various moon formation models.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who go hot and cold in relationships usually come on very strong during the &quot;hot&quot; phase. They will put a lot of effort into making you feel like you're special and wanted, so when they go cold you start to question of you did something to cause it. You think &quot;we'll they were so into me, they will feel that way again if I just x, y, z.&quot; Sometimes you'll think if you start putting in more effort, then you can draw them back in but that approach usually back fires. You stick around waiting for them to go back to how they were before, which the the hot/cold person expects. When they feel like giving you attention again, they know you'll be there. </p>
<p>Alternately, the person is scared of commitment and does believe the things they say in the hot phases but gets scared when they realize they're responsible for your needs and happiness. So they pull away out of fear. Either way the result is the same for the person on the receiving end of this behavior.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Kind of like why people often go home with the &quot;wrong person&quot; from the bar...they're drunk, desperate, and are on the prowl for a mate.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Attachment disorder.  Your relationship patterns are created by your parents and your early relationships.</p>
<p>If a child doesn't get enough attention and love from a parent they will seek out similar partners.  They also watch to see how one parent gets love and attention from the other.  If the dad is dismissive to the mom and the mom just tries harder, the kids are very likely to repeat that pattern when they enter relationships.  </p>
<p>My favorite quote about this is &quot;if there are ten guys in a room all flirting with me and one that's ignoring me, that's the guy I want to date&quot;.  </p>
<p>They are interested in a guy who ignores them.</p>
<p>You can go on r/sex (except you're only five years old so don't do that) and see examples of this all the time.  Prople unhappy in relationships with an attentive and loving partner who get turned on by inattentive partners.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;emotionally unavailable&quot; I often used for this.  Married people, long distance relationships, addicts, or any way that unconsciously tells you that the person you're dating is not likely to get emotionally invested in you (even if they do TELL you they are, or will be) are more appealing to peoe with attachment issues. </p>
<p>One study found that women generally find married men to look more physically attractive.  Emotional unavailability literally makes the other person LOOK more attractive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've never posted here before, so I'm sorry in advance if I mess up. </p>
<p>My main question is this: How much fat can a person really gain from a cheat day? Is there an upper limit? It seems unlikely to me that if someone consumed 20 pounds worth of calories in addition to maintenance, that they would then actually gain that much in fat, but maybe I'm wrong. Is the upper limit just how many calories a person can manage? Or is there a limit to how much fat the human body can create in a particular window of time? Something else? </p>
<p>I've read that a pound of fat is 'worth' 3500 calories. I just googled that to check if that's true, but I'm still not sure. That number is apparently from a 1958 study. Multiple sites call 3500 an oversimplification, or 'a general rule of thumb', but I don't understand why. That's not actually my main question, but it seems important to it.</p>
<p>I ask because I've been counting calories (5'5&quot;, woman, 1200 calories a day, starting weight 188 pounds, current weight 135 pounds, goal weight 125 pounds) and I've been too nervous to try a cheat day. I don't want to reverse my progress, but I've also read that moderate cheat days can help with weight loss. While I have no intention of attempting 20 pounds worth of calories, I'm curious to know more about how the body handles large caloric surplus.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unless the cheating is so hardcore that you actually throw up or ..throw up from the other end without digesting, there is no limit. Even though there is only so much a body can process at a time, the rest of it is just going to sit around in your intestines waiting its turn.</p>
<p>3500 kcal/pound is about right, it might be an oversimplification given other effects eating has on the body and how that might affect your metabolism during that specific time but in the long run that is the amount of weight change you are going to see per that amount of calories.</p>
<p>I think the reason that &quot;cheat day&quot; is often a part of diets is because several studies have found that people who regularly eat less than is required to maintain their weight don't actually cheat too bad during the cheat day so maybe they figured the morale boost outweighs the little setback.</p>
<p>The most recent one I red was about alternate day fasting so basically one day you don't eat (just 0 calorie drinks drinks) and the other day you eat as much as you want. They found that people ended up eating 120% - 160% (with 130% being the highest point on the curve) of their caloric requirement during their eat day which overall resulted in the same pace of weight loss as if they had eaten 60-80% of their caloric requirement every day.</p>
<p>Good for weight loss, not so good for the study though since they were looking into ways of incorporating regular fasting into daily lives due to its health benefits and not everybody needs weight loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Cranking up intake doesn't seem to cause food to &quot;get lost&quot; - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1414963" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1414963</a> </li>

<li>Different people get different results when they eat way too much: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077863" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077863</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you eat drastically more than you're used to eating, your body will crank up energy levels in a number of areas to try to burn off the excess; you'll make more heat, feel more of an urge to move, etc. Different people get different amounts of this effect.</p>
<p>Your body will naturally want to reject food above a certain amount all at once, the main way of doing this being throwing it up. The other end can participate in this too, but it's surprising how little of a difference simply poopin' more makes... I've seen numbers as high as an extra 10% of calories, but not more. It's possible that the number gets higher with really extreme amounts of food, but I haven't seen the study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've read that a pound of fat is 'worth' 3500 calories. I just googled that to check if that's true, but I'm still not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that some People tell you &quot;3500&quot; is an oversimplification. But always keep in mind that there is a huge industry that sells nothing but diets. You can buy books, supplements even hire trainers. They often try to generate some kind of mystery around the subject while reality is pretty easy: eat less then your body uses and you will lose weight. </p>
<p>So the single reason why you're still unsure is this artificial mystery. They talk bullshit and try to sell their products.</p>
<p>In the end - if a diet works - it almost every time comes down to calories. Low carb diet is a good example. If you eat 300g roastbeef with fries(200g) every day and suddenly remove the fries from your diet plan and replace it with more steak or even salad, you will lose weight because you've just reduced your caloric intake extremely. 200g fries have significantly more calories then 200g lean roastbeef. The same with noodles(mostly in cause of the the sauce). Or bread/buns. </p>
<p>A exclusion is rice. Or cooked potatoes. Or oven-roasted potatoes without fat. In fact there are countless exclusions. So in my opinion low carb is even harder then if you just count calories, because you have to leave out a LOT of healthy AND tasty stuff that is actually good for diet. I love backed potato with 0,5% fat herb-curd, roasted mushrooms and lean, roasted cured ham on top. You can eat 500g of that stuff, will be super stuffed and are only at about 500kcal. Or you replace 200g potato with 200g grilled roastbeef. </p>
<p>Counting calories needs a bit of training. But after a while you learn it. Even after years without diet i still know that 100g potato = 80kcal. 100g 1% fat curd = 60-80kcal. 100g lean cured ham 90-100kcal. 100g mushrooms, roasted without fat = you don't even need to care. It really helps to learn more about what you're actually eating and therefor to change your life fundamentally. You also automatically eat less hidden fats. If you are not sure how much of fat and sugar you get if you eat something you tend to avoid it and start to prefer a &quot;honest&quot; style of meal, where you actually see most ingredients you eat. </p>
<p>You also have to be generally careful about people, when you talk about Diet. Diet is for many people like a religion. People hate it and it gets ugly fast if you criticize their religion too carelessly. And if you ask what kind of diet you do you're basically asking: &quot;what religion is better? islam or catholicism?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Calorie counting is about long term averages, not daily counts.</p>
<p>If you eat 1200 calories every day for a month, your average is 1200 calories a day.  If you DOUBLE that count one day a month, your daily average skyrockets to... 1240/day.  Two 2400 calorie cheats in a 30 day period would bump you to 1280/day.</p>
<p>If you wanted to maintain a 1200 average and still have a 2400 calorie cheat day, you could drop the other 29 days to 1159 calories each day.  IMO, this is pointless, though, because your calorie counts are estimates anyway, no matter how accurately you weigh your food, and we're talking about less than 5% deviations here...</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you only cheated twice a year, you could keep the 1240 average and eat 8500 calories both days... :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with cheat days - if you're a compulsive overeater - is that they may trigger you into a state of constant binge that could last days or weeks. It may not happen the day after the binge - it could be a week or a few days after. It also keeps you in the diet vs. lifestyle mentality and as someone said earlier - diets fail. </p>
<p>You've done a great job so far with the weight loss, and the question I would ask you is what's making you think about a cheat day to begin with? Do you feel deprived? If so, you may need to reconsider your approach. </p>
<p>CICO works well for many people but for compulsive overeaters, if you are one, it may not be the solution in the long term, as deprivation may lead to an eventual return to old way of eating and living followed by weight gain - usually more the amount originally lost. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think this is the wikipedia article you're looking for.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of tests for a variety of nuclear propulsion drives. There are essentially three types.</p>
<p>Nuclear Electric - You have a small reactor or nuclear battery and use the electricity generated from it to power some form of propulsion that relies on electricity, like ion thrusters. Unfortunately, nuclear reactors are quite heavy compared to solar panels, and ion thrusters are so slow they're not very practical for manned spaceflight. Nuclear Electric propulsion may have a future someday on a deep space probe that's too far out to rely on solar, but as far as I know nothing uses it today.</p>
<p>Nuclear Thermal - Basically, you take a nuclear reactor and pump hydrogen into it. The hydrogen heats up, you let it shoot out the back, propelling your rocket forwards. It's kind of like you just spring a leak in the reactor's cooling system. Nuclear Thermal Rockets have real promise for providing very efficient thrust, and there have been several projects in the past to experiment or develop them, including a couple that are currently ongoing. But they have problems.</p>
<p>Due to weight concerns, shielding for the reactor would have to be kept to a minimum. Most designs provide only for a shield dividing the crew from the reactor, meaning everything around the spacecraft would be bombarded with a lot of radiation. The exhaust is also radioactive. That's less of a problem if you only use it on an upper stage and rely on a normal chemical rocket to get you to space, but that's kind of putting the cart before the horse. They're also a pain to test, since you have to collect the exhaust or give cancer to your neighbors.</p>
<p>You also have the shared problem with all of these designs- even proven rocket systems fail on a fairly regular basis. If you have enough material for a reactor go up in a high altitude explosion, you're going to be raining material down on a very large area. Even if it's over the ocean, you'll contaminate the food chain. It'd potentially be worse than Chernobyl.</p>
<p>As an aside, I'd also recommend reading about project pluto. It was a nuclear jet engine on an aircraft, not a nuclear rocket on a spacecraft, but it used a pretty similar principle- it just heated intake air rather than hydrogen fuel. It would have been a nuclear bomber that could fly practically forever, and after dropping its bombs could have spent weeks flying at low altitude to kill more people with sonic booms and radioactive exhaust.</p>
<p>Nuclear Pulse - This is the fun one. Basically, nuclear pulse engines are just shooting a nuclear bomb out the back, immediately setting it off, and riding the force of the explosion. They're utterly bonkers. They should be very efficient space propulsion, but they have added political problems. For some reason, launching a huge gun loaded with a magazine of dozens of nuclear bombs into space and having it orbit over everybody's heads doesn't make other countries happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In theory it would be a way to get enormous loads into orbits, in practice it would be a way to make a whole lot of people very angry because you were setting of nukes. irradiating your launch pad the atmosphere and risking distributing your &quot;rocket fuel&quot; across the local landscape if something goes wrong.</p>

And 3, perhaps the maddest of all, a nuclear gun where you're the bullet. </p>
<p>In all cases there's no insurmountable challenge but there are significant engineering ones, notably around building a spaceship strong enough. NASA got pretty close on the nuclear thermal engine, the rest are more conceptual.</p>
<p>The two bigger issues are 1) fallout and radiation and its effect on planet earth meaning 3 is ruled out and 1 and 2 are only really viable options if taken as far as orbit conventionally and 2) the fact that at the moment conventional propellants work just fine for everything we might want to do. If we get serious about moving large payloads higher than Low Earth Orbit (say if we want to visit mars) we might revisit the idea, but at the moment conventional propellants are doing all the jobs we need doing just fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We could though. Not from a nuclear explosion though, but using fissile material to heat a fuel up so that it's pressure rises and it's flung out of the motor to provide thrust. It would be more fuel efficient than a chemical rocket, but provide less thrust, making it hard to use one as a primary engine to take off, and it still uses fuel, making it have similar limits as chemical rockets. Plus if something goes wrong, and the reaction vessel is breached, such as an explosion, you just released contaminated material all through the atmosphere creating fallout over a wide area. </p>
<p>We do use nuclear materials as electric generators though which could power ION propulsion to drive a space craft, and we already use them to provide electrical power such as in the Voyager spacecraft. </p>
<p>The reason we can't explode nuclear material in a controlled way to power a rocket is the critical mass is too large for a controlled explosion. </p>
<p>A rocket motor is not exponential, but a nuclear explosion is. I don't think people really grasp the concept of what exponential means. Put simply, the more it happens, the more it will happen. In a rocket motor this isn't true and it's not exponential. The more fuel you feed the combustion chamber, the more thrust it will produce, but there is nothing in the chemical reaction used to create the thrust that would cause the reactions to keep getting bigger and faster exponentially. </p>
<p>A nuclear explosion on the other hand is a chain reaction. One atom splits, it's neutron strikes another which splits it, now 2 neutrons are flying, then 4, then 8, then 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc etc. In other words each time an atom of U235 falls part, it encourages other atoms of U235 to do the same. This takes place in miliseconds until the fuel is exhausted, or it blows itself apart, releasing all of that energy pretty much instantaneously. There is no way to control the speed of a nuclear explosion enough to use it as thrust. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If it is impossible to compete with your business model <em>because you are the best</em>, that is perfectly legal.</p>
<p>If it is impossible to compete with your business model <em>because you actively try to penalize and hinder your competitors</em>, that is illegal.</p>
<p>For example, the infamous EU case against Microsoft over bundling Internet Explorer with Windows  was not because they had a monopoly on the OS market.</p>
<p>It was because the used their monopoly on the OS market to push an unrelated product, giving that product an unfair advantage: the created a situation in which people used Internet Explorer not because it was the best browser, but because, they were Windows users, and so IE as practically forced on them.</p>
<p>The case against Intel was not because Intel dominated the CPU market. It was because they used their dominance to actively keep out competitors like AMD: they created contracts with customers saying things like &quot;we'll give you a discount, as long as you don't buy <em>any</em> AMD products at all*&quot;. For customers who might normally buy 90% Intel anyway, that's a tempting offer. Just switch the last 10% of your purchases over to Intel as well, and you get a fat discount. In other words, they used their monopoly position to create an artificial barrier for AMD. That is illegal.</p>
<p>But simply having a monopoly because you make the best product at the lowest price is not illegal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

(This of you who don't know - those are the 3 largest airports serving London). They were forced to sell gatwick and Stansted so that they couldn't control the market and Jack up prices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the USA, certain businesses are allowed to be monopolies at times.  AT&amp;T used to be but is not now.  Formerly, trucking companies had exclusive rights to certain long distance routes. When technology changes, frequently that is when a monopoly business loses its market power. Often monopolies have their prices controlled by government agencies. ..... example, electricity providers.  When something altogether new comes along, say Google Search or Microsoft Windows (back in the day), the company grows to be effectively a monopoly.  At some point, customers will complain about anti-competitive behavior from the monopoly company.                                                                    The US Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission will investigate. The Justice Department successfully argued before a judge that Microsoft was using &quot;anti-competitive practices&quot; by forcing PC manufacturers to bundle their browser software with their operating system. As a result, Microsoft was forced to uncouple the two products.  Right now, Google Search has monopoly power, but the US government  (unlike the Europeans,) will be slow to investigate or penalize them since they created something that is a global smash success.  That means it provides employment and tax revenue which delights the government.  If another powerful company (like Amazon, for example,) complained that Google was listing search results in a way that favored Google over Amazon, the Justice Department might launch an investigation of Google's business practices. A hundred years ago, monopolies were commonly organized as an entity inside of another legal entity called a &quot;trust.&quot;  Thus, laws against monopolies are called &quot;anti-trust&quot; laws.  Two examples of these laws are the Clayton Antitrust ACT and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Thanks for the answers. To others coming here looking for a concise answer, I found this post the most useful to help me intuitively understand some of it:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/72oipy/why_do_we_consider_it_certain_that_radioactive/dnk9sjq/?context=3" target="_blank">This post</a> explains that the theories that seem to be the most accurate when tested describes quantum mechanics as inherently random/probabilistic. The idea that &quot;if 95% fits, then the last 5% probably fits too&quot; is
very intuitively easy to understand. It also took me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory" target="_blank">this</a> page on wikipedia which seems almost made for the question I asked. So I think everyone else wondering the same thing I did will find it useful!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I can't speak to radioactive decay in particular, but I don't think your question is specific to it anyway. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem#Overview" target="_blank">Bell's theorem</a> addresses this more generally. Basically what it does is make testable the claim &quot;there might be hidden variables&quot;, which have been tested numerous times in numerous ways. Modern physics has shown, experimentally, that &quot;hidden variable&quot; theories fail and quantum mechanics is <em>fundamentally</em> random. I'm not sure what the scope of this is, and there's a chance that radioactive decay in particular doesn't have to be random, but physics in general is.</p>
<p>My understanding of Bell's theorem basically stops at what it claims, not why it makes sense, so I can't do much better than link that wikipedia article about it, but hopefully that helps?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of top level comments here from physicists giving complicated answers so I'll drop something short here as a radiochemist. There's some extra detail below the tldr but the tldr is a short/sweet practical answer to your question.</p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>We know you don't need a hidden energy source for radioactive decay because it still happens in extremely cold environments. We know you don't need hidden reactants for decay because it happens in a vacuum. We know you don't need a special unknown particle within the nucleus for decay because a single neutron flying alone though space will decay into a proton+electron+antielectron neutrino.</p>
<p>The difference in mass-energy between the parent/daughters in radioactive decay is exactly equal to the energy released by the decay. If another particle was involved the total energy released would be less than the difference in mass energy between the parent/daughters</p>
<hr />
<p>The reason radioactive decay happens spontaneously is the same reason anything happens spontaneously. It is (in <em>every</em> case) thermodynamically favorable and there exists a kinetic pathway by which the decay can occur.</p>
<p>I can answer your question explicitly in the case of alpha decay. There exists an energy barrier in alpha decay that the alpha particle must overcome to leave the nucleus. In no case does the alpha particle <em>ever</em> have this energy. The alpha particle leaves the nucleus solely through the effects of quantum tunneling, and the half life of its decay can be calculated based on only this assumption. No further information is necessary. No further reactants or sources of energy are necessary. Tunneling is a random event.</p>
<p>Radioactive decay is known to be first order kinetically. This means the kinetics of decay is dependent solely
upon the amount of the nucleus present and the decay constant. Experimentally we confirm and reconfirm every day that the rate at which something decays is dependent only upon how much of the nucleus is there. There are no chemical environments which can alter the properties of decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of responses going into bell inequalities and quantum stuff. Keeping just to the radioactive decay from your question, if you look at radioactive decay over time it follows an exponential curve, with a half-life that characterises the time it takes for the activity to halve. Sometimes in physics real-world exponential 'tails' don't really go to infinity but get truncated at very small values due to some secondary effect, but not here. As close as we can tell, radioactive decay is exponential.</p>
<p>An exponential curve has no scale. You can zoom in or out on any part of the curve, and it will still look like an exponential. In that sense, the decay has no 'features'. There is nothing that makes an atom decay faster at one speed, no peaks or changes in the curve. The only variable is the half life. This implies there is no 'reason' for the decays besides the half life. It follows a random Gaussian probability distribution, as best we can tell.</p>
<p>This isn't proof of course, physics isn't in the business of proof, but fitting observations to theory. Generally where you get true exponential distributions you find random events.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a pilot who worked briefly for a railroad I asked the exact same question and came to the following answer:</p>
<p>Gas Turbine Pros</p>
<ol>
<li>Exceptionally high power to weight ratio</li>
<li>Efficient at high RPM</li>
</ol>
<p>Gas Turbine Cons</p>
<ol>
<li>High-Veryhigh RPM useful operating range  </li>
<li>Significant fuel/air burn rate</li>
<li>Complex maintenance </li>
<li>Fragile, expensive parts</li>
<li>Power delay (5-10 seconds)</li>
</ol>
<p>Gas Turbine Pros in trains</p>
<ol>
<li>NA</li>
<li>Makes sense on road trains</li>
</ol>
<p>Gas Turbine Cons on trains</p>
<ol>
<li>As the general public, we only really see road trains in transit, going long distances from yard to yard. The reality is a significant amount of time is spent idling, or going back and forth short distances at low power shuffling cars in a yard and or pickup/dropoff at industries. Turbines are impractical on these engines, but it could still work as a separated road train engine class. </li>
<li>In order for turbines to burn as much fuel as they do, they have to compress a lot of air and suck it in. Trains operate at very low speeds, and thus do not have the luxury of having air forced down their air intake at 500 mph like planes do. They would have to have even greater compression mechanics engineered in. But this is ultimately an engineering problem so lets move on. </li>
<li>IMO This is the real killer here. Turbines are significantly more complex than diesel engines. Mechanics need to have a practical understanding of what is literally rocket science. Don't want a mechanic specialty dick measuring contest, just pointing out that this is a complex topic that will require significant retraining of maintenance employees. Additionally, these are road trains, so they move, and could break down in any yard or even en-route. Thus, mechanics would have to be retrained system-wide. And if they do break down, there are a lot more things that could have gone wrong, and may require complex repairs increasing the negative impact of mechanical failures. Also due to the complexity, there are more parts this increases the total required on hand parts (system wide again) in order to keep trains properly maintained. These parts btw, are made of special materials with special designs/equipment in limited quantities, with no alternatives to purchasing from the manufacturer... aka expensive and a possible bottleneck.</li>
<li>The maintenance issue is compounded by the fragility of the engines. fragile blades spinning at 30,000 rpm do not like solid objects of any kind. Planes don't have this problem, except on runways, which are often swept for debris, but trains are at ground level 24/7. Go under a tunnel and have your extra powerful air compressor suck a loose brick off the ceiling and that train is gonna have a bad time. Even little pebbles can be a problem, hell the U.S. military aircraft have had problems with sand screwing up turbines in the middle east. Long story short, this is another complex engineering problem, but any failure here could be catastrophic, shutting down engines in the field. Increasing that risk is not desirable. </li>
<li>last, and certainly least, is the power delay. Trains are accelerating or decelerating thousands of tons. A few second delay is completely negligible. </li>
</ol>
<p>So basically, <strong>TLDR while they seem like an efficiency no brainier, turbines are only power efficient on some trains, while the company gets screwed by extra engineering issues (air compression and filtration), limited operational use (long distance road trains only), and essentially doubling the already significant engine maintenance labor and materials cost.</strong> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turbines exhibit mechanical efficiency over only a very narrow range of RPM. Outside of this range, efficiency drops dramatically as does power output. Turbine engines are also ungodly inefficient at very low RPM, and are thus terrible at idling.</p>
<p>Diesel engines have a wider range of efficient RPM which provides much more flexibility in terms of power output. Furthermore, diesel engines idle very, very well.</p>
<p>Turbine engines are most ideal in two scenarios:</p>
<p>1.) When power output is more or less constant, or fluctuates very little during operation. This occurs in power plants</p>
<p>2.) When conserving weight. Turbine engines have a much higher power-to-weight ratio than diesel engines, which is why turbine engines are used on aircraft (aircraft power requirements are more or less constant during cruising as well). On freight trains the weight of the engine is insignificant compared to the total mass of the train, so switching to a turbine would be meaningless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fear is generally a learned response in humans rather than being present from birth. Whenever a human is observing another human as being a role model, the observer sees the response taken by the role model, and is more likely to recreate that response in the future. Because of this, it's easy to pass on your fear of bugs to another person, as long as that person's subconscious processing thinks you are worth learning from. </p>
<p>On the other hand, some fears are present from birth as a defensive response to tell an animal to run away when presented with a dangerous situation. Most animals don't fear bugs simply because bugs don't do anything to the animal. But if you put a cucumber behind a cat while it's eating, it will panic and run away because it is born with a fear of snakes, and the cat's innate processing mistakes the cucumber for a threat. </p>
<p>It's likely that our original fear of bugs did come from the knowledge that certain bugs can have bad or even deadly effects on us, which then spread the mentality that we should be afraid of all bugs. For an animal to fear that same bug, it would have to be because of a survival instinct, unless the animal somehow also learned to fear bugs.</p>
<p>Edit: apparently the cucumber/snake thing with cats may not be 100% scientific, but it was the first example that came to mind when thinking of innate fears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It does become &quot;learned&quot; to an extent, but we also know some spiders can be poisonous, and some insects can be &quot;bad&quot; and we do pass that on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Once we saw a giant house spider we showed it to our dog and he ran up the stairs! Minutes later when he decided to come down, before he stepped on the last stair he made sure the coast is clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered this too. Specifically why bugs seem to be the only thing which is not at least perceived as &quot;cute&quot; in its infantile/neotenous stage. Even fish and crabs are arguably &quot;cute&quot;. And most people would never kill a baby mouse or rat even though it's a pest and is likely more germy than a baby spider (I accidentally killed an infesting mouse trying to catch him years ago and I still feel bad). However, most people would kill a baby spider without a second thought; and this reality feels visceral to me but I suppose it could be cultural. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me actually propose that it comes down to our skin.</p>
<p>You see, most animals either have very tough skin, or a good coat of fur. That makes it less noticeable when bugs crawl on them, and adds an extra layer of protection against bites, stings, fluids, etc.</p>
<p>But humans are pretty naked, and hence vulnerable and sensitive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
