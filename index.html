<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever it is that spiders are grown and ready to set up shop, spin a web and wait for dinner (the species that do hunt this way), how does it choose the location? How does it know where the ideal place is to collect food?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How far do they travel to seek out such a place, if they do &quot;seek&quot; out certain places. Do they just drop a web whenever and wherever they are hungry? Move on when they get bored to a new place?</p>
</li>
<li>Going through some things in the bottom of the closet, stuff that gets moved on occasion, a couple times a month maybe. Inside a shoebox (and similar places) there are usually some tiny, tiny spiders with their homes set up. Is there really a steady food supply in there, tucked away, door shut? Obviously I know there is tiny food for them galore, but really, in my closet?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an almost impossible question to answer due to the vast amount of species of spiders; some spiders spin traps on the ground to alert it and catch the prey: trapdoor spider; Other tall grass faring spiders turn their webs towards the wind hoping for insects to get blown in; Some spiders build their webs over the water to eat insects flying up after they are hatched or down to drink water; Some even make webs underwater so they can trap bubbles down with them and live off plants re-oxygenating it and small fish and underwater insects. Basically, where they think there is food.</p>
<p>Traveling, some spiders travel by flying with web when they are born like a dandelion keeping them in the mile to two mile range and will generally only travel in a half mile zone from there, most web spinning spiders don't even move a half mile from their landing point though; hunting spiders are the only group that tend towards a bit of traveling but still abide in their territory.</p>
<p>If those spiders are cellar spiders they can go a long time without eating over 6 months, so a little food is enough to sustain them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a tough question to answer because spiders &amp; tarantulas and arachnids in general are so diverse in hunting and web building.</p>
<p>I probably am wrong here but in developed cities i'm sure it's to do with dust. Spiders are such apex hunters and dust generally attracts insects <del>and harbors dust mites which would be an ideal food source</del> in developed cities. plus dust leads to dirt which brings in more insects for spiders to hunt. and it can help them blend into the environment. Female spiders depending on the species generally build webs where as the males will scout and hunt. Depending on species though they all harbor different hunting techniques.</p>
<p>A species of spiders in Brazil work in communes to build massive webs together to maximize the catch of prey. Most other species are single serving free-for-all loners. Some tarantulas can burrow webs under water. Some build funnel traps in dirt and sand and other tarantulas can and will fight and eat snakes and birds and similar sized foes. I guess it depends on species and location. I notice most house hold spiders build webs in dusty corners and every nook 'n cranny. Garden spiders build big webs between plants because they can be brightly colored and if they sit in the center they blend in with the plants to another insect.</p>
<p>I'm recalling this knowledge from all the spidey books I read as a kid when I had a huge fascination with Arachnids. I am most likely wrong and would like a real spider master to correct me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oil doesn't exist underground in caverns that would otherwise be empty if it wasn't for the oil. Instead of thinking of large empty pockets, think of a wet sponge, where the sponge is rock and it's &quot;wet&quot; with oil. </p>
<p>But also remember that the oil and gas held underground is under great pressure. It is this pressure that allows the oil to be extracted, but when the pressure is relieved by removing the oil these smaller pockets don't necessarily remain empty, as they're often filled water seeping in from the surrounding rock. And even when they are not filled back in with water from surrounding rock, oil extraction often leaves about 13% porosity, which is about the same as modern concrete. </p>
<p>And it's not just water that can remain in the well: when an oil well is considered spent, and no more oil can be extracted (using traditional techniques), there may remain as much as 90% of the original deposit left in the ground. Because of the large amount of oil that can be left in an otherwise &quot;spent&quot; well, there are techniques for getting out more of the oil, which involves pumping fluids (mostly water) into the well, increasing the pressure and allowing more oil to be extracted. But this obviously displaces oil with water, and so the &quot;wet sponge&quot; never really dries out. </p>
<p>So while oil extraction often leaves a well less dense than it was to begin with, it's not a whole lot less dense...it's still mostly rock all the way down!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A different view point is that your reservoir is made of sand between 2 clay layers (impermeable). The gas/oil fills the pore space in between the sand. But if you look at what is holding the top clay layer up it is a combination of the sand particles and the pressure from the gas/oil.</p>
<p>As you produce gas/oil the stress to support the top layer of clay shifts over more and more to just the sand. Sometimes the sand cannot support this stress and starts to fracture at the individual particle level and compact.</p>
<p>You can have subsidence because your jar of marbles becomes a jar of crushed marbles.</p>
<p>Recovery % and other factors vary wildly. Some reservoirs do have meaningful aquifer support but because of the size, you may not know for 10+ years - and can crush the matrix during the time in between.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An &quot;oil well&quot; is the hole we drill into the ground. The actual area underground with oil in it is called &quot;reservoir&quot;.</p>
<p>In reservoir engineering, there is a concept called &quot;material balance&quot;. The space that the extracted oil took up has to be replaced by something else. This can include</p>
<ul>
<li>the remaining oil in the reservoir expanding</li>
<li>the gas in the reservoir expanding</li>
<li>the actual rock holding the oil to expand</li>
<li>water in the reservoir expanding</li>
<li>water from outside entering the reservoir</li>
<li>or even water/gas you inject into the reservoir yourself (this essentially forces oil out of the reservoir)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different methods in place to make sure this doesn't  happen. So sometimes what happens is that you have injection wells located a bit aways from your producing well (oil) that will inject water to help push the oil out easier and the water will prevent any overburden pressure from collapsing. Essentially you're just replacing the oil with water to try and preserve the rock. Also once your oil well starts producing all water, you know you've basically gotten all of the oil. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the cells of your bodies undergo major damage from (as an example) excess UV exposure, this causes them to die. In the case of UV exposure this is because of excessive DNA damage that causes the cell to stop functioning correctly. This causes the cell to die and release it's contents into the matrix where it resides. </p>
<p>The cellular contents contain chemical signalling molecules called cytokines (among other things) this interacts with the nearby vasculature causing the cells surroudning blood vessels to become more porous. This allows more fluid to come into the surroudning cellular matrix and more cells called macrophages that &quot;eat&quot; what is remaining of the damaged cells. </p>
<p>This fluid buildup into the matrix causes the redness and swelling associated with DNA damage. This can last a couple of days until all the cellular content is cleaned up. </p>
<p>The other reason is that sometimes a damaged cell does not die immediately. It will die a few days later. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Is a poison ivy rash similar to a sunburn in that way?</p>
<p>Also, I went on a hike when the rash was at its peak. Normally I finish all my hikes, though they do wipe me out for the rest of the day. That day, I got very winded, and had to stop in the middle and sit for a while. My rash was turning dark purple and felt extra hot/painful. Is that because the blood was trying to go to both the recovery of my damaged cells and supplying oxygen to my muscles? I went on a hike a week later as the rash was significantly more healed with no trouble. So I wonder if my rash was the factor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since there's no empirical answer here, I'll throw my non-empirical answer in the mix:</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: It could be many things.</strong></p>
<p>It could be conditioning: You took a couple of naps on the couch with the TV on; now, your brain associates the TV, with just the right amount of fatigue, as sleep time, at the right place. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at the ranch (when you go to bed), you're staring at your phone, &quot;doing some last few reddits&quot; before bed. You have trained your brain to activate before your &quot;alloted&quot; sleep time. Chances are, you've done so much internet before bed--your brain does not associate bed time with sleep time.</p>
<p>Related: Your bed should be for two things only: Sex and/or Sleeping. This is to make sure your brain and body associate that with sleep, OR Sleep that usually follows sex. </p>
<p>Also, digital screens emit blue light. In short, it's a light wavelength that suppresses melanin. Melanin is a hormone that is produced in your body. When Melanin spikes up (usually after some hours of nighttime and sometimes around post-lunch hours) it makes you sleepy because that's the job of Melanin. They also sell melanin at the drug store, but it's always better to rely on your natural sleep cycles as nature intended. The Sun and Digital Blue Light from most electronics today suppress Melanin, making it harder to fall asleep.  <strong>THIS</strong> along with not associating your bed with sleep will most definitely fuck up your sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep is still misunderstood for the most part (we don't know why we do it, generally), since it puts us at a huge disadvantage in the wild--yet, we <strong>must</strong> do it. This means that even if  we don't understand it, it does something right.  Studies where people were sleep deprived had slower time reactions, sometimes akin to a drunk person. </p>
<p>For example, cell regeneration and healing happen during sleep. The brain, oddly enough, is more active during sleep. There's a theory that &quot;pruning&quot; is occurring during sleep--AKA, your brain is getting rid of the stupid, useless information that won't help you survive. This is why &quot;The First 20 Hours&quot; method works well for advancing learning quickly seems to do well: reviewing before sleep/reviewing after sleep, in short time frames--so the brain associates that this is needed and doesn't prune it.</p>
<p>Another possible reason is that when you sleep, it takes some minutes (60ish or more on normal IF I recall correctly) to get to Rapid Eye Movement (REM sleep). REM sleep is <strong>ESSENTIAL</strong>. A lack of sleep with screw you up, but a lack of REM will really screw you up. So, when you're running on less sleep than usual, when you finally sleep/nap, you get to REM quicker! WOOHOO! LIFEHACK!  <strong>NO, it's not</strong>. As stated earlier, sleep has a lot of functions. Anyway, if you're tired and fall asleep while &quot;relaxing&quot; watching TV, and wake up 30 mins later, chances are you got some REM sleep. This fucks you up because your body has gotten a little recharge to take you over for maybe, 6 hours? It's like your phone was dying, you charged it for 10 mins and got it to 25%. It's gonna take some time to get back below 10%.  </p>
<p>Remember those people from the studies? Well, some of them were &quot;disturbed&quot; (on purpose) during REM sleep (enough to snap them out of REM, but not out of sleep). The next day, they felt they were fine and had good rest. However, their results on reaction time showed that they were not at full &quot;normal&quot; rested reaction capability.</p>
<p>Also, there have been many people throughout history that have experimented with various sleep cycles to &quot;get the most out of their day.&quot; I think (and I may be way wrong here) it was DaVinci that famously tried the polyphasic sleep (fancy name for &quot;different ways of sleeping&quot;), where he would sleep one hour every 4-5 hours. Supposedly it worked, and I don't doubt he got used to it.  So, you may have gotten used to sleeping 4-5 hours at night, with a nap right after dinner--and you may not realize that it's a habit now. You may not like it, but you did to your body--your bod is just doing what you taught it.</p>
<p>That's all I got. Some of it is scientific, but I did internet research long ago and don't have the patience currently to dig up the sources. If someone wants to disagree or bring up relevant points, or even call me out on wrong info, feel free. This is the internet, not The White House, I can admit I might be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I want to add that &quot;humming&quot; sounds can easily relax the brain. Depending on what you're watching, if it doesn't have much flux, the TV can hum along, much like a quiet lullaby. This is why White Noise or the sound of rain, a fan, Air Conditioner, beach waves, background coffee shop can aid in sleep &amp; focusing. In a weird way, it zens the mind to relax. I looked into it long ago, but I forgot why it is. Probably something with the infant brain associating a smooth sound (singing by mom) that you are safe and not in danger, so you can relax.</p>
<p>*EDIT 2** Guys, gals and all in between--I get it, it's melatonin--not melanin. I know the difference, I just have a long-life habit of mixing them up. That's what I get for doing a write-up on a lack of sleep. Happy naps, everyone!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you're watching TV, the part of your brain that watches TV says &quot;Shut up guys, I'm watching TV,&quot; so you can focus without thinking about cake or math.  As a result, the others sit silent, grow bored, and fall asleep, until only the TV watcher part of the brain is left.  Left by himself, he too gets bored and falls asleep.  </p>
<p>When you're in bed, assuming you aren't counting sheep or something, the entire brain is kind of in free time mode, and any part of the brain can speak up if it wants to.  They start talking to each other, and even if one of them starts to drift to sleep, the others wake it up either by deliberately talking to the sleepyheads or just being noisy.  Eventually more and more of the parts of the brain fall asleep from sheer exhaustion no matter how loud the others are, and eventually the last one passes out and you are asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also, antiretroviral therapy tends to cause allergic reactions (directly and indirectly), which complicates the problem even further. You also have to consider that there are many types of &quot;allergy&quot; which have slightly different mechanism of action.</p>

(Access to full articles is paywalled, but you can still read the abstract.) Basically, HIV infection increases the risk of allergy as measured by IgE levels. The mechanism behind this is unknown, but my guess is on the body furiously <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5458331/" target="_blank">trying to make new B-cells in response to the loss of normal ones</a>, making the immune system go haywire in the process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much procedure, as lack of procedure. The Constitution gives Congress the power to write laws, but it doesn't give many guidelines on how to do that. However, a lot of rules have been made over the years, but they aren't required, they're just what the Senate found useful/good practice.</p>
<p>In particular, however, there is a thing called reconciliation. It's meant to be an expedited way to pass bills, but they have to be related directly to the budget (so you can't just pass whatever you want). It also only requires 50 votes(plus a tiebreaker via the VP), instead of the normal 60 to be fillibuster proof.</p>
<p>The trade off is that the ability to fillibuster/slow down the bill is much lower, but again, everything has to be directly related to the budget (as ruled by the parliamentarian, a rules official). Right now, the prediction is that the minimum amount of floor time is about 10 hours for amendments etc.</p>
<p>After that, there aren't any rules. There's no rule stopping things from being done in secret- the only prevention is potential voter backlash, and convincing your fellow Senators to vote for something they haven't read (but which they'll be responsible for, regardless). You're also not allowing experts to comment (which is dangerous- it's <em>really</em> hard to get these right on the first go)</p>
<p>And in general, it's not that unusual for a bit of backroom negotiating to be done. It's much easier to compromise and haggle out of the spotlight. But it's never been done on this scale, for something like healthcare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I worked in a laboratory where we studied spider silk. Basically in order to understand the differences in the different types of silk, and between species. We would feed the spiders food that had carbon 13 instead of carbon 12 that way we could track how they turned their food into the silk. After doing this we would use NMR spectroscopy to examine the structure. Ultimately our goal was to better understand spider silk and see if we could copy how it was made and scale it up to human sizes due to the insane tensile strength of certain spider silk, ie dragline silk. It was a lot of fun and very interesting research, the only issue was constantly being surrounded by many spiders, often very large or dangerous if improperly handled (so many black widows)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certainly different species of spiders have slightly different silk compositions.</p>
<p>Within a single spider they will use chemically different silk for different uses (as /u/Alif3 mentioned).</p>
<p>For example: When building a web, many spiders will spin a scaffold web first which is from a strong and more rigid silk. They then fill in the scaffold with sticky web for trapping prey that isn't as strong. Afterward they will eat the scaffold to reuse the nutrients.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_web" target="_blank">wiki</a> for spider webs is interesting and a good start. They reference this <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110221" target="_blank">review article</a> which is also nice.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very slowly, generally someone will spell it out, and after spelling it a couple times, make a new sign indicating what it is. </p>
<p>IE: my deaf friend does a &quot;fidget spinner&quot; by holding her thumb and index finger together with one hand and drawing the index finger of her other hand down in front of this. </p>
<p>Eventually a sign spreads and becomes integrated into the language. This is also how &quot;regional&quot; signs are made to represent things in their community, be it a college, popular city, sports team, etc. People outside of the region won't know what the sign means, of course, so they'll just ask what they mean. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes very naturally. If somebody gave you a fidget spinner before you ever knew what it was and asked you to come up with a name for the thing, you probably wouldn't have too much trouble coming up with something, simply using all the subconscious knowledge about your native language and its word building. So SL users just name things out of the top of their heads, usually based on the visual properties of the things or concepts.</p>
<p>Another question is then, how do these new signs spread and become common? Well that's a different stroy and, as Atlas_Rising has mentioned, it usually happens slowly and begins with the new sign being regional only.</p>
<p>No matter the type of a language, the incorporation of new words depends heavily on how may people have access to the new word. If a group of friends came up with a word and only used it between themselves, the word will probably just stay within the group. But if they start, for example, using hashtags and letting other people find out about this new word, chances are, it will spread and in some time, it will become just a regular everyday word.</p>
<p>One of the fastest ways for new sings to become common is news in SL. In most countries of the world, deaf people are still struggling when it comes to getting information in their native language, so if there are any news in sign language, be it on the internet or on broadcast TV, most people will watch it. So when the news caster or, in some cases, the SL interpreter introduces new sign, it spreads super fast.</p>
<p>Another great way are all sorts of social media. For example, I live in a very small country and there's only around 8000 deaf people in the whole country. They've got their open Facebook group where they discuss all kinds of topics, just uploading videos stating their opinions. And the group is very large, almost everybody is there. That's a great way for the whole community to pick just one sign out of all the individual ones that people came up with at first on their own. I've noticed that sometimes a signer would fingerspell and/or use a few different signs for the new concept they've already seen in the group, and the number of synonyms would just drop in every following video till only one or two are left. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As Atlas said, you kind of create the words yourself, it might not be universal though. I have two of my sisters that are deaf, so for ISIS, we just spell it I S I S, and they get it. But when defining isis, we say to them it's a terrorist group with normal deaf language since these are more common words. Hope you understood it now, it's actually fun creating words with my sisters like those. We even make our own words that only our family understands, for example, we shape our hands as an ironing machine if we talk about ironing. It can be difficult at times but it's really fun</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
