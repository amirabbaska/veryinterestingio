<p>You can check that I^- is still in the solution by adding a small quantity of an oxidant, like hydrogen peroxyde. If this causes the brown color to reappear, it means you have oxidised transparent iodide back to colored iodine. (if it's negative then possibly the iodine has just evaporated)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I worked in politics, and the short answer is: it's corrupted by deceit and incentives from media-consumers. </p>
<p>And in short the phenomenon is this: there is immense social pressure in politics to not say something unacceptable (gaffes, politically incorrect, etc.). It comes with extreme punishment. At the same time great social reward to say something that gets clicks (outrageous, awe-inspiring, conflictual). So what you get out of those incentives is outrageous lies. </p>
<p>So in politics most people when they speak don't say what they actually think, they say what they think is likely to be close to what the result will be after negotiations, slightly to their side. This is not just true in the media, but also in closed political meetings, unless it is only their very closest friends present. </p>
<p>This culture of deceit makes everyone living in a constant tiring flow of lies. This has some benefits by the way, a great thing about being criticized for something you don't believe, is that you don't have to take it personally or even seriously. It wasn't your thoughts anyway. </p>
<p>When journalist usually follow-up on something they know to be untrue, they only expect another lie. So what they are watching for is actually not lies, but off-message somehow. They are looking for things that transgress the social reward mechanism of political speech.  </p>
<p>This is something which has begun to change. The corruption of untruth seems to have made people incredibly thirsty for ANY politician who say what they actually mean and actually listen to criticism. </p>
<p>I actually think this is the common thread of appeal among their supporters between wildly different politicians like Corbyn, Trump and Macron. (I know, I know, they aren't telling the truth, etc. But the point is that it often seem like they are actually saying what they think - however wrong that may be. As compared to normal politicians which usually will never say what they actually think on a subject). And if I were to advice someone doing a political campaign, I would do the same: say what you think as well as you can. </p>
<p>Same with journalists by the way. It's a corrupted culture. Any journalist could at any time stop lying, and start questioning the things they really didn't understand, or thought were false. And if you're a journalist, I would recommend doing it! You'll find yourself in a very attractive niche very quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of responses to OP deal with asking 'hard' questions.</p>
<p>That is a different subject.</p>
<p>What is being said is that when a journalist hears an obviously untrue answer to a question, he/she seldom challenges the politician with the lie. </p>
<p>In the UK (can't say about the US) one of the standard techniques used by politicians is to ignore the question, and simply make a statement advancing the official version.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are there no construction specifications preventing the use of highly flammable building materials in tower blocks?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's important to remember that the materials used in the construction of this block all complied with relevant regulations and/or were passed by the fire brigade and/or building control.&quot;</p>
<p>WTF? That's a totally unresponsive answer. </p>
<p>What should happen is that the interviewer should say: 'That's not what I asked. Could you address my question please?'</p>
<p>But he/she knows that the politician will simply rephrase the official line. (Can't remember which one, but one of the Republican candidates made himself a laughing stock during a candidates' debate when he repeated the same formulation 3 or 4 times, thus revealing himself incapable of paraphrasing the policy point 'on the hoof'.)</p>
<p>Since the journalist can probably read the politician well enough to know that he/she will stonewall, and since there's probably on 3 minutes 30 seconds allocated for the interview, and since the journalist probably has other questions, perhaps on unrelated matters, to ask - what does he/she do? Use up the whole allotted time in proving that the politician isn't answering the question, or ask one more time and then move on?</p>
<p>I think I would do something like this: ask the question again, move on to the other questions, and then 10 seconds before the time slot closes, say: &quot;Well I asked 7 questions during that interview and viewers/listeners will have noticed that you didn't answer 3 of them. Thank you - and now: this.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The documentary &quot;Journey with George&quot; touches on this topic pretty nicely if you want to give it a watch. A journalist (I forgot her name) follows George W Bush around during his election campaign, and becomes fairly good friends with him. </p>
<p>At one point during the film she asks a question during Bush's press conference about a recent scandal of his. Bush proceeds to completely shuts her down, refuses to answer any future questions she asks, and basically stops interacting with her at all for the next several weeks. Other journalists with her, who she had become acquainted/friends with, also began avoiding her. They feared that any association with her might put them in George's bad graces as well. It put her job in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Asking the wrong question not only isolates you from the politician, but other journalists. It becomes much harder to get a story after that, so generally they stick to the easy questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Journalist here. I've only worked at the local government level so things may be different at higher levels. </p>
<p>When you interview someone for the most part there is a &quot;sensitive&quot; topic you want to touch on. (There are exceptions as always)</p>
<p>The difference between a good journalist vs. a mediocre one lies within eliciting answers to those questions.</p>
<p>You need to build up to questions about the sensitive issue and slowly gain the subjects trust. That's how they open up. People want to see that your there to objectively report the facts/their side of the story too, which I believe to be fair. Everyone deserves to have a voice. </p>
<p>If I just brazenly and immediately ask a question that could be seen as offensive, my subject will most likely shut down and the interview is ruined. Not just for me either, I may have done damage to my entire organization or other media outlets entirely in that persons mind. </p>
<p>For example, I had one interview with a chief of police in regards to an officer under his command caught molesting a child. The reporter originally assigned to that story told me he was a stone wall and would dance around any questions specific to the officer. I talked to him on the phone and began my interview with just a few general questions. I asked him things like &quot;how are you doing?&quot;, &quot;Are you ok?&quot;, etc, but just basic human questions. The man broke down, spilling his guts to me. In all the previous interviews media did with him everyone just asked him ballbuster straight to the facts questions and it was obvious he was close to the officer and it was weighing heavily on his heart. I got the answers that I needed and felt that I helped the man get some things off his chest that he seemingly had no other outlet for. </p>
<p>One thing people tend to forget, especially in media, is other people's humanity. At the end of the day we're only human. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Allowing your body to through the entire cycle in maintaining your body's fitness as well as mental performance since it's during deeper sleep that your brain really processes memories.</p>
<p>The time of day you sleep is important too. At night, you go through the deep sleep stages longer while lasting only a few mins in the earlier stages especially with succeeding sleep cycles.</p>

<p>People often cite that article that was floating around recently (which I have many issues with). My answer is going to be a bit more theoretical, but frankly much of the data we need to test these hypotheses do not exist. Models have shown that simply deleting a species from its corresponding ecological network has the potential to be devastating through <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00354.x/full" target="_blank">cascading secondary extinctions</a>, that are often difficult to predict. Moreover, indirect effects among species in a food web are notoriously <a href="http://woottonlab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/98LaskaWoottonsmall.pdf" target="_blank">tough to detect empirically or anticipate theoretically</a>. To throw in another wrench, we're just recently beginning to complicate this already complicated problem by documenting and modeling the numerous (and dynamically important) <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-1424.1/full" target="_blank">non-trophic interactions in ecosystems</a>. For these reasons, most sensible ecologists would never advocate driving anything to global extinction -- ecological systems are too complex and ecologists still <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=stability+complexity+ecology&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ_o7plr3OAhUL6GMKHS2uBsAQgQMIGjAA" target="_blank">do not understand how they remain stable in the face of perturbations</a>, and we cannot at this time hope to make statements like &quot;it'll probably be okay,&quot; as in that article cited below.</p>
<p>/u/RIKHAL below says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although some animals eat mosquitos, they have other alternatives. Some changes in the ecosystem will occur but it will 100% not be devastating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because predators of mosquitos have alternate resources does not mean that their removal couldn't <em>potentially</em> be devastating. We've known that simply rewiring an ecological network can cause it to collapse in the face of perturbations for <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BDA5-ipCLt4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=stability+complexity+ecology&amp;ots=-vp7yLMor5&amp;sig=SLKOaFf1ejPjMQG268_ygKkvu2A#v=onepage&amp;q=stability%20complexity%20ecology&amp;f=false" target="_blank">many decades now</a>. Although May's monograph (the aforementioned link) makes assumptions that are violated by virtually all natural systems, it still demonstrates that simply rearranging the flows of energy in an ecosystem have very complex and difficult-to-predict dynamical consequences for all populations in the food web. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v395/n6704/abs/395794a0.html" target="_blank">More recent and biologically realistic models</a> demonstrate that simply changing the distributions of interspecific interaction strengths or energy flows (a phenomenon that would certainly accompany mosquito extinctions) is enough to drive a system to collapse.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7060/full/nature03962.html" target="_blank">evidence of cross-ecosystem trophic cascades</a> mean that organisms (like the mosquito) that spend part of their time in aquatic habitats and the rest in terrestrial ones, introduce a critical spatial component to this problem as well. Larval mosquito emergence from freshwaters to land represents a massive cross-ecosystem flux of biomass that impacts everything from terrestrial predators to vegetation, and composition of the primary producer communities. Sure, we could have more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chironomidae" target="_blank">Chironomids</a> or something, and everything could functionally remain intact, but the consequences of such a major shift in species composition that would certainly accompany mosquito extinction is simply too difficult to predict.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When writing a book based on fact vs. fiction are there any more boundries? Is there anything to stop you from just making it all up? or embellishing at all?</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Since there seems to be a lot of confusion let me further explain. I understand that research in academia needs to be well sourced and backed up. This question is in the context of popular history made for consumers. Something you'd find in your average bookshop that the average joe would read.</strong></p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historian here: </p>
<p>There are two types of sources: Primary and Secondary. The main pieces of evidence and (secondary) the people writing about the main pieces of evidence. </p>
<p>Sometimes they do just make it up! A historian's job is not just to know random dates and people but to interpret the evidence, and this includes looking at someone from thousands of years ago and saying &quot;you know what, this guy is lying.&quot; </p>
<p>Granted, you need to have a strong argument based on other pieces of evidence. Plutarch is an example that I often come across. Plutarch can be super helpful, he is a pretty good academic, is well read, and for the most part does a decent job of giving the basic facts.... but he absolutely loves drama. He will add in drama whenever he possibly can. In his work on Alexander he basically says he's not a historian but one showing the virtue of these figures. </p>
<p>So occasionally we'll get a story from Plutarch that appears nowhere else. Plutarch is known for being someone who studied the other historians well, and we only have a handful of these historians' works still in existence, so we have to rely on people like Plutarch to tell us what was in them. So we have to go &quot;hmm, IS THIS PLAUSIBLE?&quot; If so, we need to look at the evidence, compare what we do know, and make an argument. Somethings we can eliminate instantly. For example, Plutarch says Themistocles and Aristides got into a debate after the Battle of Salamis about how to proceed. Plutarch spent a lot of time hyping up the rivalry between Themistocles and Aristides, so this fits right in.... but Herodotus, who was alive during the actual time of this period, makes it very clear that Aristides was not involved in this debate at all and it was the Spartan Eurybiades instead. But Plutarch changed this one small fact for drama. </p>
<p>So when Plutarch then creates more drama between Themistocles and Aristides by saying Themistocles told Aristides he wanted to destroy the allied fleet, but told no one but Artistides, we can say &quot;Wow, that's a huge accusation, but it probably didn't happen..&quot; there's no evidence elsewhere of it, there's no reason that this would support Themistocles' plans, or help Athens in any way (they already had hegemonic control by a lot) and why would he tell his arch nemesis of this evil plan? So in this case it's not just Plutarch changing some basic facts but he's outright lying to progress the story along to explain why Themistocles suddenly fell from grace and was chased out of Athens. </p>
<p>Now if we look at Secondary Sources: Especially modern ones, there are a lot of ones that outright lie... in fact there's a gigantic market for them -- we call them &quot;Popular History&quot; which are history books written for the public instead of academics. Pretty much anytime you see a news story &quot;Was <strong><strong>__</strong></strong> secretly gay?&quot; etc., this is popular history. If you go to your local book store, your history section is 90% popular history -- these books can't be used in proper research articles. One of the ways they get away with it is they don't actually cite any sources. There's no way to follow their evidence and check for yourself -- they do this purposefully. </p>
<p>With actual historians we are required to show our work, to cite our references, and if this was a proper article I would have shown the exact passages in Plutarch and Herodotus that you would find these changes (and if anyone really wants to know I can dig them up in the morning, but honestly right now I can't be fucked.) </p>
<p>But if I did post them and did cite them and they were wrong it opens up the door for someone to go &quot;Uh, DemDerDemDen is wrong, and here's why, based on this evidence...&quot; and I might reply with other evidence defending my position, but this sort of peer review keeps things honest (albeit bloody ;) ) </p>
<p>I hope I'm making sense, let me know if you have any questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Authority is the answer. Every field has tested and trusted leaders. These leaders criticize and accept. They are editors on trusted journals and books.</p>
<p>Authority can even be measured. In academic publishing, the &quot;impact factor&quot; of a journal is a measure of how many times, on average, each article has historically been cited. This tells you how much weight people in the field give the journal.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, as someone who has seen hundreds of people die and reviewed countless deaths for our ER, unfortunately I guess I am an expert to answer your question.</p>
<p>For younger people, the thing that kills you fastest is complete cessation of the circulation which usually involves the heart or its major vessels:</p>
<p>1) Ventricular Fibrillation or Ventricular Tachycardia:
Most people who are young and die of sudden death will be described as having died of a &quot;heart attack.&quot;  That's the easiest way to understand it.  A plaque forms in the heart that grows so big that it cuts off vital blood supply to critical muscle in the heart.  The reality is much more strange.  Yes, we have older people that get gradual narrowing of their coronaries and develop gradually poor stamina and eventually chest pressure with exertion.  They will then get seen by a Cardiologist and are often a candidate for angioplasty.  HOWEVER, there are a significant number of people (especially young people or people who have just been given a clean bill of health by their MD) who have death so sudden, many of them don't even make it to the ER.  The extremely lucky ones that do make it to the ER are usually found to be in ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation which is a very irregular rhythm that doesn't allow blood to flow from the heart.  These people have no pulse and can often be stabilized quickly by shocking them out of the rhythm.  When they go for emergent angiogram to look at the arteries, the amazing thing to me is that most of the time you may see a small arterial branch that got obstructed by a piece of plaque.  This is technically a heart attack but the amount of injured tissue is miniscule, heart contractility is not effected and the patient can make a complete recovery.  These people often had very little arterial plaque but the kind that is unstable and can break off and go to a small dead end portion of a vessel.  That localized irritated heart tissue that isn't getting blood can be a focus of irregular rhythm that disrupts the normal cycles of contractility of the heart.  The result is like an earthquake of irregular contractions that seizes up effective contractions.  This is why malls, airplanes and other public places have AEDs (automatic external defibrillators) which can identify this abnormal rhythm and shock the person out.  It will definitely save a life of someone who should expect to make a complete recovery and could live a long and healthy life.</p>
<p>2) Pulmonary Embolism
What we are talking about here is an &quot;acute saddle embolism&quot; which is a type of pulmonary embolism that is so large that it kills you instantly.  PE is when clot (typically originating in the leg) breaks off and lodges in the major artery that feeds the lungs blood.  As you know, you have two lungs and two arteries that carry blood to them but if the clot is large enough it can block the origin of the 2 arteries and completely shut down the circulation of the body as all the blood that will be circulated must travel through this passage.  This is commonly caused by people who have been sedentary for long periods such as through air travel or had an immobilized broken limb that developed large clots.  Often in a young person, they can have a yet to be diagnosed disorder that makes them clot easily like a genetic disease or sometimes I see a new diagnosis of cancer that presents with major blood clots.  Suffice it to say that sudden blockage of blood to the whole body kills people instantly if it lodges completely.</p>
<p>3) Miscelaneous
Other things that cause young people to die suddenly usually involve genetic anatomic failures of the circulatory system.  They include sudden tearing of the aorta, the main conduit of blood to the whole body, from such conditions as a variant of Marfan's disease or other collagen vascular disorders.  Other genetic conditions include abnormalities in the conduction system of the heart which often happens in people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a form of enlarged heart from birth) or something called Wolf Parkinson White syndrome where they may have an abnormal resting EKG.  Something else that can kill in a matter of minutes is complete upper airway obstruction.  The body has little oxygen reserve which can deplete very quickly.  Other possibilities for sudden death include a major seizure occurring while swimming or driving.  The person will suddenly lose control of their muscles and can drown or plow into a wall.</p>
<p>Dying from &quot;Old Age&quot;
Now the old age question is an interesting one.  The short answer is that the dying process can be so complicated to explain that people just say &quot;old age&quot; but an example of this could be a major stroke which caused the person to become bed bound and then they had progressive skin breakdown from laying in bed all day and that created an infected wound that after many attempts to surgically clean and repair became so infected they went into septic shock and died.</p>
<p>Death from old age usually starts from disability and progresses into the complex set of problems that occur from that disability.  Sometimes its not just from a heart attack or stroke making them weaker, it can be from hip fracture or simply decline in stamina from age or associated factors such as progressive arthritis or even depression from a lack of enjoyment of life.  By being sedentary, circulation declines and people can develop terrible leg swelling including clots, skin breakdown where they make contact with the bed or chair and combined with lack of nutrition there is an increased risk for infection.  </p>
<p>I'm particularly paranoid about my own loved ones in their 80's who are admitted to the hospital for a procedure and knowing that a temporary disability in the elderly can rapidly progress into a permanent one.</p>
<p>Anyways hope this helps.  Rather than scare you, please understand that we all die and our respect for death should always lead us to have an appreciation for life rather than a paranoid existence.  You are never too young to consider your legacy and to be thankful for your health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse.  I've worked in a nursing home, and currently work in a hospital. I've seen this happen many times, so I'll give it a shot.  </p>
<p>Your body is a bunch of interconnected systems.  They depend upon each other so they can function, not unlike  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd05K6uKyQw" target="_blank">this</a>.  As you get older, your systems accumulate damage or wear and do not repair themselves as well as they used to.  When enough damage is accumulated, either through extreme age or through abuse of the particular system (often a little bit of both) the system begins to fail.  When it fails, the other systems are stressed in turn.  Since they too have accumulated damage over the years, they don't have much reserves left for dealing with this additional stress, and they begin to fail.  The result is cascade multi organ failure.  Sometimes a person dies of a heart attack or some such thing, and since they were so old we don't look into it, as other posters have said.  I think what you're asking is what it looks like when a body just wears out from extreme age.  I'll give a simplistic example.  </p>
<p>Suppose someone is 99 years old.  Every system in their body has been doing it's job for 99 years, and it is much less powerful and efficient than it used to be.   They have arthritis, so they take ibuprofen for pain management.  They also don't drink enough water, as many elderly don't.  This takes a toll on their kidneys.  Kidneys are responsible for managing waste and water in the body, so if the kidneys start to fail, waste products and fluids begin to back up in the body.  Their heart was functioning adequately for the amount of blood it was supposed to pump, but soon there's significantly more fluid than the heart is prepared for.  The heart begins to work harder, causing the person to get tired easier.  As time goes on, the kidneys continue to go down hill and the fluid backs up even further and begins to collect in the lungs.  The body begins to panic as it realizes the lungs are in danger, so the person starts breathing harder, heart rate increases to try and get oxygen to all the important tissues.  This puts more stress on the heart and lungs, as both systems are being pushed beyond capacity. This increase in blood pressure forces more fluid into the lungs, which results in less oxygen transfer with every breath.  This is a cycle which perpetuates itself, where each effort the body makes to overcome one problem makes another one worse.  Meanwhile, waste products are building up, so nothing works as well as it could, even with age taken into account.  Ultimately, one system or another finally exhausts its reserves and quits. The other systems are so exhausted from trying to prop up the failing system that they almost immediately fail as well. Ultimately, death is caused in the tissues by lack of oxygen.  If the heart fails, the oxygen cant move from the lungs to the tissues.  If the lungs fail, the oxygen can't get from the air into the blood.  In any case, you go long enough without oxygen to a tissue, it dies.  Enough tissue dies, it kills the organ.  Enough organs die, the person dies. So, in the case above you could say the person dies of respiratory arrest, or cardiac arrest, but ultimately it doesn't matter.  Technically I suppose you could call it multisystem organ failure? In any case, the phenomenon is most easily understood as a body just wearing out.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A typical patient we see has dementia and a full laundry list of other problems. They're usually in their late 80's or older, and they're almost always women. When I say laundry list, I mean they're in a body that has been going for a long, long time, and it's like a cheap hooptie on Craig's List. There's very little go left in it. </p>
<p>So let's say we see someone on Thursday. And they're a little present, in that they know a dog is visiting them, and they may interact a little bit with him, petting him, and talking to him. Some of the talk makes sense and some of it? They're talking to a dog they had when they were 10. It's all good. </p>
<p>And then I'll get a text that so and so is &quot;transitioning&quot;. So that means they're actively dying. If I go see that person, and they are now actively dying, they don't interact at all with me. They have no idea I'm there. If the family is there, they interact with the dog because for some people hugging a fuzzy dog makes a shitty situation a little more bearable. </p>
<p>But anyway, there's that point where the person is a person, and can understand that I'm there with a dog, even if it's an elusive understanding, and that point where they're still human, but what makes them them and not some other person, is leaving or fully gone. </p>
<p>I'll be honest: one day when I'm like that, I'm ok with leaving. When you get to that stage, there is not much left, unless these people are having a massively interesting internal dialog with themselves. I have no idea. </p>
<p>I see some people in hospice and you'd have no idea that they were on palliative care. They're fully present when you talk to them, and often much younger than that typical late 80's with dementia person. There was one woman we were visiting for awhile who had lung cancer, and was about my age. She had schizophrenia, so at times it was a bit odd to have a conversation with her, but we would go for walks around the grounds of the group home she lived in, and like I said, you would have no idea she was dying. </p>
<p>On that topic I wear a badge on a lanyard around my neck when I'm in a facility with my dog, but there are some patients where I hide the badge. It has the name of the group I volunteer for and the word &quot;HOSPICE&quot; on it, and some patients and their families don't want to see that word. </p>
<p>I think people used to be around dying people more often, and they had more acceptance and understanding of it, without maybe knowing all the nuts and bolts of exactly what was going on. But they knew that so and so was dying, and now was the time to see them before they left. </p>
<p>Finally, my husband's grandfather is 96 and grandma is 92. They still live on their own, drive, do volunteer work, etc. But if one day Gramps forgets to wake up, it's not going to surprise us. We'll be sad, and we're going to miss him, but things wear out, be they human or machine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all deaths from non traumatic causes are ultimately due to cardiac arrest, which is when the heart is unable to adequately pump blood to maintain life. </p>
<p>So although it may sound very obvious, people who die of old age die of cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Then the next question becomes, what causes someone to suddenly go into cardiac arrest. There are lots of potential causes for this.</p>
<p>Once a person reaches a certain age, their heart generally will not function as well as a young person. There heart is at an increased risk of going into arrthymia, which is when the heart beats too erratically to have normal pump function. A few seconds of a cardiac arrthymia can lead to loss of consciousness. It occurring for a few more minutes can lead to death minutes of cardiac arrthymia.</p>
<p>Small things such as large changes in temperature, poorer breathing when sleeping in the middle of the night, a sudden heart attack can trigger a lethal arrthymia in the elderly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There will always be a more immediate cause than &quot;just&quot; dying, it's just that it's not always necessary or desirable to go in to the details. Sudden deaths tend to be failures of the circulatory system, such as heart failure or stroke, and it's possible to go in to more detail in each case e.g. a heart failure could be a heart attack (artery blockage), valve failure, electrical/nervous system. The general term &quot;stroke&quot; covers two different kinds of circulatory failure (blockage or bleeding). </p>
<p>So you could say &quot;dying of old age&quot; is shorthand for &quot;dying from one of those conditions that are more likely in old age&quot;! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Plate boundaries are shifting on average around 5cm per year, some are much slower but some are much faster (I think they clocked one in at 18cm / year) so there are <em>huge</em> engineering efforts combating these perpetual forces of nature. </p>
<p>The first thing they do is avoid these areas at all costs but if it's not avoidable (Think San Francisco, everywhere) then building things so they can either bend or have devices in the to let them either expand or contract is just the start. Now, overpasses and pipelines and sewers don't like to do these things so engineers either have to choose what the smaller cost is: to replace it after it is destroyed or to put in failsafes. </p>
<p>A highway or water infrastructure system failure isn't nearly as catastrophic as a hydro-electric dam failure so planning accordingly is the biggest factor in it all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In construction we utilize things called expansion joints to compensate for the natural expanding and contracting that occur throughout the year whether it be caused by weather/temperature shifts or the physical changes in the ground surface. Bridges, for instance, utilize various different types of plates that allow the bridge steel to slide back and forth over the columns in the middle as this shifting occurs. Next time you drive over a bridge look at the ground on either side. You'll likely see something similar to this: </p>

<p>The wind driven pumps in old movies had many blades filling that disk. </p>
<p>Doesn't the 3 blade approach mean some useful wind is wasted between the blades? </p>
<p>The obvious answer is because this is the most efficient design, but how is that conclusion reached?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try my best to answer this because I studied this in school.</p>
<p>In theory, the most efficient turbine would be with one blade, because there are no other blades to create turbulance in front of the blade. However, in practice this creates an unbalanced rotor, so it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Then, the next most efficient blade system would be a two bladed system. However, these tend to vibrate on a third plane, losing lots of energy to friction. To overcome this, some turbines have a teetering hub, but that is more expensive to manufacture.</p>
<p>A three blades design allows for the most efficiency in practice. More blades would create more turbulance, so the costs of making more blades on a turbine would outweigh the benefits of the extra electricity being created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a lab at work (science centre) about this.</p>
<p>More blades gives more electricity, but with diminishing returns, and blades are expensive. Therefore, you want to find a number of blades where the return on one more blade is less than the increase in service cost.</p>
<p>The difference between two and three blades is large. The difference between the and four blades is slight.</p>
<p>One of the largest service costs is due to different wind speeds on different parts of the mill: wind speeds tend to vary in relation to distance off the ground squared. Turns out, with 3 blades the force on the mill from wind is more evenly distributed than with 2 or 4 blades. This reduces wear on the axle to a noticeable degree.</p>
<p>At the end of the day you get a bigger return building a larger mill than adding another blade when you have 3 blades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Having more than 3 blades can be less efficient in terms of manufacturing costs since the blades are often very large and expensive.  </p>
<p>You may also be interested in an efficiency limit on how much power a wind turbine can harvest from an airflow called the Betz Limit.  </p>
<p>Source:   <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/lifteq.html" target="_blank">NASA</a> has lots of very good pages on aerodynamics and such on their website. When looking at the lift equation here, keep in mind that the blade has much greater velocities as you go further out and that the blade has different surface areas throughout. We must therefore break down the blade into sections, calculating the lift for each section for it's different properties. Also note that the complexities of air compression and wind conditions are hidden in the lift coefficient.</p>
<p>Computational Fluid Dynamics, which often make use of Navier-Stoke equations are also used in calculating these things.</p>
