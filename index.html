I usually try to listen in a bit because I'm interested, but they always move too fast for me, even though they might be talking at &quot;regular speed&quot;. But, if I'm listening to a conversation in English, they have to be talking exceptionally fast for me to regard it as such. Why is that?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not because they are taking faster, usually. Sometimes they are, my high school Spanish teacher told me that Puerto Ricans speak very fast relative to the rest of the Spanish speaking world. But the true reason lies in the fact that you are not accustomed to recognizing natural breaks in the spoken language. Words will blend together or seem to chop up as you're unable to determine where one word ends and another begins. And that's where the speed confusion comes into play. </p>
<p>A couple examples: the Italian phrase &quot;In bocca al lupo&quot; may sound like &quot;Inbo cal upo&quot; to a non-speaker. Likewise the Swahili word &quot;Tunachohitaji&quot; may sound like &quot;Tuna cho hit aji&quot; so while they've only said one word, it sounds like multiple words fired off in rapid succession. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's probably a couple things at work.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When listening, we often don't fully hear every word but, using context, we can make good assumptions about what the word we didn't hear was. Like if someone says &quot;I went to the grocery store and bought eggs&quot; and you didn't hear 'grocery', but maybe only heard a word that ended in y, you can make a good guess that the word was grocery, because what other store do you go to buy eggs right? Sometimes you guess wrong, and that can lead to confusion, you thought someone said something different than what they actually said. But <em>usually</em> your guess is correct. But with a foreign language, this doesn't work, you have no idea what <em>any</em> of the words are, so you don't even know when a word begins or ends, and you have no context available to tease out meaning. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kinda related. In conversation, using context, you can often predict the next words people are about to say before they say them. We speak in pretty repetitive ways in everyday conversation, and we use common phrases that you can finish in your head before they fully say the whole thing. You know what words to expect, so you know what to listen for. Someone says &quot;The devil went down--&quot; and you immediately think &quot;--to Georgia&quot; before they've even said it, because we can usually think faster than we can talk. For example, have you noticed you can read a page in a book much faster than you could recite the page out loud? Thinking is faster than speaking. But with a foreign language, you have no idea what to expect. You don't know any of the words, every new sound coming at you is basically a surprise, you can't recognize any of the patterns and common phrases that you're so familiar with in your native tongue.</p>
</li>
<li>Some languages really do speak faster than others. I don't know which ones, and you might feel like foreign-language speakers are speaking faster than you would when really they're not. But some languages really are spoken faster or slower than other languages. Most languages have really subtle rhythms to them, like people have said much of English is spoken in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter" target="_blank">iambic pentameter</a>. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here are true, however, they are missing the main factor.  Information density.</p>
<p>English is a very information dense language.  That means that to express a complete thought, you have to use fewer words/syllables.  Spanish on the other hand (the language I think sounds the fastest in general) is only about 70% as dense as English.</p>
<p>The speed of speech is not dictated by the number of syllables, but instead how quickly we think.</p>
<p>Therefore if it takes more syllables to express the same thought, we will just naturally pack more syllables into the same time frame.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at an audio spectrum of someone talking, the pauses between words and sentences don't exist to nearly the degree that you think they do. Talking is a fairly continuous sound, but your brain has learned how to break it up into words and insert much longer feeling pauses than actually exists.  When you don't really know how to segment the language, because you're just learning it, your brain has a much harder time splitting up the sounds into word boundaries, so you get a much more blurred together feel to the sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons: One, error codes usually aren't intended to be seen by end users. In an ideal world, only a dev will ever see an error code, and the vast majority of their user base have no way to resolve the ones they will see even if they do see them.</p>
<p>Two, sometimes the program <em>can't</em> tell you what happened, really. Especially in the case of crashes, which are literally cases where a situation has occurred that the program has no code for and thus can't continue. In the case of an 'unable to connect' error, there are so many things that could have gone wrong, and the program isn't necessarily equipped to tell you which one is the culprit. Did your internet go down? At what point? Are the servers too busy? Are the servers down? Did you fail some kind of authentication? It might not actually be able to tell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>An error code that translates to &quot;Couldn't connect to server&quot; for example, means that <em>for some reason</em> the program couldn't connect.  </p>
<p>What exactly is wrong in that scenario?  It could be that your internet connection is down, the server is down, both are down, you turned off your wifi antenna, there's a memory leak in the program's net code, the net code is poorly written, and many, many more possibilities.  </p>
<p>So often, the error will be accompanied by <em>common</em> &quot;what is wrong&quot; causes of the error code &quot;Check your internet connection, check your firewall, server busy/try again later, etc.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you write a program, you add error detection at different locations in your code for all the kinds of things that can potentially go wrong. The error code basically tells the programmer what error detection mechanism was triggered so he knows where to look in his code. These errors are pretty specific and often don't translate 1:1 into something users can make sense of. An explaination for users can (and should) be added though when it makes sense (especially if the user can fix the problem themself, as in your example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gibberish is generally helpful to the developers, and usually comes in the form of a 'stack trace'. This is essentially the list of functions the program was working on at the time that the error occurred. There will also be a technical cause for the error, probably due to trying to access an invalid part of memory.</p>
<p>If the error comes up enough they can try to catch it and replace the gibberish with something helpful to the user, but that relies on coding a way of catching that particular error, handling it, and recovering the program to a usable state. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Male ticks do bite (however, they don't transmit lyme disease). People would be much less likely to agree to releasing millions of biting ticks.</p>
<p>Also, it requires millions to be released at once to overwhelm the numbers of wild males. We are exceedingly good at breeding mosquitoes in captivity. Not sure how good we are at breeding ticks in massive numbers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine does not provide energy at all. It just stops your brain from telling the rest of your body to become tired.</p>
<p>An ELI5 explanation of how caffeine works is probably like this: In your brain, there are keys and keyholes. When the key goes into the hole, your brain performs various functions. There is a keyhole, that when a certain key goes inside, your brain releases chemicals to make you tired. Caffeine fits in the keyhole, but does not pass the message to become tired. It just blocks the real keys from going inside. </p>
<p>In response, your brain makes more keyholes. This is why heavy caffeine users need more and more caffeine just to feel normal. Because you have so many keyholes, if you don't fill them with caffeine, your brain will send super strong signals to make you tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine as a molecule blocks the normal activity of receptors in the brain. These receptors usually interact to a molecule called adenosine. When these receptors bond with adenosine, your brain reads this as being tired.
If you drink coffee when your adenosine levels are low (optimal time for a cuppa in the morning is 30mins-1 hour after waking up, NOT IMMEDIATELY) then the caffeine blocks these molecules from being bonded with and your brain doesn't feel tired.<br />
Whereas, if your brain is all full up of adenosine, then as it can't shove the adenosine out of its place, all you feel are the other affects of caffeine such as increased heart beat</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a slot in your brain that only takes a certain shaped chemical. That chemical is called adenosine and it makes you feel tired when it fits into that slot. Caffeine works because it looks similar enough to your brain to fit into the adenosine slot, but because it's slightly different it kind of &quot;blocks&quot; the slot so no more adenosine can be absorbed. </p>
<p>Therefore caffeine doesn't really give you energy at all, but instead it makes you less capable of feeling tired. </p>
<p>By now you're wondering &quot;So why do I feel a pick-me-up from drinking caffeine?&quot; and mindblowing truth is that you weren't tired from adenosine being absorbed, you were tired because you were in the midst of a <em>caffeine withdrawal</em> and thus felt much better once you got your fix. </p>
<p>Caffeine is a beautiful lie. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of other answers assume you are sleep deprived.  Lets say you just slept for 8 hours, had a cup of coffee, and it's otherwise a normal day but you still feel <em>tired.</em>  Maybe you even feel more tired after the coffee?</p>
<p>It's because of Dehydration.  If you are dehydrated, the 'plasma' in your blood is greatly reduced.  This 'plasma' is actually almost all water with a few other things in it.  This means your blood cells are now crowded together in less fluid. Like people in a crowded swimming pool, they cannot move easily.  According to <a href="http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/dehydration-and-its-effects-on-performance" target="_blank">studies</a>, a 5% decrease in body water weight from dehydration, can result in a 30% decrease in physical ability. </p>
<p><a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003281.htm" target="_blank">Here's an easy test</a> for checking how dehydrated you are. No special tools required!</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> Some people are saying that more recent studies show the dehydration of caffeine is not significant (A 2005 study vs a 1928 study).  I checked out the studies, and I personally don't feel either are conclusive because of sample size (50 individuals) and because water intake wasn't controlled rigorously.   Either way, moving the controversial statement below...  please stop PMing me.  </p>
<p>Caffeine further dehydrates you, especially the 180mg that's in cup of coffee (there's 34mg in a Coke and 60mg in a black tea bag). That's why you can get even more tired feeling after your cup of coffee!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You should realize here that a lot of the technology was already in place aboard the LM in order to broadcast information back home. The mission crew at NASA needed to be able to communicate with the crew aboard the LM, they also needed telemetry, voice, and various computer diagnostics to be streamed back to Earth in order to monitor the mission. They used both UHF and VHF streams  while they tracked over a C-band beacon on the LM.</p>
<p>NASA also developed something called USB (Unified S-band) streaming which combined tracking, telemetry, ranging, command, voice, and television data into a single antenna. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to give an eli5 but keep in mind it's an highly abstracted answer
which grows in complexity step by step. </p>
<p>To answer your question you need to look at the structure of the CPU itself.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>we'll start from a <strong>transistor</strong> that like you said act as a <strong>switch</strong>.
it can transmit electric power (logic '1') or block it (logic '0').</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arranging those switches in a specific structure gives you a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate" target="_blank">logic gate</a></strong>.</p>
<p>the basic gates are called: <strong>NOT, OR, AND</strong> and they translate one state of their input to another state of their output.</p>
<p>NOT (0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;0), OR(00-&gt;0, 01-&gt;1, 10-&gt;1, 11-&gt;1), AND(00-&gt;0, 01-&gt;0, 10-&gt;0, 11-&gt;1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arranging those gates together in a bigger structure can give you more complex gates
such as <strong>NAND,NOR,XOR,XNOR</strong>, each with it's own translating function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arranging those complex gates together can also give you a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_cell_\(binary\)" target="_blank">memory cell</a></strong> that can store the state of '0' or '1' over time. (keeping the output the same while ignoring change in the input)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>combining memory cells together with logic gates gives you a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">state machine</a></strong>.
the state machine look at it's input and current state in memory and decide what the output
and the next state of the machine should be.</p>
</li>
<li>and finally we got to <strong>the CPU</strong> itself which consist of some logic (big structure of logic gates that do some specific function) and a complex  state machine the control how the CPU should work and what logic function should be activated in the current cycle of the machine.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>last note:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>this description will not be complete without considering the <strong>software</strong> part of things.
a software is a set of instructions that is stored in memory.  each instruction is represented by  binary code consists from '1' and '0'. for example &quot;0101 1111 1101&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>the state machine inside the CPU (the one that control and choose the logic to be used) runs in a loop that is called an <strong>instruction cycle</strong>. each instruction cycle consist of 3 stages: <strong>fetch, decode, execute</strong>. fetch means to read the next software instruction from memory. decode means to decode what this instruction means. for example 0101 in the instruction above means add two numbers. the numbers are 1111 and 1101.
and execute means to activate the needed logic in order to make the computation.
in this example the state machine will activate the logic that can add two numbers.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>so <strong>tl;dr</strong>: the cpu has a state machine (lots of switches) inside of it that toggle all the other logic (lots of other switches) and do the work that the software ('1' and '0' in memory) tells it to do. </p>
<p>and you get your dank meme.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trying to describe a CPU directly with switches is like trying to explain why bacon tastes good with protons and electrons.  You first need to understand how the smaller components are organized into larger, more complex ones, on multiple levels.</p>
<p>We start with transistors, which can act as switches.  A handful of switches can be used to make logic gates.  They typically have two or more inputs and one output.  The ouput represents a basic logical operation on the inputs, like AND or OR, or more commonly the negated version, NAND and NOR.</p>
<p>A handful of logic gates can be used to form basic digital circuits.  A flip-flop circuit can store a single binary digit, and an adder can add two binary digits together.  Chaining eight of these together lets you perform operations on bytes. </p>
<p>Digital circuits can be used to create the building blocks of the CPU.  The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs basic data manipulation operations.  The memory unit moves data from memory to cache, and cache to registers, where it can be operated on directly by the rest of the CPU.  The control unit loads instructions from memory, then interprets the instructions as a sequence of memory and ALU operations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The person who built the processor - for example Intel - decides what each combination means.</p>
<p>The CPU understands a language called &quot;machine code&quot;. Machine code is made up of a series of 0s and 1s.</p>
<p>There is a command called MOV, which moves a piece of data from one place to another. MOV isn't actually machine code, because it's not 0s and 1s - it's something roughly equivalent to machine code but (slightly) more human-readable called &quot;assembly language&quot; The machine code equivalent of MOV is 10001001. (Actually, there are lots of variants of MOV, and this is the first half of one of the variants, but I'm trying to keep it simple.)</p>
<p>This code was decided by Intel. They could have chosen any code they wanted, but this was the code that they chose.</p>
<p>So they built a group of switches so that there are a group of 8 wires, and when the 1st, 5th and 8th of those wires all have a signal on them, but the others don't, the switches turn on the &quot;move&quot; circuit.</p>
<p>Then, they built thousands of other groups of switches that work in a similar way. They also built switches that actually do the moving, or the adding, or the subtracting, or whatever else needs to be done, and connected them up so that they get turned on and off when they're required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Like you're five&quot;...</p>
<p>It's going to be impossible to provide an accurate answer to a five year old, so let me give you a similar question that has an answer a five year old can understand:</p>
<p>How does a car know where to go?  A car is just a bunch of gears and belts, but who or what decides if it should go left or right or faster or slower?</p>
<p>What the car does depends on what the driver does.  If the driver turns the steering wheel, there's basically a series of gears and belts that push and pull each other so that the two front wheels change the direction they are pointing.  If the driver presses the brake levers, those levers push other things that eventually push the brakes onto the wheels.  The levers and gears and belts and wheels are built so that when one lever or wheel is moved a certain way, it moves a whole bunch of other stuff that causes the intended result.  You could call the collects of gears and belts and so on &quot;systems&quot; in the car.  The systems are structured so that the gears push each other as they should.</p>
<p>There are also systems in a CPU.  CPU systems are set up so that when a 1 goes in at a certain spot, and a 0 at another spot, and another 0 at a third spot (these would be inputs), they produce a series of 0s and 1s somewhere else (outputs).  This would be like a person turning the steering wheel left while pressing the gas (inputs).  The car moves to the left (output).  It's the structure (the shape and positioning of the parts of the CPU) that make it turn inputs into outputs.</p>
<p>So fundamentally, what makes the CPU produce 1 and 0s?  The structure of the CPU.</p>
<p>Going much beyond that requires you be at least 6 to understand the answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the answer to this question is basically an undergraduate major. But maybe one approach to help you understand is to look at a very basic pseudocode and see how it turns into machine code and see how the machine handles the machine code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>result = 1 + 1</p>
<p>print result</p>
</blockquote>
<p>simple right? in my pretend assembly language (each architecture has its own assembly language, which is basically a human readable representation of machine code) my code might turn into this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>add 1,1,r1</p>
<p>push r1</p>
<p>jump print</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the assembly code has an intermediate step where those names are translated into physical values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>add 1,1,0x1</p>
<p>push 0x1</p>
<p>jump 0x8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i'll explain what exactly happened here in a bit. but further translating this into machine code you might get something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>00 01 01 01</p>
<p>01 01 0000</p>
<p>10 1000 00</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now you can sort of describe this in terms of switches. The first two ones and zeros are the control part. they determine where the rest of the signal goes. they do this with a variety of and/or gates combined in a special way to give a unique output for each possible combination (in this scenario, there are 4 possible paths, 00, 01, 10, 11 - just because of how i designed the machine code) this is called a multiplexer. so whenever the first two bits are 00, the rest go to the adder circuit in our cpu, which only has the function to add two numbers. the two numbers are the next 4 signals, each number being 2 bits so it can be either 0,1,2 or 3. here we are adding 1+1. the last two bits are what i earlier called &quot;r1&quot; for register. its just a piece of memory. it again goes to a multiplexer and enables writing to that particular register (we have 4 registers because its a 2 bit address) though the physical wires will be connected to all the memory spots. &quot;enabling&quot; a write is just another sort of manipulation of and/or gates.</p>
<p>you can look at the next instruction now, and see the first two bits are different. that means they go to a totally different circuit, which operates on the same principles as above. holy crap im bad at explaining to 5 year olds so i'll stop the post now</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, horses have eight different blood types, and each type can exist in a variety of forms, and they can also have a type from each of the other types.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://equusmagazine.com/diseases/blood-12901" target="_blank">Equine Blood Transfusions</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Horses have eight major blood types---A, C, D, K, P, Q, U and T (the first seven of which are internationally recognized)---with more than 30 different factors for which they can be positive or negative. These can combine in a number of different ways, designated by an upper-case letter for the type, combined with a lower-case letter for the factor, such as A (a,b,c,f,g), Ca, D (a,g,k), Ka, P (a,b), Q (a,b,c), etc. All of these possibilities create about a 1-in-400,000 chance of finding a 100 percent perfect match between two horses. The two most important and problematic antigens we consider when selecting equine blood donors are Qa and Aa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to what makes humans different, only humans and some related primates have the gene for ABO blood types. Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494955/" target="_blank">The ABO blood group is a trans-species polymorphism in primates</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ABO histo-blood group, the critical determinant of transfusion incompatibility, was the first genetic polymorphism discovered in humans. Remarkably, ABO antigens are also polymorphic in many other primates, with the same two amino acid changes responsible for A and B specificity in all species sequenced to date. Whether this recurrence of A and B antigens is the result of an ancient polymorphism maintained across species or due to numerous, more recent instances of convergent evolution has been debated for decades, with a current consensus in support of convergent evolution. We show instead that genetic variation data in humans and gibbons as well as in Old World monkeys are inconsistent with a model of convergent evolution and support the hypothesis of an ancient, multiallelic polymorphism of which some alleles are shared by descent among species. These results demonstrate that the A and B blood groups result from a trans-species polymorphism among distantly related species and has remained under balancing selection for tens of millions of years—to date, the only such example in hominoids and Old World monkeys outside of the major histocompatibility complex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguably the best studied case of apparent convergent evolution is the ABO blood group (A, B, AB, O) (1, 8), the first molecular polymorphism to be characterized in humans. ABO blood groups are defined by the presence or absence of specific antigens that circulate in body fluids and are attached to lipids at the surface of various epithelial and endothelial cell types (notably in the gastrointestinal tract, but also, in hominoids only, on red blood cells) (9, 10). These antigens are associated with complementary immune antibodies produced in the gut after contact with bacteria and viruses carrying A-like and B-like antigens (11). Whereas the biological significance of ABO outside of its role in transfusion is unclear (12), histo-blood antigens in general are known to act as cellular receptors by which pathogens can initiate infections (13–15). Furthermore, variation in ABO has been associated with susceptibility to a number of infectious diseases (reviewed in ref. 16), pointing to a role of ABO in immune response.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes, as you can see.
I want to address the broader question here that many commenters are sort of missing. How is blood in itself different between species.
Most of the issues when you think about &quot;typing&quot; is a consequence of learning about the antibodies present on red blood cells. About every cell in your body has two little towers, MHC complexes. These function to let your immune system function, part of their job though involves with the cell nucleus, which rbc do not have. Blood does NOT have these complexes either! Instead there are a variety of very complex &quot;factors&quot; and other functional proteins, carbohydrates and such. This is really important because it is those factors that lead to coagulation upon transmission into a new individual. They clump to other blood cells and clog our veins/arteries interestingly enough for dogs and cats (maybe others I am not sure), most can get a transfusion the first time and be fine. Now this is certainly not best practice but it goes to show the difference in the coagulation cascade between mammals.<br />
Other animals have an incredible amount of diversity for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bovines have 80 blood factors and 11 groups</li>
<li>Porcines have 16 groups</li>
<li>Sheep have 22 factors and 7 groups</li>
<li>Equines have 34 factors and 7 groups</li>
</ol>
<p>In humans you really would not have a scenario were say an individual mates with another one and their baby dies, but in some animals this can happen and it is called neonatal isoerythrolysis and probably a result of domestication and inbreeding. It is more complicated than simple &quot;typing&quot; and has alot to do with the antigens present such as Mik antigen in cats, and unfortunately the prevalence for this is unknown. This is why vets should ALWAYS CROSSMATCH, because typing alone does not really tell the whole story. Unfortunately, most clinicians have limited experience or technical capabilities to do this and opt to type or Ive seen many times no typing be done and infusions given if that is the animals first one.   </p>
<p>Further than that it is important to remember we are talking about mammals. Avian and reptile species have nucleated blood cells which is another whole game. Mammals decided a long time ago to shoot out our nucleus and have increased oxygen carrying as a benefit. bird and reptile haematology is incredibly complicated and honestly I am not sure I have really heard of transfusions being common. Ejection of the nucleus is the rate limiting step for pre rbcs to become erythrocytes (rbcs) and this is not needed in reptiles and birds. So to an extent they have a faster maturation time for blood. Therefore, it has been less common to try transfusions and little research has been done.  We really do not know a lot about other (exotic) species in general and hematology is a complex field to study. Most of the work is going to happen in a zoo, university, or the field. Whereas the common pet/livestock species are more likely candidates  for this research. For every 100 research project at a school I'd say maybe 10 are exotic focused, but this depends upon the school. </p>
<p>Edit: I shouldn't talk about humans I suppose, it is possible for humans to have a similar condition with their offspring but different mechanisms are involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cat breeder here and experienced with non domestic species. Cats have blood groups A, B and more rarely AB. This is very important information for breeders as blood type B cats produce anti A antibodies in colostrum. This means that a blood type B queen (female) bred to a blood type A stud can result in roughly a 50 / 50 split in A and B blood types in the litter. If allowed to suckle in the first 18 to 25 hours of birth the blood type A kittens can lose toes, tips of the tail and eventually die. While some breeds such as the oriental are almost always A, other breeds like the British Shorthair have a very high number of B blood type cats. So testing all breeding cats for blood type is essential. Occasionally breeders may decide the mating of an A stud to B girl is worthwhile, however the breeder must hand rear the kittens for the first 24 hours to prevent ingestion of the high antibody colostrum. A type A queen can nurse both A and B kittens. Blood type AB is separate from the other groups entirely and can nurse either however it is the rarest blood group. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

a) If you move past objects of different distance to you, the near objects appear to move past you rather fast, while the further an object is away, the slower it seems to move. Commercial airplanes fly at an altitude of ~ 10-11 km, so the ground seems to move past very slowly. But this slow movement is not really observable, because:
b) the texture of the ocean is very simple and redundant (= it repeats itself) and also so far away that no remarkable spots or patterns are able to be seen from a plane, which means unless there is an island or a large boat you have no point of reference, meaning you cannot measure your change of position relative to it.
