		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fog is from the water vapor in the air. Obviously, because it's so cold, it doesn't really stay in the gas phase, but all of the water particles cool so quickly that they don't have time to form large water droplets, so they instead form a very fine mist, which also freezes into this thick white fog. It's like ice fog.</p>
<p>I can't find much info on how dry ice behaves in an atmosphere with 0% relative humidity, but I bet there wouldn't be any fog.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right in that water usually needs to heat up to form a vapor. The responses here are accurate as well but I'd like to try explains it myself. </p>
<p>As others have already stated:
The fog from dry ice is actually caused by water vapor much like clouds are made from water vapor.  There are hundreds to millions of tiny water droplets suspended in the cloud that refract and bend the light as it passes through which is how the white color is created. </p>
<p>How it happens:
Water in the air condensing at the surface of the dry ice and then being carried away by convective currents. Imagine a cold glass that accumulates condensation. That's what's happening at the surface of the dry ice and why you don't need heat! But as the dry ice sublimates (changes from solid to gas) it creates a kind of CO2 gas current that blows the moisture away. This happens at a very small scale so the moisture droplets are incredibly  small. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

However, in the atmosphere steam typically, though not always, involves some amount of condensation into tiny water droplets. CO2 is also invisible, but CO2 from dry ice is so cold that it also condenses small water droplets in the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MLMs have a large focus on being independent and becoming &quot;your own&quot; business. To the participant you feel like you are cutting out the middle man. It's marketed as a cheaper and easier alternative to being a small business with room for &quot;unlimited&quot; growth. In reality only people who have large networks of people at their disposal will be successful and usually those people already have multiple MLM schemes working for them so to the people they sign up it looks like a good idea.  In reality the average person will sign up and reach a plateau before ever becoming profitable. This plateau is especially evident in cases where the product is specific and the larger push is upon signing up other people to make money. In companies where the product come first (and it's good products) growth and profitability can be achieved at a fairly low level because getting people to buy into a business that has products you'll actually use is easier than selling a crappy energy drink. </p>
<p>source. Every woman on my moms side of the family is involved in some MLM with varying degrees of success. If anyone has a way to explain to my mom how this is bad please let me know. I've been trying for years to get her to stop trying to sell everyone I know on anti radiation phone chips for years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is a good reason for this, technology (I am speaking from experience, I have built this tech before). It has made what was once a labor and capital intensive process into something that borders on trivial. </p>
<p>MLM's years ago used to make sellers their own warehouse, their own tax accountant... the process of getting into the game was somewhat costly and somewhat difficult. Technology has removed all of that, drastically lowering the bar to entering the MLM space. You simply need &quot;samples&quot; now, as the products will be shipped directly to the purchaser. </p>
<p>With most of the manufacturing being done in china, and the goods costing pennies on the dollar and having massive markups the profits from running one are insane. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did world financial group for a bit until I did the math and asked questions people started to open up to answering. Basically, it uses cult techniques that exploits your dreams. You're psychologically bias, you know you deserve and opportunity like this and you see how easy it is for others that are doing well, but you do not process the majority are failures since you're told all you gotta do is commit unlike &quot;the others.&quot;</p>
<p>I never pushed my &quot;business&quot; on others because I'm not a moron, it looks bad if you have nothing to show yourself. My immediate uplines and sidelines were morons that didn't understand that, there was a reason they were failures, having their little meetings everyday instead of out &quot;doing business&quot;. Mlm exploits hope and convinces you it's possible to be successful while still being in your own comfort zone, you don't gotta talk to strangers just talk to people you're friends with, except you lose your friends. </p>
<p>The first red flag was how scammy it sounds. I was basically stalked by my friend pushing it really hard. He tried to act smooth but he was obviously a moron that didn't know what he was talking about. I caved though because, clearly, he benefitted from having me being a part of it and I figured I owed him the shit since he recently helped me get a job at the time. He was so desperate.</p>
<p>I showed up, they say it has a membership fee of $100 to &quot;earn your business license.&quot; This was the next red flag. Right away, I asked who got the money and the guy says it goes to WFG. This was the red flag, world financial group already banked on me failing, this is their way to still make a buck. I dropped the $100 because &quot;why not, I have a job now and don't really need the money.&quot; Then they pushed this starter kit that varies in prices depending on who you're upline is. I paid full price, $100. The more competent uplines typically hand them out for free because they're confident in their training, mine wasn't.</p>
<p>They later pushed their insurance policy on me and sold it. I was new to being an adult, never once really thought about financial stuff, and I was open minded. They one on one push how to make money in the long term with sound arguments I agreed with, it's simple math. You get an insurance policy and a little extra and then your money grows with compound interest. It isn't a scam, it does work in the way explained. The red flag was when he pushed more than a minimum wage worker could comfortably afford. I did it anyways so I could have an early retirement. The math checks out, what he said was true that I would have a lot of money. The catch is he pushes you to sign without reading stuff, he fails to tell you how you get monthly payments of your money you have accumulated rather than a giant dump of cash, he failed to mention how difficult it is to get your money back and how trivial of a process it is. Odds are, you will have spent more money than you will ever get back in your retired life time, they're banking you die of old age before you get your money back. The guy also failed to mention how huge of a cut he gets depending how much I spend.</p>
<p>I eventually gain confidence from my friend bragging about how much money is waiting for him when he gets his license. His upline promises to give him a payout for some of the stuff once he earns his insurance license, but he ended up dying in the business after failing. It was just me left after awhile and the hardcore members of my immediate circle. I too would fail the law part of the insurance policy because of how terrible test teachers is in teaching Nevada law. I passed the other parts of the test easily since they had developed videos, but Nevada law is just an intimidating wall of text. After four attempts, I gave up. By the way, each attempt costs money. </p>
<p>My upline pushed me to take these tests even though I didn't feel confident because he needed a certain amount of people below him to be licensed so he gets to the next level. He even gave fake promises to pay for my test after I take it, but he never did and instead offered to pay for the next one as the &quot;payback.&quot; </p>
<p>One thing they push was us to go to the conventions. It costs $300 to attend this super important convention, it gives super important lessons and will change your life. When I showed up, ready to take notes, sleep deprived because the lines forced us to wake up early, all the bullshit, it was a disappointing experience. I was lucky, I got to stay in a nearby hotel for free because some people they really liked me gave me a pass. The convention was more cult like scams. The people never taught anything, just gave motivational speeches and stories, no real meaningful lessons except for one girl who gave her tips and advice. However, she was cut short for not being important like the others. I leave the convention with virtually no notes and $300 short of a profit. </p>
<p>I spoke to my peers within the hardcore dedicated circle within my clique. I hear their personal lives and learn what they sacrificed to be there, what they have gained from it. In spite being so good at what they do, they're not even middle class, they live with families and the likes. One tragic story one individual told me was the final red flag. </p>
<p>He tells me how he was a successful banker about to become a head that makes a lot of money. However, he was so passionate about WFG that he quit for it. He was so popular, he had so many friends. He was invited to every party, everytime. However, he said &quot;one day, people just stopped inviting me to parties... They were afraid I would just bring up my business every time.&quot; I asked, of course, would he. He said with a smile, &quot;of course&quot; then gives a slight defeated laugh. I asked if he had any friends that still talks to him. Uncomfortable to admit it, but he said no but that it's okay because world financial group is his life now, he is always doing world financial group and will never stop. This was the last red flag and that was when I stopped my insurance policy. </p>
<p>I tried to get the money I invested into the policy, I tried to go through the website and it had nothing, I called their support and they wouldn't help me. Basically, TransAmerica stole several hundreds of dollars from me. They didn't give clear comfortable instructions over the phone, something about mailing in a letter, it was intimidating to me at the time and I just gave in, I regrettably allowed them to win. I just allowed that money to disappear and pay for the insurance policy until it ran out. </p>
<p>I endured it for some time, might as well since I already spent the money. I learned a lot, but not the things intended to be learned. My established presence and surviving a year in this multi level marketing foundation was expensive but a rewarding experience. I learned people skills,  I learned finances in an important way, I was basically forced how to think about money management. I was forced to think long term and short term and because of it, I decided to cut my ties
With WFG. It worked for many, but not for me as that was what mattered. </p>
<p>I remember in the last days, my insurance policy finally died and my upline came rushing to me shouting &quot;Oh my god, RexDraco! Your insurance policy just closed and couldn't have at the worse time! I need x amount of policies under my name so I can level up! Can we do a meeting for a more affordable plan!?&quot; This was after him countless of time promising to help me get my money back, ending my plan (I had to google how to close it!!!) and all that. He was intentionally stalling and acts like I would trust him. I lied and said I have financial troubles and cannot afford any expenses. The truth was, thanks to world financial group, I was doing the best I have ever did in my life money management wise. Nobody in my family or social circle are on my level. Several thousands of dollars saved up into my account while at a minimum wage Pizza Hut job. When I quit world financial group, I had $3k in my bank and it would grow substantially faster because of the expenses.</p>
<p>Speaking of last experiences with these people, I claimed I couldn't afford to go to the next convention. They understood because I work at Pizza Hut. I asked how the convention was, they told me &quot;good.&quot; I asked if anything important was taught, they respond &quot;yes.&quot; I endure the meeting, went then to our meeting after the main meeting (everyone's upline wants to play big boss man and have their own meeting and accomplish nothing new). In the meeting, I sat their alone while nobody even acknowledges my existence. I calculated what I have invested and how long I have been in the business, how much I got in return, it was my last day I ever spent at WFG. I got up in the middle of the social gathering before the meeting, everyone acted as if I didn't exist.</p>
<p>So, you ask why people participate in mlm in spite one reason or another; the answer is simple though: these business platforms are designed like religions and target people vulnerable and need a way out, a change in life, a way to make their expensive dreams come true after years of hard work not paying off. You ask why they seem to exist in spite anti middle man platforms exists, it's because many products are cheaper through their members, sometimes exclusive items exists. It's also important to remember that people individuals trust are advertising their products for them. Amazon advertises a lot of things, but you will always buy shit your friends or family will say is a great product and helps they use it themselves. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is not an all encompassing sufficient answer to the original question so I'll try my best. I'm 30, been out of school for 8 years. It does seem to me that these scams (let's call a spade a spade here) do seem to be more common these days. I have been aware of these since I was a kid, but it was not &quot;out there&quot; like it is today.</p>
<p>1) technology. Internet and social media, as well as better screen printing for shirts, memorabilia and those stupid car signs I see everywhere</p>
<p>2) more bills for families to pay now. This is documented in other posts, but the cost of everything has gone up substantially faster than the rate of inflation or average income. New bills exist now that didn't before like internet and cell phones</p>
<p>3) the job market has been finicky with relatively high unemployment compared to pst decades among job seekers and underemployment, something that is hard to analyze but I see everywhere.</p>
<p>Ok. Technology. The internet, smart phones and social media open up new ways to communicate and advertise, increasing our exposure to others life's significantly while simultaneously decreasing our real social interaction. It's easy to see someone posting about how awesome their life is thanks to xyz pyramid scheme. Especially for certain demographics, like stay at home moms. It's well known that people's social media presence and their life don't exactly always Line up, and even knowing this some people fall into &quot;Facebook depression&quot; and see other people's post and think &quot;why isn't my life like there life 😢&quot; even knowing that Everyone bs's social media. This makes some people more susceptible to listening to a sales pitch or believe they can make money working from home or whatever other bogus claims they make</p>
<p>Also, I never saw any of those car banners until maybe ten years ago, and I know t-shirts and memorabilia are now significantly easier to make and cheaper than ever.</p>
<p>Life has gotten more expensive at a faster rate than inflation and our incomes can grow. This leads people to be desperate and again these scams play into that vulnerability promising to help better people's life's</p>
<p>A lot of people are underemployed. Maybe they are full time but only work 30 hours a week. Maybe they are part time employees. Maybe they work two part time jobs. Maybe they are a stay at home parent who's been out of work for years and yearns to be contributing more. Maybe they are lazy and don't want to work a demanding job. For whatever reason I see underemployment as a problem, and a problem that has increased over my time working. For whatever reason there are people who want/need more and are looking for supplemental income. Again, these scams prey into that and couple this with my two other points you see a rise in the mlm.</p>
<p>So I agree it does appear that mlm scams are much more common now than ever before.</p>
<p>I talked to my mom who is 56. She echoed my point and added that she thinks there are social pressure on women to buy these products at &quot;parties&quot; and she has bought shit she didn't want because everyone else was and she didn't want to offend the host or be ostracized by the other women. She said this is nothing new but social media makes this far worse</p>
<p>Anyone got anything to add? My wife is a high school teacher in a low income school, and a grad student who works with undergrads in the summer term. She does a lot of advising and is highly respected for this. We are trying to find ways to talk people out of mlms and so I highly enjoy learning more about this</p>
<p>Example: student says she has heard you can make great money selling plexus. Asking the student if plexus seemed like something they would buy in the store was enough to get them thinking maybe this isn't a good idea </p>
<p>Edit: I live in an area with a huge descrepancy between have and have nots, and each of the two previous areas I have lived have been similar. My neighborhood is very nice and would fit in in all of the countries most affluent suburbs, but the are where my wife teaches could not be more different. Multiple students live on dirt floors. I think this discrepancy can contribute to the large number of people who participate in my area as much as anything else</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MLMs grow because that is how the scam works. By getting more suckers to buy inventory in those hopes they will sell it you wash your hands of any risk. </p>
<p>It's literally that simple.</p>
<p>MLMs pray on a couple of human physiological traits that are beyond a ELI5 but simply put, they convince people they will become wealthy and independent by buying into the program. A major component of this is recruiting others to do the same and you reap the rewards of having done so. Most MLMs focus more on recruiting then sales because they don't have to worry about sales since all that risk is taken on by the member.</p>
<p>To be honest, MLMs should be illegal since they are glorified pyramid scam where they added products to make it legal. Thankfully Amazon and eBay are slowly killing off MLMs profitability however since MLMs focus all on proprietary products/brands, this erosion is slow.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any intervention groups or charities that work to help combat MLMs. Sadly MLMs spend a lot of money and efforts to combat bad press and are constantly adjusting there tactics to avoid  losing people. They will provide entire narratives and scripts for reps to use when confronted with negative opinions or anecdotes. Despite that, most people will burn out after a few weeks, months, maybe a year or so. By then they will have likely replaced themselves and or grown the MLMs rep base so the loss is meaningless to the MLMs. Most people will also stay on and keep trying out of shame and regret since it's likely friends and family will tell them it was a scam from the start and they don't want to be proven a failure. If you do confront some one about a MLMs they may be involved with or getting involved with, be sure to tell them you will always love them and appreciate them even if it dose not work out. </p>
<p>One of the more slimy tactics MLMs uses are meetups and conferences/conventions where they sell the culture. It's at these events they tend to find ways to tip over the more risk adverse members into committing an amount of money they would have normally not been comfortable spending. Almost all MLMs use this tactic and bake it into the system.</p>

Usually we'll notice a deterioration in their physical health months or even up to a year beforehand, and so would move them to a separate &quot;quarantine&quot; pool to give them proper treatment or end-of-life care, and this pool can facilitate their removal when/if they pass.</p>
<p>Once removed they're taken to a local animal sciences facility (any of a few local universities) where they undergo a necropsy (autopsy for animals). Samples are taken and tested to determine cause of death (whenever possible) and usually these samples are also preserved for further/future scientific study. </p>
<p>Depending on the animal and the permits aquired, certain samples like skin and bones can even be re-used for educational, public programs to teach folks about the life in our oceans! Surprisingly few public actually realize or are knowledgeable of the diversity of life beyond our beaches and ports.</p>
<p>Edit: formatting/spelling   </p>
<p>Edit 2: I appear to have recieved gold on one of my comments here. Just wanted to say if you, dear Redditor, so wish to gild, please instead consider donating to a local (or favorite) AZA (Association of Zoos and Aquariums) or CAZA (same as AZA but Canadian) accredited Marine Centre or Zoo.</p>
<p>Not all of us are evil and for profit or entertainment. Sometimes (as per the federal government) an animal is unfortunately deemed unreleasable and without facilities to house them they would otherwise be euthanized.</p>
<p>And they can help further scientific research into their species and hopefully continue to preserve their species in the wild. Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In both situations a necropsy was performed first - they're almost always performed for any zoo animal. Afterwards, chainsaws and a whole lot of manpower are used to cut up the animal into movable pieces and transport them for disposal. Depending on the kind of enclosure, cranes or other kinds of moving equipment may also be used.
For smaller (but still large) animals, like alpaca or kangaroo, they're usually hauled onto a tarp, carried by a team and loaded onto a van. These are typically cremated or properly disposed of depending on city ordinance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Both baking powder and baking soda are used to create a rise in baked goods. The chemical reaction they cause makes bubbles that puff up the dough. Baking soda needs an acid added to the dough to make that reaction happen (like your grade school volcano). Baking powder is baking soda plus an acid that activates when it gets wet. Which one you use depends on the recipe (is there an acid?) and how much rise you want (baking soda is stronger but  too much of either powder can affect tastes so sometimes you want a big rise and you use both).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate only and it acts as a weak base.  Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda, an acid that's usually cream of tartar and a little cornstarch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aka bicarbonate of soda or sodium bicarbonate. Let’s start with baking soda because it’s the most confusing. I’m going to geek out for a sec. First, baking soda is a BASE. Do you remember the science experiment we all did in school? Mixing baking soda with vinegar and watching an eruption of bubbles? Usually we did this in some sort of model volcano contraption. I know you know. When you mix baking soda (BASE) with vinegar (ACID) you get a chemical reaction (an eruption of bubbles!). A product of this reaction is carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Baking powder contains baking soda. It is a mixture of baking soda, cream of tartar (a dry acid), and sometimes cornstarch. These days, most baking powder sold is double acting. This means that the first leavening occurs when baking powder gets wet– like when you combine the dry and wet ingredients in the recipe. (This is why you cannot prepare some batters ahead of time to bake later– because the baking powder has already been activated.) The second leavening occurs when the baking powder is heated.</p>
<p>Since baking powder already contains an acid to neutralize its baking soda, it is most often used when a recipe does not call for an additional acidic ingredient. Like my sugar cookies. However, this isn’t always the case. You can still use baking powder as the leavening agent in recipes calling for an acidic ingredient. Like my lemon cake. In my recipe development, I based my lemon cake recipe off of my vanilla cake recipe. I used buttermilk (acid) instead of regular milk for added moisture and a little tang and subbed a little brown sugar (acid) for granulated sugar– again, for added moisture. I was pleased with the rise and taste of the cake, so I did not experiment with using baking soda.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see many answers in this thread were some are blatantly trying to state only the negative side of one or the other. What it really boils down to is a matter of what the countries are striving for and how they hope to achieve that. </p>
<p>Europe in general, and very much as an example Sweden(where I live), stand by the belief that education should be available to all no matter where you were born or in what situation. This has it's obvious downsides and upsides. There are small fees in some schools but those are around the 800$ range for an entire 4 year program. For this to be possible, taxes are alot higher than in the U.S, especially income taxation. Schools are also completely without sports programs and a lot of other things because it's there to educate and nothing more.</p>
<p>As someone said, why most swedes are basically united on this political topic(it's rarely, or dare i say never brought up in parties campaigns). Is because this is how it's always been and most believe that the equal possibility for education will in turn make the countries economy stronger through an educated population. </p>
<p>(I also saw someone say that uni-professors are paid poorly in Europe. This could be compared to the U.S., ofcourse true, but the fact is that in Sweden it's one of the most well paid professions under the governments control. I know this because my girlfriends dad is a professor in engineering at a very large public school in Stockholm.)</p>
<p>I can't say I know a ton of how the loaning system works but from spending a fair amount of time in the U.S. I can tell you that it mostly boils down to that the capitalistic train of thought that is that if can't promise that you will, or have already, worked for it, you dont deserve it. Some believe that the perks heavily outweigh the consequences. For example the sports programs and the (debateably) higher quality of education. Some may instead argue that the capitalistic system along with higher level schooling splits society by wealth and lets school charge a lot more than many can afford because the demand of schooling is enormous in a world where a degree is almost required to land a job with deceny pay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My accounting professor used to go on rants about various subjects and this happened to be one of them. His position was that Universities in the United States were so expensive due to the relatively easy access to various forms of student aid. His argument was that if the schools were confident that every incoming student could procure a certain amount of student loans and grants then they would simply adjust their tuition to match this amount in order to maximize revenue. As long as the government kept increasing financial aid limits the schools could raise tuition levels without worrying about students not being able to pay for it. I don't know how truthful this is for non profit Universities, but I have noticed that the &quot;for profit&quot; Colleges and technical schools set their tuition costs at exactly the dollar amount of government student aid a student can receive for the period of instruction, usually with nothing left over for living costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>A) Having an educated populace is essential to the growth, economy and success of a country</li>
<li>B) It reduces debt, making it so people don't have to start in the red when they leave college, so that leads to having more disposable income, which can be used to stimulate the economy and/or pay tax dollars.</li>
<li>C) Combining both of those things, it leads to a stronger economy which would increase tax revenue.  Leads to better employment, which would reduce the strain on welfare and etc. etc.</li>

<p>The energy of a song is largely independent of the scale/harmony, so that's no barrier. Key doesn't matter because you just shift one song or the other up or down until the two songs match. And because we all use the same stupid scales, the chords often barely matter as well. The melody from All Star is mostly pentatonic which means it works with <em>virtually any</em> typical Western chord progression. </p>
<p>There's a reason this is done with mostly pop songs and not, say, King of Limbs-era Radiohead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will try to explain this as basic as I can, even though my native tongue is not english, and my musical education was in a different language, so bear that in mind if some terms are wrong.</p>
<p>BPM or Beats per minute, indicate how fast the song goes. I.e: 60 bpm means you clap once per second. If the BPM is 120, that means 2 claps per second. That means when one second has passed, you have had time to clap twice.</p>
<p>Some of the songs you mentioned you have seen being mashed up are almost identical, if not truly identical in bpm. If there is a variation in one of the songs, the artist/person behind the mashup simply uses an in-built feature in his digital audio workstation (any music manipulating software) to drag and stretch the vocals from All Star so that it &quot;matches&quot; the BPM of the song it's being used on. That's why you will sometimes hear that the vocals can feel a little &quot;slowed down&quot; at some parts in most mashups, or even a tad faster than the original All Star. They do this to synchronize the music track + the vocals, so they don't seem off. (i.e the chorus starting one second too early, or too slow)</p>
<p>If the vocals are of a different musical key, they will often use a pitch tool (that changes the frequenzy, meaning how high or low the note is) so that it matches the musical key of the song the vocals are being put on.</p>
<p>As mentioned before in this thread, most modern pop-musicians use incredibly similar &quot;patterns&quot; when choosing chords for their songs. There is actually a way they come up with these patterns, and that involves the Circle of fifths, but I'm not going into details of that right now. It is simply a guideline for musicians for finding corresponding chords (Meaning &quot;which chord would fit nicely after this one? What would sound good, and what would sound horrendous?&quot;. This is not something every musician follows, but most western pop-music is heavily based on this. Some songs that use this is &quot;Smoke on the Water -Deep Purple&quot;, &quot;Black Night - Ritchie Blackmoore.) </p>
<p>So to conclude, the vocals from All Star and &lt;insert song from another band, with removed lyrics here&gt; do not ALWAYS match up. But because of the already similar patterns in chords, melody and song-structure (Example: Intro &gt; Riff &gt; Verse &gt; chorus &gt; verse &gt; solo &gt; riff &gt; outro), it requires little to no effort to put the corresponding pieces from each song into others that sound similar. That means it does not necessarily &quot;line up perfect&quot; just by dragging the vocals over on the other song. Some job is required, but with songs like All Star, this work is reduced to a minimum, due to repetitive patterns.</p>
<p>I hope this made sense. I am mostly autodidact when it comes to music, but I studied music for 3 years at my old college, so I might be able to answer any followup-questions if this was somehow unclear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rhythm is written using fractions.  It is divided up into segments called &quot;bars&quot; or &quot;measures&quot;.  Each of these bars contains a certain number of beats - 3 or 4, usually - and these beats are divided up into smaller pieces to make rhythm.  When people mash up songs together, the rhythms will coincide based on the relationship of the fractions that they represent.  Think of finding lowest common multiples or divisors in mathematics.  This is how the rhythms match up.</p>
<p>On the other side of things is the melody and harmonies.  The melodies and harmonies are written using notes that fall on a repeating scale.  There are 12 notes in a scale and no other notes are possible (usually).  While you can use any of the 12 notes on the scale however you like, only certain combinations will make pleasant music.  So, typical music falls into either minor or major &quot;keys&quot; that are basically just a general vibe of the music based in specific combinations and orders of notes.  If two pieces of music are in minor keys or are in major keys, the melody and harmony can be shifted up or down in scale to match.  Sometimes minor and major keys jive well together too, but that's not a given.</p>
<p>So, by matching up sets of 4's or 3's, keys (if both major or both minor or they jive well) and by shifting the keys to match, any mashup can be made to sound compatible.  Sounding nice is a different story and a matter of art, you might say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about pop songs, I've found that around 80 - 90% of the progressions used are some variation of C - G - Am - F. It might be starting from another chord, for example Am - F - C - G, or F - C - G - Am, but it the same kind of sound. Additionally the G is often swapped out for an E for an edgier sound. For example Am - F - C - E, or F - C - E - Am. This allows for a huge amount of mashups if you can match similar songs up and change the keys </p>
<p>The songs might appear in different keys, in which case you would have to transpose (move) one of the until they were in the same key. The progression C - G - Am - F could also sound like G - D - Em - C. This is the same progression just in a different key, meaning the relationship between the chords is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the Sun's color spectrum differs from artificial lights, this is not the reason this is difficult. Any light made for film making combined with the correct white balance takes care of this 100%. Incandescent bulbs cover the entire visible spectrum, only in different ratios than the sun. With the correct gel or white balance, these ratios can be brought back to natural levels.</p>
<p>The issue here is <strong>distance</strong>. Light, like many other things, follows the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law</a></strong>, which means that the further a light source is, the less difference it makes if you move closer or further from it.</p>
<p>In other words, sunlight hitting your house is the same intensity than sunlight hitting your neighbor's house. Or sunlight hitting your face will be the same intensity as light hitting your hand. With an artificial light, the two won't receive the same amount of light, as the closeness of the light source means the light decays much faster.</p>
<p>We have come to associate one with natural, and the other with artificial light. Even without thinking, we can &quot;tell&quot; that light that decays over a short distance is artificial, while light that doesn't decay is natural.</p>
<p>An artificial light source can never be as far away as the Sun for obvious reasons, so another issue is that its shadows will never appear parallel.</p>
<p>The solution is to put your light source very far away, but then you need a light source that's very very strong to compensate. This makes this type of lighting expensive, heavy and time consuming to set up.</p>
<p>Another issue is diffusion. The Sun is surrounded by the sky, from our point of view. The sky is a giant surface very very far away. This means the Sun is accompanied by a fill light of a huge surface that is equally very far away, which is even more difficult to match with artificial light. There is no way we can build a surface anywhere near as large as the sky, and as far away.</p>
<p>To light a single face you may need two giant white sheets suspended with tripods and weights, and four 5 kilowatt lights to light it. Then you need to put all this as far as you can, and hope that enough light still hits your subject. If done right, you won't be able to tell it apart from natural light. Beyond a certain point, our minds won't know the difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The hotter it is, the shorter the average wavelength of the light will be.

<p>However, it is possible to mimic the spectrum of the sunlight using LEDs or fluorescent lamps. They do that by first producing light of short wavelength, using dyes to turn that a bunch of other wavelengths. the spectrum of the sunlight.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is no. Race is a social construct which doesn't exist in the physical world. The idea of race as more than a cultural concept is pretty much rejected scientifically. Here's the American Anthropological Association's <a href="http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583" target="_blank">statement on race</a>.</p>
<p>America's last President had a &quot;white&quot; mother and a &quot;black&quot; father and was raised by his &quot;white&quot; grandparents in Hawaii. Yet he is considered to be black. Why? Racism, which resulted in the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule#Twentieth_century" target="_blank">hypodescent</a>. </p>
<p>What makes someone whose genetic heritage is 1/8 African a &quot;black&quot;? Nothing, other than the  &quot;one-drop&quot; rule which has absolutely no bearing in science.</p>
<p>What &quot;race&quot; are these <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WpblcdxKc28/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">babies</a>?</p>
<p>If you arrange humans into groups based on how they are actually related, those groups won't correspond even approximately to common notions of &quot;race.&quot;</p>
<p>Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic &quot;racial&quot; groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes. This means that there is greater variation within &quot;racial&quot; groups than between them.</p>
<p>In formal terms, phenotype (outward appearance) was supposed to be a good predictor of genotype (deeper biological similarities). However, today we know that phenotype is a LOUSY indicator of genotype. Worthless, in fact. Ethiopians are more closely related to certain Mediterranean Europeans than they are to Pygmies, even though both are &quot;black.&quot; Australian Aborigines are as distantly related to Africans as it's possible for two living populations to be, yet they are both superficially &quot;black.&quot;</p>
<p>DNA testing has determined genetic-relatedness. Because of their isolation, Australian Aborigines have drifted further genetically from Africans than any other set of genes. Look at Google Earth and you'll see how this occurred.</p>
<p>However, this geographic and temporal isolation doesn't suddenly make them a &quot;race&quot;. Those genetic differences amount to 1/15th of the differences extant within any racial &quot;group&quot;. </p>
<p>The observers who seize on these minor variables, to classify human groups, while ignoring the far more dramatic variables within groups demonstrably don't do so out of any objective desire for the &quot;truth.&quot; </p>
<p>It's [pattern seeking] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia</a>) behaviour. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>
<p>I am sort of amazed at the traction that this throwaway comment has engendered. The reactions here are quite extraordinary. I'd like to point out that the vast majority of the posters who have disagreed with this post have done so in a respectful and honest way. Most of these counter-arguments are founded, in some way,  in observable data. I find hope in this thoughtful discourse, and am happy that it seems that some of the fundamental flaws in this discredited construct are being critically examined by those who disagree. </p>
<p>Many posters called for this post to be locked, but this is a mistake, because simply silencing different opinions can never be a good plan. The value of forums such as this  one for human progress is inestimable. It helps strangers with differing perspectives from all cultures understand why others might think as they do. </p>
<p>This is what Reddit does when it is at its best. I am proud of the conversation and the contributors here. Let's not ever stop debating in this way. There is no way that I can respond to all of the comments in my inbox. It's not that I don't care or am dismissive, but there is work that needs doing.</p>
<p>Whoever gave me the Gold is a mensch. I have no idea what it does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's not go too far in the other direction.</p>
<p>Of course races exist. Chinese people look different from Sudanese people who look different from Finnish people who look different from Colombian people. Further, these differences are biological: your skin color, hair color, etc, are determined by your genes. Additionally, it's fair to say that there are cultural distinctions that go along with racial groupings.</p>
<p>What is NOT true is the underlying assumption that our commonly-used racial groupings indicate genetic relatedness. Most biologically relevant groupings are &quot;clades&quot; - groups that include a common ancestor and all of its descendants. Every member of a clade is more closely related to everyone else within that clade than any of them are to anyone outside of the clade. Human races are NOT clades. Far from it. It is untrue to claim that all black people are more closely related to all other black people than any of them are to a white person or an Asian person. In fact, the vast majority of human genetic variation is found within sub-Saharan Africa. If you were to pick two random African people, the odds are good that one would be more closely related to a random Mongolian or Native American than he would be to the other African.</p>
<p>Our races are loose conglomerations of people based on superficial phenotypes, NOT on an understanding of how populations are related to each other. Again - that's not to say that they don't exist at all. It's just important to know what they actually are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Here's a quote that summarizes the conclusion of the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The near impossibility of a definitive, scientific approach to interrogating genes, race, and IQ stands in contrast to the loose claims of pundits or scholars who assert that there is a genetic explanation for the black-white test score gap. That said, the consideration of genetics in racial analysis is not always pernicious. The ability to control for genotype actually places the effects of social processes, like discrimination, in starker relief. Once you eliminate the claim that there are biological or genetic differences between populations by controlling them away, we can show more clearly the importance of environmental (non-genetic) processes such as structural racism.</p>

<p>I recognize that the math checks out, and that we should still be picking up at least some traces of them. But if you were to look at it from the perspective of a individual Cesium or Phosphorus-32 atoms it seems so unlikely that they just happen to survive so many potential opportunities to just decay and get entirely wiped out on earth.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Carbon-14 is produced constantly in the upper atmosphere from the interaction of high-energy cosmic particles with nitrogen-14.</p>
<p>It has also been produced in other high-energy interactions (nuclear explosions from atomic tests), which is why in 14C-dating, we set the &quot;present&quot; in &quot;before present&quot; at 1950, after which the amount of 14C in the atmosphere was no longer solely the product of natural processes.</p>
<p>We also know now that 14C is not produced at a constant rate, but that the amount produced through the interaction of 14N with cosmic rays is variable. This is why we have to run a calibration on 14C dating results to convert 14C years to calendar years. At some points in the past, 14C years area almost 1:1 with calendar years (around about 2900 years ago, for example, 14C years are roughly similar to calendar years: 2900 +/- 30 rcybp ~ 3037 +/- 53 cal BP).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans tend to anthropomorphize their pets, and attribute human like emotions to their actions.  That makes it easier to forget that they are animals and experience the world very differently than humans.  What appears to be &quot;joy&quot; could be, and often is, something very different.</p>
<p>In the case of fetch, dogs have a hunting instinct that makes they chase prey and bring it back to the pack.  Throwing a stick triggers this instinct, and their brains rewards them for following through.  This &quot;joy&quot; is similar to what a human would experience when following the instinct to drink something cold when they are hot and thirsty, and would explain both humans and dog continue to feel a sense of enjoyment even after doing it thousands of times year after year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if someone has said this already, but during the domestication process, dogs suffered a process called [neoteny] (<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/neoteny.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/neoteny.htm</a>) . This means that during the domestication of the gray wolf, individuals were selected for juvenile features, physical (larger snout, broader head, smaller teeth) and behavioral (puppy like behavior, like playing a lot, not very aggressive, etc) and the physical and behavioral traits are often connected.  </p>
<p>This basically means most modern dog breeds were selected to look and behave like a giant puppy. That's also why if you take a grey wolf or wild fox puppy and raise it to adulthood, it won't be a completely domestic animal, it will have strong instincts and often times will try to run away for mating etc. </p>
<p>This is kind of my field of study (dog genetics) so if you have more questions feel free to ask </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
