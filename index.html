<p>However, you do have to blink slightly more often (I actually found myself squeezing my eyes closed a little, about once a minute, the same as you do when you've been staring intently and avoided blinking for a while and they get dry), and you can definitely feel that the fluids are denser.</p>
<p>You'll also find that your breath instantly coats everything around it with frost. Frosty eyelashes are annoying as fuck.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing about eyeballs but a few things about heat transfer.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of energy to change the temperature of water because of it's high heat capacity. It also takes additional energy to change the phase of water. Basically this means water can loose a lot of <em>heat</em> before it changes <em>temperature</em>.</p>
<p>Also water is a good conductor of heat, so if the front of the eyeball is exposed to cold, but the back of the eyeball is exposed to a heat source, heat can be conducted from the back of the eyeball to the front to keep the whole eyeball at a somewhat uniform temperature.</p>
<p>All of this was based on the assumption that an eyeball is a small bubble of water, which obviously can't be true. But I know they must also have blood vessels, which is an additional means of transferring heat around the eyeball. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, medic here! It depends. For the sake of the conversation, I'm going to assume you mean something like a run-of-the-mill, basic cut. You nicked yourself shaving, or your knife slipped a little when you were cutting veggies. Nothing that would require sutures. </p>
<p>Typically, its best to wash the cut with antibacterial soap (like Dial) and warm water, that probably constitutes &quot;wiping it away&quot;, but only to get any dirt/nasties out of the cut. You do this because when you DO hold pressure to stop the bleeding, you don't want to keep the trapped nasties in there. So technically, it's better to take a little of column a, a little of column b. After your cut has been wiped clean, put steady pressure on it until it clots, then put a layer of protectant (neosporin or the like) and a bandage/bandaid/gauze over it to help it heal. </p>
<p>Now, if you're talking about a trauma situation, it's a little different. Say, for example, you're first responding to a motorcycle accident and this dude's calf is just wrecked to hell, blood everywhere, gravel everywhere inside the laceration- your best bet isn't to keep wiping the gash continuously, you need to apply direct pressure first and foremost to stop the bleeding. Wiping it will do nothing and not allow the blood to clot properly. Pop a tourniquet on too. (This includes keeping the nasties and gravel and all, unfortunately, the hospital will properly clean and suture when they arrive. Motorcycle dude has bigger issues than a little dirt and gravel right now.) You don't want to be exsanguinated just because you kept wiping blood. Wiping continuously doesn't really promote clotting factors, nor allows platelets to form to stop the blood. It's why you are always taught &quot;direct pressure&quot; any time there is blood leaking from a wound that shouldn't be there. </p>
<p>TL;DR: when in doubt, keep pressure on it. </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense and answers your question, I'm on maternity leave, pregnant AF, insomnia and heartburn have kept me up for over a day. (: </p>
<p>Edit: holy shit RIP inbox, I wake up because my son decided to falcon punch my bladder after I could finally go to sleep (weird sensation from the inside out) and I have 100+ comments, replies, and messages. Obligatory thank you for the gold! Now, a few clarity points:</p>
<p>For my first basic scenario, I used a common example of what might happen at home/what people have at home to use. Water and really any kind of soap is fine, Dial soap is just what I've been taught to use if I have it, and many of my colleagues do too. (I HATE it though, but I'm also allergic to a lot of other cleansing agents and have to stick with it.) Personally, I don't think water temperature is a difference/makes a difference in the basic cut situation. I cut myself in the shower shaving the other day (big 'ol 32w pregnant belly over here) and I just let it run in the shower, cleaned with soap, but it didn't clot until after I got out and put pressure. EVERY PERSON'S CLOTTING FACTOR IS DIFFERENT, your mileage may vary from others. It takes me 20 minutes to stop a simple little cut like that, whereas my husband just washes and slaps a bandaid on it and forgets about it in three minutes. </p>
<p>On using alcohol/sticking your finger in your mouth- as long as it's rubbing alcohol or peroxide, I don't see why you couldn't dab a bit on. We carry it in the ambulance in situations like this. (Since we don't exactly have a sink with soap and water.) If the drinking alcohol (high proof) you want to use is fresh/unopened, or ensure that nobody has drank from the bottle directly. I've never used drinking alcohol as a sanitizer, so I couldn't tell you. As for sticking your finger or cut in your mouth- I'm completely guilty of doing this too, but just keep in mind that human mouths are NASTY AF! We treat human bites wayyyy more aggressively than dog or animal bites (save for snakes, because venom). Human mouths are just... filthy. I learned how gross our mouths are and made a conscious effort to stop sticking my cut up hands/arms in my mouth. Google some human bites, and look at when they get infected. They aren't pleasant. After seeing some in the field and looking at the infections they harbor, I wouldn't ever consciously do it again- but I mean, you do you. Like I said, I'm guilty of it too, and I think it's a bit of a reflex if I'm honest. (So many people do it!) I'm too tired to do any link adding, so if someone wants to add it, I'll put it here. (:</p>
<p>ON TOURNIQUETS:</p>
<p>A little background for those that don't know me: before I got off the truck due to my little parasite I have affectionately decided to raise, I work in a huge metropolitan area with a combo critical care/911 system. I'm mainly on the CCT (critical care transport) side, meaning we transferred people from hospital to hospital, higher level of care, etc. Got to see some gnarly stuff. We also backflowed our 911 areas when they got busy, so I've seen some crap there too. </p>
<p>Tourniquets are coming back into the mainstream. Using a tourniquet is simple, easy, and (in my opinion) should be part of a public safety course/first aid/CPR for civilians. You have HOURS (if tourniquet applied correctly) before you risk ANY harm to the limb. (And remember! Life &gt; limb, regardless. So that argument is out.) </p>
<p>You do not need to loosen it every fifteen minutes. That's the exact opposite of what you're trying to do. You do need to check for pulses in the extremity very frequently- if you feel one, readjust till there isn't one. Double tourniquets are a thing, I've had to do it on people before. You are restricting blood flow. A pulse means that the person has blood flow and they will continue to bleed out. Once you apply it, hospital staff need to be the ones removing it, not you. In my trauma scenario, I pictured a free flowing bloody calf that got ripped to shreds by a gravel road and is squirting blood that you can't stop with direct pressure alone. (Guess I should've said femoral, I wasn't thinking straight. Either way.) Put the tourniquet on the femoral artery, as high as you can, and cinch it tight. If that doesn't help, double tourniquet it. </p>
<p>Tourniquets are a very underrated emergency medical device, in my opinion. We carry several on the ambulance. They're good use for GSWs, deep cuts, lacerations, arterial bleeding from pretty much anywhere. It's easier to remove a tourniquet than remove a limb. We might use them more than you think. Open fractures that are bleeding and you can't put pressure on because bone is protruding, etc. They're very useful and can be used for several situations. </p>
<p>Another local EMS company near me actually does civilian first aid training, and they are doing a good job in removing public stigma around tourniquets in our huge metropolitan area. &quot;Stop the Bleed!&quot; is really great too. </p>
<p>As for in-field debridement: if I have the chance to squirt some saline and remove the dirt from a wound (and the bleeding IS CONTROLLED) I do en route to the hospital. If they're so messed up that I got called because of a GSW or severe accident, I'm going to be a little too busy maintaining airway, keeping BP up, etc to do much. We'll be at the facility that can take their time to clean it properly versus my crude knock-up job when I really need to focus on doing other things. If I have an extra hand or some firefighters, I might ask them to help me if I have everything else under control. (S/O to my fire guys, you rock!) </p>
<p>I hope I answered all the questions and cleared some stuff up in the edit. I will totally try to get back to all that commented! Baby boy is craving some tacos, now I gotta go make some tacos at 7am... my husband will be very confused when he wakes up, lol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm assuming this isn't a sterile surgical cut, or a massive trauma.  No risk of bleeding to death, no gross impaction of foreign material into the would.</p>
<p>If so, it would be best to wash with soap and water to get any small amounts of debris/bacteria out.  Dry, and put a bandage on that will apply a bit of pressure and help the wound heal.  Keep the edges of the wound clean and approximated next to each other so they can heal together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Pressure is key on cuts of any size. After cleaning it as well as you can, use something clean and preferably something without a lot of lint to apply pressure, as it can get stuck in the wound. Continue applying pressure until  A: It has sealed up on its own and the bleeding has stopped, or B: The wound can be properly stitched shut by someone trained to do so is it is large enough.</p>
<p>By applying pressure, you not only soak up the excess blood with the cloth/gauze/whatever, you are also leaving blood on the cut to harden and help close the cut and let it scab over.</p>
<p>Don’t pick the scab.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Activated charcoal&quot; is carbon - which, you know, is what charcoal is made out of, mostly. They press it into smaller bits with more surface area.</p>
<p>Carbon like that has a lot of porous area where chemical <em>adsorption</em> can occur. Adsorption is like absorption, kind of, in that your material is &quot;sucking up&quot; something from a liquid or gas. In the case of adsorption, atoms and molecules stick to the surface area of your material. Charcoal, particularly activated charcoal, has a <em>lot</em> of surface area, so it can adsorb a <em>lot</em> of stuff and it can do it quickly and efficiently, and also cheaply.</p>
<p><del>That's why they use charcoal to pump your stomach when you have alcohol poisoning. The carbon sucks up all the alcohol, then they remove the saturated carbon from your stomach, bringing the alcohol with it. What carbon remains to go through your digestive tract contains the alcohol so you can't absorb it into your blood.</del> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7hmd8m/eli5_how_does_activated_charcoal_work_and_why_has/dqs6r6a/" target="_blank">^^Or ^^not ^^maybe?</a> ^^I ^^dunno, ^^point ^^is ^^it ^^sucks ^^up ^^poisonous ^^stuff ^^in ^^your ^^stomach.</p>
<p>It's also used in aquariums to suck up waste in the water so it can be removed when you change your filter. It's especially good at removing heavy metals, which are sometimes present in your water at concentrations that are not high enough to hurt you but high enough to hurt your livestock. Similarly, it's used in water purification systems (like your Brita filter) to similarly suck up some stuff in your tap water that you are trying to filter out. EDIT: And some gas masks, and industrial air pollution scrubbers, and a number of similar filtering applications. It's quite good at actually sucking up toxic chemicals. Just, you know...not out of your face.</p>
<p>That tendency to suck up heavy metals has created a mystique about it, that it sucks up &quot;toxins&quot;. If it can purify your water, why not purify your skin? It can suck up &quot;toxins&quot; out of your face! (Pro tip: it doesn't.)</p>
<p>Edit: when they make you swallow charcoal for a pill overdose or swallowing poison, <em>it does nothing to the drugs or poison in your blood</em>. If you still have some left in your stomach, it soaks that up so that your OD or poisoning doesn't get any worse. What's in your blood is still there and has to be dealt with in other ways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a piece of wood. Now heat it to very high temperatures in the absence of oxygen (no combustion) - this creates a very pure carbon, a charcoal. Now, expose this to an &quot;activating&quot; agent (like carbon dioxode) that creates a very porous structure that gives it a lot of surface area. The more area you have means you can adsorb (sort of like a sponge) more contaminants. Activating also alters the surface such that it is more attractive toward, specifically, organic compounds. Examples of organic compounds that would be of interest include oils and grime in your skin, tea/coffee stains on your teeth, and taste/odor compounds and organic contaminants in your drinking water (think fridge filter). Activated carbon is in the adsorbent family of treatment options. There are other options, but carbon is cheap and it can be sustainable if one uses resilient sources like bamboo or waste products such as coconut shell. A great invention would be turning waste plastic into activated carbon, something many are working on!</p>
<p>*How much surface area? The amount of AC that fits in your palm (or half a banana, if you must) is equivalent in surface area to about five football fields. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This carries the red and white blood cells to the injured area. The injured area only needs a “cup” of blood (for example) to lay down the white blood cells to make a clot. The brain doesn’t distinguish this. It will send a bucket. It has the hose on full blast until the injured area is completely healed. The length of time of this stage is 24-48 hours post trauma. </p>
<p>This is why they tell you to elevate above the heart after an acute injury; so your body’s lymphatic system can reabsorb the swelling not needed at the injured site. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one on here has really given the right answer here so I'll chime in.</p>
<p>Swelling is the brain/body's way of stabilizing a joint. Typically if you've injured something to the point that it swells, you've most likely sprained (minor tear in ligament/tendon) something in that joint. The brain now recognises that the join has become less stable, so it pumps synovial fluid to the area to stabilize the join for you until the damage has repaired itself.  In the wild this would be very advantageous. The swelling however (as many others have mentioned) will restrict blood flow to the injured area and the actual healing process becomes slower, but again this is designed for humans who haven't figured out how to make a medical device like a brace to help keep the join immobile while it repairs itself.  So modern humans use ice to reduce the inflammation so that we can maximize blood flow to that area.  Heat is actually no longer an appropriate therapy when treating injuries such as these. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the values are limited in size you could store them by shifting the bits to the left as you go through the program (e.g. if they're limited by like 6 bits you can shift your second list element to the left by multiplying it by 2^6 ) and adding them together. Reversly you can “pop“ elements from the stack by usage of modulo operations (modulo (value;2^6 )  returns the last value on the stack and by doing value=(value/2^6 ) you remove the element you just read, assuming integer, so you can read the next one) Obviously you still have a limit for how many elements you can store and the “frame“ is static so you reserve the max amount of bits for a list element even if it doesn't use as many. Basically...the same idea you presented but by using a shift based on the binary basis instead of the base-10 system you should be able to save some space (And instead of only working for single bit integers it works for a wider range of values).</p>
<p>I believe you could get a much better answer on here if you can give people a little bit more context information. Usually when trying to “compress“ informations like this it's all about knowing which assumptions can be made about the stored elements, in what type of application they are used in etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Usually in situations like this you would store a pointer to a list of values allocated in some storage area that persists across both states.</p>
<p>This is why callbacks in C generally take only a single <code>void *</code> context argument -- if you need more than one value, you just use a pointer to a data structure. Or in Win16/Win32 the <code>LPARAM</code> or <code>WPARAM</code> parameters passed to the Window procedure callback are sometimes actual integers and sometimes pointers to larger data structures cast to integers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a programming answer and a mathematical answer. The programming answer is to use a data structure like an array or linked list to store the values. This is the most practical solution by far.</p>
<p>The mathematical answer is to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering_for_sequences" target="_blank">Gödel Numbering</a> of some kind. There is no limit on the size of the numbers except that imposed by the maximum integer in your architecture and language. That page uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem - so not primes per se, but still number theory.</p>
<p>But you can use primes: if p_n is the <em>n</em>th prime number, you could let the product of p_n_1, p_n_2, ..., p_n_k represent the numbers n_1, n_2, ..., n_k. If you don't care about ordering, you can use this to store a multiple instances of the same value by letting p_n^2 represent n twice, for example. Of course you can use a similar trick to allow encoding ordering too, or use the Chinese Remainder Theorem from the wikipedia page.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Kyriakos Porfyrakis and Edward Laird of the University of Oxford are working on building a hyperprecise atomic clock that could fit on a chip inside a smartphone.</p>
<p>They begin with a nitrogen atom, which resonates at a particular frequency and acts as a very precise reference point by which to track time. Since nitrogen is highly reactive, they have to trap the nitrogen atom inside of an endohedral fullerene-a sort of atomic cage made out of 60 carbon atoms-in their lab. To do it, they used a process called ion implantation. This process produces a molecule called N@C_60 that can easily be collected and stored (they even sell it for £200 million per gram).</p>
<p>But before they could put the molecule in a clock, they also had to figure out how to cancel out magnetic fields from the surrounding environment that could disrupt the energy level of the nitrogen atom within. Earlier this year, they developed a way to shield the nitrogen atom from external magnetic fields by applying a steady magnetic field that would cancel out any effects.</p>
<p>They recently wrote about their work for IEEE Spectrum (<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/materials/to-build-the-worlds-smallest-atomic-clock-trap-a-nitrogen-atom-in-a-carbon-cage" target="_blank">https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/materials/to-build-the-worlds-smallest-atomic-clock-trap-a-nitrogen-atom-in-a-carbon-cage</a>).</p>

<p>I have also read on Wikipedia, that often, migrane is caused by an arthery in your brain expanding to a certain degree (which seems reasonable, as migrane often feels like pulsating pressure in the brain to  me).
But how can you feel that pulsating pain, if the brain itself is inept of feeling direct pain?
(Please note that I have very little knowledge of medicine, but am but a humble fool who often has migranes.)</p></div></div>

In addition to the meninges covering the brain, which does have pain receptors, there are also blood vessels, which are theorized to be interlinked to migraines and other types of headaches. In addition, the way we perceive pain means that the 'location' of the pain may not be the source of it, so while a headache might feel like it's extremely deep in your brain, that doesn't reflect the actual location of the pain receptors that are being triggered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's something called referred pain. A constricted muscle somewhere in the body can register as pain somewhere else in the body.</p>
<p>Tight muscles in the neck can cause pain sensations all around the head, behind the eyes, in the jaw, wherever. It can go beyond aching and make you nauseated or give you vertigo. When I see people with cluster headaches smacking their own head it makes me wonder if they're instinctively doing a form of tapotement to alleviate their pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is thought that migraines are caused by several triggers (less sleep, hormonal variations, food etc) and once they are about to begin, the person experiences an aura (change in how things smell and halos around lights). </p>
<p>There have been several preclinical theories about the pathology of migraines— most of them involving release of inflammatory compounds  that cause pain by neurogenic inflammation around the meninges and nerves innervated by trigeminal ganglion (this is most likely what causes the pain in the face, around the eye orbits).  While the brain itself does not have nociceptors (pain receptors), the cerebral vessels around the brain and meninges do have nociceptors.</p>
<p>That being said, it has been shown to a significant extent that- the release of a peptide called Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) by trigeminovascular afferents has been implicated with the neurogenic vasodilation of meningeal vessels. The medications currently available (like triptans) decrease the elevated CGRP and that’s why they are recommended to be taken as soon as a person experiences the aura of onset of migraine. It is a one time treatment for that episode of migraine but not a preventive treatment. Regardless, elevated levels of CGRP in plasma are almost always seen during migraines. </p>
<p>There is also extensive research being done on CGRP receptor antagonists (drugs that would block the CGRP receptors so CGRP can’t bind to its target and activate pain and inflammatory pathways). </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What occurs when you pass out from extreme pain is a form of what is known as <em>vasovagal syncope.</em> Syncope means to lose consciousness and vasovagal refers to effects on the vasculature/vessels (vaso-) from the Vagus cranial nerve (-vagal). When you experience sudden and extreme pain, the information is sent to an area in the brainstem called the solitary nucleus, which is an input area for several cranial nerves, with the Vagus nerve being one of them. Of the twelve cranial nerves (which almost exclusively supply the head and neck), the Vagus nerve is special because it travels extensively around the body and innervates a wide variety of organs and blood vessels. It is involved in <em>parasympathetic</em> control of the nervous system, the branch of the autonomic nervous system that is commonly associated with &quot;rest and digest&quot; rather than the sympathetic &quot;fight or flight.&quot; With activation of the parasympathetic Vagus nerve, the heart slows down and beats with less force per pump (<em>rest</em> and digest). This is combined with a decrease in what is known as <em>sympathetic tone.</em> Sympathetic tone helps to keep blood vessels constricted, and when that is withdrawn, blood vessels can dilate. So, a decrease in cardiac output (less blood pumped from the slowed heart rate and contractibility) combined with dilated vessels, significantly reduces blood pressure too quickly and the brain is temporarily less perfused by oxygenated blood, leading to loss of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Edit below: More ELI5ish</strong> Sorry to anyone confused by the description above.</p>
<p>When you experience extreme pain, your body sends signals to the part of your brain that is the control board for a special nerve that &quot;relaxes&quot; a lot of your organs (slows heart, increases gut movement for digestion, etc). This nerve slows your heart down and causes it to pump less blood per unit time <em>at the same time</em> that nerves that keep your arteries constricted stop doing their job. So, you get less fluid pumping through wider pipes and, unsurprisingly, this can be measured as reduced blood pressure. Less blood is delivered to the brain, and the person loses consciousness. In the absence of any major bleeding, the body will correct the overshoot and the person will regain consciousness eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Edit #2 - TRUE ELI5</strong></p>
<p>Sudden and extreme pain flips a switch in your brain, which makes your blood vessels relax (by expanding) and your heart rate slow down <em>and</em> pump less blood with each beat. This brings less blood (and less oxygen) to your brain and you pass out. Your body fixes it quickly, but after you pass out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as i know this is not 100% explained by science. </p>
<p>But faint from pain could be triggered as a relaxation reaction of one's body. After severe pain the &quot;vagus nerve&quot; influence the vessels. If its influence is strong enough vascular tension, blood pressure as well as puls per minute decrease and one's muscles relax.</p>
<p>In extreme cases one's brain doesn't get enough oxygen, the consequence is a so called &quot;Common faint&quot;. As the designation &quot;Common&quot; implied it is a not really dangerous kind of faint.</p>
<p>The level of pain that triggers this reaction differ from one to another.</p>
<p>Many psychology touched physicians are convinced by this reason.</p>
<p>PS This is what i know from my biology education at school. So hopefully one can explain better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds posses is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.</p>
<p>First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all it's pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or feint. This is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping though the first door.</p>
<p>Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply to painful and there is no healing to be done. The saying &quot;time heals all wounds&quot; is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.</p>
<p>Third is the door of madness. There are many times when the mind is delt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind.</p>
<p>Last is the door of death. the final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add a hypothesis for why the fainting occurs from pain and the sight of blood, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_\(medicine\)#Other_causes" target="_blank">courtesy of Wikipedia:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One theory in evolutionary psychology is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of playing dead which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment. &quot;Blood-injury phobia&quot;, as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_\(medicine\)#Vasovagal" target="_blank">And here:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vasovagal (situational) syncope is one of the most common types which may occur in response to any of a variety of triggers, such as scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, during blood drawing, or moments of sudden unusually high stress.</p>
<p>Much of this pathway was discovered in animal experiments by Bezold (Vienna) in the 1860s. In animals, it may represent a defence mechanism when confronted by danger (&quot;playing possum&quot;).</p>
<p>An evolutionary psychology view is that some forms of fainting are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter-group aggression during the paleolithic. A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in blood-injection-injury type phobias such as trypanophobia as well as the gender differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-out" target="_blank">Also, a tangential bonus:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Falling-out is a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture-bound_syndrome" target="_blank">culture-bound syndrome</a></strong> primarily reported in the southern United States and the Caribbean. It is described as a constricted consciousness as a psychological response to anxiety and specific stressors. Sudden collapse characterizes episodes of falling-out, whether without warning or preceded by dizziness and a spinning sensation. The individual suffering from symptoms of falling out can usually hear and understand what is going on around them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a barometric pressure standpoint, a window or other skin of a pressurized compartment in a commercial plane will typically be subjected to pressure of about 0.5 atm.</p>
<p>This assumes cabin pressurized to equivalent of 8000 feet ASL, at flight level 38000:</p>
<p>8000 ft:  574 mmHg</p>
<p>38000 ft: 172 mmHg</p>
<p>Net pressure: 402 mmHg / 760 ≈ 0.53 atm</p>
<p>An equivalent pressure would be exerted on a window submerged in 5.5 m (18 ft.) of water.</p>
<p>In the plane case, the pressure differential would rise and fall slowly and smoothly and within well defined limits.</p>
<p>In the ship case, the pressure is more chaotic with brief but large spikes.</p>
<p>It really depends on how close to the calm waterline these windows are.  That will determine how battered they are by breaking storm waves and how deeply submerged they can be in swells.   In general, I think the ship glass has the tougher job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the ship and window in question, but it's most likely that the airplane window will be stronger, but the ship window will be thicker. Airplanes use polycarbonate (Lexan) for the window material, which is not only lighter than glass, but much stronger (up to 200x stronger than untempered glass, ~50x stronger than tempered glass). The outer pane thickness is about 0.5&quot; and the inner pane is about 0.15&quot;, with a quarter inch gap between them. </p>
<p>I would think that the airplane window would be under much higher stress than a ship window in the course of normal operation, though I haven't done the math to back this up. In flight, the cabin pressure is around 12 psi and the ambient pressure is 3 psi, so you have a net outward pressure of 9 psi. On a ship window, above the water line, the ambient pressure and cabin pressure are the same. You'd have to go 20 feet or so below the waterline to get the same pressure differential on the ship as you have on the airplane (though the pressure would be pressing inwards on the ship). It's true that the ship has waves and wake crashing on it, but the airplane window has aerodynamic stresses, which I think would be much larger than with a wave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Planes can withstand many small holes without losing pressurization. The leaks would likely be able to compensated for with a little extra strain on the pressurization system. Too many holes, or a blown out window, would be a different story, but could still structurally survive with some emergency equipment for crew and passengers. </p>
<p>Leaks in ships are similarly not the end of the world, but you definitely wouldn't want them springing up with any regularity or in difficult-to-patch locations (such as in the middle of a pane of glass). Typically there's not a lot of below-water-line windows, but those that exist are definitely more durable than the clear poly-carbonate of plane windows. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
