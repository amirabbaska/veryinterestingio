		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The general theory for this is that our brains thrive from predicting. This is why you might not like a song initially, but after a few more listens you start to love it because you can predict where the song will go next.</p>
<p>But it also works both ways; listening to a song hundreds of times results in  diminishing returns of satisfaction from predicting it, because it's become 'hard wired' into your brain. Then you take a short break, so you can enjoy the song again because you can't remember all of it anymore, and your brain enjoys trying to predict what will happen next again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three  important functions of our brain </p>
<ol>
<li>detect patterns
2, predict outcomes
3, detect change</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these help us to recognize / avoid danger</p>
<p>Our sensory systems are designed to respond when input changes- for example, when the thermostat of an  air conditioner goes on, we hear the hum.
And then when it goes off, we hear the silence. </p>
<p>These responses to change need to be noticed- since changing conditions are potentially  dangerous
After a minute of hum/ silence the receptors adapt and shut off. </p>
<p>On a higher level, when we listen to music or see art, we initially make predictions about what will come next.  When the music or art is unfamiliar, the next earful or eyeful is a surprise. So we attend closely . </p>
<p>Once the information becomes familiar, we can predict its entirety with a brief glance or short sample of sound.  It has no novelty and is becomes  less interesting. Even just seeing the title on a playlist evokes the memory of the entire composition.  We apply our attention to new information. </p>

<p>Back in the day The Rolling Stone would get prerelease's of albums to review them. Some of the best selling albums in history received poor reviews. Many of them are now on The Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time.</p>
<p>The Beatles often argued about future iconic songs and whether they should be put on an album because the guys that didn't write the songs thought it was subpar. (e.g. As my guitar gently weeps)</p>
<p>Also many super hits sit on the shelf for years even tho many hear it and pass on recording. The country song of the year Whiskey lullaby was like this. The Hallelujah Course written and recorded by Leonard Cohen was ignored for years by more mainstream recording artists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HOLY CRAP! A question from my industry!  Yes, i worked the first FOUR years of my engineering career at a factory in rural America that produced approximately 2 million pounds of unsliced turkey deli meat per week.  I still work for one of the largest producer of turkey in the world.  The answer almost exclusively boils down to economics.  Turkey is a lower cost protein to make than chicken (by a small margin...but feed inputs are roughly 70% of the cost of poultry and turkeys are more efficient feed converters.  Every little bit counts here).  On top of this turkey is incredibly seasonal.  Thanksgiving, christmas, and to a lesser extent easter are when turkey producers make their money and spend the rest of the year trying not to lose it.  You cant just turn on the giant industro-ag machine that is turkey production for three holidays so production must remain relatively stable year round.  People dont buy whole turkeys throughout the year so producers have to get creative.  Enter turkey bacon, burgers, and.....deli breast!  Essentially...if you want reasonably priced thanksgiving and christmas turkeys...the industry has to find creative ways to sell it year round....the white goes to deli, dark goes to ham, bacon, and burgers.  If you have any other questions i would be happy to answer! Poultry is my life! Currently working at a large cooked chicken plant (edited to remove a customer reference...don't want to get make anyone mad...i can't/won't be able to answer questions about specific customers or products)
Edit to add a few other economic factors...turkey takes substantially longer to grow than chicken so contracts on pricing are easier to secure.  Chicken grows in weeks...so your contract price might look great the first flock...but feed prices change rapidly and if you lock in a year contract on chicken you could be getting screwed.  Also, there are higher margin outlets for chicken breast than deli meat.  Restaurants dont want to serve turkey because its slow to cook...chicken is fast and with high margins...chicken breasts are incredibly popular at the meat case for grilling.  If you can get it in your store, buy a raw turkey tenderloin to marinate and grill! Best cut of meat to grill bar a ribeye!
Edit a second time to say thanks for the gold.  If you have questions keep asking and i'll answer ALL OF THEM.  NOW GO OUT THERE AND ORDER SOME TURKEY! Im headed out for a bit but keep asking.  Ill answer all the questions you send me.<br />
FINAL EDIT GUYS: My fingers hurt and i need some cold cut turkey to rejuvenate.  some people are getting pretty close to figuring out my identity so i've disclosed to much and am gonna stop answering questions.  i am not a &quot;heartless animal killing nazi&quot; but i do have a family to feed and a great job i wanna keep!  For the vegans/vegetarians out there i know i won't change your opinions but know we are doing the most humane and respectful processes we can.  i feed this stuff to my family and eat it almost every day.    if you have any turkey specific questions let me know in my private messages and i'll be glad to answer them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i work in a grocery store beside the deli counter - let me explain.</p>
<p>Mostly it's the illusion.  And the fact that turkeys only sell a few times a year (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas), so the industry needed to find a way to market turkey meat year round.</p>
<p>As for the illusion part - that is because nobody really expects to see slicked chicken since a chicken is small and they think that people are actually slicing a chicken breast.  </p>
<p>When you get sliced turkey (from a deli for example) you are not getting an actual sliced turkey breast either.  The meat arrives in a ball to the store, its mostly preformed meat with a little bit of binding agent (corn starch or something, I don't really know) and a whole lot of water.  The person who is going to slice it has to drain a lot of water - the water is great for adding weight and you pay by weight often.  </p>
<p>The big ball of meat is easy to slice and that is what they used to make sliced turkey from - which is a lot easier for people to believe than a sliced chicken breast I suppose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a Deli in Australia many years ago (here Deli's just sell cold meats, olives, sliced cheeses, etc).</p>
<p>I would say that Ham was the most popular product by far. There were at least 8 types of ham, with varying degrees of processing - with 'off-the-bone' being the least processed, and most expensive. 'Champagne' ham was just a ball of pink with a ham-like skin. Once sliced they all looked roughly the same.</p>
<p>Turkey meat was a niche, and the 2 types you would get here were; processed, or breast meat - which again appeared similar once sliced, but tasted completely different.</p>
<p>There was also sliced processed chicken meat, which is mainly for kids and disgusting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It typically takes a strong light right next to them that only emits &quot;blacklight&quot; for these stamps and paint to show up. They show up, faintly, in sunlight but they're practically invisible because they're washed out by the other wavelengths of light. </p>
<p>If you wore UV-filtered glasses in sunlight, you could see them in plain sunlight. For example, they sell glasses like these for golfers to help them find their golf balls. By filtering out most regular wavelengths of sunlight, they make golf balls light up in contrast to everything else, much like some white shirts light up brightly in UV light.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much on every planet or moon it is possible to define North, South, East and West based on the body's rotation. Alternatively, they can be defined based on the Solar System's North and South (as the IAU did with Uranus, whose extreme axial tilt makes the rotational North opposite to the Solar System's North, but for all the other planets it's the same).</p>
<p>However this isn't very precise to plan spacecraft trajectories. There are more precise reference frames based on longitude and latitude, so a prime meridian is defined pretty much arbitrarily as they did on Earth. It's also quite common to use Cartesian reference frames centered on a planet but with the axes based on far away celestial objects because they don't rotate with the planet, so you have an inertial reference frame.</p>
<p>In deep space, far away from any planet, we use a reference frame centered on the Sun, with the X axis pointing along the ecliptic plane parallel to the vernal equinox (the intersection between Earth's equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane), the Z axis pointing North from the Sun, and the Y axis pointing 90° ahead of the X axis following the right hand rule.</p>
<p>It is possible to define others, it depends on each particular trajectory. Basically you need a center (a planet, the Sun, etc), a fundamental plane (the ecliptic plane, the planet's equatorial plane, etc) and a direction for the X axis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While in orbit, you (usually) use prograde/retrograde, normal/antinormal, radial in and radial out.</p>
<p>Prograde is the direction in which you travel in your orbital plane. Firing your engine while pointed prograde results in increasing altitude. Retrograde is opposite of that, and firing engines in this direction will decrease altitude.</p>
<p>Normal-antinormal is the direction perpendicular to the plane of your orbit (prograde/retrograde), facing &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;. Firing in this direction will change the inclination of your orbit.</p>
<p>Radial in faces directly down to the body you're orbiting, i.e. directly below to Earth. Radial out, conversely, away from the Earth.</p>
<p>Maneuvers are a vector on which you fire the engines, and that vector is calculated via those three directions. Most of the time the major component is prograde/retrograde, and then normal/antinormal when needed to adjsut inclination (most of the work setting up the ballpark inclination is done during the initial rocket ascent). Radial in/out is very inefficient and as such its component is negligible, if present at all (&lt;20 m/s dV usually).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Around the Earth, we use a coordinate system called the Geocentric Equatorial Coordinate system. It's a bit complex to wrap your head around, but essentially instead of using the XYZ axes, we use the IJK axes. </p>
<p>The I axis points to the vernal equinox. The vernal equinox is the direction from the center of the Earth to the center of the sun on the first day of spring (hence the term <em>vernal</em>). This axis always points in the same direction, no matter where the Earth is relative to the sun, to simplify calculations, predictions, etc. </p>
<p>The K axis runs through the center of the earth up through the North Pole. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>Finally, the J axis is the cross product of the I and K axes. If you're not familiar with the cross product, it's basically a vector that is perpendicular to two other vectors. Imagine the XYZ axes. The Z axis would be a cross product of the X and Y axes.</p>
<p>So, using the position and velocity of a spacecraft in this coordinate system, we are able to calculate a bunch of cool characteristics regarding the orbit of a spacecraft, such as inclination, eccentricity (how circular an orbit is), or the amount of time it takes to complete one orbit. </p>
<p>Of course, this is only for a satellite in orbit around the Earth. They use different coordinate systems for interplanetary travel or for launching a rocket into orbit. I'd need to dig my old notes out for those :P</p>
<p>Lemme know if anything didn't make sense! It is, in fact, rocket science!</p>

<p>Each cardinal directions is given as a pair of opposites.</p>
<p><strong>Coreward</strong> and <strong>Edgeward</strong> for the direction towards the core of the Galaxy, and towards the edge of the Galaxy, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Spinwise</strong> and <strong>Counter Spinwise</strong> for the direction of the Galaxy's spin, and the opposite, respectively.</p>

Sqrt(n) (usually) means that nonnegative real number x such that x^2 = n.  This definition of Sqrt doesn't work here.</p>
<p>I think it is better to first define the complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers, then define multiplication / addition on those numbers.</p>
<p>(a,b) * (c,d) = (ac-bd, a d+ b c)
(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d);</p>
<p>Then you can define i as the ordered pair (0,1), then show that (0,1)^2 = (1,0).  I think this building the complex numbers avoid the sort of problems you mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>-1 has two square roots (i.e. the two roots of z^2 = -1, i and -i)
But by convention, sqrt(-1)=√-1=i is named principal square root. Note the difference between the <em>concept</em> &quot;square root&quot; and the <em>symbol</em> sqrt=√. </p>
<p>You can define the principal square root of any complex number.</p>
<p>I am sure some books define i as i^2 = -1 and others as sqrt(-1). In the first case, i^2 = -1, acknowledging tacitly or explicitly that by that it is meant i and not -i. So defining i as i^2 = -1 and not mentioning anything else is less accurate, as you noticed.
The second case, however requires to define what the symbol (function) sqrt=√ means, i.e. to repeat the first paragraph above, which is wordier. Now, many are more comfortable with the square root (maybe because it appears in calculators), so for them sqrt is more intuitive. But by not mentioning what the symbol √-1 is you don't tell all the story. It is like saying what e^2.5 is without defining e and the power function. Also,applying √ is often tricky and some are cautious about it . Example x^2 =4 implies √x^2 = √4, so x=2 False.  √(x^2 ) = √4 implies |x|=2, ao x=-2 or x=2. Note that the √(x^2 ) =|x|, the principal root.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a definition of complex number, i^2 = 1 is in fact mathematically quite lacking. What is i supposed to be i in this definition? A real number? There are no real number r such that r^2 = -1. Thus i must be something else. A real mathematical definition would precise what this something else is supposed to be.</p>
<p>For instance,  one can define i as the 2-by-2 matrix</p>
<pre><code>i=    │ 0 1   │
       │-1 0   │</code></pre>
<p>then indeed i^2 = - 1 where 1 is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>Complex number can also be defined as dimension-2 ℝ-vector space with a
multiplication defined as
(x,y)  (x',y') = (x x' - y' y, x x' + y y)</p>
<p>Another way to define the complex numbers is to define them as a quotient ring of real polynoms: ℝ[X]/(X^2 + 1).</p>
<p>The common point of these definitions is that they first define a mathematical object, and then one has to prove that the defined mathematical object is a field (aka a set of numbers).</p>
<p>The usual definition i^2=-1 sweep sidesteps these questions of definition, and implicitely assume that i is just an number and that the set of numbers was
the set of complex number ℂ all along. These work because addition and multiplication works the same way for complex numbers and real numbers, thus students can fill the gap using the intuition they have acquired on real numbers.</p>
<p>However, logarithms and radicals does not generalize well for complex number. In particular, it is not possible to define √ in a way that verifies that for any complex number x, y: √(xy) = √x √y</p>
<p>Indeed, consider this counter-example:</p>
<p>— First, we start from:</p>
<pre><code>   √(-1 -1) = √1 = 1</code></pre>
<p>— Then we split the radical</p>
<pre><code> √-1 √-1  = i^2 = -1</code></pre>
<p>So if √(ab)= √a √b then 1 = -1, which is obviously false.</p>
<p>Consequently defining i using radical is dangerous since square root of complex number does not follow the rule for the square root of real numbers and this could lead student to be blocked by paradoxical situation (that could not arise with a proper definition).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If I lived on a torus planet where the cross-section of the torus was the diameter of the earth and the hole in the middle of the torus was around the distance from the earth to the moon. Assuming the torus is not rotating so no artificial gravity. Where would gravity pull me towards? My slightly educated guess would be the center of mass of the torus.</p>
<p>If this is the case then my follow up question would be, if gravity is weaker over distance, could I increase the size of this torus to the point where I would no longer be pulled to the centre?</p>
<p>Edit: I'd like to do a reverse question because a lot of people are saying that I would be pulled towards the surface of the Torus, is there a scenario where the pull to the centre of mass is greater than the pull to the surface?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people are getting this calculation wrong. You have to be careful with your assumptions.</p>
<p>Since you're very small relative to the size of the torus, the surface gravity can be approximated by finding the gravity of a cylindrical mass. </p>
<p>Surface gravity from the chunk right under you will be overwhelmingly stronger than effects from the rest of the torus, which are much further away. </p>
<p>To find the gravity of a cylinder, you must use the Gaussian formulation of gravity. Newton's law only works for spheres or other shapes at a long distance.</p>
<p>I'll skip the derivation, but you can find it <a href="http://www.pgccphy.net/103/gravity.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The formula for gravity on a cylinder is: g = (2Gλ)/r, where λ is the linear mass density and r is distance. </p>
<p>I'm assuming your torus has the same density as Earth. So the linear mass density is: pi <em> Earth's radius ^ 2 </em> Earth's density. </p>
<p>Plugging in values: λ = 7.033×10^18 g/cm <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=pi+*+\(earth+radius\)%5E2+*+\(earth+density\)" target="_blank">(calculation)</a></p>
<p>We already have G and r, so we just plug in everything else to find surface gravity:</p>
<p>g = 14.73 m/s^2 <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(7.033%C3%9710%5E18+g%2Fcm+*+2+*+G\)+%2F+\(earth+radius\)&amp;rawformassumption=%7B%22MC%22,+%22earth+radius%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%7B%22Planet%22,+%22a+planet%22%7D%7D&amp;rawformassumption=%22UnitClash%22+-%3E+%7B%22G%22,+%7B%22GravitationalConstantWGS84%22%7D%7D" target="_blank">(calculation)</a></p>
<p>So gravity on this torus is a good bit stronger than gravity on Earth. This makes intuitive sense, because there's more mass near you standing on a cylinder than there is with a sphere of the same radius. </p>
<p>This is accurate within a few percent. Gravity from the very distance regions can be neglected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't sat down to do the maths, and won't have time today, but any point inside a charged spherical shell feels no net electric field (the close bits exert a larger force per chunk of shell, but the further away bits are more numerous, and they cancel out). I'm pretty sure that applies to gravity too [just checked, yes it does <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Mechanics/sphshell2.html" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Mechanics/sphshell2.html</a>].</p>
<p>A torus isn't a shell, but precisely on the inside edge it should have a similar balancing effect. You can float in that plain, within the inner edge. if you stray out of the plane (through the holes, so to speak) there will be a restoring force pushing you back.</p>
<p>[Edit]: I've spotted a flaw in my logic; the gravity decreases proportional to radius squared, while surface area of a sphere increases by that proportion. A circle circumference increases proportional to 2*the radius. So wouldn't scale as quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

With inbreeding, of full siblings, the incidence increases to 6%. So it is not actually a huge change. Second, the chance of donor siblings meeting is very low. If you have one unknown half-sibling, which is not unusual in the general population, you have a 1 in 300 million chance to meet, as there are about 300 million people in the USA. Let us suppose you have 100 half siblings. So now you have a 1 in 3 million chance to meet. A 1 in 3 million chance that your chance to have a child with mutations will go from 3% to 6%. Finally, incest is full siblings having a child. Sperm donation isn't going to result in full siblings, it results in half siblings. So now you have a 1 in 2 chance of a 1 in 3 million chance your incidence of mutation goes from 3% to 4.5%??? It's just not worth worrying about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Since the length of possible coastline can be specified within an interval where both left and right endpoints have the same value (zero) we can apply Rolles theorem (also the interval is defined as continous, f'(x) exists, etc..).

<p>But this assumption is probably not good because processes of erosion near the current surface of the water make the current coastline longer than it &quot;should&quot; be (essentially it is more crinkly because of the effects of variable water level, waves and wind).

The sea floor is (for this purpose) flat, so the continents are essentially like huge mesas on the sea floor.
This means we can reduce the sea level and get more and more coastline as we go.
Until we get to the point where sea floor topography starts to affect coastline length.
Looking at maps it seems that we can go down to around 2500 meters below sea level before we have to start doing a more detailed analysis.
So maximum coastline will occur somewhere under (3700 - 2500) = 1200 meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever it is that spiders are grown and ready to set up shop, spin a web and wait for dinner (the species that do hunt this way), how does it choose the location? How does it know where the ideal place is to collect food?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How far do they travel to seek out such a place, if they do &quot;seek&quot; out certain places. Do they just drop a web whenever and wherever they are hungry? Move on when they get bored to a new place?</p>
</li>
<li>Going through some things in the bottom of the closet, stuff that gets moved on occasion, a couple times a month maybe. Inside a shoebox (and similar places) there are usually some tiny, tiny spiders with their homes set up. Is there really a steady food supply in there, tucked away, door shut? Obviously I know there is tiny food for them galore, but really, in my closet?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an almost impossible question to answer due to the vast amount of species of spiders; some spiders spin traps on the ground to alert it and catch the prey: trapdoor spider; Other tall grass faring spiders turn their webs towards the wind hoping for insects to get blown in; Some spiders build their webs over the water to eat insects flying up after they are hatched or down to drink water; Some even make webs underwater so they can trap bubbles down with them and live off plants re-oxygenating it and small fish and underwater insects. Basically, where they think there is food.</p>
<p>Traveling, some spiders travel by flying with web when they are born like a dandelion keeping them in the mile to two mile range and will generally only travel in a half mile zone from there, most web spinning spiders don't even move a half mile from their landing point though; hunting spiders are the only group that tend towards a bit of traveling but still abide in their territory.</p>
<p>If those spiders are cellar spiders they can go a long time without eating over 6 months, so a little food is enough to sustain them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a tough question to answer because spiders &amp; tarantulas and arachnids in general are so diverse in hunting and web building.</p>
<p>I probably am wrong here but in developed cities i'm sure it's to do with dust. Spiders are such apex hunters and dust generally attracts insects <del>and harbors dust mites which would be an ideal food source</del> in developed cities. plus dust leads to dirt which brings in more insects for spiders to hunt. and it can help them blend into the environment. Female spiders depending on the species generally build webs where as the males will scout and hunt. Depending on species though they all harbor different hunting techniques.</p>
<p>A species of spiders in Brazil work in communes to build massive webs together to maximize the catch of prey. Most other species are single serving free-for-all loners. Some tarantulas can burrow webs under water. Some build funnel traps in dirt and sand and other tarantulas can and will fight and eat snakes and birds and similar sized foes. I guess it depends on species and location. I notice most house hold spiders build webs in dusty corners and every nook 'n cranny. Garden spiders build big webs between plants because they can be brightly colored and if they sit in the center they blend in with the plants to another insect.</p>
<p>I'm recalling this knowledge from all the spidey books I read as a kid when I had a huge fascination with Arachnids. I am most likely wrong and would like a real spider master to correct me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oil doesn't exist underground in caverns that would otherwise be empty if it wasn't for the oil. Instead of thinking of large empty pockets, think of a wet sponge, where the sponge is rock and it's &quot;wet&quot; with oil. </p>
<p>But also remember that the oil and gas held underground is under great pressure. It is this pressure that allows the oil to be extracted, but when the pressure is relieved by removing the oil these smaller pockets don't necessarily remain empty, as they're often filled water seeping in from the surrounding rock. And even when they are not filled back in with water from surrounding rock, oil extraction often leaves about 13% porosity, which is about the same as modern concrete. </p>
<p>And it's not just water that can remain in the well: when an oil well is considered spent, and no more oil can be extracted (using traditional techniques), there may remain as much as 90% of the original deposit left in the ground. Because of the large amount of oil that can be left in an otherwise &quot;spent&quot; well, there are techniques for getting out more of the oil, which involves pumping fluids (mostly water) into the well, increasing the pressure and allowing more oil to be extracted. But this obviously displaces oil with water, and so the &quot;wet sponge&quot; never really dries out. </p>
<p>So while oil extraction often leaves a well less dense than it was to begin with, it's not a whole lot less dense...it's still mostly rock all the way down!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A different view point is that your reservoir is made of sand between 2 clay layers (impermeable). The gas/oil fills the pore space in between the sand. But if you look at what is holding the top clay layer up it is a combination of the sand particles and the pressure from the gas/oil.</p>
<p>As you produce gas/oil the stress to support the top layer of clay shifts over more and more to just the sand. Sometimes the sand cannot support this stress and starts to fracture at the individual particle level and compact.</p>
<p>You can have subsidence because your jar of marbles becomes a jar of crushed marbles.</p>
<p>Recovery % and other factors vary wildly. Some reservoirs do have meaningful aquifer support but because of the size, you may not know for 10+ years - and can crush the matrix during the time in between.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

So sometimes what happens is that you have injection wells located a bit aways from your producing well (oil) that will inject water to help push the oil out easier and the water will prevent any overburden pressure from collapsing. Essentially you're just replacing the oil with water to try and preserve the rock. Also once your oil well starts producing all water, you know you've basically gotten all of the oil. </p>
