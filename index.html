		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the 4s orbital is typically lower energy (and therefore filled first) in comparison to the 3d because a small part of it is actually quite close to the nucleus, whereas the 3d is generally mostly far out. We describe this by saying the 4s &quot;penetrates&quot; the 3d orbital.</p>
<p>Most teachers in high school are under the misunderstanding that all s-orbitals are simple spheres. They aren't. The 1s is, but the 2s is more of a sphere within another sphere. Then the 3s is a sphere within a sphere within a sphere, and so on. Gaps between these spheres called radial nodes are added every higher shell. This happens for all orbital types: one higher shell adds a radial node to that subshell's orbitals.</p>
<p>The 4s shell has 3 radial nodes, and it's innermost sphere is close to the nucleus. The 3d, because it is the first shell to have d orbitals, has no radial node. The electron density is mostly out at the edges, and this allows the 4s to actually achieve lower energy than 3d.</p>
<p>4s therefore fills first.</p>
<p>If you're wondering about chromium being 4s^1 3d^5 instead of 4s^2 3d^4, it's because the energy required to pair two electrons in the same orbital (causing repulsion due to the two negative charges on the electrons) turns out to actually be a greater energy cost than just... having the electron go into the higher energy 3d state.</p>
<p>Copper has a related story, in that it chooses to pair the last electron in the 3d rather than the 4s. this is again because of the shape of the orbitals - that small inner sphere of the 4s that's close to the nucleus also means paired electrons will be forced closer together than paired electrons in the 3d (which spend their time on the outskirts of the orbital) and so pairing in the 3d is more stable than pairing in the 4s. At least once the other 3d electrons are near full anyway. Orbital energies all differ and change depending on the electrons present in the atom already.</p>
<p>These trends generally hold down the table, but as you get more shells, the energies become very very similar for different orbitals and the electrons stop caring what order they fill really. Because the energy is about the same.</p>
<p>As to why the d block and f block specifically misbehave more than the others, it's because their shapes  siffer to that of the s and p orbitals. s and p orbitals only experience shielding from orbitals in shells lower down, but a d orbital is so spread out that it gets shielded by other electrons in the same shell. With f orbitals that effect gets so bad you even start seeing something called lanthanide contraction, where the atomic radius seems to behave as if the f orbital electrons are barely even there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically there are competing effects that determine the most stable electron configuration that lead to a very predictable and regular order early in the periodic table (small atomic numbers) but become more complicated with both increasing energy level and angular momentum.</p>
<p>At first, the largest effect leading to the aufbau rules is the energy level (labeled 1, 2, 3...) or the principal quantum level - which can be thought of as roughly the average distance from the nucleus. The difference in energy between levels decreases rapidly with increasing energy level so other effects start to compete</p>
<p>The next aufbau rule - fill s before p before d... relates the angular momentum (s orbitals have no angular momentum, p orbital have one quantum, d orbitals have 2...). In a single electron system (H atom or highly charged ions) they are all equally stable for a given energy level, but with the electron-electron repulsion, multi-electron systems tend to have the lower energy arrangements when the outermost electrons fill s orbitals first, then p, then d... the difference in these energies also reduces with increases angular momentum, and also varies with how many electrons.</p>
<p>Then there are effects like Hund's rule - configurations with unpaired electrons are more stable than those with paired electrons. This typically isn't considered when following the aufbau rules but is cited as the reason Chromium, for example, is [Ar]4s^1 3d^5 instead of [Ar]4s^2 3d^4 as predicted by Aufbau.</p>
<p>These kinds of breakdowns of the Aufbau principle become more common with higher energy level and higher angular momentum, and they do so in a manner that you really couldn't predict ahead of time based on simple arguments about energy sorting - you can only rationalize after the fact. It's not that these concepts are B.S., they just become too similar in magnitude to keep sorting in a simple predictable pattern. To truly predict an electron configuration for a large atom, you have to do a full quantum calculation solving the Shcroedinger equation - way beyond what you could do by hand and can even pretty challenging with high-speed computers for the larger atoms. </p>
<p>tl;dr: Like just about everything you think you know in science, the simple rules are approximations and sometimes the approximations aren't sufficient to answer your question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

After learning more about quantum physics, I realize, the truth is that there is no analog for things that exist at the macroscopic level. The best we can do is describe the behaviors mathematically. Orbital theory is as close as you're going to get for an explanation. Otherwise, the answer is &quot;quantum physics&quot; which is a somewhat different reality we don't experience in every day life.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what my esteemed friends and colleagues here have said, all d-block (transition metals) have different and varying amounts of electrons in their outer shell, it's this outer shall that does most of the chemistry for that atom. In the case of a transition metal there are 5 outer orbitals, with different planes of movement and bonding so you can get large complexes or structures to form. All electrons are able to be spin-paired. This means that in the 5 d-orbitals 10 electrons may fit. Where in the case of scandium there is 1 d electron (sort of) and in zinc there are 10. Different elements within this series form different oxidation states, mostly always forming positive ions. The stability of certain metals and their use in different things is often to do with their oxidation state and therefore their d electron count. One of the best things I can say here is that metals love doing shit and making shit. </p>
<p>Part of this is to do with the fact that they are slap bang in the middle. They want to achieve a stable electronic configuration (e18) like a noble gas, for example your reason krypton doesn't easily react is due to it having a full set of valence electrons so it doesn't have to gain any or lose any to be more stable and therefore doesn't NEED to react. </p>
<p>P-block elements or main group elements (gallium-krypton) get involved in chemistry just as much more often than not with metals themselves and are just as important to our everyday lives and are the basic building blocks of all organics, including yourself! P-block elements only have 3-orbitals so 6 electrons so can't form as many bonds or oxidation states, however a reason for the higher stability of the p-block is due to the electronegativity of this group the closer to the element fluorine you go the more electronegative the species. P-block will often form negative ionic species and are limited to the amount of electrons they can gain before becoming too unstable. Another main reason for the stability is that the ionisation energy of all elements increases as you go across the period. So it takes more energy to play with these chemicals the further to the right you go. </p>
<p>Metals and d-block Chem is extremely cool and I love it! I'd be happy to try and answer any questions you may have! I hope this went some way to explain the basics of it? And of course as to what I've said there are huge numbers of exceptions and we're learning new things all the time!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early days of the automobile manufacturers did sell directly to the consumer.  Then automobile sales began to boom.  Manufacturers didn't have the capital to create enough dealerships to sell all their cars in every city across the nation so they franchised out to dealerships.  This helped car manufacturers reach consumers fast and get into areas where it wasn't feasible to just sell their cars.  They could franchise their brands to dealers who sold competitor brands.  This allowed continual rapid growth for sales while keeping capital to a minimum.</p>
<p>These franchises feared automotive companies would be able to undercut them if they ever decided to build their own dealerships.  So they successfully lobbied politicians to create laws prohibiting direct sales.  This was done with the belief these laws would protect the small franchises from the large corporations and the belief that dealerships created local jobs.  There was also the belief that dealerships created a more personal experience and lowered prices by creating more competition.  These dealerships also banded together into networks and fought against OEM's if they tried to create their own dealerships.  Not all states outlaw direct sales, and the Big 3 in the past have tried to sell direct in those states.  Yet their own massive independent dealer network would freak out whenever it happened and would threaten to disrupt sales across the country.  So even in states where it's not illegal to sell direct the major manufacturers still sell through dealerships due to threats from other dealers if they don't.</p>
<p>Of course opponents to these regulations see dealerships as nothing more than useless middlemen, especially in an age with so much information available to the consumer.  Why shouldn't cars be sold like most products?  A person can go to an Apple store or Best Buy to get a new Macbook.  Heck, they could buy one from the comfort of their own home by buying one online directly from Apple or an Apple dealer.  Why can't a person do that with a car?  If dealerships truly lowered prices then they have nothing to fear.  These laws appear to be useless regulations that provide little benefit to the consumer while adding costs to the process of buying and owning an automobile.  Why not let the consumer decide what they value instead of being told how to buy a car?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Germany. There are of course many dealerships, but the big German car makers (BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW, Opel, Porsche, ...) also run 'branch offices' in many big cities where they sell directly. They use the same list pricing (and possible discounts) like their official dealerships, and when you think of the branch office being run like a dealership, bottom line will make the same margins as the dealers, basically. Of course the branche's profits go directly into the car manufacturer's profit, which benefits the car maker, not an independent dealer. So they basically control the supply chain from making the car, marketing, distribution etc. down to the sales the consumers, plus they run aftermarket and service facilities in their branches, too. </p>
<p>As another option you can order your car directly with the branch, and then even pick it up at the factory. You can go e.g. to the Volkswagen 'Autostadt' (=car city) in Wolfsburg, or BMW in Munich to pick up your shiny new treasure, VW makes a big show out of that by supplying it with a bouquet of flowers from an automated glass storage tower, your can stay even in the Ritz Carlton there and visit their museums and car shows for one or two days, against a fee of course. But you will save the fee of 'transfer from factory' of a 500-100 usd you would be charged when picking it up at the dealer or branch. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aB5dh1WbQMs" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aB5dh1WbQMs</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Now of course the various car companies are big enough they could that there are laws in place to protect the dealers from competition from the manufacturer who could undercut them. </p>
<p>There are some exceptions, Tesla do not sell via dealers. You can only buy new cars from them directly.

<p>In <em>Citizen Kane</em>, director Orson Welles revolutionized how films were shot. There are a number of cinematic techniques that were introduced in <em>Citizen Kane</em> including low angle shots, multiple dissolves, deep focus, non-linear storytelling (in particular supported by the film editing), people talking over one another (most films were shot then as back-and-forth dialogue), full sets with four walls and a ceiling (most films then were shot on sets like stage plays -- 3 walls, no ceiling), incorporation of fake documentary/news reels (which Welles had pioneered on radio with <em>War of the Worlds</em>), expressionistic lighting, and more.  </p>
<p>All of these things are so commonplace today that you'll see them in many 30-second commercials, never mind feature films. But in 1941 they were all almost entirely new innovations that people had never seen until <em>Citizen Kane</em>. </p>
<p>Watching <em>Citizen Kane</em> today, you'd think &quot;What's the big deal?&quot; But the <em>reason</em> you think &quot;What's the big deal&quot; is because of all the techniques that <em>Citizen Kane</em> introduced to cinema. </p>
<p>Possible recent analogy: think about how the special effects of something like <em>Jurassic Park</em> or <em>The Matrix</em> in the 90's or maybe <em>Avatar</em> in 2009 changed the way that people thought about how films could be made. <em>Citizen Kane</em> had <em>ten times</em> the impact that those films had in people's thinking about how films could be made. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>In Citizen Kane, director Orson Welles revolutionized how films were shot. There are a number of cinematic techniques that were introduced in Citizen Kane including low angle shots, multiple dissolves, deep focus, non-linear storytelling (in particular supported by the film editing), people talking over one another (most films were shot then as back-and-forth dialogue), full sets with four walls and a ceiling (most films then were shot on sets like stage plays -- 3 walls, no ceiling), incorporation of fake documentary/news reels (which Welles had pioneered on radio with War of the Worlds), expressionistic lighting, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it's important to note that it's not just that Welles used these techniques, but <em>how</em> he used him.  And in fact, many of the innovative things he did where already done in previous films (deep focus is used heavily in The Rules of the Game, 1939), but he was the first to do them all in a single movie.  The final chapter of one film textbook I read was dedicated to explaining why Citizen Kane is so great, and it opened by stating something along the lines of, &quot;Every shot in the movie contains meaning, and the worst of the shots are merely very good.&quot;</p>
<p>So to give you an idea, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbGbqRWwC_Q" target="_blank">here's a famous shot that students typically look at in film school.</a></p>
<p>Here are some things to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single shot once we enter the house/cabin.  Creating continuity in time, and also means that the blocking in this shot is all related</li>
<li>Contrast between how the mother is dressed (formal) vs the father (casual)</li>
<li>The camera moves away from the window with the mother in the foreground and father in the background, suggesting further that she has control over the scene</li>
<li>They sit down.  The characters are arranged so that the father is the only one standing.  Usually a character standing suggests strength, but since he is still in the background and his dressed casually, this blocking convention is somewhat subverted, just as this scene subverts gender dynamics as a whole.  Also, as they debate over the fate of a young Charles Foster Kane, he is scene in the background, between the two parents, playing in the snow.  (This all being visible to the audience is an example of his use of deep focus).</li>
<li>As the drama in the scene escalates, the father moves to the foreground and the camera tilts up (still the same shot).  The shot goes from a wide to a medium-wide, low-angle.  The continuity in movement further articulates the rise in drama, and suggests a last ditch effort by the father.  He now appears more menacing than before.  Maybe there is more to his relationship with his wife and son?  &quot;Anybody doesn't think I've been a good husband, or father...&quot;(we find out a few moments later that he is not a good father)  Note: Charlie is still in the center, background. </li>
<li>As the mother signs, the camera tilts back down, excluding the father from the frame, indicating that he has no agency in this scene, or this moment.  The mother owns the scene, the mother has &quot;won&quot; the scene</li>
<li>After the papers are signed, the camera rises, and the father moves back to the window and shuts it.  The closing of the window following the signing of the papers, suggests that these documents have actually ended the boy's blissful childhood, a major theme of the movie.</li>
<li>They are all standing now and move towards the window, and the mother actually opens in one last time.  The dialogue in the following closeup, with her action of opening the window reveals that she may not be as cold as we were previously lead to believe, that she does care about her son's well-being, and this is what she thinks is right for him.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's just one shot in the movie.  That's not even going into the overall structure of it and the depth of the narrative.  There's a lot going on in Citizen Kane, and it's acclaim is not unwarranted.  Roger Ebert did a commentary track for it, which is supposed to be fantastic.  That can explain in more detail why it's a near perfect movie. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the silents or early talkies, they are almost like theatrical plays. Static stage, camera, and lighting. The story is usually pretty linear, and told exclusively through dialogue (and maybe a bit of action)</p>
<p>In Citizen Kane, most of the locations are filmed through several different cameras, some at some fairly unusual angles. And a great deal of care is taken with the lighting. All this gives a much greater sense of the locations being actual places instead of a stage with the curtains hidden from view. It also was pretty innovative with the narrative frame - there are flashbacks, montages, and so on. Citizen Kane wasn't necessarily the first movie to use any one of these techniques, but it did so many of them, and executed them so well that it has come to be seen as kind of a master class in how to use the unique properties of cinema to create artwork that wouldn't be possible in any other medium. And the acting, dialogue, cinematography and all that is very well done.</p>
<p>It also probably acquired a certain amount of mystique because Orson Welles was such a young and unknown quantity in Hollywood when he made it, and then never really lived up to that early promise. It was also very controversial when it came out, because the incredibly powerful newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst (whom Kane was based on) tried to bury it during production. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From <a href="https://redd.it/2rpq0u" target="_blank">Previous thread</a> - Here is a great ELI5 explanation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever seen pizza made from scratch? The dough begins as a ball. It is then thrown in the air and spun. As it spins, the dough flattens and moves outwards into a disc shape. Solar systems and galaxies form like that.</p>
<p>Because they spin.
When you have loosely connected matter, like the dust from which galaxies are formed--or, say, pizza dough--as it rotates, it tends to push material away from the axis of rotation. Thus, gravity can compress the matter into a disc-like shape, but the faster it rotates, the harder it is for it to compress into a spherical shape.</p>
<p>This applies to the formation of many objects in astrophysics--it's why solar systems tend to have a 'plane' much like galaxies, and even stars are originally formed from a collapsing disk.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that there are more spherical galaxies, as well as a large central bulge in otherwise 'flat' galaxies. There's quite a lot of variance.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the main thing at work here is conservation of angular momentum, which is a fancy way of saying that the total amount of rotation in a closed (isolated, not connected to some other source or sink of energy) system has to stay the same.</p>
<p>So say you have a huge cloud of dust that will one day be a galaxy. At the moment it's a huge blob with particles flying in all directions and bumping into each other. If you add up the trajectories of all of the particles in that cloud, you will end up with a net amount of rotation on one axis (in 3D space), which means that the whole cloud is rotating in some direction on some 2D plane.</p>
<p>Since the total amount of angular momentum in an isolated system has to stay the same, that means that the cloud must rotate no matter how the forces inside it end up balancing out. Particles that aren't rotating in that direction continue to bump into each other, as well as rotating particles, and over time, all of those opposing directional forces cancel out, leaving the cloud more or less all rotating in the same direction, on that same flat plane.</p>
<p>The reason the disc doesn't collapse into a sphere is because the particles are individually too light relative to their distance between each other to overcome the centripetal forces keeping them locked in their orbits. Planets form spheres rather than discs because the particles that make them up, while starting as a cloud and collapsing into a disc, are able to pull together into clumps gravitationally. They still keep rotating in the same direction, but they all become larger chunks with enough mass to maintain a 3D shape against the speed of their rotation.</p>
<p>This is also why all of the planets in most solar systems orbit in the same direction, because all of the particles that made them did so as well, and had nowhere to dump that rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Theres also alot of rogue objects which arent really bound to anything gravitationally and are just drifting.

<p>Take 3 of the most common antiseptics, hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, and iodine. </p>
<p>On their own they work great.  But hydrogen peroxide is a strong &quot;oxidizer&quot;, a term in chemistry that means it has free oxygen that reacts with other chemicals.  (It's H2O2, meaning one oxygen splits off to create h2o and o and the o is reactive).</p>
<p>The Hydrogen peroxide will oxidize the alcohol, making it less effective, and it will oxidize the iodine and create a different chemical all together.</p>
<p>Edit:  just tried this so I wasn't a hypocrite in case it didn't work.  If you have dry hands, pour alcohol on them.  It will burn. Now pour peroxide on your hand, it will fizz. Now mix equal parts alcohol and peroxide in a bottle or cup and shake it vigorously for a few seconds, then let stand for a few seconds.  Now pour it on your hand.  It won't fizz, and it won't burn, and it won't smell that strongly of alcohol either.  And oddly enough, it'll feel a little slippery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, and I'll try to answer in a way suitable for your school project. </p>
<p>First look at your electrons. They &quot;orbit&quot; the nucleus, but not in the way that planets orbit a sun, but by filling quantum orbitals.  These have shapes, which can be seen <a href="http://timelineoftheatom.blogspot.co.uk/p/erwin-schrodinger-1926.html" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://cdn.comsol.com/wordpress/2015/05/orbitals-for-the-hydrogen-atom.png" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8aDOv.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. If you are trying to find an electron characterised by its specific quantum numbers, these shapes will tell you where you need to look to find such an electron with high probability. </p>
<p>These shapes can be found by solving the Schroedinger equation for a Coulomb potential generated by the tiny, yet massive and positively charged nucleus.</p>
<p>The nucleus itself is built up in the same way. The protons and neutrons also occupy such orbitals. So from the point of the atom you can indeed say that the protons and neutrons are just all lumped in together in the nucleus. Yes, they are highly ordered, but it will make little difference to the atom.</p>
<p>If you need more/different information ask again. It would help to know what year you are in, the most appropriate answer will be different for a senior year in high school or junior high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is missing a lot of key points, and many are flat out wrong. It's not lobbying in a legal sense and it's not a campaign donation. </p>
<p>The money being pooled is almost exclusively to be used by 501(c)(4), which are &quot;social welfare organizations&quot;.  These organizations cannot donate directly to candidates for federal office.  </p>
<p>What these organizations do is make &quot;independent expenditures&quot; which benefit candidates. Legally these have to be done without coordination with the candidate or the campaign.  </p>
<p>What that means from a practical standpoint is that they run an ad that says something like </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Healthcare reform was a critical factor in making sure residents of Wisconsin.  Paul Ryan was a champion of smart, sensible health care reform.  Tell Paul Ryan 'thank you' for being a strong voice for Wisconsin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[note, I don't agree with that... just using it as an example]</p>
<p>The advertisement would clearly be in support of Paul Ryan, but Citizen's United v. FEC made it legal for social welfare organizations to participate in certain types of speech without falling under normal campaign limits.  Theoretically, these social welfare groups can spend unlimited money running those kinds of ads.  </p>
<p>So what the Koch brothers essentially did was say &quot;hey, we're going to spend a ton of money supporting Republicans through our network of 501(c)(4)'s.  If you vote no, we won't spend any of that money in your district&quot;.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The first mechanism, as others have mentioned, is due to the isotope being part of the decay chain of other, longer lived isotopes.</p>
<p>Another mechanism that can do this is cosmic rays. The Carbon 14 used in Carbon dating is produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen in the atmosphere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short:</p>
<p>&quot;The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.5 billion years, uranium-235 about 700 million years, and uranium-234 about 25 thousand years. Uranium atoms decay into other atoms, or radionuclides, that are also radioactive and commonly called &quot;decay products.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Basically you have a combination of factors. </p>
<p>-Really long half-lifes</p>
<p>-HUGE amounts of material</p>
<p>-Material then decays into other radioactive elements.  It takes a long time for a hunk of &quot;random radioactive material,&quot; to actually become stable.  This is called a decay chain:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is there still any naturally occurring isotopes left on Earth if they have short half lives?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't.  Most have really long half-lives.  </p>
<p>Also if you had 100 tons of a material w/ a half life of 100 years, after 1000 years you would still have nearly 1 ton of the original material, and also a bunch of other radioactive goop.  Hence our storage of spent radioactive fuel.  For example TC-99 has a half-life of 220,000 years. So all that spent fuel is in there for the long haul and will likely remain radioactive longer than humanity will exist.  (Unless we leave this planet.  Friendly reminder to support Mars research.)  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several different reasons. Consider a few examples:</p>
<p>Uranium-238, Uranium-235, and Potassium-40. All are radioactive enough to twig a geiger counter up a few notches, all are still naturally occurring in not insignificant quantities. But this is because they all have long half-lives, 4.5 billion years for U-238, 0.7 billion years for U-235, and 1.3 billion years for K-40. That means there's half as much U-238 on Earth now than there was when Earth was &quot;born&quot; along with 1.2% as much U-235 and 8.3% as much K-40. Billions of years is a large amount of time, but these are pretty long-lived isotopes.</p>
<p>Consider Carbon-14 however, with a half-life of only 5700 years. None of the Carbon-14 from the early days of Earth is still around, yet it continues to be present in small amounts even so. This is because high energy cosmic rays hitting the Earth's upper atmosphere produce a shower of particles which includes neutrons and these neutrons can hit Nitrogen-14 atoms, turning them into Carbon-14 atoms after the emission of a proton. So there's a natural process constantly producing Carbon-14 and creating an equilibrium abundance of it in trace quantities at a given level of background cosmic radiation.</p>
<p>Consider Radon-222, Radium-226, and Helium. Helium is stable, but it doesn't typically last very long in the Earth's atmosphere because it has a tendency to drift higher and higher into the upper atmosphere and then get lost to interplanetary space. However, there's still Helium in Earth's atmosphere and there are natural sources of Helium (underground). This is because an alpha particle is just a Helium-4 nucleus, so alpha emitting radioisotopes will produce Helium in their environment as the alpha particles eventually lose energy and mate up with electrons, if they end up in a location where they can't easily escape to the surface (such as a geological formation that would also trap natural gas) then they can remain there in reasonably high concentrations for many millions of years. This is indeed where Helium comes from industrially, as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. Radon also exists naturally and can be quite dangerous to humans in certain environments, and yet it has only a 3.8 day half-life. Radium-226 also exists naturally but it has a half-life of only 1600 years (shorter even than Carbon-14). But both exist in the &quot;decay chain&quot; of naturally occurring Uranium/Thorium isotopes. As long as there's still Uranium-238 around there will be some amount of Ra-226 and Rn-222. This is actually a big factor in the radioactivity of naturally occurring Uranium, because U-238 isn't that radioactive on its own, but as it decays it builds up amounts of faster decaying and more radioactive isotopes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>Random interactions with other particles: Alphas/betas/Gammas/Neutrons.  Any of these can potentially turn a stable isotope into an unstable one.

<p>On point 1, it doesn't matter if an isotope has a short halflife in the range of seconds or less, if it's produced by something with a long halflife decaying, then it will pretty much always exist in some percentage in nature.</p>
<p>Some halflives are so long that they're considered primordial.  Like that particular chunk of isotope was there for the creation of the galaxy/universe, and it's still here.  It could conceivably still be here at the end of the galaxy/universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In my experience, kitchen staff won't make an item with extra ingredients unless the proper charge is on the ticket. In general, if you ask for something to be withheld, you'll just get extra of everything else. But since I'm just wait staff and not a manager or owner, I can't really change the price of your meal. The only exceptions I've seen be made are for when people want a half portion or something made very plain for a child. I would normally have to get it OK'ed by management and then they would adjust the price accordingly. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, any alteration to how the menu is presented should cost the customer more, and never cost the customer less.  </p>
<p>The cost of assembling a menu item for the customer is already figured out.  The decor of the plate, the flavor combinations etc. have been planned out ahead of time, and you're asking to change that layout.  If you are altering the menu, you're creating a &quot;speed bump&quot; in the kitchen for the people who are preparing it.  </p>
<p>They will make it to your liking, however this will probably slow down the service for other customers.  If everyone changed the menu to their specific tastes, it would likely double the time it takes to prepare each meal, and it may alter the presentation and flavor profile that the chef had intended... and they risk making other patrons mad for slow service.  So naturally they're not going to encourage the practice by offering a discount for doing so.</p>
<p>If you're allergic or you generally don't like one aspect of a menu item, it doesn't hurt to ask for an alteration.  But don't expect them to say yes (so have an alternate item picked out), and don't expect to pay less... because you're wrecking the flow and order of the kitchen.  And you don't want to piss off the people who are making your food behind closed doors, nor make the waitress the target of an upset kitchen staff.  </p>
