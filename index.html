		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Reddit!</p>
<p>We are a plant ecology research lab at Monmouth University. We recently conducted a study investigating community succession after abandonment in abandoned cranberry bogs within the New Jersey Pinelands. Since the 1860's, the cultivation of the native American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, has been a major agricultural practice in the New Jersey pinelands. The pinelands have been well suited for cranberry production due to the sandy, organically rich soil and abundant sources of freshwater. Although cranberry agriculture can represent over a third of wetlands in the pinelands, the industry has been on the decline as it has moved to other regions of the country. As a result, many bogs have been abandoned. The effects of abandonment have not been investigated thoroughly. </p>
<p>In this study, we explored the fate of bogs and examined bog succession after abandonment from time zero (an active cranberry bog) to 60 years abandoned in flooded and unflooded communities. A full inventory of plant and invertebrate species were collected from cranberry bogs of different ages from three locations. Community diversity and structure were determined from the inventories and a chronosequence for bog succession was developed. When a cranberry bog was left to dry, conversion from a wet savanna to either a mesic mixed forest or wooded swamp was observed. A cranberry bog that remained flooded transitioned to a lake, spung, or pond. With this information, recommendations can be made onto how the lands should be managed in the future in order to maintain healthy and native communities.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An easy way to think of it is by imagining the ear drum as an actual drum. The pop in the ear is the pressure inside and outside the ear normalize and is equivalent to loosening a tightened or tightening a loosened drum diaphragm. A loose drum wouldn't be able to correctly reproduce the high frequency noise while the tight one wouldn't be able to reproduce lower ones. Fixing the pressure lets both extremes go back to normal. However, because your brain has been hearing suboptimal reproductions, it increases the sensitivity of what signals it gets. So when the ear goes back to normal everything is obviously very different and optimal making the crisp clear hearing. But then over time you get used to it, brain doesn't have to strain as much and it feels like it's back to normal </p>
<p>Edit: [source] (<a href="http://www.entnet.org/content/ears-and-altitude" target="_blank">http://www.entnet.org/content/ears-and-altitude</a>) for u/Wootery similar effect except in this case the pressure differential is due to altitude</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For you to hear, your eardrum needs to move in and out. If it's too far pushed in or out, it won't be able to move properly, so you can't hear so well.</p>
<p>Your eardrum sits between your outer ear (connected to the outside world through your ear canal) and your middle ear (which exchanges air with the atmosphere through a tube that ends in your nasal cavity). That tube opens when you swallow, chew, blow your nose, etc.</p>
<p>The pop you hear is the tube opening and the eardrum being centred again. It does sound like your tube isn't working well, which is causing your middle ear to not equalise in pressure normally, which causes your eardrum to push one way or the other. It could be caused by infection, age, or just how your body is built.</p>
<p>This could indicate or cause problems, so if it is something that happened recently and hasn't gone away, I'd speak to a professional about it. I'd definitely speak to someone if I had a related sinus/nasal infection, pain in the ear, or persistent hearing loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is not normal - the pop is normal, but your hearing should be the same before and after. It sounds like something may be impeding the movement of your tympanic membrane or ossicles (hearing bones) most of the time and relived for a short time when you pop your ears. That could be wax outside the ear drum just touching it, or something deeper in the middle ear or maybe even something in your throat that is keeping your middle ear blocked (the Eustachian tube is what's responsible for equalising the pressure inside your middle ear and letting fluid drain out so that you can hear).</p>
<p>A normal audiogram doesn't mean your hearing is perfect. You may be able to hear the full range of frequencies but that doesn't mean you can hear them clearly or perfectly, or all at the same volume.</p>
<p>You could try wax removal drops like Otex or Olive oil first to see if it helps, but it's probably best to go and get a doctor to have a look inside your ear (and even throat) and decide how further to look in to this for you. I would NOT start randomly using medications like Flonase if I were you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deep down in the bottom of your ear is a little drumskin. </p>
<p>On the other side of that drumskin is a little room about the size of a lima bean. </p>
<p>On the floor of that room is a little tunnel that leads to the back of your throat. That little tunnel opens occasionally to let fresh air in and flush out any moisture to the back of your throat. </p>
<p>Sometimes, when you're sick, the little tunnel swells up or gets blocked. Air can't get into that little room so a little vacuum forms. That vacuum sucks in the drumskin making it tighter than normal. When the drumskin tightens, it doesn't work the same and it makes sounds seem dull. </p>
<p>When something opens that tunnel, like when you get over your sickness or you pop your ears, air comes back to the room. The air can come back in slowly, so you barely notice, or it can rush in and make a &quot;pop&quot;. </p>
<p>The returning air relieves the drumskin and makes it easier to hear. If the problem with the tunnel isn't quite fixed, the vacuum and the &quot;pop&quot; might happen over and over until everything is fixed. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus ELI-an-adult-redditor:</strong> The eustachian tube (ET), which ventilates the middle ear space, may fail to function for a multitude of reasons. Often it's congestion of some type that temporarily blocks it or causes inflammation which impairs its function. Some individuals simply have dysfunctioning ETs and have chronic trouble equalizing middle ear pressure. In normal conditions, the ET opens frequently throughout the day before any significant pressure can build in the middle ear space. For this reason you don't really notice a change occur. When pressure has been allowed to change over time (e.g. in cases of cold or congestion) or pressure has changed suddenly (e.g. upon take-off or landing in an aircraft), a sudden opening of the ET is much more apparent and you get the classic &quot;pop&quot;. If your congestion is ongoing, you get these prolonged periods of negative middle ear pressure with only brief moments of relief. </p>
<p>Middle ear immittance is a story for a different day. The short end of it as it relates to this thread is that the negative middle ear pressure sucks in the tympanic membrane (TM; ear drum), changing its frequency response and reducing its ability to transduce acoustic energy (sound). As the ET opens, pressure within the middle ear approaches that of the surrounding atmosphere, which is typically ideal for normal transduction of sound. </p>
<p>EDIT: <strong>Source:</strong> I'm a pediatric audiologist, so I've spelled this out a few times in the past. To everyone asking for one form of advice or another...If something is impacting your daily life, it may be worth your time to have a quick exam by an ENT. Might help, might not. But you will have checked off something. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pop is from a tube which runs from inside your ear to your nasal cavity.  You hear a pop when blockage is cleared and air pressure which has built up from breathing gets relieved.  It's called a eustachian tube. If you have constant mucus in there from sinus issues it can block the tube and everything will sound dull compared to normal hearing because the built up pressure prevents your ear drum from moving enough to transmit sounds. You can try to fix the sinus trouble or they make stints which hold this tube open if its a non-mucus related problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The English language has many homographs: words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently. Think of the bow of a ship and a bow made of ribbon; or an invalid in a wheelchair as opposed to an invalid input.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is because English spelling rules are a mess. We haven't had a proper spelling reform since the introduction of printing, but the way we speak has continued to change through the centuries. As a result, our written language is seriously out of step with our spoken language.</p>
<p>The word &quot;job&quot; appears to come from the 15th-century &quot;gobbe&quot;, meaning &quot;lump&quot; or &quot;piece&quot;: it was in the phrase &quot;gobbe of worke&quot;. Over time, the &quot;of work&quot; was dropped because it became redundant, the &quot;g&quot; was softened to a &quot;j&quot; sound and the meaning was expanded from the original sense of &quot;a task&quot; to &quot;paid work&quot; and then to &quot;occupation&quot;.</p>
<p>The name &quot;Job&quot; comes from the Hebrew &quot;Iyov&quot;, although the &quot;o&quot; was pronounced a bit more like our modern long &quot;o&quot; (not <em>quite</em> like it, but similar), and the &quot;i&quot; was pronounced like our &quot;ee&quot;. The sounds represented by &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, as anyone who has learned Spanish will know, are very closely related and can sometimes be confused.</p>
<p>But we didn't get the name directly from Hebrew. Instead, we got it from the Latin translation of the Old Testament. Latin originally didn't have a letter &quot;j&quot;: it used the letter &quot;i&quot; to represent both a vowel sound (&quot;ee&quot;) and a semi-vowel (like our &quot;y&quot; in &quot;yes&quot;). Latin also dropped the first vowel, giving us &quot;Iob&quot;, pronounced roughly &quot;yobe&quot;. Later, the new &quot;j&quot; was created as a variation of &quot;i&quot; and became used for the half-consonant sound, giving us the modern spelling &quot;Job&quot;. Then the sound of the &quot;j&quot; changed, by a complicated process, to its modern version.</p>
<p>Not all languages did this. In German Bibles, for example, the name is much closer to the original Hebrew: it is sometimes written &quot;Ijob&quot; (the German &quot;j&quot; still represents the &quot;y&quot; sound), but more usually it's aspirated, meaning an &quot;h&quot; sound is added, so in most German Bibles it's &quot;Hiob&quot; (without the &quot;j&quot;, because it's actually superfluous), pronounced approximately &quot;hee-obe&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Biblical Job is a Hebrew name through Greek and Latin, with a soft j/i and a long o, more like &quot;eeobe&quot;.</p>
<p>Job as occupation is much more recent, might be from &quot;gob&quot; as in a lump (of work to do). Johnson's dictionary has</p>
<p>job. (1) A low mean lucrative busy affair. (2) Petty, piddling work; a piece of chance work.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons: summer days are longer near the poles compared to the tropics, meaning more time for activity; and springtime sees an absolute explosion of food resources (insect and plant population growth) so the birds that fly back north get access to it, whereas the birds that would stay down south continue having to compete for a standard amount of resources.</p>
<p>Basically, seasonal variation makes for some months with an overabundance of food (ie spring) and some months with a dearth of food (ie winter). They fly south to avoid the lack of food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. </p>
<p>The other comment about long summer hours in the north is a pretty good point. Where I live we get about 18 hours of sun on the longest day of the summer. Of course that means we only get 4 hours of sun in the shortest day of winter, but hey, plants can't grow in the snow anyway.</p>
<p>While people have this idea that the north is a sort of ecological wasteland, its really not. That is an old idea tied to agrarian lifestyles.  ie: if it's not good farmland, it's useless. That isn't true. </p>
<p>The north, the boreal/taiga forest and tundra, are rich in flora and food, and this is evident in the extremely large animals you'll find, like moose, polar bears, grizzly bears, brown bears, wolves, cougars, musk ox, walruses, seals, elk, and so on. For avians, there are large species too, like trumpeter swans, eagles, snowy owls. </p>
<p>Big animals need lots of food, so their presence in the north tells a tale.</p>
<p>Even the mosquitoes and flies get into the act. There are huge black swarms of them at times, and in certain places.</p>

<p>For an enterprising and hungry animal, the north is a table full of food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’re basically chasing new sources of food. If they stayed in one place all the time they would eat all of the bugs/fish/algae/etc. and their population would experience a die off due to lack of food. By continually moving North and South during the year they eat a little here, once things get scarce they move along, and by the time they return to that area their food supply has replenished. They also have breeding grounds they return to for nesting, and they stick around there long enough to hatch their eggs and get their offspring mobile before beginning another migration. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In Rochester, MN there's a man-made lake called Silver Lake. It stays warm all year round, and the town ended up with <a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/121512/Daniel%20Eckberg%20Thesis%20sp10.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">a resident population of huge Canada geese</a> who decided it wasn't worth migrating.</p>
<p>Then there's the grackle population of Texas. They're supposed to be migratory birds, but huge flocks of them hang out near the grocery stores of Dallas and Austin all year round.</p>
<p>So it's a tradeoff birds make depending on specific circumstances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If all of the birds stayed near the equator, then eventually they would have to compete for food and other resources (which means less chance of survival). One of my favorite teachers explained evolution as always &quot;following the path of least resistance&quot; meaning that if a species exhibits some extremely strange behavior, it is because survival was harder the other way<em>. So even though migration is taxing on the birds that go south, it would be even harder for them to survive if they tried to stick around all winter.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is what someone said on another thread:</p>
<p>There's a phenomenon called 'osmosis' which plays its role here.
When two different liquids with different concentrations are separated by a semipermeable membrane (the one that allows one-way flow only), the liquids would flow in such a way that they attain a state of equilibrium, i.e. now the concentration of both the liquids is same.
The bacteria which cause the sore throat also have their skin similar to a semipermeable membrane. When you gargle with salty water, the inner 'fluid' of bacteria (which makes them live, in a literal sense) oozes out (in order to equalize the concentrations of these fluids-salt water and bacterial body fluid). This kills the bacteria and their 'active fluid' is washed away when you gulf-out the liquid. Thus they loose their dominance on the sore throat and you feel relaxed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Even if salt did kill bacterias or viruses it wouldn't help to immediatly relieve the pain a sore throat causes.

<p>If you recall the Circle of Fifths, it is based on the fact that going up 12 perfect fifths is the very nearly the same as 7 octaves.  But very nearly is not exactly.</p>
<p>When tuning an instrument, you have two choices, make all fifths a little off, or make some exact and some way off.  Many tuning strategies go for the second option, and music written for them simply avoids the using the bad fifths.  One, in particular, makes 11 of the 12 fifths good, and the 12th really bad.  That fifth is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mean5th_Wolf_5th.ogg" target="_blank">wolf fifth</a> because the binaural beats it produces warbles, to some people at least, like a howling wolf.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>p4 p4 p4 M3 p4</p>
<p>p4 = Perfect 4th; M3 = Major 3rd</p>
<p>String instruments like Ukulele and Bouzouki often have the same top 4 strings (p4 M3 p4)</p>
<p>The upright bass is tuned similarly to the bottom strings (p4 p4 p4)</p>
<p>So the guitar, with its 6 strings, is kind of like a mashup of the tuning systems of these 4-stringed instruments. It's really good for playing bass notes on the low strings because each string has a different note. The high strings are good for playing melodies on because the intervals are close together, and varied. </p>
<p>There are other tunings that are good for this, like Orkney tuning, but Standard is probably more versatile for open and barre chords.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is pretty much impossible to melt wood. The reason is that as you start heading the wood up, its constituent building blocks tend to break up before the material can melt. This behavior is due to the fact that wood is made up of a strong network of cellulose fibers connected by a lignin mesh. You would need to add <em>a lot</em> of energy to allow the cellulose fibers to be able to easily slide past each other in order to create a molten state. On the other hand, there are plenty of other reactions that can kick in first as you transfer heat to the material.</p>
<p>If you have oxygen around you one key reactions is of course combustion. But even in the absence of oxygen there are plenty of reactions that will break up the material at the molecular level. The umbrella term for all of these messy reactions driven by heat is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis" target="_blank">pyrolysis.</a></p>

<p>&quot;At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2 MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330 °C or 7,820 °F), so it sublimes at about 3,900 K.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is many different types of smoke detectors out there. Some can't see the difference between smoke and steam, but the more complex ones does a good job of separating the two.</p>
<p>The ones I use at work now is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>optical. (Think LED in one end of chamber and a photo-resistor in the other end. Mesures the amount of light that get through.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>double optical and thermal. (Uses two different angels on the chamber for the optical part to guesstimate the difference in smoke and steam based on different reflections.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optical / thermal / gas. (Reads Co2. Works like a champ in theaters, clubs etc. that uses theatrical smoke on stage.)</p>
</li>
<li>only thermal. (Works on the principle of fire is hot. Heat rises and sets of the detector at a set temperature or if the temperature is rising very fast.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Double optical is very good at separating steam and smoke. (Use it in kitchens and locker rooms close too the showers. No problem with false alarms.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The smoke detector works by having a small tube open to the air. At one end of the tube is a radioactive material, at the other is a radiation detector. Smoke gets into the tube and absorbs the radiation, causing the alarm to go off. Steam can certainly do the same thing, but it may be less effective as the steam could absorb less radiation or condense before entering the tube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear warheads fitted to ICBM's and SLBM's are not really warheads in the same sense as an artillery round. They are in fact a small and complex machine fitted inside a heat resistant and aerodynamic shell. It might be easier to think of them as miniature spacecraft. One nuclear missile will carry several warheads and they will seperate to attack different targets or the same target multiple times. These are called MIRV or Multiple Independent Re-Entry Vehicle.</p>
<p>Because they are basically machines, they are designed to be taken apart and maintained. The pit or the nuclear element of the warhead is just one component. It can be removed and in fact very often is removed from the warhead for things like testing (Where it is replaced by an inert device) and routine maintenance.</p>
<p>The decommissioning process varies depending on the terms of the treaty. In some cases it is simply a case of reducing the number of MIRV's the missile carries say from 12 to 8. If physical removal is required it is a case of removing the nuclear element of the warhead and putting it into storage or use as a fuel, while recycling or destroying the components of the MIRV. The missiles themselves are rarely destroyed in entirety, they or their components often have useful secondary peaceful applications.</p>
<p>There are a number of common misconceptions about ICBM's, SLBM's and nuclear warheads and their MIRV delivery system. One is that their guidance components use GPS to guide them into their targets. This is in fact not true. These missiles must reach their target and relying on GPS might harm their chances of that happening if the GPS system where to be attacked. So the majority of ICBM/SLBM use celestial navigation (The positions of the stars) to guide them into their targets. They don't have to be super accurate. A circular error of probability of half a mile is acceptable. Russian missiles used to have massive payloads to make up for their less accurate guidance systems. It really doesn't matter if your off target by 3 miles if you ramp up the explosive power by 10 megatons! For this reason you will often see US missiles use smaller warheads than their russian counterparts.</p>
<p>Another common misconception is that the warheads have some communication component that offers an ability to communicate with it after launch and give a recall or cancellation ability, so if a missile is fired in some sort of accidental launch scenario it can be communicated with and made inert or to blow itself up without going nuclear. This is also not true and is a myth perpetrated by Hollywood. The risks of an enemy finding out how to communicate with the missile and destroy it would be too great. These weapons are designed to be the ultimate and last deterrent. The missile, once fired, communicates with nothing and no-one. It is a self contained system that once the button has been pressed, will carry out it's mission to it's final horrifying end unless it is somehow intercepted externally.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: Clarified decommissioning process and celestial navigation and the fact I may not have mentioned inertial guidance clearly enough. To clarify the correct term is astro-inertial guidance in that the &quot;majority&quot; of ICBM's and SLBM's (Lest we not forget the US developed versions are not the only types of these horrific weapons) use both, with inertial guidance being responsible for initial and re-entry guidance and celestial for mid course correction. </p>
<p>So celestial navigation is the tracking of your position by looking at where you are in relation to the stars, because where you are and the time of day defines what you can see and where they should be in the night sky. It's not an overly complex skill and we have been doing it for a very long time. It's kind of fallen out of use in these days of GPS. Ships at sea would use a sextant to help them plot their position relative to the time of the day and the position of the stars which was why getting accurate clocks on board ships was such a big deal many years ago. In fact the earliest Boeing 747 aircraft had a porthole in their cockpit roofs to allow the crew to use celestial navigation should the need arise!</p>
<p>Obviously celestial navigation is of more use at night and in good weather if your on the ground, but ICBM's and SLBM's don't need to worry about this as within the space of about 30 seconds they are high enough to begin using it without either of these concerns as they use inertial guidance in their initial launch. The missile and MIRV's basically have a digital version of a sextant on board. If you would like to see a vaguely similar approximation of how they work, I suggest you download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Sky app (Formerly Google Sky)</a>, which allows you to use your phone to plot the stars in the sky (Though Google augments this with GPS data so they cheat a little bit).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are really two issues here. One is the dismantling — taking things apart. The other is verification — proving to the other party or parties that you did really take things apart, and aren't just lying about it. The latter is just as important for treaties as the former.</p>
<p>As for taking them apart, it is neither as easy nor as hard as one might imagine. Nuclear warheads, and nuclear missiles, and nuclear silos, are all just complex machines. They have many parts. They were not built with the intention of making it easy to take them apart (it isn't just a matter of using a screwdriver), but you can take them apart. Nuclear warheads are disassembled in &quot;<a href="http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gravel-gertie.jpg" target="_blank">gravel gertie</a>&quot; containment bays that make it so that if something goes seriously wrong — e.g., their high explosives detonate — contamination will be limited (gravel will collapse onto it, holding in any scattered plutonium, etc.). The missiles themselves can be de-fueled and then disassembled in pieces. It isn't significantly different than deconstructing any other device that contains some dangerous or toxic parts. The warhead is probably the most difficult thing to take apart because it contains toxic, radioactive, and volatile (explosive) components, but they develop procedures for doing it and have been doing it for years.</p>
<p>OK, so how do you verify that you've done it? Most treaties focus only on the disassembly of delivery vehicles, e.g., the planes, missiles, or submarines. Proving you took those apart is relatively straightforward: they are large enough to be seen by satellites so you can just destroy the thing in question in a relatively &quot;public way.&quot; For airplanes this is particularly striking: the <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01583/planes-big_1583925a.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;boneyards&quot;</a> of retired planes, which are just rusting outside, some of which have been &quot;guillotined&quot; with massive blades. Submarines can be taken apart in dry dock, silos can be decommissioned and destroyed, etc. Each &quot;side&quot; has people whose job it is to count up such activities, and so you can get a pretty good tally of what each side has or hasn't. In a world of ubiquitous satellite coverage, you just don't have states being able to field large numbers of ICBMs or even submarines without it being noticed.</p>
<p>None of the treaties currently limit the number of total warheads in a stockpile (they limit the number of <em>deployed</em> warheads which is more a question of delivery vehicles than actual warheads). The question of &quot;counting warheads&quot; actually presents really tricky technical aspects that have been recognized for some time. The US and Russia are not willing to share information on how their warheads work with one another. If they were, it would just be a matter of disassembling the warhead while someone else watched. Because they want to keep it secret, all sorts of counting problems are involved. Let's say I am monitoring Russian warhead dismantlement. They show me a box and say, &quot;there's a warhead in there.&quot; They take it inside their dismantlement facility, then say they took it apart. They might show me another set of boxes and say, &quot;here are the parts from that warhead.&quot; How do I know that any of that is true? How do I know the box isn't just filled with lead? How do I know they haven't just squirreled the warhead out the back of the facility? </p>
<p>There aren't easy answers here. There are some interesting technical approaches to being able to verify that the box contains a warhead without learning anything about the warhead's design. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-virtues-of-nuclear-ignorance" target="_blank">You can read about some of them here if you are interested in more details</a>, but they are essentially similar to creating a &quot;one-way hash&quot; of a 3D, physical object, e.g., something that lets you verify it is &quot;X&quot; without being able to see what the &quot;X&quot; actually is on the inside. </p>
<p>It is not clear we will ever have treaties that put firm limits on warhead counts, it is not clear it is even necessary (if you can't deliver the warhead, who cares?), but the work is being done under the assumption that maybe, someday, there will be political will to do such a thing, and if that day comes, it would be nice to have worked out all of the technical aspects ahead of time, so they don't become a stumbling block.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplifying what others have said;</p>
<p>1) remove component warhead parts and break down further. The radioactive material is often reprocessed into the nuclear power industry.</p>
<p>2) remove fuel component from missile. Liquid fuelled missiles are typically only fuelled just prior to launch. Solid fuel missiles are a little more complicated. Rocket fuel can be rather toxic depending upon the type.</p>
<p>3) missile body is then often cut up and left exposed to satellite observation, or observers from the opposite side of the treaty are there watching the destruction processes. Sometimes both.</p>
<p>4) the silos/ mobile launchers can also be destroyed depending upon the treaty. Observers &amp; satellites monitor this.</p>
<p>When Kazakhstan became nuclear free the US and Russians were present on the ground. The warheads went back to Russia and monitored into the nuclear fuel industry. The silos were systemically destroyed, with additional work undertaken every ~6 months. I have photos of several of the Kazak silos going through phased destruction back in the mid to late '90's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Making it very short, they're handled in two ways:</p>
<p>First, the warheads are removed and stored at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. Specifically, in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/35°02'25.0%22N+106°36'33.0%22W/@35.0105695,-106.5507132,955m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d35.040278!4d-106.609167?hl=en" target="_blank">this massive bunker.</a> Fun fact: they're not really dismantled for the most part, they just sit in cold storage under observation.</p>
<p>Next, the delivery system (missile, bomb, cruise missile, airplane, etc.) are destroyed in a way that makes them impossible to reuse. Airplanes get cut in half — like <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PBDjAe3b57P2" target="_blank">these ones</a>, in Arizona. Missile launch positions get blown up or filled with concrete.</p>
<p>Finally, the warheads are trucked to Texas. Disassembly occurs in a plant there. Once the batteries are disconnected, a nuclear weapon is basically impossible to set off, and becomes much easier to disassemble. The conventional explosives are separated from the nuclear components. Most of the parts are simply stored separately, as they're specialized enough to be incredibly useful to say, a rogue state looking for more information on how to construct a weapon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a rule of thumb, if it bleeds, then it can heal to some degree. Also, tissues in the body generally heal using the same four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hemostasis. It is bleeding and the body sends stuff to stop the bleeding.</li>
<li>Inflammation. The body is in alert mode and sends stuff to the injury that will stop infection, clean up junk in the injured area, and generally kickstart the healing process. Without this stage, healing doesn't happen, so in the short term inflammation is a good thing.</li>
<li>Proliferation. Basically the stage when the body lays down the raw materials for the injured area to heal. Lots of collagen gets layed down here. If you snip a rubber band partially and keep pulling on it, it will continue to tear. If you somehow connect the torn edges, the tearing stops because the force on the uninjured tissue is reduced. Similar to what is going on here. </li>
<li>Maturation. This is the fine tuning stage. Cells that don't need to be there anymore go away or die. The collagen gets stronger by getting aligned with the lines of tension. </li>
</ol>
<p>Bones heal as strong as they were before the injury because your body lays down new bone. However, it can take a long time for bones to get back to full strength because of the structure of the newly laid bone. Your body is always breaking down bone and building it up to some extent, so it takes time for it to remodel into the strongest structure. Remember though, if it doesn't bleed it usually doesn't heal well, so there are some commonly fractured bones that don't heal well and often require surgical intervention.</p>
<p>Ligaments usually don't have good blood supply, so they don't heal particularly well.</p>
<p>Muscle has very good blood supply, so it bleeds when injured (this is why you often see bruising after significant strains). However, your body doesn't lay down new muscle tissue where the injury occurred. Instead, it lays down collagen in a fairly unorganized way. So at first during healing, the healing tissue is still very weak. As time passes, the new collagen changes into a more organized structure that aligns better with the line of pull of the muscle. When it is aligned better, it is stronger. Previously injured muscle won't be as strong as uninjured muscle (all other factors being kept the same)</p>
<p>Tendon is similar to muscle, except a bit less blood supply. All of the same mechanisms of healing apply still. Injured tendon will also not be able to take as much load as uninjured tendon (all other factors being kept the same)</p>
<p>Skin follows the rules as well. Generally it won't be as strong as before either. </p>
<p>Now, when we talk about &quot;strength&quot; I'm not talking about how much weight it can move. I am talking about how much load it can take. Muscles, tendons, and ligaments generally are injured through high tensile loading (like pulling a rubber band apart). So when I say they aren't as strong as before I mean they can't be pulled on as hard as before or they will reinjure. It is still possible for someone with an injured muscle or tendon to physically be able to move more weight than before their injury because they can continue to train the healthy tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>So there are two different principles at work here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When you use a muscle or a bone you are using actin-myosin proteins which help with the strength of a muscle contraction. When you use them however you &quot;break them&quot; and your body recruits builds new ones. It will build them such that they won't &quot;break&quot; under the same amount of force the next time you use them. That's what is meant by &quot;tearing/breaking&quot; your muscles during usage. There is no actual tissue tearing.</p>
</li>
<li>When you have tissue damage in skeletal muscle and connective tissue there is actual tissue damage. Skeletal muscle are actually cells so I'll talk about them (since connective tissue isn't actually majorly comprised of cells). Skeletal muscle is known as a &quot;permanent&quot; tissue, so it can't regenerate, i.e the cells cant replacement themselves back to their normal levels. Instead your body &quot;repairs&quot; them by putting in new fibrous scar tissue. Which isn't as strong as the old muscle and doesn't have the same contraction ability.</li>

<p>Hope that helps, I know this is ELI5 and this is the best I could do without going into more detail. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we put this all into the context of pathological damage, muscle tearing (aka muscle strains), are actually detrimental to muscle function over time. Whereas bone breaks are repaired using the same materials they are originally made of (the organization of mineral deposits, calcium, phosphorus ect.), they get stronger due to the bone callus that forms over a typical fracture. When we injure muscle, tendon, or ligament, you are repairing that damaged tissue with a lesser material, scar tissue. Scar tissue is weaker than the tissues it is meant to repair, because of their different organization of tensile fibers. A muscle full of scar tissue has reduced function, whereas resistance training does not cause scar tissue accumulation, to a similar degree as muscle strains. Same rule applies to tendons and ligaments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
