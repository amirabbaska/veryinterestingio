Really, the question of qualia (which is the technical term for what you're asking) is only one step removed from the question of solipsism, which is the belief that you are the only consciousness in the universe and everyone else is a mere unconscious automaton (to put it in one more tangible version of the theory).</p>
<p>Another fun thought experiment in the same vein is whether a rock is actually hard or whether it is soft until the moment you touch it, when it instantaneously becomes hard (alternatively, maybe the rock is the shiniest object in the world until light hits it, when it becomes matte). Both of these thought experiments are unfalsifiable because regardless of whether either statement is true or not it has no practical effect on the world: the world and its function are identical in a universe where either possibility is true.</p>
<p>To put it back into the realm of qualia: so long as we both agree that the big red button is red, it is irrelevant whether your red is the same as my red.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/TRRS-Wiring-Diagram-300x224.png" target="_blank">Here's a diagram of a TRRS audio jack</a>. You'll see that the connector is divided (separated by insulators into distinct conducting strips). The reason this is called a TRRS audio jack is that it's broken into 4 different conducting strips, called Tip, Ring, Ring, Sleeve. There are also TRRRS jacks which have an extra ring and thus 5 conducting strips in total.</p>
<p>To do mono audio, you need 2 conducting strips (audio + ground). To do stereo audio, you need 3 conducting strips (left audio + right audio + ground). If you have 4 or more conducting strips, then you can have stereo audio plus some other form of communication. The diagram I linked to you has the 4th strip be a microphone, but some smartphones will use the 4th conducting strip to send control information such as &quot;pause&quot; and &quot;play&quot; commands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there's no one standard for how TRRS and TRRRS jacks are used. Different devices and different headphones will make different (incompatible) decisions on what to do with the extra strips. If you're going to buy headphones with a TRRS or TRRRS connector, you just have to check beforehand whether it's coincidentally going to be compatible with your phone.</p>
<p>The most common protocol used by phones is called CTIA<del>or OMTP</del>. (Edit: upon further research, CTIA and OMTP are 2 different standards, but seem to be largely compatible in this area). It's defined by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. Note that other audio and video equipment will use the same jacks but be electrically incompatible in the higher rings of the jack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They were using the DC component one of the lines to draw power for a tiny chip mounted behind the headphone line buttons, and when a button is pressed, the button-side chip sends a high frequency signal back down the audio line which is detected by another chip in the phone.  The high frequency is well above human hearing limits, like in the 100KHz range.  Different buttons send different tones.  When those tones are detected by the chip in the phone it sends the requests to be processed by the phone processor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am going to assume you are talking about a magnetic confinement fusion reactor, in which the fusion happens in a plasma that is contained by strong magnetic fields.</p>
<p>If the superconducting magnets that maintain the magnetic fields suddenly stop being superconducting (a condition known as quench, which is very bad for the magnets), then the magnetic field will weaken or break down completely. This allows the plasma to expand, lowering temperature and pressure, and likely already stopping the fusion reaction.</p>
<p>Moments later, the plasma starts to collide with the inner wall of the fusion reactor, cooling down even more rapidly now that it is in contact with it - and also ruining the wall, and potentially burning a hole into it to destroy other parts of the reactor.</p>
<p>Result: One ruined fusion reactor, plus if there is a burnthrough possibly deuterium and tritium (or rather, after combustion with air, heavy and superheavy water vapor) and helium being vented to the outside.</p>
<p>The thing is, a fusion reactor going out of control is a lot less dangerous than a fission reactor doing the same, because it needs a lot of effort and control to even get the fusion reaction to happen - fission, on the other hand, happens basically on its own once you have enough fissile material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it would just turn off. fusion reactors are banging together hydrogen to create helium, and that isn't something that can happen by itself the way fission can. there's no chain reaction. if the conditions inside the reactor change significantly, it simply stops doing fusion.</p>
<p>a more theatrical failure would be a loss of containment. the stuff inside the reactor is so hot that it would destroy literally anything it came in contact with, so the reaction materials have to be held by an electromagnetic field. if that field fails, all of the super hot stuff just spreads out, obliterating whatever it touches until it cools down. since the contents of the reactor are only a few grams (for perspective, a paperclip is about 1 gram), this isn't threatening to the outside world. it could destroy the very expensive equipment used to create the reaction chamber, but not much else. </p>
<p>somewhat amusingly, the equipment used to create the reaction is more dangerous than the reaction itself. enormously powerful electromagnets, high pressure hydrogen, power systems measured in <em>trillions</em> of watts. these systems could fail, and you would have a more conventional industrial disaster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic Confinement:
The reason why fusion reaction doesn't work (currently) is because they are unstable. So being stable is necessary to make them work.</p>
<p>Stars:
For stars the opposite is true, stars maintain their stability by their fusion. When they start to fail gravity takes over and eventually the star collapses in on itself and this causes the star to go supernova (explodes).</p>
<p>Difference:
The reason for the difference is that in magnetic confinement, the fusion is a result of the extreme squeezing force of the magnetic fields. The hydrogen is crushed to the point of fusion. If the confinement fails, the hydrogen is no longer under the massive crush of the magnetic fields and therefore can no longer fuse.</p>
<p>In a star the fusion is the result of the massive crushing force of gravity. The gravity is so massive because of the huge amount of hydrogen. As the hydrogen fuses it throws off massive amounts of energy which tends to counteract the gravity, therefore at a certain point the outward flow of energy(photons etc) balances the inward pressure of gravity. If the fuel starts to burn out, the pressure of the gravity increases until it reaches a point where it reignites in a massive explosion.</p>
<p>Note:
There are other ways for fusion to occur. The above only applies to man made magnetic confinement and stars and even then they are not the only factors involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Supreme Court discusses this rationale in every exclusionary case. </p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that the Constitution does not require an exclusionary rule. But for the 4th Amendment to have any value it must have some remedy or mechanism of enforcement. </p>
<p>Suing the officials for an illegal search is always an option. But the cards are stacked against the defendant, who is probably already busy defending himself in a criminal trial. Further, agents of the state are a big target to take on for a private individual. If private citizens are left with the sole burden of enforcing an important Constitutional right, that right may effectively disappear. </p>
<p>The alternative, and the one the Court considered most likely to deter illegal searches, is to cut off the reward. An illegal search practice = inadmissible. </p>
<p>BUT, since the Constitution does not require the exclusionary rule, and since it more often than not lets a guilty person go when applied, the rule is only to be applied when the deterrent effect outweighs the cost to society. </p>

<p>Another way to look at it is that if the officer was willing to break the law to get the evidence, who's to say they weren't willing to break the law and fake the evidence? This all follows from the idea that it's better to let a guilty person walk free than to put an innocent person in jail - and if you disagree with that, imagine if you're the innocent person. No, really, think it through, for a few hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it can create the issue of law enforcement basically going &quot;eh, it's worth it&quot;, deciding that a conviction is worth the fines or whatever penalties come from ignoring proper procedure to obtain evidence if it's going to be valid. Especially since law enforcement has a hard time getting prosecuted to begin with. It's there to ensure that due process is adhered to.</p>
<p>It's the same rationale as shady companies doing something that would still be profitable even after they get hit by a fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/law180 provides a good answer. Another factor to consider, assuming you are not talking about a civil remedy is that the very law enforcement officials who just violated the Constitution would then be responsible for prosecuting themselves. So under your question Officer Adam decides to do an illegal search because he's really really sure that criminal Bob has heroin in his house. Officer Adam finds heroin and takes the evidence to prosecuter Charlene. Charlene is now expected to file charges against both Officer Adam and criminal Bob, because both of them broke the law? As a practical matter prosecutor Charlene is unlikely to vigorously pursue charges against officer Adam,  and even if she did neither judge Denise nor the jury members Ed, Elmer, Elizabeth, Ellen, and so on would probably convict him.</p>
<p>Meaning that in the absence of the exclusionary rule there is nothing to prevent the government from willfully violating constitutional rights. And Rights are meaningless if they don't apply to everyone, but there's just no way a jury is going to convict a police officer for violating a child rapists' rights  if corners are cut to obtain a conviction. Because of that we must suffer the bad of letting criminals go in order to preserve the greater good of rights that have meaning, because the next time a corner  is cut it might not be for someone as &quot;obviously bad&quot; as a child rapist but is instead someone who for example says bad things about the president online. Do we want the world to be one heading down that slippery slope? it is a hard rule, but it keeps our police at least marginally honest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers here seem to be focused on the United States, but for those interested, illegally obtained evidence can be submitted in several jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In the UK for example, illegally obtained evidence only need be excluded where it would preclude the notion of a fair trial (s78(1) Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984). This allows the judge to assess the evidence before the trial begins, and provides him with the ability to exclude illegally obtained evidence on consideration of a fair trial.</p>
<p>More recently, UK courts have held that illegal actions by state agents such as the police may invalidate the prosecution of an individual. Specifically, in cases of entrapment, courts have held that undercover police officers entrapping individuals can constitute an abuse of process, allowing the judge to declare a stay of proceedings, see R v Loosely [2001]. I believe the UK approach is similar to the approach taken in Canada.</p>
<p>On your second point, UK courts haven't shown particular interest in prosecuting individual officers for illegal searches or obtaining evidence illegally as English courts generally pay due deference to the police in their efforts in fighting crime. UK courts seem to recognise that undercover operations and slightly off-the-books practices are becoming increasingly important in combatting terrorism and organised crime, and as long as there is process which prevents the prosecution of defendants where there has been an abuse of process, courts are happy to let the police take the initiative on counter-crime tactics (mostly).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In addition, more humid air can transport its temperature better and more humid air smells more. That's why dogs can smell stuff better on rainy days. The CO2 level is not noticeable different. There was a video about a guy in a chamber where they lowered the oxygen level slowly. And the guy had to put a oxygen mask on when he notices. He didn't notice anything.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our research group has been involved on matters of indoor air quality for many years now. There are two main aspects to consider in answering your question:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is only one air! That means, all the atmosphere and all indoor spaces are connected and, with the exclusion of very special airtight spaces, in general you have to assume that there are continuous exchanges of air between indoors and outdoors. This justifies other peoples' answers here. The bulk general composition of the air will be the same (nitrogen and oxygen, mainly).</p>
</li>
<li>Despite the above, there are many more compounds and components in the air that have a very important role in both the perception of 'freshness' and the potential health impacts of being in contact with the air. Apart from things like humidity (i.e. water in gas form, dissolved in the air) and CO2, the large majority of the other compounds are cumulatively known as 'air pollutants', regardless of being harmful or not to humans. Even though these are generally present in small amounts/concentrations, frequently measured in 'parts per million' (ppm) or even smaller measuring units, they can still be perceived by people in multiple ways, be it by smell, 'staleness', lung and eye irritation, allergies, etc..</li>
</ol>
<p>The World Health Organisation has established a list of <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/128169/e94535.pdf" target="_blank">particularly relevant indoor air pollutants</a> that we should take special care about. For instance, one important pollutant is nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which originates from high-temperature combustion processes such as internal combustion engines in our cars, trucks, etc. Despite originating mainly outdoors, NO2 can still be problematic indoors, particularly in urban areas, because air will get in the house from the outside bringing with it its air pollutants. These will then be added to the pollutants that originate indoors, be it from people (yes, we emit a number of so called bioeffluents!), cooking, cleaning products, air-fresheners, perfumes, construction materials, furniture, and many other human activities. There are literally thousands of chemicals around us all the time, but the probability of these being present in higher concentrations indoors is higher due to an accumulation effect. This will only be exacerbated in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.</p>
<p>Regarding CO2, the average world level has now gone above the 400 ppm mark and levels indoors can frequently climb to over 1000 ppm. While this is not damaging to health, it is generally a good indicator of deficient ventilation in regards to a space occupancy. The main sources of CO2 indoors are people. You need a minimum amount of air renovation to dilute their exhaled CO2 along with many of the other bioeffluents. If CO2 levels are too high, then it is likely that you will also have high levels of many other compounds which will make the air feel heavy. The perception is particularly intense when someone comes into a room with these high levels. People in the space will generally not notice the gradual degradation of air quality in the space.</p>
<p>Note that in many cities outdoor air quality can become very poor at times. Some Chinese and Indian cities have been particularly hit these past few years. In these cases, it is actually better for your health to stay inside and try to keep outdoor pollutants from getting in (i.e. do not open windows and refrain from opening doors too often). I have also read about the health impacts of going for a run or cycling in urban streets. When you exercise you inhale a lot more air and if you are doing it close to the tailpipes of cars and trucks, you will be absorbing very high loads of pollutants through your lungs. At the end of your exercise, you might actually have damaged more your health from breathing bad quality air than what you gained from exercising.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>An orgasm is, partly, an uncontrolled muscular spasm. By tensing up your legs, you're tensing up other things, and by other things, I mean your ass, since it's hard not to when you're tensing your thighs.</p>
<p>When you tense up your ass, you also tense up everything in the general pelvic area, including the muscles involved in the orgasm. In this way, you're helping those muscles reach the point of necessary release faster than they would on their own, leading to a quicker pay-off.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measurements of G are affected by a large uncertainty ultimately because gravity is very weak.</p>
<p>You would think it would be fairly easy to extract an estimate of G from orbital dynamics. However, all gravitational effects from a body of mass M are proportional to the combination μ = MG, the standard gravitational parameter. The μ of a celestial body is very easy to determine once you can measure orbits around it (or, if you're lucky enough to be standing on it, the surface gravity), and indeed the μ of most solar system objects is known to great precision. </p>
<p>However, to extract an estimate of G from μ you'd have to divide by M... and you don't know M. We do not have very precise independent estimates of the masses of planet and stars. The G extracted from this method has a relatively huge error.</p>
<p>Thus G can only be measured through the gravitational effects of <em>prepared</em> bodies with well known masses, which need to be much smaller than planets. So you are now measuring extremely weak gravitational fields generated by man-made objects in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment" target="_blank">Cavendish</a>-like experiments. This gives a more precise estimate of G, but still with an error comparably larger than all of the other fundamental constants simply because of how small the forces to be measured are, and how hard it is to shield from noise.</p>
<p>Going back to the planets, G measured from Cavendish-style setups is the most precise determination, so you actually use <em>that</em> estimate to extract one for the masses of celestial bodies through M = μ/G. That's how you get the known figures for the masses of the Earth, Sun, etc.</p>
<p>For contrast, hbar is known to definitely better precision because it can be determined directly through a variety of not-as-fragile experiments. An example (not necessarily the best) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_balance#Measurements" target="_blank">Watt balance</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measuring G is hard*. It's extremely weak, it can only be measured if you have first found the mass and distribution of <em>everything</em> you're working with, and even then, you're in danger of thinking you're measuring gravity when you're actually measuring magnetic interactions. Or static electricity. Or floor tilt. Regardless, you can do an experiment where <em>your</em> value of G look like it's accurate to, say, a few parts per million, but for some reason it doesn't match the value of other peoples' measurement of G. Since we don't know who is right, we have a very large uncertainty in our value.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When measuring hbar, you are working with point particles, something with an explicit position with relatively small errors. </p>
</li>
<li>When measuring G, you need a collection of point particles to obtain a detectable signal. Usually you use a sphere, which has symmetry which allows you to say it's an effective point particle with all of it's mass at the middle, but this is an imperfect assumption because your sphere is most likely imperfect. And here is the main point: <strong>Because you cannot prove your spherical mass is perfect EVEN if it is perfect, your uncertainty on its results are going to be bigger.</strong> You could literally measure G to its true value (whatever that may be)  to 100 decimal points, but you would never be able to believe your result well enough to express your value to as many decimal points as we know hbar. </li>

<p>Might be a dumb question, but it's bugging me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An excellent question in my opinion, or at least one I've wondered about on my own before. </p>
<p>There are a few ways to look at this, and it is often far more illuminating to see a problem from multiple sides so I will briefly talk through two lines of thinking.</p>
<p>The first is to consider the balance of energy; the motivation for your question is that the water molecules must have gained energy in order to move upwards. It is certainly true that the gravitational potential of the water+paper once the water has soaked upwards is higher than before, so this energy has come from somewhere.</p>
<p>The truth is that the total energy of the system clearly includes more than just the gravitational potential energy, it also includes the surface energy which is the energy inherent to the interface, the bonds, between two substances.  The easiest way to imagine surface energy is to consider a droplet, it is obvious that the bonds between water and water is stronger than water and air because otherwise water would not clump into a droplet, it would want to spread out, to maximize it's surface area in order to decrease the total energy of the state. This means that water-air has a high surface energy. This is not the case for the water-paper interface which is very low energy since the water molecules can have strong intermolecular forces with the molecules of the paper.</p>
<p>As such, our water wants to increase the amount of contact it has with the paper as it will be at lower energy but doing so increases it's gravitational energy so you reach a new equilibrium where the water will soak up the paper just far enough such that the increase in gravitational energy of the system is equal in magnitude to the decrease in the total surface energy.</p>
<p>Another way of exploring this is to consider the force of adhesion; if you have ever looked at a glass of water then you will notice that the fluid at the very edge clings to the side slightly, lifting the surface at the edges in opposition to the surface tension which wants to minimize the surface area. This is because the molecules of the glass have stronger bonds with the water than other molecules of water so they pull the edge of the liquid up slightly. This is another manifestation of the lower surface energy of the water-glass interface compared to the water-air interface.</p>
<p>If you had a narrow glass tube then you could imagine that around all sides the water is being pulled up. If we imagine a column of water being lifted, the extra gravitational potential will be proportional to the radius of the tube squared (pi * r^2 * h) and the adhesive force will proportional to the radius of the tube (2 * pi * r) then there will very clearly come a cross over point where, as you reduce r, the adhesive force overcomes the gravitational force.</p>
<p>This is the origin of the upwards force in a capillary tube and your paper, which essentially is entirely constructed of small channels, or tubes which water can flow through, also has a capillary force in it. Allowing it to suck up the water.</p>
<p>Hope that was interesting or at least answered your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Adhesion of water to the walls of a vessel will cause an upward force on the liquid at the edges and result in a meniscus which turns upward.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy for the water to go into the napkin is similar to the energy that dissolves sugar in a glass of water, the favorable between-molecule (aka intramolecular) interactions between the individual water molecules and the napkin molecules - which as long strands of carbohydrate cellulose. The energy for the water to go into the napkin also has to do with entropy - the statistical likelihood of distribution of matter as well as energy. Water has an uneven charge distribution because the oxygen atom has more of a pull on the electrons than the hydrogen atoms. This makes it have a net negative end and a net positive end - an electric dipole. Cellulose is made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen true to its name. It also has many dipoles. The oxygen-hydrogen motif lends to a relatively strongly interacting dipole called hydrogen bonding because of the magnitude of the electrical charge distribution difference.</p>
<p>Though water does indeed interact energetically favorably with itself due to these dipoles, it can also hydrogen bond with the cellulose fibers of a napkin which also contain oxygen-hydrogen patterns which are called &quot;-hydroxl&quot; groups. It is such that water-water interactions can be similar to the interaction between the water and the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. </p>
<p>But if it's similar in interaction and presumably about equal in intramolecular energy profiles then why does the water spread up the napkin? Our universe follows the law of increasing entropy. If you put a drop of dye in a glass of water, our intuition says that the drop of dye will spread through the glass with time. Things and energy tend to spread out. Like I mentioned before, this is terms entropy and it has an associated energy as well. </p>
<p>So let's do the reverse - getting water out of the napkin. You squash the napkin with your hand and the water boops out into a pool. Clearly you've put energy into the water-napkin system. Your hand energy broke up the water-hydroxyl intramolecular energy and got the water to go back to interacting with itself. If you leave the squashed napkin in the pool of booped water then the napkin probably won't reabsorb like it did unless it's a premium brand paper towel. What's different? </p>
<p>Well a new dry napkin doesn't have hydroxyl groups of the napkin interacting with each other, it's more fluffy so the hydroxyl groups interact with the air. When it's wet and squished however, the situation is changed - the hydroxyl groups of the napkin are probably interacting with other hydroxyl groups of the napkin with something resembling hydrogen bonding but probably not exactly like it as the oxygens and hydrogens won't be able to line up just right. So there's a reduction in bond energy here - the water isn't coming in and making new hydrogen bonding interactions anymore, it's coming in and breaking up hydrogen bonding style interactions to replace them with hydrogen bonding interactions - not as favorable. The smooshed together fibers also have less room for the water, so the water can't spread around as easily in an entropically favorable way. When the smooshed napkin dries it still has its fibers interacting with each other and so it can become kind of hard in texture. </p>
<p>Summary: The energy comes from water molecules interacting with the hydroxyl groups of the napkin which were previously interacting only with air, and from entropy - the universal law where things spread out (or assume the most probable microstates).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Horrible answers so far. Mortgage Loan Officer Here!</p>
<p>There are only two things (there's more, but that's getting into nitty gritty and this is ELI5) that determine how much money they will loan you, specifically for a mortgage.</p>
<p>1) Debt to Income Ratio. Take all of your monthly obligations THAT ARE REPORTED ON YOUR CREDIT REPORT (no your phone bill doesn't count as a debt. Yes, your car loan does), add them up together, and divide by your GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. That is your debt to income ratio (or DTI). Your DTI needs to stay, generally, under 45% for you to qualify for a Conventional mortgage. There are exceptions though, like if you have large cash reserves then we can increase the DTI threshold for you.</p>
<p>This all went into effect in 2010 through the Dodd-Frank Act and the Ability To Repay Rule (ATR).</p>
<p>2) Appraisal. Lenders will only loan you an amount for either the Appraisal or Sales Price, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>Those are the only two factors that influence the loan amount. Credit score has a role in it, but it's insignificant for ELI5 purposes. Credit score just influences the interest rate and there is a minimum credit score. However, someone with a 600 credit score can qualify for just as much as someone with an 800 credit score as long as they have the income for it.</p>
<p>Of course, there is much more to mortgages than just these three pieces, but this is the answer to your question for United States Mortgages.</p>
<p>Edit: I've been answering questions for a bit now. I need to get back to work. I'll answer more when I get home. In the mean time, I'd like to invite you all to check out /r/mortgages</p>
<p>Edit 2: Alright, I'm back to over 120+ messages and comments. I'll try to answer them all. Just know that I can't answer everything simply because they're too complex and would require me asking you for an entire cabinet of files to prove various things.

As a simple overview, the UK <em>generally</em> lends 4.25x your gross income as long as that is no more than 95% of the house value. If you earn £20k, we'll lend about 85k, so you need to put in about £4,500 of your own funds you can buy a house at just under 90k.</p>
<p>Due to new rules (refered to as MMR) we now also check how much money you'd have each month if your mortgage was charged at a high interest rate (normally 7%), after accounting for bills/creditcard/Loans. If it's below a certain amount, we'll decrease your lending amount until it fits the bank's threshold. </p>
<p>The less (as a percentage of the house value) that you put in yourself, the higher the risk to the bank, so the higher the rate you get charged. In the above example you'd likely be around the 5% mark. If we leant you the 85k, and you put in 85k of your own, the bank's risk is seen as much lower, so your rate would likely be around 1.5% instead. </p>
<p>Credit doesn't come in to the amount we'll lend to be honest. It's pretty much a pass/fail test, it doesn't say what we could safely lend you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the country. </p>
<p>Here in Norway the bank has a pretty easy way: They can only lend maximum 85% of total purchase sum, and no more than 5 annual salaries. And you should also be able to withstand a 5 point increase in interest rates. (i.e if the interest rate goes from say 3% to 8%) </p>
<p>So this means that you need a 15% down-payment, and can't borrow more than 5 times your annual salary. </p>
<p>Before the housing crash, the down-payment was lower. But the gov. figured out that by regulating the down-payment rate, they could save themselves from a disaster, and shield obviously underfunded people from buying property. </p>
<p>Thought I'd give you an perspective of how it works around the world. </p>
<p>edit: Also, you get 27% deduction on all the interest you pay. So that makes the loans a bit cheaper in the long run, and makes ownership even more appealing from the start, than renting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Man, American terminology is weird, &quot;debt to income&quot; ratio doesn't make sense to me the way you guys use it.  In Canada, we have debt service ratios (DSRs), which represents the amount of your gross monthly income that needs to be used to service your debts.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a Canadian perspective...</strong></p>
<p>There's three high-level considerations that need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>1) Will you make your payments?</strong>
We essentially consider income and credit.  If you have good credit (Beacon/FICO of high 600s and up), you will likely qualify for something.  From there, a lot of it comes down to DSRs.  There's a Gross DSR (GDSR) and a Total DSR (TDSR).  Your GDSR is calculated as your monthly housing costs (mortgage(s), property tax, strata fees, hydro) divided by your GROSS income (before tax).  TDSR is similar, but you include all of your debt obligations (housing + car payments + loan payments + CC payments, etc).  Generally, banks want GDSR &lt; 35% and TDSR &lt; 45% (but this can very a little by bank or if you're using an alternative lender).  Obviously your house price will be directly tied to this calculation, so there will be an inherent cap created here.</p>
<p><strong>2) Are we safe if you do not make your payments?</strong>
This comes down to the security, i.e. the value of the house.  On a purchase, typically loan-to-value (LTV) is capped at 95%, i.e. you need to put at least 5% down.  On a refinance or equity take-out (ETO), LTV is frequently capped at 80%.  So if you are purchasing, you will be limited to a mortgage equivalent to 19 (95 divided by 5) times your down payment (i.e. the house price can't exceed 20 times your down payment).</p>
<p><strong>3) Are the regulators okay with it?</strong>
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) has many different rules, but a common one has to do with LTV ratios.  They are particularly concerned about people with weak credit, self-employed, not citizens, or large home prices (in the millions... so a big deal in Toronto and Vancouver right now).  On those, the bank will generally limit mortgage amounts accordingly to stay compliant with the rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Firstly, you either have a sole or joint income to take into consideration. They will use your gross figure you earn. They will work out your monthly outgoings such as food, council tax, bills, childcare and anything that will remain once you have a mortgage. The bank will give you a decision in principle, a decision in principle is known as what indicative figure the bank will lend you. It can be up to 4.75x your income, it's dependant on lender and what their criteria is. You won't get credit searched for a DIP, it's soft scoring and won't leave a footprint say for a full credit search such as taking out a lending product.</p>
<p>Example: Mr A earns £20,000 per year.  In principle a bank could lend him 20k x 4.75= 95,000. The bank wouldn't normally provide a full 95,000 and you would contribute a deposit towards a property. The larger your deposit, the better for the loan to value ratio. The more deposit, the cheaper your mortgage will be in the long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
