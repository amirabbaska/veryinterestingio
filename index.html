		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, do you know how European cities have these amazing, elaborate tram and subway systems in the first place?<br />
We had the &quot;opportunity&quot; to completely restructre our cities, oh, about 70 odd years ago. Turns out, when pretty much all your city is obliterated after WW2, and you have to rebuild anyways, there is a lot of free space where you can stick those transportation systems.<br />
Basically, you did the demolition for us. All the building and zoneing people had to do was clear the rubble and now we have parks in inner cities, zoos near the city centres, and relatively broad roadways. Plus, the space-consumeing railways.<br />
American cities were, for the most part, never destroyed that completely. You had to integrate public transport into living cities, which is almost impossible to do. Construction takes that much longer and is therefore that much more expensive because you can only do it in increments.<br />
Plus, shutting down certain parts of the city can become nigh-impossible because they are major traffic arteries. And there is the matter of aquiring the property you need to do construction on or underneath. If anyone gets wind of the project the prices are going to rocket sky high.<br />
Plus, what good is it to maintain old tram systems, even when they are profitable, when they're just going to be stuck in the traffic created by the cars? The more cars became prelevant, the less useful the tram becomes. Therefore, you need either subway systems (tunneling) or some sort of monorail / a bridge system to get your tram around.<br />
And those are way more expensive to build than tram systems on the ground. See also: The problem of aquiring the land in a city that is already completely owned by a hundred thousand different people. Even those support beams have to stand on somebody's land.<br />
And every time you attempt to do these project, the prices are going to go up. Plus, no-one is happy to live next to the subway, right? Those property prices are going to plummet because of noise polution. So you always have the big-construction-problem of groups forming to protest your new railway plans. Possibly to the point of stonewaling you and voting you out of office before you can make significant progress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors listed here. One in cities like Houston, Texas is that it is massive and spread out. Houston is the 4th most populated city in the US and is a little larger than London at 1630 sq km, but has 25% of the population. People work far from where they live and have to commute all over the city. Light rail trains, buses, and high occupancy vehicle lanes cut down on the amount of vehicles on the road, but some drive distances/locations are not practical without allowing 2+ hours commute each way daily. </p>
<p>Downtown Houston is only about 50 feet above sea level, so underground subway systems are not practical. </p>
<p>Here is a quick guide to why the US sucks at public Transportation. </p>
<p>Largest cities in the world ranked by land area in sqKm                            </p>

<li>Miami                               2,891</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to get to 13th to find the 2nd city not in the US.             </p>
<p>We are the 3rd most populated country in the world but the 179th in population density. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People use cars for pretty much any journey in the US.  When I went there on business, I was asked by a colleague what I was doing for lunch and I said I'd probably pick up a sandwich from the supermarket which was less than 200 yards away across the office car park.  He asked me how I was getting there and I said walking and he was having none of that insisted on driving me there, all 20 seconds of the journey.  He seemed oblivious to the fact that it might be nice to get some fresh air.</p>
<p>Another day I thought about visiting a store which was about three miles away.  I do a lot of walking/hiking so it's a distance I walk regularly and I figured there'd be a route I could take to it and it would make a nice walk after being sat in an office all day.  Not a chance in hell.  I'd have to take a car to get there because of the road systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The American rail system is focused on shipping freight which it does very well.</p>
<p>Westward expansion took over a century which meant it was difficult to plan where new population centers would be cropping up in relation to the older cities.</p>
<p>Lobbying and scheming by motor companies to make America based around the car, the documentary <em>Taken for a Ride</em> does a good job covering this.</p>
<p>Many states are mostly rural areas which negates the usefulness of light rail somewhat.</p>

<p>LED or old school vacuum fluorescent: It uses less while blinking. Almost all of the power in a clock like this goes into the display because the display needs to emit light. You've never seen a battery powered LED clock because the batteries would last only a few days. Well, a blinking display is only lit up part of the time, so it's using basically no power during the times it's off. Hence, less power overall. </p>
<p>LCD: More power, but basically immeasurable. It does take a bit of power to make an LCD change state, and a bit of power to calculate when to do this, so it is technically more power. But it's probably like 0.01% more.</p>
<p>EDIT: LCD's are less too because they aren't bistable. See comments below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>When you choose Login via Facebook/Google/etc you are choosing them to prove your identity for you (because they already know you, you are registered there). The way Facebook/Google manages to prove your identity to XYZ depends on the protocol implemented behind the scenes (OAuth, OpenID)</li>
<li>By choosing Facebook/Google to prove your identity, you are knocking on their doors and asking them to give you a letter stating who you are and possibly a few more details about you. Before giving you the letter, you must prove that you are who you claim to be, then, Facebook/Google asks you to prove your identity at their door --&gt; using your username and password.</li>
<li>If your username and password are correct, Facebook/Google will issue the letter for you with a security feature like a watermark, something that makes the letter unable to be forged.</li>
<li>Then, you go back to XYZ, knock on its door, show the letter. XYZ examines the letter and because of the security feature, XYZ can confirm that your letter is valid and they let you in. (how XYZ knows Facebook/Google's security features is another story).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It uses a protocol called OAuth.  There are several different versions and <em>flows</em> of this protocol.  The most common version used by sites works something like this.</p>
<p>There are basically 3 different &quot;people&quot; in this transaction -- the User (i.e. you), the Authorizer (i.e. Facebook/Google/etc), and the Site.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You click the &quot;Login via Facebook/Google&quot; button for a particular site.  It creates a URL that redirects you to Facebook/Google.  That URL includes information about the Site and what type of information it wants from your Facebook/Google account (usually just your email, name, etc).  It also includes another URL that will redirect you back to the Site <em>after</em> you login to Facebook/Google and authorize the Site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You login to Facebook/Google and accept the authorization request.  Notice that only Facebook/Google is getting your login credentials.  You will be redirected back to the site with an <em>Authorization Code</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Site will use that <em>Authorization Code</em> to request an <em>Access Token</em> from the Authorizer that allows the Site to access your Facebook/Google account (but they will only have access to the information you authorized).  The Site has to pass along a <em>Secret</em> (basically, the master password for the Site) to get the token.  This ensures that no other Site can request authorization by pretending to be a different Site.   Basically, you've just created a second set of login credentials to your account, but it only works for that Site and has limited access to your account.</p>

You are not in fact giving your credentials to a random site, but instead, the random site is making an API call to google/facebook. and you then log in with a secure connection to your existing FB or google account. Then the google/fb API sends back the information that the site/application needs along with the successful login note and you are now allowed into the site/app.</p>
<p>Typically it only should need your name and email address, but once you authenticate, it usually gives you another little screen saying what information will be sent to them from your profile/account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's how this works in as close to ELI5: in order to set up logging in with Facebook, the site will first register with Facebook, and Facebook will verify and approve that the site is legit. Then Facebook will give some credential keys to your site that it can use to help users log in with their Facebook credentials. </p>
<p>When you click &quot;log in with Facebook&quot; on a site, that site will send a request to Facebook with the site's credentials asking to display a log in page. Usually, this will open a pop-up window with Facebook's login screen (or if you're already logged into Facebook, just an approval screen.) What's important here is that that pop-up window is owned by Facebook, not the site you're logging into. When you tell Facebook you want to allow the connection, Facebook will send some information about you (like your name and email) as well as a special token that will allow the site to request that information again in the future. Importantly, the site you are logging into doesn't get your credentials, they get some bits of information that you allow to be shared and a token that the site can use to get or send information to Facebook. </p>
<p>This process is more or less the same with every site, and Facebook is stricter in how they verify the 3rd party site than others. The reason sites want to do this is that people are usually too lazy to fill out sign up forms to create an account on a site, so that site wants to make it as easy as possible. Facebook wants to allow that because it gives them more data they can use to sell you stuff. In many cases, this process can be more secure than creating an account with a given site.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emotion is nature's decision-making tool.  We try to do things that make us feel positive emotions and we avoid things that make us feel negative emotions.  That's not even just a human thing; animals have emotions and use them to make decisions too!  The problem is that emotion isn't necessarily a <em>good</em> way to make decisions.  If you're smart, you can think of a better way.  For example, I don't feel like waking up early Monday morning and jumping in a metal container with dozens of other tightly-packed people in order to go sit in a chair somewhere downtown and do things other people want me to do, but as an intelligent organism, I know how to plan for the future: I know that if I stop doing this, I will no longer be able to live comfortably, eat what I want, etc.  While I'm still ultimately guided by emotion -- I know what will make me feel positive in the future -- I'm doing things that make me feel less positive <em>now</em>.  Less intelligent organisms don't have that particular capability for reasoning about their actions, but we humans do.</p>
<p>The thing is, the more intelligent we are, the more we can reason about our actions, and therefore, the less we need to rely on simple emotion to make our choices.  If we're intelligent, we understand consequences better, too.  For example, a 3-year-old will suffer negative emotion when his ice cream falls to the floor and will begin to cry.  A more intelligent adult, on the other hand, will only be mildly annoyed at this, because he understands that there will be more ice cream in the future, that he's fortunate to have been able to get ice cream in the first place, that the ice cream just doesn't matter that much compared to other aspects of his life like the fact that he has a loving family and steady income, etc.  (How do you make a 3-year-old cry?  Throw his ice cream on the ground.  How do you make an adult cry?  Kill his family.  Don't try this at home!)  Intelligence gives us a larger set of concerns to worry about, and this makes emotion less important.</p>
<p>Intelligent people still <em>have</em> emotion.  They just have enough perspective to be affected by it less.</p>
<p>That said, there are some people who are just not good at <em>understanding</em> emotion but are often good at certain other things: people with Asperger's.  There are a lot of factors here.  Being not so great at understanding emotion in others means that it's tougher to relate to people, so instead of relating to people, a person with Asperger's might spend time alone.  And what does one do alone that's actually worthwhile?  Learning, of course!  A person with Asperger's may notice that it feels bad to be rejected by peers but it feels good to learn new things in whatever subject, so he'll use his emotions -- which he <em>feels</em>, even if maybe he can't tell what other people are feeling -- and do the thing that gives him pleasure: learning.  As a result, everyone knows that one dude from grade school who's very smart but has no friends, and the stereotype spreads.  By the way, you don't need to have Asperger's to have trouble relating with peers; intelligent people often have trouble as well simply because their interests are different.  An especially intelligent person may be excited by learning new things in math, for example, while a more typical person may just not care about that.  That can make it hard to interact.</p>
<p>Finally, the idea that intelligent people are bad at emotional things also has roots in less intelligent people wanting to feel better about themselves by just making stuff up that sounds like it could be true.  &quot;I may not be as smart as Alice and Bob over there, but I'm obviously much better at emotion than they are, so SUCK IT, Alice and Bob!  YOU SUCK at emotion!  HA HA HA!  I'm better than you at something!  HA HA HA!&quot;  I'm only kind of exaggerating.  If you've been to high school, you probably know people who actually think like this, instinctively trying to find flaws in people who they see as &quot;better&quot; than them somehow, whether in terms of intelligence, athletic skill, appearance, social status, whatever.  (Hopefully they'll have grown out of that kind of pettiness by the time they're adults.)</p>
<p>In any case, very few people -- sociopaths, specifically -- actually have no emotion.  More intelligent people can be just as emotional as less intelligent people; they just don't make decisions on that basis as much because they have better ways to make those decisions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This perception likely derives from the fact that when you consider a person 'emotional', it's almost certainly because they have poor impulse control.</p>
<p>If someone is constantly flying off the handle, weeping over trivial slights, etc., then they're probably not able to maintain the kind of focus necessary to educate themselves and make decent life decisions.</p>
<p>It's not that intelligent people don't have emotions.  It's just that they don't let those emotions interfere with their lives in a negative way.</p>
<p>Note also that the opposite - true lack of emotions - can be a significant hindrance as well.  People who lack certain emotional responses can be socially isolated because the presumption 'everyone feels like X' simply don't apply to them - and this makes their actions seem curious or even insulting to others.  Emotions also drive us, so a lack of certain emotions can steal motivation.  You may hate the anxiety you feel, but you've probably never considered how much it drives you to succeed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I had to guess, it's because most of the displays of intelligence we see in our society are in professional, academic, or other formal settings. These situations tend to be fairly sterile in terms of emotion. For example, we all grew up in contact with teachers during our schooling. This might be one of the first situations we run across in our lives where we have a non-family interaction with someone who clearly has more knowledge and intelligence. A good teacher isn't going to be emotional most of the time; it just isn't part of the job. Emotions aren't part of the job for other interactions we might have with people who hold specialized knowledge. It's out of character to have a visit with an emotional doctor, or a consultation with an emotional lawyer, or get technical support from an emotional specialist, and so forth. Even a therapist - someone that works with emotions all day - isn't supposed to become emotional during his or her work. To do so would be considered unprofessional.</p>
<p>Emotions are only truly appropriate when you're with friends and family, and here intelligence really isn't so important - at least in my experience. Here, someone being very smart is something akin to someone being very strong. It's a characteristic, something to consider about a person when thinking about him or her as a whole. It's not their most important trait, just a quirk they have. The displays of intelligence you might see in these relationships aren't really clear to the observers because relationships are so subjective.</p>
<p>And so, maybe intelligence is associated with lack of emotion because roles where intelligence are needed also restrict emotions and relationships where emotions are free don't have much need for intelligence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The ability to regulate, manage, fake, and display emotions appropriate for a situation is known scientifically as [Emotional Intelligence (EI)]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence</a>).</p>
<p>Now, you're positing that there is a relationship between emotional intelligence and IQ, and so far, scientific studies have found <a href="https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/1647/is-there-a-correlation-between-eq-ei-and-iq" target="_blank">only low correlation</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question as I believe this is the exact opposite. And one should not mistake the fact of being able to control how emotions are shown and the fact of feeling those emotions inside.</p>
<p>Working with children with high IQ (to very high IQ) seems to show that they are overloaded with emotions.
See for instance <a href="http://sengifted.org/emotional-intensity-in-gifted-children/" target="_blank">this post</a> on gifted children. So how comes that intelligents children have high level of emotions and lost them when they becomes adults? </p>
<p>When growing up, they learn about controlling, detecting, using emotions. Which may seems as a lack of emotions. But the emotions are not lost.</p>
<p>To take a counter example, many artist (Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso for
Instance) are recognized as being very intelligents and able to express emotions in an incredible levels in their paintings. Many extremely intelligent songwriters are also able to express emotions in the song they write touching millions of people. Poet like Rimbaud are known to be extremely clever and has produced poetry with emotions that have marked many generations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think some of the answers here are missing some information.</p>
<p>Edit: Added TL;DR ELI5-like version at the bottom.
But a 5-year old that knows what tolerance and substance means should kinda understand some parts of these.</p>
<p>See the body is a complex chemical machine that does crazy stuff to stay balanced chemically all the time, so everything you eat it will react accordingly to keep levels of substances in the blood which that can maintain life.</p>
<p>You see you can usually classify substances you consume in let's say 3 categories.</p>
<p>1) Substances that can bind to existing receptors. Such substances are similar to existing hormones or neurotransmiters, say opiods, they bind to existing receptors. To these types of substances the body usually does two things 1) It lowers the production of the existing substance/substances in the body that is similar to the one you consume 2) It increases the resistance of the receptors.</p>
<p>Usually after such a substance binds to a receptor it is &quot;consumed&quot;/changed so it is either metabolized into stuff that is thrown away from the body or into parts that can be reused later. IF this wasn't the case then obviously you'd have an effect that lasts forever.</p>
<p>So for example if you took opiods your body will stop producing the same dose of existing feel good substances and also create resistance in the receptors, that's why you'd feel so awful after you stopped taking them. If you took steroids (in bodybuilding jargon, testosterone derivatives that is) for example your body will stop producing testosterone in itself, and after a while your testicles would shrink since they are no longer used as much.And if you stopped taking them you'd feel bad and it will take a long time to recover.</p>
<p>2)Types of substances that the body can digest/break up into other types of substances/destroy.</p>
<p>This ranges from most types of food, coffee, alcohol, types of poison/venom etc.</p>
<p>Edit: as msief has pointed out caffeine actually  binds to receptors. So drinking coffee  regularly will both increase tolerance of the receptors to the caffeine and also increase enzymes production that can break down coffee and remove it more efficiently from the blood.</p>
<p>This means that the body can simply produce more of an enzyme, or more antibodies to destroy/break down the substance.</p>
<p>This varies from person to person, some people for example are too sensitive to caffeine and might almost die from a couple cups of coffee while other can handle more.</p>
<p>But the basic idea is the body can just work harder to break the substance into parts that it can handle better. Of course this works up to a certain degree, since ingesting some substances means no matter how efficient your body gets at disposing of it, it will still have a big effect on it.</p>
<p>For example if you eat too much refined sugar, it's a great stress to the body since no matter how much insulin it produces there is up to a certain amount it can process in the blood.</p>
<p>In the case of things that are venomous or poisonous or just things our bodies can produce antibodies for, after an initial (non-lethal dose) your body will keep antibodies around for some time, anticipating further consumption/infection hence you maintain resistance for a while.</p>
<p>This resistance can range form hours to years, this is how vaccines work to a degree.</p>
<p>This is also how you can gain resistance to poisons or snake venom for example, our bodies already have the antibodies to neutralize them, or they can produce antibodies to neutralize a specific type of venom/poison but since it would be too energy consuming to keep all the antibodies types all the time, the body doesn't produce them until an infection. Unfortunately many types of venom will kill you faster than the body can produce the antibodies to fight it, but if you put a non-lethal dose the body will keep antibodies around for a while, anticipating further infection/foreign bodies, and if you increase the dose the body will produce even more and you can eventually survive a dose that would be lethal to the average person.</p>
<p>3) The last category are usually substance that aren't as organic and complex, like certain types of metal. So they have an effect on the body and the body can't really slow down their effect, just flush them out. Some of them can be flushed easily in urine, but others can bind to proteins or cells and remain there for years, so the body doesn't really know how to react to this.</p>
<p>Usually such substances are ones you aren't really supposed to consume or even have in your natural environment, like some pollution particles are the hardest to take out of the body and impossible to build a tolerance since your body has no way of resisting the effects of the substance, and maybe even no way of taking it out of the body or preventing it to get in.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Edit: Added a section related to antibodies and venom/poison, usually these are the substances that you can gain resistance to otherwise lethal doses.</p>
<p>Edit2: <strong>TL;DR ELI5 version</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the type of substance the body can either:</p>
<p>1) Just  pee it out or break it down into substances it knows how to pee out. This usually applies for food-like substances; Resistance is build by making more enzymes to break stuff easier but usually you can't gain much resistance to such stuff, not to the same degree you could for say poisons (see below)</p>
<p>2) It can produce antibodies to neutralize the substance. This applies to poisons, venom, some other toxic substances and infectious viruses/bacteria. Usually a big dose at once will just kill you, but a big non lethal dose the body will keep antibodies for a while just to be sure, so if you increase the dose steady you can have enough antibodies to eventually neutralize a dose that would otherwise kill you.</p>
<p>3) It can produce less of substances your body usually produces and/or it will react less to it (block receptors).
This applies to substances you take that can be produced in the body or are similar to ones the body produces or the body reacts to them that way (such as opioids, hormones, etc)</p>
<p>4) Certain types of substances like some metals that can bind to your cells the body has no way of filtering them or react to them, so you can't gain a resistance at all to such substances. These are usually substances that you'd not naturally encounter or consume, usually inorganic components, like some raw metals or some pollution particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first thing first - <strong>It's a physical thing.</strong></p>
<p>There's this idea in biology called &quot;homeostasis&quot;. Basically, your body has an idea of chemical balance, and it adjusts to stay balanced. Like: it's hot out, so you sweat, so you cool down, then you stop sweating. Or you eat candy, which raises your blood sugar. Your body will release insulin, which will lower your blood sugar. As it gets back to normal, insulin release tapers off.</p>
<p>This applies to everything. If you drink alcohol once, it'll make you drunk. If you drink it every day, your body will start adjusting to compensate for it, and you'll have a harder and harder time getting drunk. Soon alcohol just brings you up to normal. If you then stop drinking, your body will now be off-balance in the other direction, and you'll go into withdrawal until homeostasis can be restored.
Pain? Similar deal. Your brain tries to maintain homeostasis. Acute, agonized misery is only sustainable for so long. If the pain itself can't be dulled down, your emotional reaction to it can be. The emergency shutoff switch is when this doesn't work, and all your emotions are cranked down as far as they can go. That includes distress, pleasure, and fear: basically, it causes apathetic depression. This is why you can't just expect people to &quot;get used&quot; to severe pain.</p>
<p>When I say this applies to everything, I mean it. Sex, gambling, sugar, background noise, everything is filtered through your perceptions in this way. Why aren't rich people all happy? Because that level of prosperity is their new normal. What's up with Stockholm syndrome? Victims become desensitized to abuse, and their expectations for &quot;kindness&quot; are steadily reduced. Why aren't teenagers overwhelmed by the pace of the internet? Because it's normal for them. Why don't better football helmets reduce the number of concussions? Because people just do dumber things in order to maintain the same sense of acceptable risk.</p>
<p>This one principle explains quite a bit about why people act the way they do.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body can build a tolerance to a substance in at least two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Getting rid of it quicker: Imagine the substance is removed from your body by being broken down in the liver by a particular enzyme.  Your body says to itself &quot;I keep having to break down this stuff, I'm going to make more of the enzyme&quot;.  The liver makes more enzyme, gets rid of the substance quicker, and you appear to become tolerant to the substance - although the substance is still affecting you, it's not hanging around as long.</p>
</li>
<li>Reacting to it less: Particularly with substances that affect the brain, constant exposure can reduce effectiveness.  Imagine a substance that affects particular brain cells which go on to make another substance that affects different brain cells.  If you keep on being exposed to it, your brain says &quot;I keep getting this signal, I'm going to react to it less.&quot;  It might make fewer of the molecules on the brain cells that react to the substance.  Or the brain cells might make less of the second substance.  Or the other brain cells might react less to that second substance.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other ways this can happen, but they're less common.</p>
<p>If you've got a substance that isn't removed from your body by being broken down - it just goes straight into your urine through the kidneys, for example - then the first route doesn't work.  </p>
<p>If your body can't stop reacting less to the molecule - maybe it works on a part of the cell that's essential or that the body can't make less of - then the second route doesn't work.</p>

I could still pull my legs up to give you an idea.  Finally had an emergency C section after 36 hours with a spinal. My second was a spinal as well.</p>
<p>I also had local anaesthesia for 3 moles that needed to be cut out on my back. When the Dr started to cut I said OUCH, I feel that!! He proceed to give me more. Again it hurt when he cut. So he ask the nurse to bring an unopened box ( thinking that perhaps the anaesthesia might be outdated or something).  Well the new box made no difference so he continue to cut me anyway. Not believing that I could still feel him cut... So I was laying down on my stomach and just trying to hold it together. I felt really traumatised afterwards and shaking. The cuts were about 3 inches long, total over kill 😷</p>
<p>Got my first filling in 20 years 3 months ago. So warned my dentist the local anaesthesia might not fully work due to past experiences . AND...  it did not. She give me more and luckily second round I could not feel a thing. Whoop.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the interesting portions of the weather are related to the phase changes of water which gives precipitation and stuff. Apart from that, in the ocean there are still eddies and currents. </p>
<p>However, while the atmosphere is heated from below (sunlight at the surface), which drives convection and stuff, the ocean is heated from above. This mostly means that its only the upper layers of the ocean that have what could be called weather, ie variations on short time scales. </p>
<p>Its perfectly possible to find eddies by using satellites to measure variations in sea surface height or temperature. The larger the eddy the longer it will last for. Its the mesoscale (10-500 km) eddies that last for days to months. The larger the eddy the larger the effect, so its harder to see the effect of the smaller eddies (just like in the atmosphere).</p>
<p>There are eddies everywhere and they could be thought of as ocean weather but they aren't particularly exciting like a supercell storm or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers have explained how 'weather' is not an applicable term to the oceans below the surface layers (which do in fact have a large influence on weather). I just wanted to make explicit that this is because the process in the troposphere occur largely due to energy input from the sun, the light from which cannot penetrate more than a few hundred metres in the ocean. Differences in received solar energy across the Earth create the heat differentials necessary for winds, the evaporation necessary for H₂O's phase changes, the energy that is re-radiated by greenhouse gases, and the photochemical reactions necessary to create an ozone layer. </p>
<p>Disregarding the term weather, your question drives at what sort of variability in conditions exist in the oceans. Surface currents driven by wind, patches of upwelling due to interactions between currents and seafloor topography, and largescale <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_gyre" target="_blank">ocean gyres</a> are all interesting aspects illustrating our dynamic oceans. </p>
<p>Moving to the deep oceans, less and less variability in ambient conditions is typically seen, which is one reason why deep-sea sediments make auch good indicators of climates and environments that existed long before any formal records or humans at all. Perhaps the major phenomenon of interest down there are deep sea currents, or the cold components of the <a href="http://https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" target="_blank">global thermohaline circulation</a>, which as its name suggests is driven by density differences caused by variations in temperature and salinity. </p>
<p>One of my favourite quotes from marine biologist Rachel Carson on the deep sea borrows a term from atmospheric weather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I think of the floor of the deep sea, the single, overwhelming fact that possesses my imagination is the accumulation of sediments. I see always the steady, unremitting, downward drift of materials from above, flake upon flake, layer upon layer – a drift that has continued for hundreds of millions of years, that will go on as long as there are seas and continents..... For the sediments are the materials of most stupendous snowfall the Earth has ever seen...” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Marine snow' sounds so much better than the sediment and feacal detritus that it actually is. Conveys they constant nature of the process quite nicely though. </p>
<p>So what we have in terms of 'ocean weather' is a large conveyor belt of density driven currents and some wind driven ones on top with various smaller scale process of circulation and fragmentation in between. The driving physics for both ocean and atmospheric movement is fluid mechanics, which is essentially the same, but operates much more slowly in the oceans due to the higher density, and is not accompanied by phase changes which lead to all the interesting things seen in weather like precipitation and hurricanes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that surprised me when I first learned fluid dynamics is that the oceans have largely the same equations of motion as the air, since they're both fluids! (Oceans have an extra salinity equation, while the atmosphere has an extra water vapour equation) One difference however is that the ocean is pretty much truly incompressible. Another thing is that density currents are more prominent in oceans due to the effect of salinity.</p>
<p>Other than that, most of the theory holds. There are things like eddies (Kolmogorov thy.), fronts, inertial oscillations etc. Since water is &gt;800x more dense than air, different terms in the equations will be more significant for each of the two systems. Finally, it is worth noting that the atmosphere and ocean are coupled -- the oceans affect the weather (eg. el nino), and the weather affects the oceans (eg. wind-driven gyres).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They aren't used yet as long term heart replacements, but that is certainly a possibility. Artificial kidneys exist too- dialysis machines.

As for the hardest, the brain for sure- that's a whole separate conversation about AI probably- though some of the more basic electrical signaling from the brain could be/ is done artificially. But another organ at the top of the 'synthetic difficulty' list would be the <em>liver</em>. The liver has hundreds of functions- it stores energy, produces vitamins and components of the immune system, breaks down toxins, monitors blood sugar, regulates hormones... Any artificial liver would have to be able to do all of these things, at the right time and to the right extent.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the hardest thing to replace would be bone marrow. A lot of our organs are filters of some sort, or pumps, but bone marrow creates our blood cells which is a lot harder to do than just filtering or pumping something. There was a thing created recently that can almost be considered an &quot;alternative&quot; organ to bone marrow. It's basically a sac that creates red and white blood cells but I don't know if that can be considered actually synthetic or not. It depends on if by synthetic you mean like robot bits or include engineered bits.<br />
Other than that I'd say the brain would be the hardest to replace. If done slowly enough I don't think you'd ever notice switching our organic neurons with synthetic ones. It's just engineering the artificial neurons that would be the hard part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that the brain is out. I'd say lymphoid and hematogenous tissue of any sort would practically have to be cellular. Any tissue with endocrine or secretory function is out as well. That doesn't leave you with a whole lot. Nearly every organ has secretory functions even if they are not traditionally considered endocrine. Your heart produces natriuretic peptides reactively to blood pressure and distention. Endocrine organs are inconcievably complicated. The liver is basically a chemical factory. Kidney has endocrine properties even though it's not a traditional endocrine organ (EPO secretion, renin angiotensin aldosterone system). Even the lungs convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II and facilitate one of the most important mechanisms of blood pressure and volume control. But if you really need an answer, I'd say heart and lungs are the easiest to replace with synthetic ones. And I'd say liver, kidneys (No, hemodialysis does not replace kidney functions) and endocrine organs are the hardest in no particular order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The things that trigger disgust reactions are usually also vectors for disease: poop, gore, vermin, and so on. Your brain is programmed to recognize them as potential contaminants - you're not only disgusted by these objects, but also by any <em>other</em> objects that they may have touched. 'Losing your appetite' (and, in extreme cases, vomiting) is how your brain tells you that anything found in close proximity to these things is unfit to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry this isn't an answer to your question, but as a nurse, I have the ability to clean up a &quot;code brown&quot; (aka a patient crapped all over themselves, their bed, the floor, then proceeded to smear it everywhere else in the room), empty a colostomy complete with corn and carrot bits, dress a wound with black necrotic tissue and pus, etc.... finish up and then go right to lunch. after a overly thorough washing of my hands of course. However, if i get something off texture-wise in my food... like a piece of gristle in a sausage, i completely lose my appetite and cannot eat anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
