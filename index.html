However, it is not very good at doing any two of these things at the same time, because each one requires a large amount of energy and oxygen (both provided by blood flow).</p>
<p>After a large meal, most of your blood is diverted to your digestive system to break down all the food you've just shoved in your face. This means that blood is diverted AWAY FROM your brain, making you sleepy.</p>
<p>Now, you might think that thinking doesn't require much energy (after all, it is small and makes up for only 2-3% of your body's total mass), but in general, your brain accounts for about 20% of your caloric output. Your brain not only performs logical reasoning, but also controls your muscles (including involuntary ones like your respiratory and digestive systems).</p>
<p>This is also the reason why we are prone to cramps when we exercise after a medium to large meal. Our bodies simply don't have to capacity to digest food and do physical work at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm very tired so I'll give a short winded shitty response but you'll probably get the gist of it. </p>
<p>Glow in the dark objects contain a compound (phosphors) that can be excited by light. The compound absorbs the light energy by using it to put its electrons in a higher energy shell. If you imagine the Bohr atomic model with the rings around the center, the electron would be moving away from the center therefore occupying a high energy state. The atoms in the compound then release the energy via moving the electron back to its lower energy state (closer to the middle of the atom) and this energy release is given off as light. What color the light is when it's released depends on what compound is used, and what wavelength/energy value is absorbed/emitted by that compound. So to answer your second half of the question- no, not all glow in the dark objects use the same compound. </p>
<p>There's more to it and I'm sure someone will take the time to explain it but that's the simple version </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glowsticks operate via chemiluminescence, which is a fancy way to refer to a chemical reaction that produces light. You know that a chemical reaction is occurring because you need to mix the two chemicals in the glow stick to activate it. Phosphorescence, on the other hand, is the mechanism for glow-in-the-dark pigments that need to be &quot;charged&quot; by exposure to external light. Phosphorescent chemicals absorb light and then re-emit it slowly, at a lower intensity after a relatively long period of time. Radioluminescence involves using a radioactive element to excite a chemical that then emits the energy as visible light. This used to be highly popular, but that was at a time when radioactive water was marketed as a health tonic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Atoms absorb and reflect light. Leaves on a tree absorb light and only reflects green light.</p>
<p>Glow in the dark objects are the same. They need to absorb light before they can glow, thats why after a while they become very dim if they haven't been under the light for a few hours.</p>
<p>The reason why they glow in the dark unlike other objects is called phosphorescence. The object absorbs light but they don't reflect it instantly. The energy of the light thats absorbed is slowly released over time. </p>
<p>What happens inside the atom: In normal objects the electron of the atom absorbs the photon of light. This gives the electron energy, the electron is what we call excited. The electron then releases that energy again in the form of light which we see. </p>
<p>Objects that are phosphorescent have electrons that absorb light, but releases it in small steps over a long period of time. </p>
<p>Hope this was easy to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Well, the Americans would go in with their ships and as soon as the projectile landed and try and get pieces to study.  They continued doing this over the objections of the Soviets until one day they tested not one missile ... but three, with the second almost hitting the <em>George Arnold</em>.  These weren't full atomic warheads, but they had about 40 kilos of TNT on board to create a boom that could be picked up on sonar by the Soviet tracking vessels to determine exactly where the rocket had landed.  They were also, you know, falling from space so they had a bit of speed to them.  Certainly not something you wanted to land on your ship.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this you should know how sound waves interact with each other</p>
<p>Have you ever used <em>real</em> noise cancelling headphones? The headphones aren't just little earmuffs. They have a microphone in them and work by sending frequencies to your ears that are related to the sounds coming into the microphone, cancelling out the sound.</p>
<p>And have you ever been to a concert, where everyone sings along and it actually sounds pretty good? (Even though most of them are probably tone-deaf) That's because on average, people are singing the right note, so wrong notes get cancelled out by other people singing similarly wrong notes and everything sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>When you're out in a noisy environment, lets say a construction worker is using a jackhammer, it's really fricken' loud. But if it was in the city where there's lots of loud car horns it would seem less loud: partly because you're gradually getting more accustomed to louder noises, and partly because some frequencies will cancel eachother out.</p>
<p>Obviously, a random loud noise is scary. But if you're at a really loud concert you'll quickly get used to it because your body realizes that you're not in a dangerous environment. So if you turned up your volume too high, you'd be fine eventually, you just might suffer hearing loss. (Note: most - all headphones these days do have the ability to damage your hearing if turned up too loud, please preserve your ears.)</p>
<p>You should also know that, not all noises are created equal. Higher pitches are actually louder to our ears than lower notes, <del>so a song with some gnarly violin solos is going to mess up your hearing a lot more than a bass guitar.</del></p>
<p>I generalized a lot and I'm sure others may have more to add, I encourage any questions or corrections! :)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our ears have a way of protecting themselves from high energy sound – it's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex" target="_blank">acoustic reflex</a>.</p>
<p>The most delicate parts of our ears are the small hairs or <em>cilia</em> in the cochlea. Intense noises can damage them, so the acoustic reflex stiffens the bones that connect the eardrum to the middle and inner ear. A stiffer connection dampens the energy going into the cochlea. It can reduce the energy by a huge margin, between 15 and 20 dB, which is up to <em>90%</em> attenuation.</p>
<p>The acoustic reflex is triggered by loud sounds or vocalization, so when you are in a loud environment, your threshold for pain and damage automatically adjusts to the ambient sound level.</p>
<p>The most damaging sounds are ones that have a very quick onset, like gunfire. The acoustic reflex takes about 15 ms to take effect, which is too late to protect you from an impulse-like sound. Steady sounds, like a loud subway car, might have comparable decibel levels, but your ears have physically adjusted to protect themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The background noise from the loud room interferes with the noise you want to hear. This is pretty obvious; it's harder to hear someone in, say, a nightclub than in a library. Decibels are also measured on a logarithmic scale, so a doubling in sound wave pressure is something like a 6% increase to perceived sound. There's also the concept of the <a href="http://www.hear-it.org/temporary-threshold-shift" target="_blank">Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS)</a>, which is a kind of hearing loss / reduction brought about by loud noises. This is why the volume of the music player you set when you left work yesterday is now too loud right after you wake up, even though it's (theoretically) the same driving environment.</p>
<p>And because I'm too lazy to make another thread, I have doubts about Semoln's point about the concert. The crowd singing will sound in key because the majority of the crowd will sing correctly (more or less), while the people singing so badly will be in the minority, thus being drowned out. The point about the noise-cancelling earphones is correct though: if the microphone senses a signal of +X, it will produce a noise of -X to get a net result of 0. Also, yes, the noise will damage your hearing even if it isn't currently hurting you. Hearing loss begins at 80 dBa (spots car interior at 120km/h), and OSHA recommends no more than 90 dBa (passing subway train) over 8 hours or 110 dBa (chainsaw) for more than 30 minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

However, just like the drop of ribena in a tub of water, the electrical current dissipates outwards until it is too weak and is quickly neutralised.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the fact that all these rockets are aerodynamically stable without fins. Their centre of lift/drag is behind/lower than their centre of mass, so they tend to keep going roughly in the direction they're pointed, even without thrust vectoring. The length of the rocket is a big help in this. Being long relative to its weight means that the area aft of the centre of mass is large, increasing the amount of force pushing the rocket to face the direction it is moving.</p>
<p>A good comparison is a javelin, which, unlike an arrow, has no feathers to stabilize it, but flies relatively straight and true regardless because its front end is the weighted end. If it were the reverse, it would tend to spin around so that end faced the target no matter how it was thrown. This is one of several reasons why the movie move of throwing your sword would have been a very bad idea. Now, a javelin does not fly as straight as an arrow because the feathers of the arrow make it even more stable; but at the same time, the javelin's flight is much less likely to be impacted by the wind, even if it is the same size and mass, because the surface area of the feathers increases drag overall.</p>
<p>With rockets, the increase in drag and weight from fins usually outweighs any gains in stability, especially since a rocket is unlikely to be pointing anywhere except somewhere very close to the direction it's going. Correcting big deviations from centre are where fins shine. It isn't as simply as just slapping them on there, they have to have a structure that connects them to the rocket, require a different weight distribution in the stage, and perhaps even control surfaces for steering, all of which adds weight that rockets can ill afford.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you're sleeping, you're not unconscious, you're in a <em>different state of consciousness</em>. You're still responsive and somewhat aware of your surroundings. It's why a loud noise or being shaken can wake you up, or how sounds around you can make their way into your dreams. While you may not be aware of it, while you're asleep you're still processing sensory input.</p>
<p>When you're anesthetized for surgery, you're not in an altered state of consciousness, you're fully unconscious. Your brain isn't processing sensory input or recording memories.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be caused by various reasons. Here are some simple explanations.</p>
<p>It can because your blood sugar drops and you get hypoglycemic which causes the nausea or the puky feeling. When have been hungry for a while our bodies start slowing down to preserve nutrition. This affects blood circulation to put it simply which is why some of us feel light headed, dizzy,etc.</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>It's can be caused by the acid in your empty stomach. The longer it's been since you ate the worse it can be. By the acid not having anything to digest it causes irritation to the stomach lining and lower esophagus which you feel as a sensation of nausea. This sensation tends to be worse in people with a predisposition to having acid reflux.</p>
<p>An actual medical cause can be gastroparesis where the stomach does not empty correctly and can leave food in your stomach from meals digested during your prior meal that adds to irritation.</p>
<p>In addition if the nausea is extremely transient, such as a sensation going back and forth between extremely hungry and nauseous quickly, it's likely a caused by a strong signal in the gastric nerves and the limited ability of our brains too correctly interpret this signal. So it is likely trying to interpret the extreme range of human gastric sensation and gets the two confused, i.e. hunger or nausea.</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>When your body expects food your stomach releases ghrelin, a hormone that makes you feel so hungry that you get nauseous and feel like you're starving. This reaction is only related to your feeding schedule though, so it'll happen when you might not even necessarily need food. After a while your stomach will stop releasing Ghrelin and the feeling will go away. That could take between 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>For instance if you normally ate food every hour, if you missed a meal you'd feel nauseous and super hungry, even though you didn't really need food. Ghrelin encourages you to seek food, but your body stops releasing it after a short while so as not to inhibit food procurement activities. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have had emergency services come out to me and explain this when I had an episode once.</p>
<p>It had to do with low blood sugar. I hadn't eaten anything all day, was running around playing paintball and at the end of the day when walking home I kept vomiting and passing out.</p>
<p>Someone noticed me passed out on the sidewalk and called an ambulance. When the EMTs showed up and took my vitals, the first thing they asked was what I had eaten that day. I said nothing. They told me to go home and eat, because I was having a hypoglycemic episode. I told them I didn't feel hungry at all and they said that was normal and was why I was so tired and throwing up (all that was coming up was a watery, yellow liquid that smelled really bad) but I can't remember exactly everything they told me about it. I was kinda fucked up and felt drunk. </p>
<p>If I haven't eaten for a while and start feeling queasy now, I find something to eat immediately. </p>
<p>Edit: correction of a word. Thanks /u/saikado.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: It was a little more complicated than I put it, but I can only relay what I remember and, as I mentioned, I was out of it; passing out, throwing up, I felt drunk and dizzy. So I don't remember a lot of the details I didn't even understand. They administered some tests, talked to me a bit, my friend showed up and told them what we were doing earlier in the day, and then someone called my mom to pick me up. I was 15 or 16 when this happened. </p>
<p>EDIT 3: I forgot to add in the previous edit that the EMS did not administer anything to me, at least not that I recall. No injections, pills, not even a bite to eat. If they were supposed to have done something like that, then they either fucked up, or did give me something while I was still unconscious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have been suffering from depression (Probably) as of late, and one of the major effects is the near disappearance of my appetite. Simply put, I never actually feel hungry. However, if I don't eat at all, often my body will start to feel nauseated. Is this the same thing? Is my body not telling me I'm hungry until its far past the time I should have ate?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is we are not sure. </p>
<p>But these are the plausible reasons which are widely agreed on :</p>
<p><strong>Empathy</strong> It is a psychological reaction which pretty much relates someone else's body to our own. It exists so that humans could work together better and to have us avoid killing each other in most cases. Well, the face reaction is really just us putting ourselves into that persons shoes, and reacting how they would.  </p>
<p>But there is this study that claims it has nothing to do with how empathetic the person is.  - <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018675" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
<p>From an evolutionary view it is beneficial for us to easily remember bad memories. This helps us avoid repeating mistakes we have witnessed and keep us out of dangers way e.g. My friend was eaten by a bear in that cave, I remember this in great detail and avoid that cave in future so I'm less likely to be eaten by a bear.
I think it might be similar for things we find embarrassing. </p>
<p>It's dangerous to do things that alienate you from a group since we are social creatures that rely on acceptance and group work to survive. If we remember things we've done before that threatened our social standing then we aren't likely to repeat the behaviour in future and avoid exclusion. That's just speculation though.
for people asking for more info on this I highly recommend looking up evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>'Evolutionary theories of emotion view emotions a
s adaptive traits - they help the organism to adapt to the demand of the environment and thereby survive' (Izard, 1977; Plutchik, 1984).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The German's actually have a word for this, Fremdschämen.</p>
<p>There's varying theories as to why embarrassment is good or bad, but it really boils down to surviving in the social and cultural customs of whatever group (tribe) you're in. If you don't fit in you aren't finding a mate. Feeling the embarrassment of your friend when they're unaware that they're not fitting in allows you to step in and save them, with the understanding that they'll do the same for you...you could think of Fremdschämen as nature's wingman.</p>
<p>You have to keep in mind that at our core we're still very much socially dependent pack animals. A key part of being able to survive as long as we have is our ability to empathize with others.</p>
<p>We're capable of feeling the pain, embarrassment, and even joy of others, which compels us to help and support one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have already mentioned mirror neurons and vicarious embarrassment but I think the key feature that a lot of people are missing is this. When you do something embarrassing, you elicit a negative response from the people around you, which causes tension and discomfort among the group. The most extreme case of this would be being ostracized from a group which would significantly lower an organism's chances for reproductive success.</p>
<p>Thus, when our brains view someone else in an embarrassing situation, we recall the feelings (often literal physical feelings) of what it was like to be embarrassed; basically your brain's way of telling you &quot;remember how bad that feels? Don't do that!&quot; much the same way we remember and avoid physical pain.</p>
<p>Basically, feeling vicarious embarrassment is our brain's way of &quot;sandboxing&quot; the emotional experience and subsequent processing of being embarrassed without having to first actually do something embarrassing. It's our brain warning us that whatever that person did that embarrassed them, we shouldn't do because it will feel super bad and risk being cast off from the group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>For instance, sports. People watch football and they enjoy it. </p>
<p>These motor neurons might possibly have an evolutionary advantage of allowing us to become more sociable, by understanding peoples emotions through vision alone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I believe it isn't much about empathy or mirror neurons, but for social acceptance: you feel ashamed because others might relate <em>him</em> or <em>her</em> to <em>you</em>. Proof is that it's hard to feel it if you're alone with the shameless one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
