<p>In many industries, union contracts with employers state that they're only allowed to hire members of the union. So you can't work for those companies unless you're a dues-paying member of the union. Right to Work laws make these clauses in the contract illegal.</p>
<p>In general, I'd say it's bad for unions, because it means they get less dues, and it's bad for people who want to be in the union because it means the union has less negotiating power if only some of the workers are in the union. It's good for the employers, because the union has less power and it's good for people who don't want to be in the union because they aren't forced to pay dues in order to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>EDIT: Right-to-work laws are <em>not</em> about prohibiting employers from requiring employees to join the union as a condition of employment. They are about whether unions may deduct union dues/fees from non-members paychecks. Requiring union membership as a condition of employment (i.e., the creation of a &quot;closed shop&quot;) has been illegal since the passage of the federal Taft-Hartley Act in 1947.</strong></p>
<p>TL;DR: They are intended to reduce the influence--both economic and political--of organized labor by making it harder for unions to collect dues/fees. </p>
<p>Unions deduct dues directly from employees' paychecks. For union members, this is no big deal. They signed up for the union, they agree to union dues.</p>
<p>But what of non-members? The Supreme Court has ruled that unions cannot deduct fees to be used for political purposes from non-members (that would violate non-members First Amendment rights), but can be permitted to deduct &quot;services fees,&quot; (EDIT: also sometimes called &quot;agency fees&quot;) which are theoretically the costs the union incurs in negotiating the employees' collective bargaining agreements. </p>
<p>What &quot;right-to-work&quot; laws say is that unions can't deduct <em>any</em> fees/dues from non-members' paychecks. Employees have a &quot;right&quot; to work without paying unions a dime unless they voluntarily decide to join the union. Sure, if fewer employees choose to join, that means fewer dues for the union, which means it might not be able to secure as good a collective bargaining agreement for the employees, and might not even be able to represent them at all. </p>
<p>The reason this is such a problem for unions is that a lot of employees don't <em>want</em> to join the union. Yes, they'd certainly prefer to gain the benefit of the collective bargaining agreement without paying anything for it. But unionized employees know damned well the nature of their collective bargaining agreements and many <em>still</em> don't want to join the union. Why? Maybe because while unions themselves direct pretty much 100% of their political donations to Democrats, unionized <em>employees</em> are almost as politically diverse as the American electorate as a whole. </p>
<p>On top of that, unions political affiliations are known to pretty much everybody. That includes elected politicians. Including Republican politicians. Who control both houses of 33 state legislatures and one house in another 7 states. I can't think of any reason they <em>wouldn't</em> want to take an enormous whack at the single most reliable source of Democratic campaign contributions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With work, there is capital, labor, and management. Capital is the investors. Management works for the investors and runs the company. And labor does the actual work. The investors pool lots of money together to enable the creation and funding of the company, and authorize management to hire and fire labor to get the work done. </p>
<p>If labor wants to get better working conditions, management and capital are far more powerful than them. America is a &quot;at-will&quot; country in general, so management can hire and fire for just about any reason (except for some limited discriminatory or retaliatory reasons). </p>
<p>So to actually have any ability to stand with an even footing against management and capital, Labor has to organize. It has to present a united front. &quot;You can't fire one of us for asking for better work conditions because if you do, all of us will quit and the business breaks down.&quot; </p>
<p>Right to work laws are meant to fracture union power so that labor can't unite. It uses free riders to say &quot;I won't fund the union...but i'll benefit from their work.&quot; And the people who do pay union dues then get annoyed with the free riders and want to stop paying dues as well. Furthermore, the union may try to strike, bu the with so many people opting out, a strike with just 15% of the workers doesn't have the same impact as 95%. It becomes much easier for management to just pick off and harass the key union leaders and get them out of the organization. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right to work laws are a product of the struggle between the labor movement and businesses opposing them. Labor unions want to organize workers to protect them and gain benefits, better wages, health care, retirement pensions for the workers. So they advocate closed shops. If a union signs up a majority of workers they want to be able to close the shop, all workers must belong to the union. New hires have a certain time period to join a union. There is a logic to this. A union shop pays better wages and has better benefits due to work by the union. </p>
<p>However in states with weak labor movements the legislatures will outlaw union shops. The law is called a right to work law. An employer can hire anyone they want. That is true in both cases. But in a right to work state no worker is required to join a union to work somewhere. So after a union has achieved better working conditions the employer can attract good workers who do not have to join the union which got those benefits. Union shops exist in those states. Peer pressure, and appreciation for the benefits of belonging to a union can get enough workers to join the union to make a business a union shop. But the law in those states says no one has to join the union to work. So maybe there is more freedom in those states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi. I make fonts for a living. </p>
<p>TrueType and OpenType fonts are mostly the same thing.</p>
<p>There are two things that make them different:</p>
<p>TrueType fonts are drawn using Quadratic Outlines, which is a very formal way of drawing letters. OpenType fonts use Postscript Outlines which is a much easier way for designers to draw fonts.
You can't see the difference when looking at a font, but it's something a type designer has to think about when drawing the letters.</p>
<p>The other difference is how each font uses &quot;hinting&quot;. Hinting is special rules that tell the computer how to show the font on a computer screen. </p>
<p>TrueType has lots of rules about how it should look, and because of this, a hinted font will usually look better on a computer screen. PostScript has some simple rules and mostly lets the computer decide how it should look. </p>
<p>TrueType fonts can have a .ttf or .otf extension, and OpenType fonts can only have a .otf extension. </p>
<p>Most people can't see these little differences, so you can use either OpenType or TrueType fonts.
When you're working in a job that uses a lot of fonts you might need to use one format or the other. Graphic designers who work in print usually use OpenType fonts. Web designers usually use fonts that start out as TrueType fonts. And a lot of architects need to use TrueType fonts in their programs. </p>
<p>Last thing, kids: fonts take a lot of work to make and a lot of people work very hard to drawn new and interesting fonts. So please use your allowance to buy fonts and don't steal. </p>
<p>Adults: </p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>OpenType fonts can be used across operating systems (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.)</li>
<li>OpenType features allow for some very nifty substitution logic, I've used it to give the &quot;worn type&quot; look by randomly switching out up to seven versions of the same character. </li>
<li>OpenType fonts can come in CFF / Type 1 or TrueType flavors. The nature of the curves differs slightly, but more importantly, the former will have the .OTF extension, while the latter will have .TTF - it's still an OpenType font, though!

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may ask why there were two types of fonts in the first place and the reason goes back to the early days of printers, when there were multiple different page description languages to tell printers how to print a page. Adobe's PostScript became a favourite (especially for publishing) and with it PostScript fonts. Apple and Microsoft didn't like having to pay royalties to Adobe to use PostScript fonts, so they got together to invent a new font format, TrueType. This led to the &quot;font wars&quot;. (Truly, that's what that period was called.) Professional typesetters and service bureaux generally regarded TrueType fonts as inferior, and that was often the case. (Not because of the format but because there were lots of badly made copies of famous fonts in TrueType. Anyone remember those &quot;1,000 fonts for $10&quot; CDs? They were TrueType.)</p>
<p>Anyway, eventually Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple all got together and came up with OpenType, which was basically a wrapper that could go around both TrueType and PostScript fonts. Windows started offering in-built support for OpenType, whereas previously you had to install an Adobe app (Adobe Type Manager) if you wanted to use PostScript fonts on a PC. OpenType also allowed far more characters than had been the case for PostScript fonts previously, which had been limited to 256 characters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OpenType (OTF) allows for more advanced use of text/glyphs/symbols than TrueType (TTF). It was developed in a way that allows font develops better, cleaner looks when using more &quot;complicated&quot; text use than simple alphanumerics. This includes any use of multiple languages, symbols, mathematical symbols with better support for Unicode. OTF better handles any changes in the positioning, size, and layout of the characters. </p>
<p>Simply put OTF is better for advanced typology or use of special characters. They are largely equivalent in their coding of how they represent characters and for standard usage of alphanumeric characters.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Will try to do justice to the name of the subreddit and keep things simple. </p>
<p>Catalonia has its own language which is called Catalan. It is one of 4 official languages in Spain, the others being Basque (Euskera), Galician, and Castillian (Spanish).  </p>
<p>For about 10 years, Catalonia's government has been lobbying the Spanish government for greater autonomy both economically and culturally (i.e. the right to collect their own taxes, the right to use the Catalan language in any context they please). It is important to remember that most important taxes in Spain are levied by the national (federal) government. This contrasts with the United States, whose citizens pay considerable taxes to local and regional (state) governments. This is why you often hear Catalans claiming that they pay a disproportionate share of federal taxes -- because the whole country pays into a pool and it then gets divied up based on need. Catalonia, as a top earner, does indeed get back less than what it puts in.
However, these statistics have been politicized by both pro- and anti- independence camps and often what you hear is an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Spain's government, run by the &quot;Popular Party&quot;, is traditionalist and conservative. They are pro-Spanish unity and many of its party members have made (intentionally or unintentionally) offensive statements through the years regarding Catalonian language and culture. This is especially sensitive due to Spain's history as a dictatorship and the linguistic and cultural oppression that took place under Francisco Franco. The national government's comments and attitudes have predictably poured fuel on the pro-independence fire, a movement currently enjoying more momentum than ever before due in large part to the national government's intransigence.</p>
<p>In 2010, a constitutional court ruling upheld most of a previously ratified law that granted more autonomy to Catalonia. In 2012, on Catalonia's National Day, between 1 and 2 million people took to the streets to protest Popular Party's recent electoral victory. The party had opposed the aforementioned law and had tried to kill it on appeal. Shortly after these protests, then-regional Catalan government leader Artur Mas called a snap election, whose results would implicitly give or deny his government a mandate to initiate a process that would ultimately result in secession. Although Mas's own party unexpectedly lost 12 seats, overall there were more pro-independence parliamentarians post-election than there previously had been, and momentum continued to build. </p>
<p>Later, in 2015, another regional election produced a precarious coalition of Catalan parties known collectively as Junts Pel Sí -- Together For Yes -- again with an implicit mandate to continue the march towards independence, this time with the promise of a referendum. Spain's 1978 constitution does not contain any explicit clauses on the right to self-determination and the national Spanish government has based (most of) their opposition to the referendum on that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Civil Guard, a national Spanish police force whose organizational structure largely resembles that of a military, arrested 14 Catalans on suspicion of taking part in the preparation and organization of what the national government considers a rogue, illegal referendum. As you can imagine, many Catalans consider these people political prisoners, while many Spaniards consider them to be illegally in defiance of constitutional law. People then took to the streets to protest their detentions and congregated around a Civil Guard building, essentially trapping them inside and forcing local Catalan police forces to provide them safe passage. This was the first time that the Spanish government took a REAL swing at the pro-independence movement. Things are tense here right now, hope this provides a bit of background as to why. </p>
<p>What can be done to de-escalate? It's not clear that anything could be done at this point, although a complete about-face by the national government would certainly shock people and could potentially jump-start a new, more civil dialogue. Another possibility is that the October 1 referendum clearly lacks a mandate due to lacklustre turnout and/or a clear bias of pro-independence voter participation. Poor turnout is possible not because the measure lacks support, but because the national government seems to have actually succeeded in derailing preparation for the vote by confiscating ballots and engaging in other forms of sabotage. Moreover, and to be fair, the lack of clarity regarding the referendum's constitutionality means that many, if not most voters inclined to vote &quot;No&quot; will stay home -- a half-assed boycott of sorts.  Personally, I believe that after yesterday's escalation the Catalan government is now determined to go through with independence as long as the Yes vote wins, regardless of turnout or perceived illegitimacy of the results.</p>
<p>Edit: grammar and shit yo!</p>
<p>Edit2: It has been pointed out that Basque Country enjoys federally sanctioned financial privileges that no other &quot;autonomous community&quot; in Spain enjoys, and this is absolutely true. This is important, I suppose, insofar as it means there is a precedent for the financial &quot;autonomy&quot; many Catalans have been advocating for years, and since most Spaniards consider Basque privilege to be the result of separatism. However, the history of these two regions could hardly be more different, and Basque Country's special status was hard-won.</p>
<p>Edit3: It has also been correctly pointed out by u/Portarossa that here in Barcelona, at least, more than a handful of people are totally lukewarm about the entire &quot;Catalan Question&quot; as the press here refers to it. While there is plenty of blame to go around about how we got to this seemingly avoidable juncture, both people in favor and against independence are often willing to acknowledge that it is the national government who too many times fumbled the ball while it was in their court. While they claim now that their door has always been open, in 2012 Catalan leader Artur Mas traveled to Madrid expressly to negotiate a &quot;Fiscal Pact&quot; for Catalonia. Behind closed doors, it is likely that Rajoy simply told Mas that his hands were tied by Angela Merkel's austere fist. Moreover, Popular Party indeed benefits electorally when perceived to be promoting Spanish unity and a strong federal state. The point here is that yes: to people on the ground, it seems as though this crisis could have potentially been averted if only Madrid had done more to assuage extremism early on, instead of creating more of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spain used to be lots of independent regions each with their own King or Queen. Each had their own dialect or language, usually descended from Latin. In the case of Catalonia this was Catalan.</p>
<p>In the 15th Century Catalonia became part of Spain after a royal marriage united two kingdoms.</p>
<p>Later in the 20th Century Catalan language and culture was suppressed and forbidden by the dictatorship in Spain.</p>
<p>Since the end of the dictatorship, Catalonia has gained more freedom, and schools in Catalonia are taught exclusively in Catalan. However due to immigration from other parts of Spain and elsewhere, 47% of the population speak Spanish as their native language while 37% speak Catalan as their native language.</p>
<p>Some people have started asking for Catalonia to be an independent country, because they feel that Catalonia has its own separate culture and language, and also because it has a stronger economy than some poorer regions in the south of Spain.</p>
<p>The Catalan regional government has arranged a series of referendums to ask the population if they want Catalonia to be an independent country. The first one was in 2014 and the next one is due on 1st October 2017.</p>
<p>The Madrid government and court have declared these referendums as illegal. This is because they say that the Spanish Constitution doesn't allow any region to hold a vote on independence, and also because the Madrid government has not given permission. When the Catalan politicians continued with the referendums, the central government and police have raided offices of the regional government, and seized ballot papers from a warehouse.</p>
<p>The vote held in 2014 was non-binding, however the Madrid government still called it illegal. However the Catalan government says it will declare independence within 48 hours of a &quot;yes&quot; vote. This may have contributed to rising tensions and a strong reaction from Madrid.</p>
<p>Regarding your last question, about how the situation can de-escalate: it's worth noting that the turnout in 2014 was quite low, and since I said that there are more native Spanish speakers than native Catalan speakers in Catalonia, I don't think it's likely that a true majority of the population would support independence. However Catalan speakers are more likely to vote in the referendums than Spanish speakers, especially given that the referendum is not &quot;official&quot; according to the central government. If the turnout is low again I don't think that the Catalan government would declare independence, so the tension may deflate slightly in that case. However there is a possibility of tensions getting higher with the police making more raids and arrests against the organisers of the vote.</p>

</li>
<li>edit 2: Source for my claim about Catalan being forbidden during the dictatorship: &quot;The fascist regime that emerged triumphant from the civil war in 1939 did everything in its power to stamp out the official and private use of Catalan.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a long time, Catalonia and Spain have lived in the same farm. The relation is not always easy.</p>
<p>Catalonia likes to do things in her own particular way. Catalonia also has felt that Spain has not treated her fairly sometimes. Because of this, Catalonia has already has said a few times &quot;enough is enough, let's make a fence and separate the farm into two parts&quot;. But things always chilled down eventually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Spain has reacted to Catalonia's oddities in different ways: sometimes being totally cool about it, sometimes facepalming (&quot;Why do you always have to be so difficult, Catalonia!?&quot;), but sometimes being really really awful to her (sometimes even hitting her).</p>
<p>What is going on now with them, you ask? Well, this is my opinion... A few years ago, Catalonia did some stuff called Estatut, but Spain didn't like it, and changed what Catalonia had done. This made Catalonia quite angry, and the idea of leaving came back to Catalonia's mind once more. So far, it's the same old story, but...</p>
<p>Things in the farm were not going well. At all. Actually, it was going pretty awfully and money was becoming a big issue. When there is no money, things become more difficult and people get angry at each other for the tiniest reasons. As you can imagine, Spain and Catalonia were both in a terrible mood by now.</p>
<p>So for a few years, it's been &quot;I am leaving!&quot; &quot;No you're not&quot; &quot;YES I AM&quot; &quot;NO YOU'RE NOT&quot;. Catalonia is maybe not making the smartest choice, after all there are advantages sharing the farm and sometimes she and Spain get along very very well. But Spain is being very nasty about it, not even listening to Catalonia most of the time, and often calling her names and being very rude to her.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Catalonia said that she's going to decide if she's leaving or not, and she is not going to consider at all what Spain has to say. Spain got really pissed, and is now standing with a baseball bat right by Catalonia's door. Everyone, including Catalonia, Spain and the neighbors, are really confused. Everyone, including Catalonia, is wondering if she will really leave. Everyone, including Spain, is wondering if Spain will hit Catalonia.</p>
<p>It really is very sad they can't get along, be it in the same farm or in separate ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Every single conversation in the bar immediately stopped and every guy in the bar turned to glare at me. Sensing the awkward shift in mood, I turned to the bartender with the international symbol for  &quot;huh?&quot; - shrugged shoulders, elbows in, palms up.
.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had been frequenting the bar for the past week and had become friendly with the owner, who understood I was just an idiot American, ignorant with regard to the local history who meant no ill will. He stepped in and filled me in on why what I said was not well received. I gradually realized just how bad my faux pas really was. This would be akin to walking into an IRA bar during The Troubles and shouting &quot;God save the Queen!&quot;. I decided I wanted to have more friends than enemies in Catalonia so I bought a drink for the entire bar and apologized to everyone there individually.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They tried to make a referendum on November 9th, 2014, had some problems with the State not allowing it to be legal, so the result was considered unclonclusive.</p>
<p>So the parliament went on to an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plebiscite" target="_blank">plebiscitary</a> election with new parties, so that they could do a legit vote, one party was big for the Yes to become independent, others didn't play the game, others said maybe, etc.</p>
<p>After winning, but not by much, the Yes party, instead of declaring independence (They couldn't because they didn't feel legitimized enough), promised to hold a real referendum in 18 months.</p>
<p>The 18 months are almost over, and the president and catalan government, settled on a date for the referendum: <a href="http://ref1oct.eu" target="_blank">the October 1st, 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The law allowing that event passed at the beggining of september (and suspended the day after), the president promised to be independent by the 2nd if the Yes wins, or call up an election if the Yes loses.</p>
<p>The spanish government, keeps repeating that the law in Spain doesn't allow any kind of referendum nor questioning in any part of Spain, so they call it an illegal referendum that is not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the September 20th 2017, spanish (not catalan) police entered 40 government buildings, bussinesses, arrested 14 government officials, which haven't been yet released with any charges.</p>
<p>Apparently, the orders came by a spanish judge working in Barcelona (the number 13th) following an investigation (started this February?), the police force (clearly mandated by political chiefs) have their holidays temporarily revoked and sent to sleep in three cruise line ship in Barcelona and Tarragona's port.</p>
<p>More than 2000 police riot units have been sent over to control the crowd and &quot;pacify&quot; catalunya, moreover, it appears that their mission is to stop the referendum at almost all costs, as of now, they have aprehended 10 million voting ballots and a much more material.</p>
<p>Two helicopters have also been recently deployed in Catalunya too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water vapor does, but only slightly so to be unnoticeable.  Water vapor (i.e., humidity) absorbs microwaves in the 3-5 GHz range only on the order of 0.001 dB per km.  For a typical cell tower with 100 km range, this means humidity is only changing this range on the order of 1 to 10 meters or so.  </p>
<p>Rain or hail, on the other hand, can have huge effect, this is actually how our weather radar systems work.  The US National Weather Service's 88Ds are 3 GHz radars, in the same frequency bands as wifi.  The rain and hail won't appreciably absorb as much as it reflects the signal (this reflection is what shows up on the weather radar images).  When you go to 5 GHz signal like wifi, hail cores in very strong thunderstorms can reflect all the signal over very short distances.</p>
<p>Temperature gradients also affect the way directed microwaves travel.  This can result in pulses from say, a radar, being bent back to the ground.  </p>
<p>If you want to experiment water's effect on microwaves you can place your phone in a water proof bag and submerge it in water and see your wifi signal drop. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation</a></p>
<p>Zones of temperature inversion in high pressure areas can offer propagation losses that are extremely small. The most pronounced effect is when the ducting occurs just above the surface of the sea or a lake. For example I once contacted Holland from the UK with only 1mW of power on 2,3 GHz ie about 100x less than WiFi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Circulating coins used to be made of actual silver and gold but these were phased out because the value of the silver and gold outpaced their face value and it was easier to make more durable coins out of copper-nickel and steel cores. Canadian &quot;junk silver&quot; coins up to 1966/67/68 (depending on the denomination) are all currently worth 7 to 11 times their face value. </p>
<p>In reality, most of the NCLT $20 silver coins don't even include an ounce of silver and so they are essentially jewellery disks.

So people were purchasing as many as they could on their credit cards and then turning around and depositing them immediately to pay off their credit card - this gave them &quot;free&quot; airline miles and cash back opportunity.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Legal tender evokes a certain emotional response in collectors that just isn't present in things like medals. Anyone can make a medal out of silver, and there are even those that can make them with the same quality as a national mint. But they don't have the same cachet and power as actual money. Medals made by national mints are somewhat valued, don't get me wrong, but actual legally authorized money has a specific mythic quality to it.</p>
<p>One effect of this is that mint errors are so valued. It's silly if you think about it; a double-struck coin is just a mistake - a misshapen, probably ugly artifact. But people collect them because they're unique objects made by an official government entity.</p>
<p>For practical purposes, commemorative silver coins aren't much use as money, because it would be silly to spend them for a fraction of what you paid for them. But since the mint is authorized by the government to imbue them with a cash value, they do so, and collectors love it.</p>
<p>The short answer, then, is because people will pay that much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>the majority of insects have 4 wings: 2 fore wings and 2 hindwings. flies are the only insect order (group) that have modified hindwings called halteres (they look like little drumsticks). these halteres are what allow flies to have superior agility to other insects - they act as dynamic counter-balances in flight. perhaps this has something to do with their name...they're excellent fliers!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Bees are the buzzy, flowery ones, wasps are the angry, stingy ones, dragonflies are the long, elegant ones, ladybugs are the pretty, spotted ones.
But with flies they don't do anything else. They are teeny black specks that fly around for about a day then die. They're only &quot;flies&quot; because there's almost literally nothing else you could possibly name them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both correct answers are here already but neither in the same post with one another.  First, water has high heat capacity.  That means that even a small change in temperature for water = a ton of energy.  So 200 degree water has thousands of times more heat than air for every degree of temperature change, and that's based on MASS.  The density of water is much higher than that of air so there's a lot more of it close to you when you're exposed to it.  Finally, because of the density, it transfers energy much much faster.  Heat is transferred when molecules hit one another - more density means more molecules close together, which means more collisions = faster energy transfer.</p>
<p>For an example of this at work try to bake a potato in a 450 deg F oven while boiling one in 212 deg F (boiling) water.  Should go alot faster in the water.</p>
<p>tl;dr - Water has more energy in a smaller space and transfers that energy much faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is at a very high temperature but it does not transfer that temperature to your skin. Water is about 30 times better at transferring heat.

<p>It's the reverse of why standing naked in 50 degree air will be cold but bearable for maybe half an hour, but jump into 50 degree water and you'll be unconscious from cold in a few minutes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Humid air, like is in a sauna, is a better conductor, but still not close to water. It works the opposite way too. If you put your hand in a freezer, or somewhere it's very cold, it doesn't make your hand very cold quickly, but if you touch a better conductor of heat such as ice or metal, it will feel much colder than the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>You might want to look into the Monitoring Capabilities of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).  You can read a bit about it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/10471/chapter/5" target="_blank">https://www.nap.edu/read/10471/chapter/5</a></p>
<p>Basically, radiochemical analysis can tell you information about the bomb design and the metallurgical refinement techniques of the fissile material (which a lot of people don't know is the majority of the &quot;technology&quot; of a nuclear bomb).  However, whether that can be mapped to a specific nation state, or even a specific manufacturing facility ultimately depends on how much we know about that nation state and its nuclear weapon manufacturing facilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Retired Nuclear Engineer here.</p>
<p>When producing fissile material for weapons, there are multiple samples taken to determine the enrichment quality. There are also samples and pertinent data collected when inspecting the facilities for safety and efficiency. Because of variations in reactors, the specific facility can often be identified from records. And, in the case of agreements between countries, i.e. START, we have detailed records as well do the other countries of which facilities are capable of producing or do produce these materials for weapons.</p>
<p>For reasons like cost and the fact no one can test these things due to international treaties(I'm not including DPRK in that) the only way we know if weapons work when they are upgraded or recycled is because we can do the math and know the chemical composition of the fissile material due to its byproducts. And every reactor has a byproduct footprint. This footprint can reveal what reactor, what year, what month, and which part of the vessel the material came from. </p>
<p>We spend a massive amount of cash on maintaining the weapon stockpile in testing product chemistry and materials production. Not including maintenance on the delivery systems. And the delivery systems are much more complex than the payload. Once a country or organization learns how to make a bomb and gets the fuel right, it's actually a much (metaphorically)simpler mechanism than the wind up clock. Because for basics there are only two ways to go, (gun/implosion) and the more complex of the two (implosion) is 97% of the work for you to get to the one that makes the more predictable and scalable boom. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: So yeah, most of the time they can tell you not only where, but what part of a reactor the enriched fuel came from because they keep records and because it's the only way to make sure they work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Post detonation, that is obviously not something that can still be done. </p>
<p>Post detonation you can get clues to determine things like, was it a fission device or a fusion device and clues about the yield. You may be able to tell Uranium vs Plutonium. Maybe someone more expert than me can respond to my post if they see it. I don't think there would be any definitive way to know for sure exactly what facility inside a country manufactured it without other knowledge/intel outside the detonation. So I would highly doubt you could tell exactly where the bomb came from using physics alone.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
