		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people seem to be saying &quot;so they can target ads&quot; or &quot;so they get lots of information about you&quot;, but that's not really the case. Let me explain a bit about how this works.</p>
<p>When you click &quot;log in with Facebook&quot;, the website sends you to a website controlled by Facebook (not them) that asks you to log in if you aren't already logged in, and then asks you to authorize their application to access certain information. If you click OK, then it sends a token to that website allowing them to access only the information that they requested access to.</p>
<p>That Facebook page will tell you what they are requesting access to. The list of things they can ask for is on <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/" target="_blank">this page</a>, but most of these websites just ask for the basics- public_profile and maybe email, so they'll get your name, profile picture, and your email, but they won't have access to your likes or your friends list or anything like that. If they do want access to that other stuff, the page will tell you. You should always read this page to make sure that random websites aren't requesting permission to spam all your friends and like pages on your behalf. </p>
<p>The advantage of this to Facebook is that you have more stuff tied to your Facebook account so you become more tied to the Facebook ecosystem. They also know what app/website you're using, but they don't know enough about what you're using the app for to target any additional ads to you.</p>
<p>For the website, there are two main benefits.</p>
<p>First of all, the sign-up flow is way easier- it's literally just two clicks if you're already signed in to Facebook. If they need a bunch of information from you, they'd otherwise need a much longer sign-up process, and a lot of people tend to give up if the sign-up process is too long. </p>
<p>Second, they get to take advantage of all of Facebook's security. Facebook has something like 17,000 employees. They have whole teams just dedicated to keeping your information safe. Joe's Forum does not have whole teams dedicated to keeping your information safe, so it's much more likely that Joe gets hacked than Facebook. That means Joe doesn't have to worry about stopping hackers from creating tons of fake accounts, and if his website does get hacked, the hackers won't get access to all of his user's personal information (since all of that is stored in Facebook).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I mention the concept of &quot;friction&quot; because there are tons of website out there competing for your attention.

These are very useful pieces of information when collected on a large scale, and very profitable.</p>
<p>If they get you to create an account without using Facebook, you're still handing them you're email address, which is still useful. </p>
<p>It all boils down to this simple fact: if a service is free, then you are not the customer, you are the product. Any time you use a free product, try to think of what information you're giving them and how you are being marketed as a product. </p>
<p>Edit: Also, there's a difference between something like Spotify allowing you to login through Facebook and that stupid quiz to find out what Disney princess you are that your friend shared asking you to login through Facebook. One of them is a service that you're likely to use a lot, and they are outsourcing the authentication infrastructure to Facebook, the other is just trying to collect information to sell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

			<a href="/posts/6m8jly" onclick="return false">In Olympic rowing, why do all the players (on a single boat) row in sync rather than alternatively, for instance half team pulling and other half recovering, thus, resulting in a smoother motion?</a>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trivial answer is to &quot;go faster&quot; but why does that happen?
What is actually involved that makes the boat go faster while rowing all in sync instead of alternatively?</p>
<p>[edit] What I mean by alternatively, is, suppose the whole team (present on boat) is divided into 2 halves, A &amp; B. To move through the water, first the team A pulls the boat (using their oars) and when they have finished their power stroke then team B does the pulling. So, when team A is done pulling it goes into its recovery phase. Meanwhile, team B pulls the boat. And then A again, and so on continuing as ABAB... (What I DON'T mean is half team is pulling for half the distance and other half for the left over distance).</p>
<p>[edit 2]
Thank you for all your responses. </p>
<p>Summary of the reasons (mentioned in the thread) rowing is done in sync and not otherwise:</p>
<p>Limited Space on boat   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making it unable for rowers to go out of sync</p>
</li>
<li>The oars hitting one another</li>
</ul>
<p>Boat imbalance  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unnecessary stresses on the boat when rowers are going in opposite directions</p>
</li>
<li>Half rowers on one side in sync with each other but completely out-of-sync with the other side, make the boat go zig-zag, increasing the distance they're covering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Half of the rowers pulling the weight of other half who are recovering, halves the acceleration (not exactly though), which is not desirable.</p>
<p>Synchronization becomes unmanageable. </p>
<p>While in recovery, rowers move in a direction opposite to the motion of boat, thus the pseudo force pushes the boat forward, slightly though. If the rowers were alternating, the motion of the rowers would cancel out and thus
wasted.    </p>
<p>When a boat is being rowed, if half the rowers have completed their pull, the water is set into motion, and some rower of the other half will be applying the force with the oar in moving-water, thus inefficiency in its application </p></div></div>

<p>If you mean the first two people pull both left and right, while the next two recover, you're losing 1/2 your power in each stroke. Those boats are designed to have minimal drag so the gliding phase is less of a loss than losing 1/2 your power. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So you're watching Olympic rowing and somehow think it's not smooth enough???</p>
<p>The absolutely <em>simplest</em> answer here is that the way it's done now means there's zero chance of anyone's oars hitting someone else's. And that reason in and of itself is worth not taking the risk.</p>
<p>It's also a lot easier to stay in sync when you work as a team than as two teams. You'll notice there's one pacer per boat; your way would mean either two or on doing two jobs. </p>
<p>Plus, as with many things, it boils down to tradition. That's how they've always rowed; that's how they row now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics tells me that, given you can apply the same forward force even if split up, it's more efficient to do so. This is because drag force is relative to the velocity squared, so high velocity is punished harder than what you save from low velocity - keeping the average velocity is more efficient. I'm not sure how much difference this makes though. (1^2 +1^2 =2 while 0.5^2 +1.5^2 =2.5, 25% more drag force if you evenly shift between 0.5 and 1.5m/s compared to a constant 1m/s, although the average speed is still 1m/s)</p>
<p>So why don't they do that?</p>
<p>1) As others have mentioned, there may simply not be space for the oars to be out of sync. While this is probably true, if it was more efficient, I imagine the boats would be designed for that, so I don't buy this fully as a single explanation.</p>
<p>So I'll add two other possible reasons, just speculations from my part:</p>
<p>2) Being at the boats lowest speed when putting down the oars may also allow each rowman to add more force each stroke compared to if they put it down at a speed closer to the average, so my initial assumption may be incorrect.</p>
<p>3) Being out of sync means some rowmen has to wait half a stroke into the race before starting to add their force, this sounds inefficient, it's likely that half the rowmen will put one less stroke into the water by the end of the race.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason, besides oars colliding, is that more power in the stroke means more speed, which lifts the hull further out of the water, so there's less drag, which means even more speed.  It's like a multiplying effect.  Having people stroke at different times means the hull never lifts very much, so you don't get that increase in speed.</p>
<p>See also &quot;hull speed&quot;.  It takes a lot less power to skim over the water than to push through it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen it explained this way: the immune system has two major branches.  One mostly fights bacterial invaders, and the other fights parasites, like worms. </p>
<p>Humans co-evolved with worms.  We have been in an arms race with the annelids since before there were humans at all.  Basically every human, everywhere, carried a worm burden.  It wasn't a question of &quot;if&quot;, it was &quot;how many&quot;.   The last hundred years or so are the first time, in all of human history, that we haven't all been loaded down with the little jerks. </p>
<p>One current hypothesis right now (edging into theory, perhaps, but I believe it's still a hypothesis at the moment), is that in the absence of anything to attack, the anti-parasite branch of the immune system goes after other, random stuff.   It wildly overreacts to the wrong proteins, because it's never seen the <em>right</em> proteins.  In addition, worms that routinely infect humans also secrete chemicals that moderate the immune response, so between the two things (lack of moderating chemicals, and lack of invaders to fight), we end up with pollen allergies. </p>
<p>There's pretty good evidence that dosing yourself with worms will reduce or even eliminate allergies and some auto-immune disorders.  Pig whipworms are a common treatment; you drink a glass with some eggs in it, and they set up shop in your intestine.  They can live in us, lasting about a year, but they can't successfully reproduce, so you get the benefit of worms in your system without being infectious.  </p>
<p>This is a real treatment, administered by real doctors.  It's called &quot;helminthic therapy&quot;.  I haven't tried it, but overall reports seem pretty positive.  It doesn't work for everyone, but it works often enough to be very interesting for those with immune-system issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>To give some further background on the immune system:</em><br />
Allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to specific molecules.    </p>
<p>Your immune system has several varieties of <strong>antibody</strong> (the parts that detect pathogens and cause immune reactions).<br />
Five in fact:  </p>
<ul>
<li>IgA  </li>
<li>IgD  </li>
<li>IgE  </li>
<li>IgG  </li>
<li>IgM  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IgE</strong> is the antibody which is associated with allergies (an overreaction by this antibody).    </p>
<p>Interestingly; IgE is only found in mammals - making it 'young' (on the evolutionary timeline) compared to those found in fish, reptiles, and insects.      </p>
<p>Part of the theory behind allergies considers that IgE is 'new', its cutting edge, and could be considered an work-in-progress (in evolutionary terms).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is a theory that we have achieved such a level of cleanness in our homes that sometimes the immune system cannot develop properly, and becomes prone to false positives, such as pollen or many other things. People who grow up in a more dirty environment usually don't tend to develop allergies as much as those who grew up in clean environments. If the theory is true, then it makes sense that this condition is fairly recent in human history, so evolution would not have had time to &quot;figure it out&quot; yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also, this is used when getting a 'perm' - they add  ammonium thioglycolate (afaik - might be any generic reducing agent) to your hair which react with the keratin to release the sulphur molecules to form semi-permanent hydrogen bonds. These retains the hairs shape until it eventually washes out after some time.
Alternatively, when getting your hair chemically straightened they add calcium hydroxide or some other non-lye based straighteners to reduce the number of disulphide bonds in the proteins that are in your hair, causing it to be less frizzy or curly. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body creates chemicals naturally that control various things, which make you feel happy, sad, horny, energetic, etc. These are things like dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, etc. These chemicals traverse your body via the nervous system. There are receptors in each nerve that &quot;moves&quot; the chemicals along. </p>
<p>Use of external chemicals (heroin in this case) add in a supply of chemicals that bind to your receptors. Given the abundance of said chemical, your body reacts by shutting down functions - it doesn't need to spend energy making something that it has enough of. </p>
<p>I like to use the following analogy to explain it simply - it leaves out complexities of metabolism, equilibrium, and parasympathetic activities but is easy to visualize: </p>
<p>Pretend there is a factory, a warehouse and a consumer in your body. Factory makes the chemicals and ships to warehouse. Warehouse sends chemicals to the consumer. One day the warehouse receives a shipment of heroin, which is an adequate substitute for your body's naturally made morphine. The shipping trucks load up and deliver to the consumer - who to their surprise, says they don't need it yet and to come back later. The trucks return to the warehouse full. So they overfill the warehouse with the unused heroin, and the warehouse calls the factory to say they don't need anymore for a couple days. The factory employees get laid off until they need to start again. The factory workers go on vacation as a result.  </p>
<p>Another shipment of heroin comes in as the consumer starts needing more, and so the factory still isn't producing but the consumer continues to run, happily. The factory layoff continues, so the workers start going out of town and what not. This keeps happening as the heroin shipment from this mysterious benefactor keeps coming. Expecting another heroin shipment, the factory layoff continues, except that the shipment never shows up. No problem, the overstock can be delivered. As the supply at the warehouse starts to dwindle, the factory workers start getting recalled. Except, a few are on a cruise, a few got super wasted, a few aren't answering the phones, a few got locked up streaking around a college campus. The boss is getting pissed, but what can the boss do?</p>
<p>Now the consumer doesn't have any chemicals that it really needs. This is when withdrawals begin. The super drunk guys eventually sober up and wander back to the factory, but three guys can't do all the jobs themselves. In all, it took about two weeks to get the factory back to full staff, making morphine again. </p>
<p>Selective Serotonin Re uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) block the serotonin receptors, causing your body to make <em>more</em> serotonin because the tank is reading empty. </p>
<p>Along with this analogy, the trucks going to the consumer never showed up with the SSRIs (they really did, but they never filled out their log book saying they did). As a result, the warehouse is going below its level trying to keep the consumer happy, who in turn calls the factory to order twice as much. The consumer is happier because it's getting twice the serotonin for the same price as a single lot!</p>
<p>This is intentionally oversimplified for a basic ELI5 understanding. Drugs and the human body are crazy complicated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a much, much simpler eli5.</p>
<p>Every circuit the brain needs an opposing system to slow it down and keep things balanced. Because the opiate system is extremely complex, let's just call them the wellness and pain system. Your body produces heroin-like substances that help do that for pain and wellness circuit.</p>
<p>heroin is way more powerful than what we naturally produce, and the circuits get used to heroin and our natural balancing systems aren't strong enough to counteract the desensitization. </p>
<p>Once the person doesn't have anymore heroin, the pain and wellness circuits have nothing to balance them out, and the person feels a lot of pain and a lot of unwellness, called opiate-induced hyperalgesia. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Deeper cuts</strong></p>
<p>If we want to go deeper, it's receptor based. Heroin binds to wellness (opiate) receptors and puts them into overdrive. The body senses this powerful signal and reduces the number of receptors in an effort to normalize the signal. </p>
<p>When you no longer have that powerful artificial signal, the circuit isn't normalized, it's underdriven. The brain just doesn't have enough juice to keep the pain circuit under control.</p>
<p>Dope sickness is due to the fact that we have opiate receptors all throughout our body. They regulate not only pain, but hormonal stress. If you fuck with all those things at once, you get fluishness as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With small wounds, the nearby cells can replicate and grow to fill in the gap. This is a normal process of healing for small scrapes, cuts, and other penetrating insults. </p>
<p>But with larger wounds, like deep gashes, lacerations, or punctures, there really isn't a way for the nearby cells to replicate to fill in the void. It's too big. So instead, the body tries to fill in the void with a mass of connective tissue instead of living cells. The connective tissue is composed of long biopolymers and structural proteins that overlap in sheets to re-connect the tissue and cover the wound. </p>
<p>This connective tissue in the scar is mechanically stronger than normal cells which makes the scar less likely to tear or get cut again. However, the skin on the edges of a scar don't have this benefit, and are actually more likely to tear because they're right on the boundary between healthy cell and connective tissue.</p>
<p>Where your skin is living and growing, the connective tissue is static. That's why it never really changes. It might shrink or fade very, very slowly (over the course of decades), but depending on the size of the scar, it won't ever go away completely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all a matter of priorities.</p>
<p>Somee animals heal without scars.  One of the best examples is the Axolotl, which can regrow limbs, and even solid organs.</p>
<p>Small mammals, especially rodents heal with minimal scarring.</p>
<p>Larger animals, especially mammals scar.  This is because we have evolutionarily prioritised healing sounds quickly to prevent infection, over scarless healing.  </p>
<p>Similarly, an embryo, and an early foetus can heal without scar.</p>
<p>Many things seen to contribute, including:</p>
<p>Wound tension - embryonic skin (and those of small mammals such as rodents) have much less skin tension.  Tension across a wound stimulates formation of fibroblasts from stem cells, which ultimately lead to scar tissue.  It also leads to further differentiation to myofibroblasts, which contract and shrink the wound, making it smaller (and therefore healing quicker)</p>
<p>Neutrophils - animals that heal without scar seem to have a much more macrophage driven wound milieu.  Again this goes back to infection resistance, especially to bacterial infection.  Both cell types are phagocytes, but macrophages have a much more complicated role beyond eating bugs.  This is also part of the reason infected wound healing with worse scars than clean wound</p>
<p>The way the wound is closed (or not closed) plays an important role.  If the wound is directly in contact with the other side (such as a surgically sutured wound - healing by primary intension) it will heal with less scar than a wound that is left open (healing by secondary intension), such as a burn or an infected wound.</p>
<p>There are examples of larger mammals healing without scar (the largest I am aware of is deer antlers), and this is an area of research to identify ways to manipulate scarring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>All wounds scar. Every one of them.
But then why can see a scar due to an accident but not a scar in a surgically incised wound after a few weeks? </p>
<p>Well, our entire body is covered by Langer's Lines.
These are the direction in which the collagen in the skin is arranged and deposited, and regrows if damaged. </p>
<p>Cutting along (parallel) to these lines leads to less scarring and if the suturing along it is done well, almost none can be seen after a few months. </p>
<p>If however the wound is haphazard or goes across these lines (perpendicular or any other non-parallel way), or not sutured along these lines, the collagen deposits in a way that the scar is very evident, sometimes persistent for life. </p>
<p>In short, a scar cannot heal, its already the healed form of a wound. </p>
<p>Wounds scar depending on how they are inflicted with respect to Langer's lines. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello /r/askscience </p>
<p>I had a really long night trying to understand any explaination, but I couldn't jump to any conclusion.</p>
<p>A common explaination to why an e.g. electron has a magnetic field when moving is the experiment with a wire with protons and electrons and an electron outside the wire.
Because of special relativity, the Coulomb's law experienced from the electrons point of view (the wire is moving, density of protons increases from their point of view), it must translate to a magnetic field from our point of view.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is: How can you explain it in a case that I've drawn here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/D3d7r64.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/D3d7r64.jpg</a></p>
<p>The moving electron with a constant velocity is in a vacuum (PART A), there is no other charge or anything, so relative to the current point of view, with what is it interacting to produce a magnetic field? Or is there no magnetic field of the electron in Part A? If so, why does it have one in Part B?</p>
<p>//EDIT: To clarify, my question is why there is a magnetic field produced by the electron around itself. The big square (magnetic field) in the image is just to show that the electron must have one because it is deflected.</p>
<p>I hope that most of my question is correct.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></div></div>

I take it that in part B you are showing an <em>external</em> magnetic field produced by some means other than the electron's own magnetic field. It sounds like you are thinking that the electron will only deflect if it has its own magnetic field, which is wrong. The deflection of the electron in an external magnetic field is due to the external magnetic field, and has nothing to do with whether the electron itself has a magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

These types of phenomena are so distinctive in their behaviour that classically they were thought of as two different interactions - an electric field and a magnetic field. In reality, they are the same thing.</p>
<p>Back to the issue of the moving electron. The moving electron has a potential for change in behaviour surrounding it, and when we bring another charged particle within that space surrounding it, the two particles interact via exchanges of photons. A part of the resulting behaviour that results depends on the position of the electron and a part of that behaviour depends on the motion of the electron. Classically, we called it the electric and magnetic field because they depend on two different things.</p>
<p>Think of waves interacting. Do you know much about quantum mechanics? Let's take for example a particle in an infinite square well. A particle in the lowest energy state forms a standing wave, the expectation value of the momentum is 0 and the expectation value of the position is in the centre. A particle in the second lowest energy state also forms a standing wave with a different energy, and yet the expectation value of its momentum is 0, and the expectation value of the position is in the centre of the well also. But if we take a linear sum of the two energy states - a particle in a mixed state - then the expectation value of the position takes on a time dependence, and the momentum is no longer zero. Two standing waves added up to form something that was no longer stationary.</p>
<p>Similarly with the electron and the magnetic field - the electron is emitting virtual photons around it to produce the &quot;field&quot;. When the electron is stationary, those virtual photons add up in a particular way that we characterize as an electric field. When the electron is moving, those virtual photons add up in a particular way that a different kind of behaviour occurs that we characterize as a magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>To clarify, my question is why there is a magnetic field produced by the electron around itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is tricky. See <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/224064/do-moving-charges-get-affected-by-the-magnetic-field-they-create-while-moving-to" target="_blank">here</a> </p>
<p>In particular, it's mentioned that Jefemienko's equations should be used when particles are not static. And in that case, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefimenko%27s_equations#Discussion" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... since each of these equations connects quantities simultaneous in time, none of these equations can represent a causal relation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, it's my understanding that electromagnetic fields are a little like gravity. We're not sure why they are created, only that there are fields under certain conditions. </p>
<p>In your specific drawing, usually that example is given for a charged partical in an <em>externally</em> applied magnetic field to show the deflection of the charged particle. I can't remember if it was discussed in class as to whether the charged particle deflects itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Nothing: the electromagnetic field of a moving charge has B-field components. It doesn't need to &quot;interact&quot; with anything.</p>
<p>Ignore SR for a moment. We can find an easy explanation in Ampere's Law: a changing electric field produces a magnetic field. </p>
<p>As the electron travels, the electric field in the area changes, resulting in a magnetic field. Done!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big square (magnetic field) in the image is just to show that the electron must have one because it is deflected.</p>

<p>Not so. Charges are deflected in magnetic fields--it has nothing to do with whether or not the charge is producing its own magnetic field. </p>
<p>And how could it? A charge doesn't &quot;see&quot; it's own field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Forces can be approximately described as being mediated by &quot;virtual particles&quot; in the approximation framework known as perturbation theory. For example, electrons interact via the electromagnetic field, and ripples in the electromagnetic field are called photons. So it makes sense that you could approximately describe the interaction between electrons in terms of exchanges of ripples in the electromagnetic field.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do not know your background, so if this is too advanced please let me know.</p>
<p>The notion that forces are mediated through particles is a bit misleading, but we can give an explanation in a QFT framework.</p>
<p>A particle is an excitation of a field (e.g. the electron field), i.e. a state in a Fock space. Particles can have different charges, which characterise their transformation properties under the internal symmetries. For example, the electric charge of a particle corresponds to a global U(1) symmetry.</p>
<p>We also have to distinguish between on-shell particles (they satisfy the equations of motion) and off-shell / virtual particles (they do not satisfy the eom, and they are not, in fact, particles)</p>
<p>A very successfull branch of theories are so-called gauge theories. Here, we take a QFT with a global symmetry and impose it also locally (i.e. the transformation may now depend on one space-time coordinate). To impose this symmetry, we need to introduce additional fields to our theory, so-called gauge fields. These gauge fields are the fields that &quot;mediate&quot; the forces, e.g. the photon field for U(1), the gluon field for SU(3) and so forth.</p>
<p>Now how does this work?</p>
<p>The local gauge symmetry generates couplings between the charged matter fields and the gauge fields, so the two fields interact.</p>
<p>Now let's consider on-shell particles. Examples are the electron or the photon. They satisfy the equations of motion, and they are what we use e.g. in electron beams. As the electron is charged, it will react with the gauge field (the electromagnetic field for example). So you can imagine that the field around the electron is perturbed. These perturbations are not photons. They are &quot;virtual&quot; photons.</p>
<p>Imagine two electrons passing by each other. Both will cause disturbances in the electromagnetic field, and both will react to these disturbances (they will repel). The process can be treated perturbatively, and diagrammatically using Feynman diagrams. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Bhabha_T_channel.svg/220px-Bhabha_T_channel.svg.png" target="_blank">They look like this</a></p>
<p>This example is an electron-positron scattering.</p>
<p>Now, we can interpret this as the exchange of a &quot;photon&quot; (the curly line) between an electron and a positron (the straight lines). However, the &quot;photon&quot; in the diagram is not an on-shell photon, it is a virtual particle, a disturbance in the electromagnetic field, and it is only the first term in a perturbative expansion (there can be higher order terms with loops, quantum corrections).
So to answer your question in short:</p>
<p>How are forces mediated through particles: They are not.
However, one could think of them being mediated through the exchange of virtual particles, but then one has to keep in mind that they do not have the same properties as an exchange of real particles (e.g. forces can be attractive).</p>
<p>If you want to read further on this, a much more detailed and better explanation can be found <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/virtual_particles.html" target="_blank">here</a> a bit more mathematical.</p>
<p>If there is anything unclear, or I should elaborate on anything, please let me know :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by seeing. Seeing in the visible means picking up the light field of many fundamental emitters. You cannot resolve the structure of an atom with light in the visible wavelength regime as the atom is already the fundamental emitter. But you can still associate emissions to single atoms if you separate them far enough. That's something that for example can be done with optical lattices where you store single atoms in regular grids that are made from laser fields. <a href="https://www.mpg.de/1230541/zoom-1300288025.jpg" target="_blank">These pictures</a> are 'drawn' by altering the state of single atoms in such a grid - each pixel is one atom. You can also distinguish the emissions of single atoms in ion traps, where they usually are spaced even further apart as it is done <a href="http://www.quantumoptics.at/images/lintrap/8ionen.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. In each case you have to shine light of certain resonant frequency at the atoms so that they are excited again and again and therefore produce sufficiently many photons that you can detect the fluorescence.</p>
<p>Mind that you do not resolve the atoms and that the pictures are blurred out such that the fluorescence looks much larger then the actual atoms. This is not only a purely technical limitation - you can resolve patterns at the order of the wavelength that you are using for imaging and for visible light this wavelength is significantly larger than atoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
