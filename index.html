		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit late to the party and I think /u/AgoraiosBum summed it up well, but I'd like to add a little more. I realize this goes a bit beyond &quot;ELI5&quot; but I think the issue also goes a bit farther than poor drinking water and is worth talking about. China is currently investing in some of the largest and most expensive engineering projects in world history to deal with their water issues, and these projects could have impacts outside their borders. Here's a few key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>China has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great" target="_blank">thousands of years of history</a> in creating (and destroying) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_\(China\)" target="_blank">water-management infrastructure</a>, the combined effect of which has been the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources_of_China#cite_note-1" target="_blank">severe depletion of groundwater</a> reserves and increasing desertification in some parts of the country. The most visible effect of this has been the <a href="http://chinawaterrisk.org/opinions/yellow-river-changing-course/" target="_blank">changing course</a> of the Yellow River. In modern history there have been several years where the river has not reached the sea due to overuse and drought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industrial waste and fertilizer continue to pollute several major waterways, especially the Huai River system which is home to the famous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/04/china-villages-cancer-deaths" target="_blank">&quot;cancer villages.&quot;</a> Over 80% of China's remaining groundwater is also contaminated, <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1935314/80-cent-groundwater-chinas-major-river-basins-unsafe" target="_blank">primarily by toxic metals</a> from industry and fertilizer runoff. Incidents usually get cleaned up but because economic development is so important polluters often get away with minor punishments and end up polluting again. Part of the problem is that it's currently cheaper for many factories to pay the fines than to follow environmental regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Northern China (including Beijing) has a much bigger problem than Southern China. A major part of the infrastructure being created to deal with this problem is the [South–North Water Transfer Project] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%E2%80%93North_Water_Transfer_Project" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%E2%80%93North_Water_Transfer_Project</a>). The basic concept is to divert water from the Yangtze River Valley to help alleviate shortages in the North. The not-so-basic part is that it has already cost over $79 billion dollars (over twice as much as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" target="_blank">Three Gorges Dam</a>), led to the resettlement of over 300,000 people, and only one of the three main routes has been completed. That route has already begun pumping about 10km^3 of water per year to the North, which is expected to rise to between 12 and 13km^3 by 2030. It's also worth noting that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02water.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">as the impact of the project has become clearer</a>, new projects have had to be started in order to compensate for environmental damage and water loss along the canal routes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some solutions have the potential to become diplomatic issues. China controls the headwaters of the Ganges, and <a href="https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4349-Diversion-debate" target="_blank">some discussion</a> has occurred among academics about diverting Tibetan waters in order to deal with the crisis. So far though these are just hypothetical plans for what could happen if the crises becomes significantly worse.</p>
</li>
<li>Desalination is a <a href="http://www.waterworld.com/articles/wwi/print/volume-25/issue-6/regional-spotlight-asia-pacific/market-report-developing-desalination.html" target="_blank">growing market</a> in China, and makes sense since a huge portion of the population lives along the coastline. While desalination plants have been slow to spring up due to huge investment costs, over time more plants might become viable and help ease some of the burden off of natural freshwater systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the question of &quot;how bad is it?&quot; is difficult to answer at this point because a lot of solutions are still panning out, and new policies are being created and tested. If you'd like to learn more about the history of water crises and water management in China, I recommend <em><a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058248" target="_blank">The Yellow River</a></em> by David Pietz, which was published in 2015 and is pretty up to date.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess I should mention I'm getting a M.A. in China Studies and this was part of my research for a paper on environmental litigation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's bad. There are no safety or environmental standards in China and where there are, they are either ignored, data is misreported or monitoring equipment is manipulated. Toxic waste is just dumped, on land, in rivers or at sea because it's easier and less expensive. On land this eventually gets into the water table causing any water to come up from it to be polluted in some way. </p>
<p>The food, water and air are all poisoned. To give you some idea of how bad the air is, the PM2.5 air partical scale only officially goes up to 500 because the people who made it couldn't conceive of a place on Earth so awful. In the Winter, you can regularly see levels go as high as 1000. 150 is considered hazardous. </p>
<p>You're seeing a lot of news about green China is right now, I can assure you it's all propaganda and promises to do something eventually. And I expect to get a lot of down votes by people who have never lived in China or Hong Kong. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's what etymonline has to say about it.  It comes from the Old English word &quot;hrere&quot; which meant lightly cooked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;undercooked,&quot; 1650s, variant of Middle English rere, from Old English hrere &quot;lightly cooked,&quot; probably related to hreran &quot;to stir, move, shake, agitate,&quot; from Proto-Germanic <em>hrorjan (source also of Old Frisian hrera &quot;to stir, move,&quot; Old Saxon hrorian, Dutch roeren, German rühren, Old Norse hroera), from PIE root </em>kere- &quot;to mix, confuse; cook&quot; (source also of Greek kera- &quot;to mix,&quot; krasis &quot;mixture&quot;). Originally of eggs, not recorded in reference to meat until 1784, and according to OED, in this sense &quot;formerly often regarded as an Americanism, although it was current in many English dialects ....&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: since this reply gained some traction, I'll pimp etymonline a bit.  It is a great site for understanding why a particular word has its specific meaning.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pathogens we aim to kill with heat are almost exclusively on the surface of the meat. Which is seared to a proper temp even when the middle is &quot;rare&quot;. The type of food born illness that resides in bad meat is not gotten rid of via heat (or any other means). This is why ground beef is inherently more dangerous because once you grind larger pieces of meat you mix in any surface pathogens with the entirety of the product. This is also why my answer is specific to steaks and not burgers. </p>
<p>We have to understand as consumers that food born illness such as e. coli are by in large the result of the contamination of a product from an outside source. This usually means that the surface of a product is ground zero for our attention. Hell, cantaloupes are one of the biggest culprits of salmonella. The pathogen can contaminate the rind of the melon and we we slice into it with a knife we drag salmonella into and across the surface of the pieces of fruit we're going to eat. This is why we wash our produce before consumption (even if it is organic and/or labeled pre-washed). </p>
<p>Source: Am Chef</p>
<p>TL;DR When it comes to getting sick, the surface of a steak is the part that need to be brought up to temperature unless you are dealing with rotted meat, in which case no amount of heat will save you. Wash your vegetables. </p>
<p>Also, please don't wash your chickens in the sink with soap and water. Just thoroughly wash the things that come in contact with the raw product. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Of note, it is important to distinguish that food label calories actually represent metabolizable energy, which is total caloric content minus calories that are presumably not absorbed by the body and excreted as waste. Therefore, the absolute amount of calories in food is higher than the calories stated on the label and this was evident in our sample of snack food items (6.7 kcal [−4.9, 31.9], p \&lt; 0.05). Since nutrient absorption has a high inter-individual variability in humans (22), it may be of more value to report gross calories on food labels as a more reproducible measure of caloric content in prepackaged snack food items.</p>

<p>Do calories always go to energy + fat storage or can some be wasted?  I'm not sure what &quot;losses during digestion&quot; means in the original question.  I assume it means they leave the body in some way without the nutrients being used, ie there are still calories leftover.</p>
</li>
<li>Does meal size have any factor in this?  For example if you ate a 2000 calorie meal its safe to say some will get stored as fat but does the body ever say &quot;I don't want to deal with all this&quot; and ignore a couple hundred of those calories that go straight to waste?  Essentially the larger the meal the larger the larger % of calories are ignored.</li>

<p>Let's say you're on a wagon-wheel-like spaceship that's spinning such that the (sorry) centrifugal force inside the 'wheel' (where the crew would be) is equivalent to 1G. Now let's say you're climbing around the outside of the wheel, using handholds that you're tethered to with a metal cable. If you fell off, you'd be hanging off the wheel by the cable, spinning 'below' the wheel relative to the center of the wheel. In this circumstance, would you still be able to climb back up the cable, or is there some weird interaction with vacuum or spinning reference frames or some other weird space thing that would prevent this? Thanks!</p></div></div>

<p>As far as reference, if you're holding onto the rope it would just look like the spaceship weren't spinning the the universe around you was, just like on a merry-go-round.</p>
<p>The only real strange thing is the spaceship would need an equal counterbalance exactly your weight+the rope's weight or it would have a funky rotation as it spins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, one thing to think about would be, how long is the cable? The gravity on one of those theoretical space stations is simulated by centrifugal force, and that force increases as the distance from the centre of the wheel increases; in the centre, there would be no force, and presumably on the outside, 1G. Now, if you move away from the outside, getting further away, your rotational path is longer, and so you must move faster to cover it in the same time period; this means that you would experience more than 1G. If the tether was quite long compared to the radius of the ship, you might begin to experience quite a lot more than 1G, and you might not have the strength to pull yourself in.  I don't have the physics skills to calculate the actual numbers, tho, just the knowledge of the basic principles.</p>
<p>In addition to all of that, I really wonder how easy it would be to pull yourself up a steel cable even at 1G, especially wearing a space suit; it would have significant extra weight, and presumably it would also hinder your grip in the same way that other bulky gloves do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The center will be 0G's and as you move toward the outer edges it will increase to 1G then, exceed that as you continue. </p>
<p>So you could conceivably climb to the center, granted your pulling power exceeded the force on your body pulling you towards the outside of the circle. </p>
<p>(I am a laymen, this is simplified, feel free to correct me) </p>
<p>For example. I weight 170lbs. In the center, the force needed might be 5 lbs of force to propel yourself through 0G space. At 1G 170lbs of force or more is needed. (If you're pulling yourself up a rope) Anything beyond that is just going to multiply your body weight against the gravity amount. So 2G x 170lbs = 340lbs of weight to pull. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only should you be able to climb the rope, but when you first grab the rope, you also encounter a startling consequence of relativity. </p>
<p>Let's say that one day, you wake up in a room with no windows where I've taken you prisoner. There's a small hole in the top of the ceiling and a rope hanging down from it. I tell you to take hold of it, and you oblige. Everything feels normal. As you're just starting up, I ask you:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey /u/spark2 : are we in a gym on Earth where I've put up a few walls around a climbing rope, which is attached to a ceiling and held taut by gravity? Or are we in a spoke of my sinister wheeled spaceship, which is spinning in the void with this rope running out from the center, held taut by centrifugal force / centripetal acceleration?&quot;</p>
<p>One key early insight underpinning relativity is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_centrifugal_and_centripetal_forces#Role_in_developing_the_idea_of_inertial_frames_and_relativity" target="_blank">you absolutely cannot tell the difference</a>.</p>
<p>You know that when you're in a car making a sharp turn, your body tries to keep going straight, but your restraints bind you too the car, pressing on you and forcing you to accelerate in the new direction. On the rope, you're using your hands and muscles to stay bound to the rope, which takes prayer because you're trying to move in different directions, just like in the car. Yet the question I was really asking you as you climbed was this: does holding onto the rope require force because you're in flat space in the middle of nowhere, wanting to go in a straight line, and staying on the rope means being forced to follow an ever-curving path through that flat space? Or does staying on the rope require force because you're on Earth, in the curved space of the planet's gravity well, wanting to follow the curve, and staying on the rope means being forced follow an ever-straightening path in that curved space?</p>
<p>One of the core principles of modern physics is that the two possibilities are literally indistinguishable from your perspective, and both interpretations can be equally valid depending on your frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. It's such a natural thing we all know happens, I assumed the answer would be easy to find. Actually, it looks like we don't really know- although studies have confirmed what we all feel intuitively to be true, and performance at short-lasting exercises (sprints, cycle sprints, strength tests) are poorer in the morning than afternoon or evening. From <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46030736/The_effect_of_training_at_a_specific_tim20160528-24442-e21gke.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1497471290&amp;Signature=3eaYmOqIfSxibG75j02YB2DcZks%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Effect_of_Training_at_a_Specific_Tim.pdf" target="_blank">this review</a> here are some of the possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Body temperature: our core body temperature goes down when we sleep and goes up gradually when we wake up. It's possible that when we are warmer, our muscles do better because connective tissues move more freely, metabolic reactions occur more efficiently/quickly at their optimal temperature, muscles move more freely, and nerve impulses are even conducted slightly faster. This is supported by the fact that warming people up does seem to reduce the negative effect of morning, but warming up doesn't get rid of the effect completely, so it can't be the only problem. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in the way the nervous system works overnight vs during the day: commands from the brain travel down nerves in the spine to nerves further out that tell the muscles to move. It looks like the &quot;command centre&quot; in the brain/spine is less active early in the morning <em>and</em> the peripheral nerves are not transmitting with the same effectiveness early in the morning as later on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using muscles and connective tissue over the day makes them work better: this one is the most obvious one- by evening, we have used our muscles more than early in the morning. All that movement likely stretches out muscles and connective tissue, increasing range of movement (just like warming up did in point 1, but this part is independent of temperature) and therefore reducing the effort needed to perform tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>Maybe complicated metabolic stuff: it looks like muscle work has more aerobic (oxygen + food -&gt; energy + carbon dioxide) vs anaerobic (food -&gt; much less energy + lactic acid) contribution in the afternoon/evening than the morning. Why? I don't know.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yeah. Complicated and interesting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I seem to recall it has to do with your body preventing you from moving as you sleep to help you rest and relax - you don't want to thrash around and punch yourself in the face as you dream, so your body basically paralyzes you while you sleep.</p>
<p>This can take awhile to wear off, which is why you're weaker in the morning (after deep sleep).  This may also be the cause of sleep paralysis - you wake but your body is still in paralyzed mode, so you can't move.</p>

<li>
<p>To the extent that the US is &quot;hesitant&quot; with stem cell <em>research</em>, this has mostly to do with <em>embryonic</em> stem cell research. Why? Suffice it to say that, simply as a matter of fact, the issue of embryonic stem cell research is closely linked to the issue of abortion, which has been a political hot-button for the past forty years. But stem cell research based on non-embryonic sources continues apace with very little controversy. </p>
</li>
<li>To the extent that the US is &quot;hesitant&quot; with stem cell <em>therapy</em>, it is hardly unique. Other than bone marrow transplants (which have been performed for quite some time now), there really aren't all that many actual stem cell <em>therapies</em> that have been approved for clinical use anywhere in the world. The technology still in its infancy. <a href="http://www.closerlookatstemcells.org/stem-cells-and-medicine/nine-things-to-know-about-stem-cell-treatments" target="_blank">Very few usable therapeutic applications/uses have been definitively identified and perfected.</a> From that link:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The list of diseases for which stem cell treatments have been shown to be beneficial is still very short. The best-defined and most extensively used stem cell treatment is hematopoietic (or blood) stem cell transplantation, for example, bone marrow transplantation, to treat certain blood and immune system disorders or to rebuild the blood system after treatments for some kinds of cancer.</p>
<p>Some bone, skin and corneal (eye) injuries and diseases can be treated by grafting or implanting tissues, and the healing process relies on stem cells within this implanted tissue. These procedures are widely accepted as safe and effective by the medical community. All other applications of stem cells are yet to be proven in clinical trials and should be considered highly experimental.</p>

Planets and stars are so far away that our eye can't resolve this angle.  It all just looks to our eye like it's coming from one place.  </p>
<p>Whether it's a huge sun at an extreme distance or a small planet at an extreme distance, either way our eye can't detect anything more than that there is light come from a particular spot.  Our eye doesn't have the resolution to be able to detect that the light from the right and left edges of the body is coming from different places.</p>
<p>Think about it this way; imagine you are looking at a really pixelated picture of a small very bright light against a pitch black background.  All you can see in the photo to represent the light is a single big white pixel.  Now imagine you are looking at a picture of a much smaller very bright light against a pitch black background.  It will <em>still</em> look to you in the photo like a single white pixel.  There isn't enough resolution to tell the difference </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of the concept of angular resolution. Basically, any given aperture has a smallest possible angle that it can resolve, with the size of the angle being directly related to the size of the aperture. In our case the aperture is our eye, and it can see things of approximately an arcsecond or larger. Anything smaller than that, i.e. Stars, planets, etc. appears to be that size, regardless of how small it actually is because our eye simply can't bring it into focus on our retina at the true size. The light is blurred out to this minimum resolution, and thus most stars look the same size. </p>
<p>Edit: The bigger the aperture, the smaller the size it can resolve as well. This is why we build telescopes with huge mirrors. On earth they are also limited by what is called seeing, but in space, telescopes can be made bigger and bigger and the image will become clearer and clearer. (In theory)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that there is a thing associated with how we learn called &quot;long term potentiation,&quot; which basically means that when two things happen at the same time, like a sound and an emotion, for example, they become associated, so one can trigger the other. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, there was a famous experiment where babies were exposed to a loud noise, which scared them, and bunnies, and for much of their lives were afraid of bunnies, because they associated the visual stimulus (bunnies) with the scary thing (a loud sound).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So say you're an angsty teenage and you're feeling all angsty, and also listening to a particular album a lot. Your brain is going to associate those two things - that specific music and that specific emotion - for a long period of time afterwards. So a decade later, that music still evokes an extremely strong emotion. Because in your brain, the two things are tied together - one triggers the other.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This also explains why these responses are hyper-specific to each person. It requires a specific set of conditions - repeated exposure to the song at the same time as experiencing a specific emotion. That's not something someone else is going to have, so having them listen to the same song won't get the same response. In your case, you listen to music all the time, so this has probably happened for lots of songs, albums, even genres - that's why it can change your mood in seconds. But none of that would happen for someone who just doesn't listen to music. The associations aren't there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fun fact: you can use this as a hack to learn something effectively, like if you're studying for an exam. Listen to the same playlist or record while studying, then get it stuck in your head for the test. &quot;Hearing&quot; the music in your head will trigger memories of the material that you studied while that music was playing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are five separate problems.  These problems require storage that lasts a hundredth of a second and just smooths out voltage, to minutes or hours of storage, to days or months or years.  In order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dirty power: power sources need to react to the grid down to fractions of a second.  When the voltage is high/low or isn't a clean 60/50 Hz signal, you call it dirty power.  In conventional grids, the frequency and voltage of the grid is tied to how fast the generators are spinning- &quot;rotor inertia&quot;.  The fluctuations in the grid are literally smoothed out by having to speed up or slow down massive spinning steel armatures.  Obviously this means that solar PV can have a problem with this- if you have too much solar on at once and it isn't carefully regulated, the grid can become unstable if there isn't enough inertia.  Wind has this problem too but to a much lesser degree, and sometimes its even better than normal since you also have the inertia of the turbines.  The solutions to this problem are complex but mostly don't involve storage and aren't really a fundamental problem with renewables.  People like to throw around plots of German electricity being unstable but it's not really a big deal and afaik it's mostly related to poor controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load following: This is a real problem- sudden minute-by-minute spikes in load can destabilize some renewables.  Natural gas plants are used for this purpose in normal grids- you add more fuel to the turbine and it spools up the power.  With renewables you're usually operating near 100% of what you can currently output so you can't add more.  In principle renewables are extremely good at this as well, but currently they undercut peaker plants and reduce the number of plants responding to spikes.  Even so- this problem actually gets better the more renewables you add.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peak demand: Electric power <a href="http://www.mpoweruk.com/images/elec_load_demand.gif" target="_blank">varies</a> over the day.  Compare that to <a href="http://www.sma.de/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_Load-profile-and-consumption_EN_1d158c119d.jpg" target="_blank">solar power</a> over the day.  Power demand drops by 50% at night, but solar supply drops to 0%.  That's a huge problem- one of baseload.  You need storage of some kind to deal with this, even with wind.  We will absolutely need some kind of daily storage with renewable energy (aside from biomass or geothermal, which are not practical at scale).  There are two ways to deal with this.  At ~20%, you run into short-term problems- the supply will be less than the demand at some points, like the afternoon or very early morning.  You can deal with this using batteries, or you can simply build more solar panels.  Economically it is initially cheaper to build more panels but as solar starts to supply 60%+ of power, you need batteries for the remaining 30%+ because there simply is no sun.  This is the real point that we will unarguably need batteries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weather constraints: Sometimes it snows, or there is no wind or too much wind.  You need emergency storage.  This is a non-issue until 30%+ renewable energy, because the capacity we have greatly exceeds how much we use.  If all renewables just stop working, we'd have to put every other plant on full power, but we still wouldn't need storage.  It depends on the grid when this happens, but places with &quot;peakier&quot; daily needs will have more capacity and will be able to take more renewables.  Probably this will happen somewhere between 30-50% renewable penetration, at which point you'll need <em>some</em> storage.  The most common estimate is 3 days of stored renewables, but you won't need that right away.  3 days of storage is a lot more than it sounds like- grid-scale systems with dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU-hSFFwSmo" target="_blank">MPPT</a> controllers can still pull 50% power out of very poor weather, so 3 days of storage means you can last out week long constant storms before brown-outs.</p>
</li>
<li>Seasonal demand: Finally, there are <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/map_pv_us_december_dec2008.jpg" target="_blank">winter</a>/<a href="http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/map_pv_us_january_dec2008.jpg" target="_blank">summer</a> demand and supply changes (maps from <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html" target="_blank">here</a>).  This is totally impractical to solve with storage except underground gas storage.  In some cases (worst in the NW US, but still not good in the NE US), the combination of increased demand and decreased sunlight means you need <em>triple</em> the solar panels to supply enough power for winter.  NB: snow is less of a problem than you'd think.  At higher latitudes panels need to be tilted more so they face the sun- by the time you're far enough north to get snow, the panels are steep enough that snow slides off them naturally!</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, the crossover is 30-50% renewables depending on many factors.  Until then renewables are mostly different rather than disadvantaged.  &quot;Economically impossible&quot; is a vague term- currently 3 days of battery storage costs ~2x as much as the solar it would be storing.  That would imply that a 100% grid would cost 200% more than the current grid per kWh- is that economically impossible?  That increase would affect our quality of life relatively little, but still few people would <em>want</em> that.  At the same time the cost of a 100% solar grid with 3 days of storage would be a ~20 trillion dollar investment in the US.  That's the total annual GDP, or 5 years of the complete federal budget- a 100% renewable grid is a certain economic impossibility for decades because of the sheer cost of replacing what we have now.  I will also point out that even now grid scale storage is relatively affordable- averaged over half a century.  Better technology and price decreases ($400/kWh -&gt; $150/kWh) will make batteries very affordable.  That will happen over the next decade or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the local climate.</p>
<p>Here's a model looking at a scenario for all demand met by PV &amp; wind, using spare power to generate fuel which is burnt when there'd otherwise by a deficit: for <a href="http://energynumbers.info/balancing/?cy=gb&amp;example=1" target="_blank">Britain</a>, for <a href="http://energynumbers.info/balancing/?cy=de&amp;example=1" target="_blank">Germany</a>, for <a href="http://energynumbers.info/balancing/?cy=es&amp;example=1" target="_blank">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>For somewhere like Spain, we get about 85% of demand met in real time by wind + PV, with a chunk of over-production for export and/or storage. A similar proportion of real-time demand met in Britain &amp; German, requires a higher proportion of over-production.</p>
<p>Also, wind and solar aren't the only technologies available - there's hydro, biomass, and in some places geothermal too.</p>
<p>And we don't yet know how economical the advanced storage technologies (in the above example, power-to-gas) are, because we haven't scaled them up yet. It's early days - we haven't needed much storage, so there's been very little investment in grid-scale storage research &amp; development. That's starting to change now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
