		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can, indeed, define trig functions using ordinary arithmetic operations. The catch, as you can see, is that we have to use imaginary numbers. In particular, we have to use imaginary <em>exponents</em>, which behave weirdly compared to real exponents.</p>
<p>The reason that these functions seem so strange is that when you first encounter them, you don't about imaginary numbers, so you can't put them in terms of something you already understand. In fact, trigonometry as a whole long predates the formal idea of imaginary numbers.</p>
<p>However these functions were treated historically, I personally find that the usual definition in terms of triangles is needlessly opaque. I prefer to define them in terms of <em>circles</em>.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Unit_circle.svg" target="_blank">This</a></em> is what the sine and cosine mean.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Circle_cos_sin.gif" target="_blank">Animated version</a>.</p>
<p>Now, what is the connection to imaginary numbers? Take the function f(t) = e^(i·t). This looks rather abstruse^([difficult to understand; obscure]) — what does it mean to raise something to an <em>imaginary</em> power? Well, it turns out that it means <em>rotating</em> it! The function e^(i·t), when t is a real number (so that i·t is imaginary) always produces a point on the unit circle. When t=0, e^(i·t) = 1. But as t increases, e^(i·t) rotates around the unit circle counterclockwise. When t = 2π, e^(i·t) has gone all the way around and is back at 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity#/media/File:Euler%27s_formula.svg" target="_blank">Picture</a>.</p>
<p>You can see that this is almost exactly the same picture as the one defining sine and cosine. In fact, there is an even simpler way of defining sine and cosine:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b39d354fe272ab3508576234f99f9884115e1fa9" target="_blank">Image</a></p>
<p>In these equations, “Im(x)” means the imaginary part of x and “Re(x)” is the real part of x. For instance, Re(2 + 3i) = 2, and Im(2 + 3i) = 3. The real part and imaginary part functions are not ordinary arithmetic functions — they're more like the absolute value function. But using these definitions, we can indeed define sine and cosine using ordinary arithmetic functions:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/54c9315ebec2cf4de2424c145441ec2cd3e43ca5" target="_blank">Image</a>.</p>
<p>A little fiddling will result in “Euler's formula”:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b55e28219a34ac40f8f4a92e22302abb83c53bb" target="_blank">Image</a></p>
<p>And so we have an explicit definition of the sine and cosine in terms of familiar functions. The trade-off, obviously, is that now we have imaginary numbers to contend with! But imaginary numbers aren't so bad, and they really do make other things simpler. I find that explaining things <em>without</em> imaginary numbers is often more difficulty and complicated than just explaining imaginary numbers first. I've always wondered how much easier high school trig would be if you started with imaginary numbers and proceeded from there. Sure, it's not the way the ancients did it, but so what?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thought about removing “abstruse”, but instead added a definition because I really like that word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <strong><em>sine</em></strong> is a measure of vertical-<em>ness</em>. Imagine a Ferris wheel, the wheel rotates by an angle and the <strong>sine</strong> of that angle tells you how &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; you are on the wheel. (With -1 being at the very bottom, and 1 being at the very top).
The <strong><em>cosine</em></strong> is a measure of horizontal-<em>ness</em>. Using the Ferris wheel analogy, this would be how far &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right* you are on the wheel.
The <strong><em>tangent</em></strong> is the slope-<em>ness</em> of a ramp. It's the height divided by the base (or Sine divided by Cosine) 0 slope would be a horizontal ramp and infinite (undefined) would be a cliff face. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are the three basic <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions" target="_blank">trigonometric functions</a>.</p>
<p>Look at a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Trigonometry_triangle.svg" target="_blank">right triangle</a> (&quot;right&quot; means that one angle is 90 degrees). Specifically, look at the angle A. There are three sides to the triangle: the hypotenuse (which is opposite the right angle), the side opposite the angle A, and the side adjacent to the angle A. The three trigonometric functions are defined as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>sin(A) = a/h = the ratio between the side of the triangle <em>opposite</em> the angle, and the <em>hypotenuse</em>.</li>
<li>cos(A) = b/h = the ratio between the side of the triangle <em>adjacent</em> the angle, and the <em>hypotenuse</em>.</li>
<li>tan(A) = sin(A) / cos(A) = a/b = the ratio between the side <em>opposite</em> the angle and the side <em>adjacent</em> to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this defines sin/cos/tan for any value between 0 and 90 degrees. There's a more complex definition using a circle which extends this for every number (instead if just 0 - 90), which you can read about in the wiki page I linked to. Also, instead of using degrees, we normally use <em>radians</em>, which are a way to express degrees using the constant pi, such that 360 degrees = 2*pi (so 90 degrees = pi/2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obviously, as others have stated, there are very precise definitions of what the trigonometric functions are. However, it seems like you're asking for a more intuitive or less technical way to think about what they do to a number. </p>
<p>Consider first, for simplicity and without loss of generalization, that you're not going to feed your Trigonometric function numbers in the form of radians, which would just be some partition of the irrational number pi (pi/2, 2pi, pi/6, etc). Again, right now we aren't talking about that specifically. You're going to feed your function numbers in the form of degrees.</p>
<p>To be more concise and concrete, consider that you're walking along a circular path in a garden. Your path has a diameter of 2 meters. As you walk around the garden from your start point, you are taking more steps until you come back around to where you started. You've walked in a circle or 360 degrees. What if you notice that <a href="http://sculptures.bethelartsct.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/homeimage.jpg" target="_blank">the path has lines in it from pouring the concrete?</a> You stand on one line and look to the opposite side of the circle, you then count the number of lines between your line and that line directly across from you. <a href="https://www.studenthandouts.com/01-Web-Pages/2013-03/8-section-pie-chart.gif" target="_blank">In our example you count 3 in between that line and your line. 1 halfway between your position and the other side, creating two compartments, and then one in the middle of each compartment creating 4 compartments of path between you and exactly opposite the circle from you.</a></p>
<p>What would you think the angles you've made if you stop at one of those lines on your way over to the opposite side? You start at angle zero, and begin to walk over and every time you stop at a line you've added 45 degrees to your previous angle.</p>
<p>Now consider you wanted to set a number line between you and the spot directly across from you with respect to the center of the circle. You then declare the line you're standing at is 1, because with your 2 meter diameter, on your path you're standing 1 meter from the center (at all times actually!). So, as you walk towards the opposite line from where you're standing what if you stopped at your favorite spot, say 1 line from where you started - 45 degrees - and then decided you didn't like being on the path so you walked directly back to the number line you laid out between your 0 degree spot and the 180 degree spot? Would you be further than 1 meter from the center or less? Hopefully you think less! As you walked around your path to the other side, if you look at the number line you set up between you and the line directly across from <a href="http://solarenergyengineering.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/data/Journals/JSEEDO/935368/sol_138_05_051005_f005.png" target="_blank">you and walked directly to it, you'd be closer to the center than if you had stayed at 1.</a> As you keep walking towards the line opposite your original spot your angle grows bigger and your number line number keeps decreasing to -1 at the opposite side. </p>
<p>Now maybe you're seeing a relationship here. I know this was a little verbose and maybe tricky for you, the 5 year old, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/cBzeLOo.gifv?forcedesktop=1" target="_blank">ultimately I hope you see that the trigonometric functions help translate your angle to the position on the line.</a> Specifically, in our example, we were talking about cosine. You give it your angle and it will give you your number line distance from the center. However, sine works the same way but reads out the vertical distance. When you're standing at 0 degrees, you're actually 0 meters above or below the center of the circle with respect to where you started. </p>
<p>Hopefully this helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, there's a way to define them.  Suppose I choose a point on the unit circle (circle of radius one) about the origin, and I look at the angle that point makes with the (positive) horizontal axis.</p>
<p>Then the sine of the angle is the height (or vertical distance) of the point, the cosine is the horizontal distance (and is the same as the sine of the complementary angle, which is why it's called co-sine), and the tangent... well, that's the ratio of the sine and the cosine, never mind that one. :)</p>
<p>That's enough to define a function, we don't need to define it in terms of multiplying and adding things.  But if we need a number, we can use a Taylor series to approximate it.  This is what a calculator uses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in saying that wavelengths shorter than the Planck length are possible simply because you now Lorentz boosts (changes of reference frame) are symmetries, so you can always boost into a frame where any given photon has a post-Planckian momentum, wavelength, period, etc.</p>
<p>However, a sub-Planckian wavelength λ is &quot;not observable&quot; to you because it cannot be used to locate an object with accuracy λ like you would be able with a normal wavelength, because your photon would create a black hole as soon as it interacts with anything (anything with a &quot;normal&quot; wavelength)*. The smaller λ, the bigger the black hole.</p>
<p>Moreover, the photon is not necessarily a point particle all the way down. In string theory, being a string, it has a minimum size which more or less is a Planck length. So when the wavelength gets smaller than Planck, it's not really a good measure of the photon's localization since its own structural size is larger.</p>
<p>So this should give an intuition into the subtleties of the Planck length works as a minimum length scale. It's not like a grid size or anything of the sort, but it is still a minimum length in some very unconventional sense. I've discussed this a bit more in detail <a href="https://hologrammata.wordpress.com/2017/02/20/is-the-planck-length-the-minimum-possible-length/" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested. </p>
<p>* actually, this is not strictly correct, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5xg3wi/if_photons_have_a_minimum_wavelength_what_happens/dei3mjj/" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Physics is unclear about what's going on at around the Planck Length.  Interestingly, this is actually a feature of an alternate theory of black holes by Pawel Mazur and Emil Mottola :</p>
<p>&quot;Quantum theory says that any scale smaller than the Planck length is unobservable and meaningless to physics and physicists. This limit can be imposed on the wavelength of a beam of light so as to obtain a limit of blue shift that the light can undergo. This becomes important for the structure of a gravastar because general relativity says that a gravitational well blue-shifts incoming light, so around the extremely large mass of a gravastar there is a region of &quot;immeasurability&quot; to the outside universe as the wavelength of the light approaches, and then passes, the Planck length. This region is called a &quot;gravitational vacuum&quot;, because it is a void in the fabric of space and time.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, bleach is a mixture of 1 to 25% of NaClO (sodium hypochlorite) and water. Now, let's look at the formula: you can see we have sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl) and oxygen.</p>
<p>In reactions, NaClO is highly likely to oxydize things, which means that it is prone to give his oxygen to something else. </p>
<p>Now, colours are given by a wide category of compounds, the chromophores (from latin: bringers of colours). Bleach oxydizes these compounds (it gives them tha oxygen), which changes their behaviour and change their properties, destroying colour basically.</p>
<p>Now, there are 3 possible explanations to your couch colour:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The green compund turns yellow when oxydized. Instead of going from &quot;reflect only green AKA look green&quot; to &quot;reflect everything AKA look white&quot;, this compund goes to &quot;reflect only yellow&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green can be made by yellow + blue. The blue compound reacts with bleach and goes white, the yellow doesn't. You now have a pale shade of yellow.</p>
</li>
<li>You haven't used enough bleach.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, oxydation is what destroys colours. Some stains can be removed with oxygenated water (H2O2), which has lot of oxygen and so oxygenates things well (most notably, fresh blood stains which are otherwise har to remove). </p>
<p>Colours of old things are faded because exposure to the oxygen in the air.</p>
<p>Sun makes colours fade (think about clothes you use a lot in the sun or your own hair during summer, unless you have black or platinum blonde hair) because it heats things, speeding up the reaction with oxygen in the air and there are several more examples like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bleach is a really intense base. It oxidizes the materials it comes in contact with. Chromophores are the parts of molecules that reflect light and give color to those molecules. When bleach is introduced to material, the oxidation process alters the chromophores in such a way that they no longer reflect only the light that gives color to the material. This is how bleach essentially strips away color. However, different materials, colors, and amounts of bleach can affect the oxidation process enough to produce a range of shades from white to yellow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are able to exclusively hire people of one ethnicity because of a loophole called most qualified; if they are actually trying to discriminate based on race. The only ethnic restaurant, I personally know, that tried to racially discriminate hires had a language requirement. It was a language which one only learns if they're from that ethnicity.</p>
<p>The realistic reason is because of how they hire. Most ethnic restaurants hire through networks they have and in most cases the owners are immigrants. Their networks are typically limited to only their ethnic group which results in their staff being primarily whatever their network is made of. In addition, they often hire family members which also happen to be homogeneous in the ethnic spectrum. It's not like most owners are actively trying to discriminate but rather their methods of hiring has a side effect of discriminating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Essentially, they tend to hire family members into the business. The same applies to other businesses such as nail salons. They tend to be family owned and help each other out. </p>
<p>But in larger chain restaurants such as buffets, I've noticed that only the front-end staff (waiters, hostess, cashier) will be of the same ethnicity while the back end (cooks) are much more diverse. I'd imagine that's to maintain a certain atmosphere for the clientele.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is essentially a future simulation machine.</p>
<p>The brain can be split into 3 main chunks (I'm simplifying): the hindbrain, responsible for many instincts; the midbrain, responsible for many emotions and sensory integration; and the forebrain, newest and best at future planning. </p>
<p>The forebrain takes longest to develop. It tends to be in teenage development that people have their first epiphanies about existence and their place in the universe. This hits emotional triggers very hard, and is written into your memory as an important experience, to make sure you remember it. Why? The theory is a sense of purpose and value of your life has survival value. You're more likely to live with a strong ability to predict the future, and &quot;purpose&quot; is very much tied to future planning.</p>
<p>Crises can happen when you lose that feeling of euphoria tied to future planning. And since it was tagged in your brain as super important, you feel a sense of loss that is very strong.</p>
<p>Edit: credit to u/starfirex for pointing out that I describe brain structure using an outdated model. All 3 &quot;chunks&quot; have been evolving this whole time. I meant to use it only as a frame of reference for the forebrain and its function.</p>
<p>Edit 2: There's gold in them thar hills! I will celebrate with an awesome definition to share.
<a href="http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/" target="_blank">Connectome</a>: a comprehensive map of all connections in the brain. It hasn't been done in humans yet, but is as important for us to learn as the human genome. I hope to see it all mapped out some day.</p>
<p>Edit 3: a good chunk of this is indeed speculative. This is way beyond what researchers can test. </p>
<p>Attempt at a reasonable explanation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forebrain" target="_blank">The forebrain</a>, as well as mid and hindbrain, are structures which develop differently along the neural tube. A tube becomes your brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>Perhaps some better read folks out there can help me with a definition of epiphany. My Principles of Neuroscience class defined most new thoughts as &quot;connecting two previously separated concepts in a novel way&quot;. I assumed the definition of an existential epiphany to be something like connecting pathways responsible for &quot;self&quot; with &quot;purpose&quot; or &quot;the rest of the world&quot;. </p>
<p>One of my profs said it in a way that I am retelling: your brain is searching to connect two or more concepts. Under MRI, it appears to be mild activity in many structures. When a connection with meaning is found, there is a sudden burst of activity. A sudden burst can lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation" target="_blank">long term potentiation</a>, a fancy way of saying the memory is likely to be stored in long term memory.</p>
<p>If this long term potentiation is paired with emotion (likely through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala" target="_blank">amygdalae</a>), it does two things: further consolidates the memory, and adds emotional content whenever the memories are recalled.</p>
<p>The thought process can also be tied to a rush of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins" target="_blank">endorphins</a>, which is essentially feel-good juice that your pituitary releases. The &quot;loss&quot; I refer to could be a number of new things that you have experience since you had the original epiphany. Reality sets in? You lose confidence? Have you become accustomed to the mindset without new stimulus? Then you may no longer trigger the entire pathway, and lose the paired endorphin rush.</p>
<p>My background is a BSc in Neuroscience. Good scientists will see that I didn't include enough primary lit. I am an amateur attempting to explain the unexplained, but I think my logic and theory is sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain realizes it's going to end.</p>
<p>You may know this fact, but few people <strong>internalize</strong> this.</p>
<p>What does internalization mean?</p>
<p>Internalization is the process by which the brain converts facts it learns into practical life lessons and adapts itself to that.</p>
<p>Example: Let's say you've heard that children are starving in Africa. You know this as a fact, but you have not internalized it. Now let's say you go to Africa, get lost and stuck into a tribe, and now you are experiencing that. When you get home, you will have a much different approach to starvation than if you only knew about it.</p>
<p>There are a few ways the brain can internalize things. The above example is through experience. But other methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epathy</li>
<li>Witnessing</li>
<li>Meditating</li>
<li>Hearing another</li>
</ul>
<p>Among others.</p>
<p>Death is unique. Because Death is something that, once internalized by the brain, devastates it. Because there is no escape. Your brain cannot project an escape route. This hits the deep core of fight or flight. There is no fight. There is no flight. It leaves the brain defenseless to the inevitable doom.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most tragic thing is, is how long the brain can go without internalizing the reality of death. Indeed most people do not internalize it ever. They go to the grave in shock and horror. Others create myths and stories to try and avoid internalizing it. Others try to live live with hedonistic distractions to the reality of death.</p>
<p>But once you internalize it, you are changed forever. And many suffer an existential crisis. Some even suffer small versions of it when they realize their <em>person</em> is dying, but not their body. Children may experience it as they internalize that childhood is ending. New adults around 25 typically experience it as they realize the free life of youth is over. And many by 35 experience it when they realize their high life of sex, drugs, and alcohol is no longer compatible with living healthy and happy. Indeed many at 45 will experience it when they realize they cannot have kids anymore, and many at 55 will experience it when they realize they are not wanted anymore by many people.</p>
<p>These regular crises will continue, until the great final mystery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toward the end of the 19th century, something called “trading stamps” took the American retail world by storm. Like frequent flyer miles, the stamps were a virtual currency which consumers earned as a reward for spending money. Earn enough trading stamps and you could cash them out for various other goods, such as cookware and household appliances relevant to that age. But unlike frequent flyer miles, you didn’t get trading stamps from your credit card company (which didn’t exist yet anyway). Instead, you obtained them from shopping at participating retailers — merchants would hand you a physical stamp to paste into a collection booklet. For the retailers, the trading stamps were a great way to build customer loyalty — if a consumer were ten stamps away from a Dutch oven, he or she would likely patronize businesses which issued the right type of trading stamps to collect those last few.</p>
<p>So how did retailers get the trading stamps? They bought them from the redemption company. The retailers, therefore, incorporated those costs into their business operations. In some cases, merchants offering trading stamps bumped up prices a bit to account for the cost of acquiring the stamps. However, as the Straight Dope observed (and sorry if that link auto-plays a video), various state legislatures weren’t a fan of this practice. Some states wanted customers to be able to get that cash back in the form of cash, not cookware, so legislatures started passing laws requiring trading stamps issues to redeem booklets full of stamps for cash. According to Mental Floss, New York took the lead: “by 1904, [state] had enacted laws that forced stamp makers to put a cash face value on each stamp that would enable consumers to bypass catalog redemptions and get money back for their stamps.” Over time, many other states passed similar laws.</p>
<p>Of course, the trading stamp companies didn’t want to be in the business of sending cash back, so they simply priced the stamps in a way to limit the work. A typical trading stamps collection booklet had room for 1,000 stamps — it therefore made sense to offer one dollar for a filled book. Do some quick math and each stamp was given a cash value of one-tenth of one cent, or 0.1¢. Even though a booklet of stamps could be easily redeemed for products worth a multiple of that, it’s likely that state governments were okay with this pricing — round numbers tend to make sense to us, even when they shouldn’t.</p>
<p>The popularity of trading stamps persisted through the first half of the 20th century and into the 1970s, and along the way, retailers and manufacturers came up with another way to incentivize consumers. That method, of course, is coupons, which work very differently than trading stamps ever did. But often, when lawmakers are met with a new product that they think needs to regulation, they turn to apparently similar products and try and replicate the law. State legislatures often employ strange analogies which lead to even stranger results, and coupons are a victim of such shenanigans. A handful of states believed that coupons would create the same economic cost-reshuffling that trading stamps did, and those states required that coupons, like trading stamps, also be redeemable for a very tiny bit of cash.</p>
<p>Some of those laws have since been repealed, but a few still remain. Because it doesn’t really make all that much sense to issue two sets of coupons to comply with various state laws, we’re stuck with some cash value — very, very little cash value — on our coupons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To begin, a Calorie isn't exactly &quot;absorbed.&quot; All a kcal is is a measurement of energy required to raise the temperature of one kg of water 1 degree celsius at 1 atmospheric pressure. And, in physics, the amount energy in the universe is fixed. We use the energy, but release energy as well as heat, as matter, etc.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, your body definitely would metabolize 2,000 Calories in one sitting versus several days completely differently. Your stomach generally holds onto food for 3 - 6 hours, depending on how much fat content is in it; fats take longer to break down because they must be emulsified first, and then broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, absorbed through your intestines into lacteals, which are a part of your lymphatic system, and then disbursed throughout your body.</p>
<p>The biggest factor to consider concerning metabolization and Caloric intake is which type of macro nutrient we are talking about. Ignoring vitamins and minerals, fats, carbohydrates, and proteins are broken down in different ways. Simple sugars and carbohydrates are the easiest to break down, and are a preferred source of energy in some ways, because of their high bioavalibility; sugar is excellent for bursts of energy, ya know, to outrun lions, or catch the rabbit for food. Fats require a lot of oxidation to be utilized, so when you are walking, sitting, sleeping, studying, pooping, or anything that does not raise your heart rate very much, (IE: using oxygen rapidly as energy in conjunction with sugar for your muscle cells) your body will use the oxygen to oxidize fats for energy. This is why we say fats give 9kcal per gram. Proteins are a different beast, that I will not get into.</p>
<p>TLDR; the way Calories are metabolized depends on the activity you are, or are not doing. And, there is a timer in which foods consumed will be utilized for energy, or stored for later use, and this time period is just a handful of hours--much less than one day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of depends. Mostly depends on the type of food.</p>
<p>Your body is going to do its darndest to absorb all the calories that it can. most of the time it does a pretty good job, but sometimes things make it down far enough into the intestines that gut bacteria get to eat some of it - oftentimes this leads to what we call indigestion.</p>
<p>If you spread out 2000 calories of normal food over a 5 day period, your body will get pretty much every bit of nutrition (calories, this case) that it can. If you eat 2000 calories worth of fat and sugar in one sitting, your body can pretty much get all those calories into your bloodstream where they will be dealt with in one manner or another. If you eat 2000 calories of tough meat, high fiber foods, and other tough to digest foods, and if you eat it all in one sitting, a portion of the meal will move down the intestinal tract before being absorbed, and a bit of it will be utilized by bacteria or be left over in your fecal matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economics student here with a focus on developmental economics. I'm late to the party but hopefully a few people can get me some upvotes for visibility.</p>
<p>Africa is impoverished for many reasons. </p>
<p>In no particular order, I will list some:</p>
<h1>All tropical areas tend to be more impoverished because they are more prone to disease</h1>
<p>-- You may notice that Northern areas and very Southern areas tend to be better off than Equitorial areas, especially wet ones. Places like the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Argentina used to be among that list of prosperous countries but had bad governance, and Chile is now quickly joining them. </p>
<p>This is because of disease. Until very, very recently (as in, since maybe the 1980s) people in those areas could not rely on being healthy tomorrow. Tropical diseases of many sorts, as well as diseases also common to temperate areas, ravaged them. This leaves working age people disabled or dead. Without a good ratio of healthy people to sick, an economy cannot be productive.</p>
<h1>Africa has suffered from bad governance</h1>
<p>--Since European contact, Africa has suffered from bad governance -- mostly from Europeans but also from African leadership as well. For a few hundred years, Europeans <strong>really</strong> wrecked the place with extortive policies aimed to overtly impoverish the population. This eased European rule and thus the capacity for Europeans to extract what they wanted from the area.  </p>
<p>Immediately upon independence, bad governance continued in many, but not all areas. Why? </p>
<p>Because those areas wanted to practice <em>autarky</em> (autarky is the opposite of free trade &amp; open migration -- Trump loves autarky if that makes it easier to understand). Why did they want to practice this policy?</p>
<p>They wanted to close their borders because of their history of subjugation at the hands of foreigners. So they decided to not trade with anyone, not accept investment, and not allow labor migration. </p>
<p>This left them without a means to transfer technologies from more technological areas, and without a way to get out of destitute poverty since they could not generate investment from exports or from foreign aid, or from foreign direct investment. They couldn't build industries at home because they had no source of income.</p>
<p>Today, many many African countries are much better managed. But, they've got a lot of growing to do. Nigeria, Botswana, and Kenya are some of the best examples of growing prosperity.</p>
<h1>Africa has recently been suffering from armed conflict, as is common among newly independent states</h1>
<p>-- Whether it was the fall of apartheid, the genocide in Rwanda, child soldiers in Sierra Leone and Uganda, or the ongoing civil war in the Congo, many Africans have not had their most fundamental need -- safety -- met. Without safety there is usually economic contraction, and often it is severe. This means that these areas, which were already poor, become more destroyed and more poor due to ongoing war. </p>
<p>Any political revolution, on the short and medium term, tends to cause economic contraction due to a loss of faith in contracts and jeopardizing safety. Some revolutions tend to cause economic growth -- sometimes huge growth -- on the long term. An example of this is of course the American revolution. Another would be the fall of Apartheid, from the fall of Apartheid until the rise of Jacob Zuma South Africa had very robust growth (but Zuma killed that with tribalist division).</p>
<h1>Africa lacks mature, essential institutions.</h1>
<p>This one can unfortunately be blamed mostly on colonial powers, as most African nations haven't been independent long enough to have developed fundamental institutions. It also falls as part of bad governance, but should be cited on its own.</p>
<p>While public schooling in Africa is becoming fairly common <strong>now</strong>, previous generations often were illiterate or had not finished elementary school. So, until this generation grows up the workforce in Africa -- while cheap -- is unviable. Sure, African workers will work for less than those in Bangladesh... but they can't read. They can't read instructions. Again, not all. The region is in a period of huge transition right now and places like, say, Kenya or Botswana, or South Africa are much further along than, say, the former Zaire or Sierra Leone. </p>
<p>Additionally, they lack banking industry. They lack large corporations and large bureaucratic structures. They lack a fully fleshed out police force especially in rural areas. A farmer in Namibia cannot, unlike an American farmer, enter in to a long term contract with a large purchaser to sell all of his, say, grain for the next two years at a fixed price. He can't do this because there aren't good courts and if there were then even if he won there aren't police out in the boonies where he lives to make the person pay him. He has his word, his family, and their collective weaponry to enforce agreements, and that's it. This limits the capability of investment and tends to cause disastrously volatile pricing which is extremely dependent on local conditions for that season. </p>
<h1>The keys to prosperity in this world are fairly intuitive.</h1>
<p>We need safety -- not only from violence, but from disease and dirty water too. Then, we need justice. -- those in power cannot be performing backhanded deals or serving their own profit. Finally, we need to be open -- freely exchanging with our fellow man and allowing the inflows and outflows of goods and people.</p>
<p>Africa had none of these things until recently. Now they need time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: It is my opinion that the hypothesis I've written about below is one that <em>adds</em> to the discussion rather than explains entirely why Africa has had developmental problems.  I am also aware that aspects of it may sound racist, however that does not warrant completely ignoring the hypothesis.  It's not my hypothesis, and while I do believe it may have some truth, I don't fully agree with it nor the economists who espouse it.</p>
<p>There is a fascinating concept called the &quot;geography hypothesis&quot; that might explain the economic hardships faced by subsaharan Africa.  There are wide ranging causes of economic despair across the globe.  When looking at a globe however, there seems to be a noticeable divide between the wealthy nations and nations with low income levels.  Nations that lie in the tropics are on the wrong side of the tracks when it comes to economic prosperity.  According to economist Ricardo Hausmann, these tracks exist at twenty degrees latitude and nations below this line are cursed with stagnant, declining, or slow economic growth rates as well as noticeably shorter life expectancy rates.   Nations in the temperate zones exhibit overwhelming economic success by comparison.  The temperate zones contain twenty-seven of the thirty wealthiest nations, the three exceptions being Brunei, Hong Kong, and Singapore.   These nations seemed to have escaped the curse by having extensive coastlines allowing them access to global markets.  Singapore for example is a small and flat island with few natural resources other than, arguably, the sea that surrounds it and allows the nation to enjoy low import and export costs.   The rest of the tropical zone is not so lucky, and economists who subscribe to the geography hypothesis have three main reasons for this: the tropics are geographically prone to diseases, tropical agriculture cannot use technology from other geographic zones because the different climates produce equally different crops, and the countless landlocked nations of the tropics face exorbitantly high transportation costs for imports and exports.  Many nations in the tropics face all three of these geographical obstacles simultaneously, and without the resources to overcome them these nations will continue to experience little or no growth.</p>
<p>Malaria is a useful example to study for this topic due to the vast amount of data collected on the disease, and it has such strong associations with the economically impoverished tropics that it has been dubbed the ‘disease of the poor’.   Ninety-eight percent of all malaria deaths occur in thirty-five countries, five of which are in Asia and the other thirty are in Sub-Saharan Africa.   Malaria is often treatable depending on the severity of the strain, however the most severe strains are virtually exclusive to Sub-Saharan Africa where they cause jaundice and frequent loss of consciousness in their victims.  The disease also claims more lives there than anywhere else.   One out of every twenty children under the age of five in Sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria and adults, while more likely to survive, suffer frequent and long-term debilitation.   The crippling effect malaria has on workforces in Sub-Saharan Africa has made investors wary and growth elusive.  The disease has effectively isolated the region from international trade and tourism by raising transactions costs to prohibitively high levels.   This unfortunate reality is sustained by the geographic attributes of the topics.  The tropical climate allows malaria to thrive year round, whereas colder temperatures spare temperate zones from having to contend with the disease as an economic hurdle.  Malaria continues to pester tropical economies as relentlessly as the mosquitos that spread it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Born and bred West African here who spent the first 24 years of his life on my beloved continent. Problem numero uno in my opinion is bad leadership. One thing you always have to remember about Sub Saharan Africa is that a lot of these nations are artificial non homogeneous creations by European powers. Take my home nation of Nigeria as an example. There are three ethnic groups within its borders with populations of over 20 million each. Sure they may have all looked black to the British but these groups are as culturally and linguistically different as Russians are from Chinese (if you think this is not a problem, imagine aliens invading Earth and declaring that henceforth, Greece, Turkey and Russia will be one country). Throw in another four or five groups with populations roughly equivalent to that of Ireland and another 20 or so numbering over a million and you have a recipe for chaos as individual groups jostled for power. It's no accident that the Nigeria of my childhood was wracked by constant military coups. In such a situation, it's not the cream of the crop with drive and vision who rise to leadership. It's the most brutish and the most unscrupulous who force themselves into positions of authority.</p>
<p>Something else people tend to forget is that the colonial period is still relatively recent. When I was a toddler, Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique were still engaged in conflicts related to their wars for independence. Apartheid was still a thing in South Africa. Heck, 7 years before I was born my own country was engaged in civil war. These conflicts were devastating and take time to recover from.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm optimistic about Africa. I believe the younger generation are far less hung about ethnic identity than previous generations. People now take as much pride in being Nigerian, Senegalese or Ghanaian as they do in being Igbo, Wolof, Yoruba, Akan etc. Skilled African migrants are returning home to setup businesses as a kind of reverse brain drain. The internet has made the world a lot smaller and you can sit in a small village and pick up valuable skills by browsing MIT Courseware. The politicians are still no prize but they are a lot better than they were when I was growing up.</p>
<p>I choose to remain positive. Give it 50 years and I think this is a story that turns out well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably going to get buried in the comments but Paul Colliers book titled, <em>The bottom billion</em> does a great job explaining this. He boils down poverty and economic disparity to these 4 main problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Never-ending conflict (countries plagued with conflict will never be economically successful in any meaningful way. Without security there's no economic success)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The natural resource trap (poor nations who are blessed with a few natural resources that should theoretically make them rich end up squandering the money and concentrating all their efforts into these resources while neglecting all other industries)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being landlocked (Surprisingly this actually has a huge impact on the success of developing nations. Countries on the coast or those with access to the sea have a greater ability to trade and move around goods and people. If you're landlocked then you're in trouble because you're dependent on neighbours for trade and if they happen to be a neighbour that's in conflict, poor or badly run then it's not just unfortunate but your own economy will suffer as a result). </p>
</li>
<li>Bad governance (this one pretty much speaks for itself and unfortunately most countries in sub-Saharan africa suffer from this)</li>
</ol>
<p>The book goes into depth about all these points but it's easy to read and really informative. Highly recommend!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're asking about Sub-Saharan Africa, yes? Because the African Mediterranean coastline has always done pretty okay, at least in comparison to parts further south. And it ought to be pretty clear why <em>Saharan</em> Africa is pretty poor: for the most part it's a godawful wasteland where almost nobody lives. So I'm assuming that you're really interested in Sub-Saharan Africa here.</p>
<p>As to that, the simplest answer I can come up with is that Africa is a continent where just about everything wants you dead, from lions on the macro scale, to microbes on the micro scale. </p>
<p>European explorers/colonists travelling to Africa had a distinct tendency to <em>die like flies</em>. There's a reason European countries spent almost three centuries colonizing North and South America before seriously turning their attention to Africa (which they'd <em>always</em> known about!), and this is a big part of it. Infectious diseases endemic in Africa--yellow fever and malaria in particular--contributed to such a high European mortality rate that Africa was known as the &quot;white man's grave,&quot; and not for no reason. The climate is about as fantastic a breeding ground for the spread of infectious disease as one could imagine. The parts of Africa that aren't tropical are sub-tropical. It almost <em>never</em> freezes, meaning microbes and the bugs that carry them never have to go dormant. </p>
<p>Well if Europeans died in such large numbers, how did Africans survive? Part of the answer is that African populations do seem to have developed a certain resistance to some of the more common tropical diseases. For example, there's a recessive genetic disease, sickle-cell disease, that's pretty miserable for people who have it. But for people with only one copy of the gene carrying the sickle-cell traits, it provides a fairly robust resistance to malaria. Sickle-cell carriers can get malaria, but it's a lot less severe when they do get it. There are some other examples, but that's a classic one.</p>
<p>But the other part of the answer to how Africans survived in places Europeans died so much is that they <em>basically didn't</em>. European mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa during the colonial period could be fairly described as &quot;catastrophic&quot;. African mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa during the colonial period, by contrast, could be described as merely &quot;pretty damned bad&quot;. Life-expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa has pretty consistently been among the lowest in the world for a <em>very</em> long time. Assuming the lions (or whatever) didn't eat you, and the monsoons cooperated to the point that you could bring in at least <em>something</em> in the way of crops, there was <em>still</em> a really decent chance you were going to catch some bug and die. </p>
<p>There are certainly other reasons. European colonial misadventures certainly didn't do the continent any <em>favors</em>, that's for damned sure, and certainly contributed to Africa <em>staying</em> poor a lot longer than most of the rest of the world. But Africa has trailed more temperate regions in terms of physical prosperity for a <em>very</em> long time. It's just a really tough place to live. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't switch just because a new president arrives. </p>
<p>Air Force One is piloted by Air Force pilots (typically O-6, O-5 or O-4 - very senior guys - it's a high profile gig) and each tour of duty (like the rest in the military) typically lasts 3-5 years, so they will naturally rotate out over time during a presidency and overlap with multiple Presidents depending on timing in their career.</p>
<p>edit: </p>
<p>Here's a great National Geographic Documentary on this and what goes into planning each mission: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKRQyDsKODE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKRQyDsKODE</a></p>
<p>edit2:
/u/since_ever_since mentioned that only full bird (O-6) colonel's could be Aircraft Commander of AF1. The other pilots/navigators could be lower ranks. It is a prestigious gig, so pilots are typically selected for it as a good deal tour of duty</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was 6 or so, I met the Air Force One pilot for George W Bush. The pilot gave me a box of peanut M&amp;Ms with the American seal on it and the president's personal signature on it in sharpie, next to the printed signature. I ripped it open, ate it and threw it away.
Apparently stuff with his actual signature is worth around $300 now. Drat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
