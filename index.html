		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some bad science around here.</p>
<p>It's true that waking up in the middle of your sleep cycle will make you feel groggy, but that really isn't the whole story, and as someone has already pointed out, doesn't explain grogginess at the end of the sleep cycle. And it happens every time you are woken up from deep sleep, not just when you've overslept. </p>
<p>What's going on when you oversleep: throwing in an extra sleep cycle or two messes up your circadian rhythm, so your body has to spend a lot of resources trying to sync everything up again. That can make you feel kind of out of sorts or grumpy. There is also evidence that oversleeping messes up hormones and neurotransmitters, which also makes you feel groggy, as they also follow your circadian rhythm and are now out of sorts.</p>
<p>Also: going without food or water for an extra hour doesn't explain what happens. If you are dehydrated to the point of confusion, that is a medical emergency. Humans aren't delicate flowers. There is evidence that not drinking coffee as early as your body expects it can throw you off. It's part of a phenomenon called &quot;weekend headache.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is a cycle.  If you wake up in the wrong part of the cycle, you will probably be VERY groggy and slow to wake up.  If you're sleeping outside of your normal pattern, your body doesn't know how to plan the cycles.  So you actually wake up more tired than you would have if you had woken up earlier.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, try to plan for ~90 minute intervals for sleep per cycle.  So 7.5 hours of sleep would be more likely to have you waking up at the &quot;right&quot; time.  9 would be good as well.  8.25 is probably gonna leave you groggy, as would 10.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A scientifically semi-rigorous explanation I've heard before - and this is mostly just expanding on what others have said about hormones getting out of sorts - is about cortisol, a hormone that, simply speaking, makes you alert (like adrenaline but it works more slowly). It's released when you experience stress, and consistently high levels of it, i.e. chronic stress, are bad for you. Natural spikes of it are ok, though. Indeed one such spike normally makes you wake up in the morning, after which cortisol levels decrease over the course of the day (with stressful events triggering more spikes).</p>
<p>Now if you sleep through that morning spike, or if you wake up and then go back to sleep, you will naturally have less of this waking-up hormone to help you wake up later. Also explains why chronic stress can mess up your biorhythm, why is difficult to wake up or fall asleep ahead of your usual rhythm, why depressive ruminating makes it harder to go (back) to sleep, and why being startled (say, hearing a loud and/ or worrying noise in the middle of the night) can wake you up fully and quickly, and again make it difficult to go back to sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I've seen people speaking about intervals and all kinds of timings, but if you're used to sleeping 7 , 8 or 9 hours and you sleep more or less one day, you're gonna feel a bit more tired.</p>
<p>Also, for centuries we've woken up to the sun and went to sleep when it was dark.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, this question will only garner speculative answers as no one knows. Animals usually have mating seasons so that when the offspring's born it will have an abundant supply of nourishment (either directly or indirectly, e.g feeding off the milk the mother sustains through feeding). For example, elk and deer have their mating season during the autumn months and give birth around spring time when plants begin to grow. This leads to good foraging opportunities for the mother to nourish her young as well as there still being enough plants for the calf to start feeding on during weaning.</p>
<p>It has been theorized that humans don't require this sort of &quot;offspring timing&quot; to coincide with food availability because we <strong>always</strong> have food available. However, most infants are born in the summer months. If this is some remnant of a mating season to give birth around the wet season in Africa, I'm skeptical of, but who knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two answers I've heard that seem worthwhile. The first is that at some time during the evolution of humans, reproduction-based sexual interaction was &quot;co-opted&quot; for a more sophisticated level of bonding between individuals. Sex becomes a kind of language of connection and a supplemental form of communication/reaffirmation.</p>
<p>A second idea I've heard (which is not at all mutually exclusive with the first) is that because female-dispersal was more typical during most of human evolution, creating instant sexual bonds was a useful tool for a young woman to have when entering a new community. Instead of waiting a month or several months, and potentially having to deal with male aggression and an uncertain position within a community hierarchy, a woman could potentially enter into sexual relationship with a man in the group, cementing her place socially, and pre-empting the stress of dealing with the (potentially aggressive) interest of multiple men.</p>
<p>Sloth-edit: Totally forgot to mention what u/mmm3says wrote about &quot;timing of conception is vague&quot;. I think that's another important piece of the puzzle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimps, Gorillas,  and Baboons (I want to say all primates) don't have &quot;mating seasons&quot; either - the female goes into estrus periodically all year. Bonobo chimps are even like us - constantly in a state of being physically receptive to potential sexual activity, regardless if conception is likely on any given day of the cycle. </p>
<p>Goodall noted that high-ranked males would &quot;sequester&quot; the high-ranked females to get exclusive reproductive rights. </p>
<p>Goodall also noted that all males of a Troop would (nominally, generally) help protect the young from predators, generally ALL mature males had mated with all mature females, and were ALL potential fathers. </p>
<p>Further reading about Bonobo chimps suggests sex is a social bonding experience.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Monkeys are social animals who like sex &amp; power hierarchies &amp; many primatologists/anthropologists seek to gain insight of our own sexuality through these genetic relatives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human breeding and sexuality are atypical as far as animal species go.  There must be evolutionary benefits to this that have outweighed those a seasonal breeding season (which in addition to timing and weather has impact on predation)
A couple of benefits to this behavior:</p>
<p>1) Humans, unlike most animals, have sex for pleasure without respect for season. (I'm though I heard females orgasming is rare or even unique to us, and makes sense as far as it encourages mating behaviors)   Men just don't stop by for some action for some month once a year.  This  has huge social and societal impact.
Closer and longer lasting intimate relationships with males and females.  A man would be less likely to stay with one woman and participate in childrearing if mating was a seasonal thing.  This allows females both a wider selection of mating partners</p>
<p>2) Because human estrus is not obvious, timing of conception is vague.  This creates opportunity for more ambiguity as far as who fathered a particular child.  This allows females both a wider selection of mating partners, and knowing her body better, to arrange conception with mate of her choice.  This uncertainty gives a woman the potential to secure child-rearing resources from a man who is not the child's biological father.  This give a man the potential to father a child and have some other guy raise it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We didn't evolve to have a mating season is the best answer when asked &quot;why?&quot; about anything that didn't happen in evolution. It just means there was no reason or pressure for us to need to keep mating to a short time period. It could be something to do with our long life spans, the incredible time and energy that goes into your children, or how long it takes from conception to birth being a long time compared to many animals.</p>
<p>It could be said that being able to reproduce at anytime is advantageous to reproduction, which means the better question is why other animals have mating seasons at all, and that will change depending on the animal I suppose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bricking generally means making completely unusable at the hardware level.  The reason that computers rarely get bricked is that we RARELY do any manipulation of the computer at the hardware level.  To brick a computer, you would need to break the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) which pretty much no one non-techy messes with.  If you break windows, you can still reinstall windows. If you break the BIOS, you can hose things pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The other aspect is that even with the BIOS, I can't think of ANYONE who would be messing around with the BIOS without using the official manufacturer's files.  Most of the time you're messing with phones, you are doing so with custom firmware/ROM's, which means something made by someone other than the manufacturer.  If you're flashing your BIOS, you're almost always going to be doing it with something provided (and quality controlled, tested, etc) by the company who made the product.</p>
<p>So it comes down to two factors: </p>
<p>1) for computers, you generally don't tinker at such a deep level that you're going to risk bricking it</p>
<p>2) Even if you are messing at that level, you're not doing anything that is not officially approved of by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The final aspect is the fact that it's relatively easy to replace a computer (especially a desktop) part.  If something in your phone breaks, 90% of us are just going to give up because it's so hard to replace.  Most of the stuff that's likely to go bad is also easily replaced/substituted.  I fried my sound card on one of my desktops a few months back, and for $10 I just plugged in a new sound card.  If I killed the speaker on my phone, I'd say fuck it and just buy a new phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PCs are built with openness in mind. Meaning on a PC you can install different OSs, boot from different media, install different hardware and so on. It's all under the users control and if you screw things up, you just boot from a USB stick or DVD and recover easily. PCs are meant to be tinkered with and handle accidents well. Even for accidents in the mids of a BIOS upgrade many mainboards have ways to recover from that.</p>
<p>Phones, tablets and game consoles are the complete opposite, they are locked down so that the user has little to no control about what is going on. Meaning a lot of tinkering has to happen in areas that the manufacturer didn't intent to be tinkered with or actively tried to prevent tinkering in. This means the tinkerer is walking a minefield and any error might put the device into an unrecoverable state.</p>
<p>All of this is not an accident, but by design. If manufacturers wanted to, they could make phones as easy to recover as a PC by letting the user boot from SDcard or access the internal flash storage via USB. Case in point, many bricked PSP could be recovered after people found out that booting from the memory card was possible via a modified battery. The feature was there all along, but not documented by Sony to prevent hacking.</p>
<p>Another issue is that even if the device allows you to recover, you would still need the data to put on the device to recover it. On a PC you have Windows install discs, Linux distributions and all that readily available to reinstall on a blank device. Getting the OS image for your phone might not be that easy.</p>
<p>To make things further more complicated, the ecosystem around those devices is not standardized and discoverable, which makes it hard to create software that works across different devices. A Linux distribution will work on essentially any PC, but you can't make a Linux distribution that will work as easily on every phone as all the hardware around ARM varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually can brick a computer if you manage to turn it off during a bios update for example. Android has something similiar to computers bios, called OEM bootloader. It is being run before the operating system, just like bios in computer. The thing is, if you want to replace the operating system in your computer, you do not need to replace or do anything at all with your bios. Bios by default allows you to boot from usb or cd/dvd and so you can judt install the OS freely. This is not true for android, most android  phones are OEM locked, and their modloader often also disables ability to access recovery mode, which allows you to flash custom OS, just like booting in your computer. Here is the key part, you as an user, have by default full access to your computer as an administrator (you can install whatever program you want, do whatever you want with your pc, you can even overclock your processor), but for your phone you do not have administrator rights , so you are limited to the OS ans settings set to you by the company . To bypass this and gain full control of your phone, you need to do something called rooting a phone. Rooting can be dangerous as it most of the time takes replacing the bootloader. If you fail to replace the bootloader properly, you brick your phone, as it is unable to start even the loading process before OS. This is a hard brick. Soft brick is when the OS you flashed (installed) is broken and the bootloader can not load it, you can still just flash another. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned you can brick a motherboard if you try hard enough. When I was a kid, I flashed a BIOS upgrade onto my dads machine, except I accidentally flashed the file for almost the same version (think XXXXX+ vs XXXXX Pro or similar) - and it totally let it flash, and upon rebooting, the machine was dead.</p>
<p>So I panicked, because like, it's my dads PC right and he's not going to understand what I was trying to do, he's just going to be mad. And I can't afford to buy a device to reflash the chip, nor did I have any idea how to make one, at the time.</p>
<p>But then I remembered my machine had the exact same motherboard, and took a look and, yay, the chip was removable. So I ask a bunch of random people on IRC if it would be sane/possible to boot my machine, get it all ready to flash the correct firmware, then while the machine is on, pull out the BIOS chip and replace it with the dead one, and flash it from the system that's already booted. This seemed to make sense to me, but they all told me it was stupid and would break the other one. (I've since found out that, obviously, I did not invent this idea, but hey I was really young, when you're young you came up with everything first)</p>
<p>Desperate kids will do anything an adult tells them not too, though, so I did it anyway and it worked. Didn't get hit with a belt that day! :&gt;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>
<p>You have to directly image the planet in order to do it because you need to look at the spectrum of light coming from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O2 is twice as hard to detect compared to H2O</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chlorophyll will be 6 times more difficult to detect compared to O2.  Factors like cloud cover on the exoplanet factor heavily into this.</p>
</li>
<li>It's possible that level of resolution will only be achieved when the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) telescope is launched sometime after 2025.</li>

<p>very little, if any, muscle in the feet.

<li>
<p>keeping them tucked under their warmer skin</p>
</li>
<li>counter-current heat exchange: veins and arteries are organized closely together in a way that allows the blood leaving the warm heart to run near the colder blood from the feet before it actually reaches the feet. Benefit is that it warms the colder blood before it reaches the main body and the warm blood loses its initial heat to other blood instead of ice/air. <a href="https://teamatlantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ducks-heat-exchange.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>, credit to u/wildflower8872 from a similar thread years ago</li>

<p>I actually asked one of my nursing professors this question too, in a joking fashion because I told him I've always wondered about it since I was a kid, and why penguins didn't melt through the ice.</p>
<p>He went on to tell me an amazing explanation as to why a penguin's foot is like a human testicle. In human biology the testicles sit outside of the body so that sperm can be produced because at a internal temperature of 98.6 degrees they cannot produce sperm. However sitting outside the body exposure to colder air can also decrease the Bloods temperature enough that when entering back into the body it could cause a person to go into shock. So in the human testicle there exists a cross current system where the artery coming out of the body into the testicles passes by the vein that returns back in thus cooling the internal hot arterial blood when it comes out, and warming back up the cold venous blood when it goes back into the body.</p>
<p>The same exact cross-current system exists in a penguin's foot so that the arterial blpod can be cooled down to a temperature that the feet can not melt through the ice and then warmed back up on its way in so it doesn't cause Penguins to go into shock.</p>
<p>And that my friends is why a penguin's foot is like a testicle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Frostbite in general happens as a result of the body restricting vessels in very cold extremities to maintain its core temperature, instead of allowing the cold blood to recirculate. Penguins, arctic foxes, and others don't have this issue, because they have counter current exchange systems in place, in which the returning blood is re-warmed by the oxygenated blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might enjoy the book &quot;Why Don't Penguins Feet Freeze?&quot; I bought it and thought it'd never come in handy, so here's my chance to shine!</p>
<p>Part of the answer has a biochemical explantation.
A binding of oxygen to haemoglobin is normally a strongly exothermic reaction: an amount of heat (DH) is released as the molecules attach. The same amount of heat is usually absorbed in the reverse reaction. However, as oxygenation and deoxygenation occur in different parts of the organism, changes in molecular environment (e.g.: acidity) can result in heat loss or heat gain in the process.
With regards to cold peripheral tissues like the feet, DH is much smaller than humans.  This has 2 benefits. Heat is absorbed by the birds' haemoglobin when it's deoxygenated. The second is a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics. In any reversible reaction (e.g.: absorb/release of oxygen by haemoglobin) a low temperature encourages the reaction in the exothermic direction. So at low temps, oxygen is absorbed more strongly by most species' haemoglobin, and released less easily. A modest DH means that in cold tissue the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin doesn't become so high that the oxygen cannot disassociate.</p>
<p>2 mechanisms are at work; penguins can control the rate of blood flow to the feet by varying the diameter of arterial vessels supplying the blood. They also have 'counter-current exchangers' at the top of the legs. Heat flows from warm to cold blood, so little of it is carried down to the feet.
In winter, their feet are held a degree or two above freezing - to minimise heat loss, whilst avoiding frostbite. (Ducks &amp; geese are similar, but if held indoors for weeks in warm conditions and then released, their feet may freeze, because their physiology has adapted to warmth which causes blood flow to be virtually cut off and their foot temp falls below freezing)</p>
<p>Tldr; they've adapted to the cold and can lessen blood supply to the feet. They also  hold their feet at a steady temp, a degree or two above freezing.
Less heat is absorbed by the birds haemoglobin when it's deoxygenated. The low temperatures encourage an even more exothermic reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you watch a real chef, you'll see they are very careful about what they touch.  They're not going to rub their nose/face and not wash their hands.  If they touch something that would contaminate something else (raw chicken for instance) they'll immediately wash their hands before they do anything else.</p>
<p>Gloves block your the transfer from stuff on your hands to things you touch, and vice versa, no more.  If you wear gloves and handle raw meat, or money, or any of the other unhygenic things and never change your gloves you're actually more of a problem.</p>

<p>Using gloves is only really helpful if you don't want to contact the things you are handling with your bare skin such as with caustic chemicals, for some reason you can't clean your hands with soap and water (which brings up the question of how your work surfaces are cleaned), and if for some reason a hand has an open wound.

I have my food handlers managers license. In my course we actually did a demonstration that showed the amount of germs that you can trap underneath the gloves. Most health inspectors prefer that you do not use gloves as they trap germs, foster a lovely moist warm environment for bacteria to flourish in, and use of gloves actually discourages hand washing.
We wash our hands constantly and mine get dry and they hurt from doing it so much in the winter. But you are better off that way, promise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole built from antimatter or one built from matter with the same mass are identical.</p>
<p>The quantity that distinguishes matter from antimatter is the baryon number. It is the total number of baryons (like protons and neutrons) minus the number of antibaryons. Baryon number is conserved in the standard model and that is what you would recognize as &quot;conservation of matter&quot; in some sense, and the reason for which the proton is stable in the SM: it is the lightest baryon and so it cannot decay to anything else because it needs to preserve its baryon number of +1. So the proton can only release its mass in energy for lighter particles if it meets an antibaryon carrying -1 baryon number, so they total to 0 and they can produce lighter non-baryon particles such as photons or mesons. That's why matter &amp; antimatter annihilate.</p>
<p>(A similar argument works with leptons, with a thing called lepton number).</p>
<p>These, baryon and lepton #, however, are not conservation laws with any specific deep or fundamental justification behind, they are just accidental symmetries of the standard model. (Unlike, for example, charge). As soon as you step out of the SM, these are violated. Black holes are well outside the SM and do not care in the slightest about baryon number. Black holes don't have a well-defined baryon number and throwing a proton or an anti-proton* into a black hole produces the same final black hole, whose only macroscopic distinguishing properties are mass, charge and angular momentum. After a lot of time the black hole has evaporated into Hawking radiation which is made of standard model particles, and the final baryon number of the radiation does not have any discernible relation with the baryon number of all the stuff that fell in. </p>
<p>* woops forgot: except for charge, charge is conserved even by BHs. So maybe you can throw a hydrogen atom (baryon # 1, charge 0) or an anti-hydrogen atom (baryon # -1, charge 0). Or neutron/antineutron.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole can be considered to be two separate things, one a phenomenon of matter, one a phenomenon of space-time.</p>
<p>A black hole is formed from a very high-density collection of mass. Typically this is something like a collapsing neutron star or stellar core. The composition of the matter inside the black hole after the formation of the event horizon is a very complicated question, and something that theorists still haven't decided on completely.</p>
<p>However, the nature of the black hole to the rest of the Universe is very much different. From the outside the black hole is no longer a phenomenon of matter, it's primarily a phenomenon of space-time. What's &quot;inside&quot; the black hole is almost entirely irrelevant to the rest of the Universe. This is because there is no way for the matter trapped inside a black hole to influence the rest of the Universe, except gravitationally (and electrostatically if you want to get technical).</p>
<p>Many people have a fundamentally classical idea of how a black hole works. Generally something along the lines of an object with an escape velocity higher than light, so that even light can't escape from the black hole. This ignores the fundamental nature of black holes, however, which is closely tied into relativity and the behavior of space-time. Within a black hole's event horizon there is simply &quot;no way out&quot;. The event horizon is a one way door, once you pass it there are no space-time trajectories that go forward in time which leave the black hole (in fact, that do anything other than eventually travel to the singularity). This is important to understand because it recasts a black hole from a weird phenomenon related to light somehow to a phenomenon that directly affects the nature of, well, the fabric of reality. A black hole is like a little pocket Universe with no way out.</p>
<p>Once you shift to that conception some of the details of black holes might make sense. For example, whether a black hole is made of matter or anti-matter (or, indeed, entirely of photons) is irrelevant externally. Nothing that happens inside the black hole can escape the event horizon. If, hypothetically, you had one black hole that was formed from a collapsing star and another black hole that was formed from a collapsing anti-star merging them would still necessarily result in just a bigger black hole (mass-energy is just mass-energy). What happens inside the black holes isn't something that can affect the event horizons themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question.
A few things that I'd like to point to which I think might contribute to the discussion.
The relative degree of consonance/dissonance is directly associated with the number of cycles that are required before 2 (or more) notes repeat their pattern. e.g. in a unison it is a 1:1 ratio and so the two notes are considered consonant. Whereas the tritone/A4/D5 is an irrational number which when we use the same criteria takes the biggest number of cycles before resolution/repetition of the pattern compared to other intervals. Some other intervals, depending on the tuning system used, are 5:4 or 3:2 which resolve faster than the tritone and so, are described as consonant. You can complete the mathematics for any chord and this holds up to any cultural ordering of consonance/dissonance that I am aware of.
When comparing the major key to the minor key in western music, we have a set of melodic and harmonic structures that are common to both. What is happening here is that these two keys, while both considered consonant have slightly different variations. They are tied together and comparable largely due to the dominant -&gt; tonic (V-I, whatever you want to call it) which gives us a cadence. When you compare the harmonies found in these two keys and the intervals used to create the melodies, the minor key is slightly more dissonant than the major key. Given this is the case, and making some assumptions that brains all process patterns in a similar way (big assumption, i know) I think we have an argument for a natural predisposition due to slower pattern recognition in the minor key. Perhaps the minor key lends itself to slower tempo so as to allow time for melodies/harmonies to process, this may make the association stronger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the answers are quite complete / accurate.</p>
<p>Chinese characters can be ordered in two main ways, by pronunciation and by radical. The sound of each character in Mandarin can be written out using Roman letters (a phonetic system called pinyin), which can be arranged alphabetically, A to Z. For example, the character 你 (you) is listed under &quot;ni&quot;, and the character 她 (she) under &quot;ta&quot;. Mandarin also has 4 tones, so for each sound such as &quot;ni&quot;, there will be further ordering &quot;ni1&quot;, &quot;ni2&quot;, &quot;ni3&quot;, and &quot;ni4&quot;, where the number indicates tone. So 你 is actually under &quot;ni3&quot; and 她 under &quot;ta1&quot;. This ordering is useful when you know how to say the character, but don't know/remember how exactly to write it.</p>
<p>For radical, things are slightly more complicated. Most Chinese characters can be split into a &quot;main&quot; part and... the other part. The main part, called the radical, often gives a general idea to the meaning of the character. If you know Chinese, you can easily pick out which part is the radical (it can be on the left, right, top, bottom, left-bottom, top-left, 3-side-surrounding, 4-side-surrounding, etc!). At the start of every dictionary is an index -- a list of all the radicals. Under each radical, you see a list of ALL the characters having that radical (there are very very many). Take your time to find the one you're looking for, and it tells you which page to go to for that character. This kind of ordering is useful when you know what the character looks like but not how it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Pros and cons</strong>: the radical ordering works everywhere, as long as you can read the written characters; the pronunciation ordering only works in a particular spoken Chinese language. Since Mandarin is the largest spoken language (not in Hong Kong!), that's what dictionaries always use.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>. You may ask, how do you arrange all the characters under the same pronunciation (for example 思斯絲司私撕廝 or 顆科柯棵苛)? Or how do you arrange them under the same radical (確礦碳碼 or 開關問聞)? Heck, how do you arrange the radicals in the first place (亻宀忄口火馬鳥)? In this case, we use the number of strokes. Basically, it's the number of times you have to lift the tip of your pencil to write the character, according to a standard way of writing that everyone must learn in school. This save you some time, but there can still be dozens of characters with the same radical and the same number of strokes. Check out and play with the <a href="http://unicode.org/charts/unihanrsindex.html" target="_blank">radical-stroke index</a></p>
<p><strong>BONUS2</strong>. Your title is not entirely accurate. Chinese is a language family made up of a wide range of different regional languages that cannot understand each other when spoken. Mandarin is just the name of a spoken language. There is only ONE written language, so the same character can be pronounced differently but still understood by everyone. (Except Mainland China writes most characters a bit differently than Hong Kong and Taiwan. We won't get into that here.) Since dictionaries are about the written language, you should write &quot;Chinese&quot; instead of &quot;Mandarin&quot; in the title.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Chinese characters can be ordered in two different ways:
(1) Romanised pronunciation -&gt; tone number -&gt; number of strokes
(2) Number of strokes of radical -&gt; radical -&gt; number of remaining strokes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Once you find all the 女 entries, they're organized by number of extra strokes.  So 女 is three strokes and 子 is also three strokes, so you can look it up that way.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The appearance of a character and its pronunciation has less correlation than other writing systems, so in Chinese the following two are both possible: knowing a character but not its pronunciation, and knowing a pronunciation and meaning but not knowing how to write it.</p>
<p>For the pronunciation to character index, some dictionaries have that as an appendix. The harder problem is looking up a character based on appearance with no knowledge of its pronunciation.</p>
<p>Every Chinese character is written using one or more strokes, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_order" target="_blank">stroke order</a> is more or less predictable. Furthermore, most Chinese characters are composed of simpler characters. Some of the simpler characters are considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)" target="_blank">&quot;radicals&quot;</a>, which you can think of as a &quot;meta character&quot;. There is a fixed number of radicals. </p>
<ul>
<li>First there is an index of radicals, sorted by ascending stroke count, since radicals themselves are also characters.</li>
<li>Then all characters are sorted first by radicals (in the same order as the index), then by the remaining stroke count.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are irregularities that come with the radical system, so here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>語 (&quot;language&quot;) has a total of 14 strokes. Its radical 言 (&quot;speech&quot;) happens to occur on the left-hand side. 言 has 7 strokes, so first you look up 7, and find arrive at the page where all 7-stroke radicals are. Once you locate 言, it tells you which page to start for all the 言-radical characters. Once you flip to that page, there are 14 - 7 = 7 strokes remaining, so you keep flipping forward until you get to the 言-7 section, and that is where you will find 語 as well as any other 17-stroke whose radical is 言.</li>
<li>情 (&quot;emotion&quot;) has a total of 11 strokes. Its radical 心 (&quot;heart&quot;) also happens to occur on the left-hand side. The inconsistency is that in radical form, it is 3 strokes, but in isolated form, it is 4. A lot of radicals diverge between radical form and isolated form, e.g. 水 (&quot;water&quot;) is the isolated form and the left-hand side of 河 (&quot;river&quot;), 氵 is the radical form. For the purpose of looking up the radical 心 itself, you use 4. But for the purpose of calculating the remaining stroke count, you use 3, so 11 - 3 = 8. The character 情 can be found in the 心-8 section.</li>
<li>慶 (&quot;celebrate&quot;) has a total of 15 strokes. Its radical 心 (&quot;heart&quot;) is in the middle of the character. Not every character's radical is on the left-hand side! In this case the actual occurrence is in regular form, so 15 - 4 = 11, so 慶 is in the 心-11 section.</li>
<li>花 (&quot;flower&quot;) has a total of 8 strokes. Its radical 艸 (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;) is on the top of the character, in the radical form of 艹 with 4 strokes. This is a double whammy! Not only is the radical not on the left, but the radical itself has two different forms just like 心 (&quot;heart&quot;). Where you would find 艸 is a more interesting question: some dictionaries say 艸 itself is 6 strokes, while some prefer saying 艹 is 4 strokes. They are the same radical in two different forms, so it's a matter of preference and standards. The character 花 can be found in the 艸-4 section.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The radical can reside anywhere in the character, but the most common locations are on the left or on the top. The right or the middle are less common, but it can happen.</li>
<li>A radical may have two different forms. One is the isolated form, when you write the radical as its own character. The other is in radical form, when you write the radical as part of another character. Depending on how common the isolated form is, one may look more alien than another. For example the isolated form 水 (&quot;water&quot;) is just as common as its radical counterpart 氵, but you seldom see 艸 (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;) other than in the context of radicals and the radical counterpart 艹 occurs much more frequently as part of other characters, e.g. 花 (&quot;flower&quot;), 草 (&quot;grass&quot;), 藝 (&quot;art&quot;).</li>
<li>How many strokes a radical has is trickier if it has two forms. The Taiwanese Ministry of Education, for example, prefers the stroke count of the radical form.</li>
<li>How many strokes a character has is less contested, but can happen. This is due to disagreement between whether a stroke is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_(CJKV_character)" target="_blank">simple or compound</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going back to the two different problems whether you know the character's pronunciation: on a desktop computer it is very common to input a character's pronunciation and let the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method" target="_blank">IME</a> automatically choose and / or let you select the right character. Other IMEs work by letting enter a series of radicals (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie_input_method" target="_blank">Cangjie</a>) or straight up let you use a trackpad or touch surface to handwrite characters for recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to have to come at this from the other angle:</p>
<p>The reason that poor people tend to get screwed by the Legal System is because they are saddled with a Public Defender. </p>
<p>Public Defenders aren't bad Lawyers, they're usually <em>shockingly</em> competent at their jobs. <em>However</em>, due to their small numbers, Public Defenders are required to take on an <em>insane</em> number of cases. Public Defenders <em>usually</em> don't have much time to prepare for a case. Most can't afford to spend more than 15 minutes on a single case, and are <em>insanely lucky</em> if they can afford an hour of preparation for a single case. </p>
<p>It's virtually impossible to win a case without time to prepare. You need to research the relevant Laws, and <strong>all</strong> of the Case Law that is binding in your Jurisdiction. Then you need to review the Prosecution's Evidence, and get Evidence that was illegally acquired or questionable thrown out. You also need time to coach your client on how they should behave in court.</p>
<p>It's <em>physically impossible</em> to accomplish <strong>half</strong> of the preparations required in an hour, much less 15 minutes. As a result, most Public Defenders recommend that <em>most</em> of their Clients just take whatever plea-deal is offered by the Prosecution. It'll be a lighter punishment than they'd receive if they go to court and lose, and the odds of not losing are <em>basically zero</em>.</p>
<p>The exception to that <em>most</em> are clients who <em>can</em> realistically be defended. This generally means that the Case against the Client is full of holes to the point where the <em>Jury Members</em> would probably catch the procedural errors, or relies upon evidence that's <em>blatantly</em> inadmissible in court.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, Wealthy People can afford to hire a Private Lawyer. These Lawyers can control their case-load, ensuring that they have <strong>all</strong> the Preparation Time that they need. They can take their time, do their research, coach their client, and pick apart the Prosecution's case.</p>
<p>Even if the client is blatantly guilty, the Lawyer can actually hold the Court to the Letter of the Law regarding sentences... but this is going to require some explanation.</p>
<p>Most Judges in the United States, outside of the Federal Circuits, are <em>elected</em>. Because of our current culture, it's best for a Judge to maintain a public image of being &quot;Tough on Crime.&quot; If you pass down a relatively light sentence on someone, you can bet your ass that your Opponent in the next election will plaster it all over their campaign ads. As a result, Judges are incentivized to be as harsh as possible when it comes to sentencing.</p>
<p>This trickles up to the Federal Circuit as well. Federal Judges are generally drawn from State Judges, and getting promoted up in the Federal Circuits requires you to be Nominated to that position by the President of the United States. <em>Being</em> a Candidate for a Federal Bench (which you can hold for life) requires you to hold onto your State Bench. Moving up in the Federal Circuits requires the President to move you up... and the President has incentives to put Judges that are &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; onto the Federal Benches.</p>
<p>However, a Good Lawyer can hold a Judge's feet to the fire when it comes to sentencing. Excessive Sentences can be used as a justification for Appeals, and having your judgements <em>overturned</em> by a higher court hurts your chances for advancement <strong>even more</strong> than not being &quot;Tough on Crime.&quot; A State Judge up for re-election can spin not being &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; as being &quot;Merciful,&quot; but it's difficult to spin &quot;Incompetent Judge's Decision Overturned by Appellate Court&quot; into something vaguely positive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that the letter of the law allows more lenient sentences, or lesser charges, or other mechanisms that allow a person to receive a preferable sentence.  A good lawyer is better at convincing a prosector or judge or jury that those mechanisms should be used to the benefit of their client.  That's what makes them a good lawyer. </p>
<p>Additionally, rich and famous people often have options less well off people don't.  A prosecutor might be willing, for example, to let a famous person off with &quot;community service&quot; because they think kids will actually listen to them and not, say, do drugs if they go around telling people not to, something that wouldn't be true of your average accused. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lawyer is there to be a pain.  Against a public defender who can't really dedicate the time to a young delinquent from a poor family, it's an easy slam dunk to convict them and throw some years at them.  Easy win, get the stat.</p>
<p>With a PITA wealthy lawyer, expect extensive attention and appeals and calling the judge and prosecutor into question.  Bad stats, waste of resources, risk of being overturned on appeal.  </p>
<p>It's just human nature to go down the path of least resistance.  Especially if the people are represented by politically-minded workers.  The lawyers need to become judges, judges need higher court and eventually maybe Justice.  The consistent, &quot;tough on crime&quot; stats makes picking on the poor way easier than going after the rich.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do believe that the US legal system is flawed and rich people do get off a lot easier than the average Joe. </p>
<p>But... with that being said, some average Joe's are just lucky when it comes to legal matters or they're masters at getting sympathy from court judges. </p>
<p>My brother is a piece of shit wife/kid beater and he ALWAYS seems to get off easy. He's broke as shit and usually drunk and usually unemployed. Whenever he gets arrested, and he has been arrested at least 4 times now (that I know of) its usually for beating his wife or fighting with neighbors/strangers or some other gang related shit, at least 1 weapons charge. Either way, the most jail time he has gotten was 3 months, 3 glorious drama free months. Then business as usual when he gets out.</p>
<p>Once he and his wife apparently got pulled over for driving erratically (he was drunk) and the cop gave him a stern lecture and asked his sober wife to drive instead than sent them on their way. Oh his kids were in the car. Good times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
