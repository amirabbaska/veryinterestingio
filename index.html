		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. Terminal velocity is way too slow, and a bullet far too light, to cause significant injury. </p>
<p>When you fire a gun, the bullet accelerates until it leaves the barrel, and then it starts slowing down immediately due to wind resistance. When you fire straight up, or nearly so, the bullet will travel up until it slows and briefly stops at the apex of is arc. Once it hits that apex, it's falling, relying solely on gravity to accelerate. In a vacuum, it would accelerate as long as it was being acted on by gravity. But you still have to worry about wind resistance: at a certain point, it will no longer be able to accelerate because the force of the air will be equal to the force of gravity. (I'm simplifying this, because physics isn't my strongest suite.) This is your terminal velocity. Terminal velocity is more challenging to figure than i can readily do, but let's say that you manage to get a slug falling at the rate of 200mph. (For comparison, the Challenger command capsule hit about 220mph, and a person in freefall will hit about 120mph.) That works out to be 293fps or so. A .22 short will have a muzzle velocity of about 1000fps, and most BB guns will be in the 400+fps range. If you are assuming something like a 7.62x39mm slug, the slug weight is about 10g/.3oz. At 293fps, that's...  A whopping 29 foot pounds of energy. A .22 short, one of the smallest, lightest ammunitions around, will have <em>at least</em> 44 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. (Heavier bullets will definitely produce more energy.)</p>
<p>It would probably break skin, but likely not penetrate deeply. (Lawn darts, given how much they weigh, are more likely to cause significant injury, even with a relatively slower velocity.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>. That's <em>only</em> if you shoot straight up, or nearly so. If you are shooting at an angle, then gravity will have altered the trajectory of the bullet, but the bullet will still have forward movement from being shot in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Old man strength is typically from those who have been performing some form of physical labor for a long time, and have such developed incredible grip strength.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Young men today actually have weaker grips than men did 30 years ago, and likely in generations prior to that.  Grip strength is often used as a proxy for general body strength in populations.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1985, men ages 20-24 had an average right-handed grip of 121 pounds and left-handed grip of 105 pounds. Today, men that age had grips of only 101 and 99 pounds, the study found. Men 25-29 posted losses of 26 and 19 pounds.&quot;</p>

<p>The truth is that men today are likely weaker than any recent generations of men.  This is probably due to obvious shifts in physical activity for pleasure and for work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

After all, he just took five minutes to get out of his chair without his joints exploding, so we definitely didn't expect him to casually break loose the stuck jar lid Junior was struggling with.</p>
<p>Because of their appearance and mannerisms, we think of old people as being frail and weak, but they're often far stronger than they look. It's unlikely an 80-year-old will actually be stronger than a 40-year-old, but the difference in their strength may be smaller than the difference in their appearance. We're occasionally reminded of that and it surprises us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>older people, men in particular, are more likely to have engaged in physical labor all of their lives, leaving them with muscles, bones, tendons, joints, and pain tolerances better suited to feats of strength</li>
<li>while coordination and endurance suffer as we age, people often retain much of their raw strength, and it can be unexpected to find a man who has trouble climbing a flight of stairs will has a vice-like grip</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, they are not stronger than they were at the prime, just strong they most people would expect them to be.</p>
<p>My mom worked in nursing homes, and mentally incapacitated older male patients were often a problem.  They weren't necessarily violent, but they often got confused, and if they didn't want to do something, it was often difficult, or even dangerous, to try to make them do something.  They were just as strong as any nurse or orderly, even if they were in a wheelchair.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

This constant can only be determined experimentally, but we use QED to make predictions of this constant and then compare with experiment. To date, the fine structure constant is accurate to about 1 part in 100 million, or something like that. It’s absurdly accurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>QFT is extremely well tested, it is used in essentially all of condensed matter and high energy physics. It is a much more general theory than QED, which is a particular QFT contained within the standard model. </p>
<p>QED is often called &quot;the best tested theory in physics.&quot; This is basically a statement about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_tests_of_QED" target="_blank">fine structure constant</a>, which can be computed in QED and gives an answer that is measured to be correct within 1 part in 100,000,000.</p>
<p>As far as other predictions from particle physics, there is the prediction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons#Predicting_the_W_and_Z" target="_blank">W, Z</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism#History_of_research" target="_blank">Higgs bosons</a> (which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone_boson" target="_blank">Goldstone's Theorem</a>), as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism#Consequences_for_fermions" target="_blank">higgs coupling to mass</a>. </p>
<p>Other things that come to mind immediately are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect" target="_blank">Casimir effect</a>, and Dirac's prediction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle#History" target="_blank">antiparticles</a>.</p>
<p>Then there are all the things that only have a coherent explanation through QFT. Examples include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_shift" target="_blank">Lamb shift</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production" target="_blank">pair production</a>. Indeed, essentially all observed physics phenomenology seems to be in harmony with Quantum Field Theory.</p>
<p>String Theory, on the other hand, is a class of quantum field theories (or at least started that way). I am not an expert in String Theory, but to date it has made no testable/falsifiable predictions. The main reason people like String Theory is because of its mathematical beauty. There are many string theories that become the standard model in the low energy limit, which is part of why it's so hard to make falsifiable predictions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical concept to formulate a physical theory. The electromagnetic , weak and strong force can all be described with appropriate quantum field theories, and can also be combined to the quantum field theory known as the Standard Model (SM). This is the best model we currently have, with some parts tested really really well to absurd precision, other parts and predictions are not testable with current experiments, but so far every experiment agreed with predictions. </p>
<p>At the moment, gravity (general relativity, GR) can not be formulated as a quantum field theory. It is also really well tested, in calculations from the mercury rotation, satellites to black holes and gravitational waves, every experiment so far is also consistent with the theory.</p>
<p>There are still some open questions where SM and GR cannot explain reality (see also (here)[<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics</a>] for a list). String theory is also a kind of QFT that tries to be more general, incorporate GR and have as a special case the SM, and also predict additional particles or fields for dark matter. But there are no successful attempts (that I know of) that predict anything useful and testable by experiment, so it is entirely theoretical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool question. No, I think it's not a coincidence, in that similar geology and weathering patterns made it possible for the &quot;mitten&quot; structure to occur more than once in Monument Valley.</p>
<p>One important thing to know to understand the mittens is that they are actually long and skinny, even though you might think they're round based on the pictures from the main lookout. The skinny mesa in <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/wC9W1u8b7ruEdhNY1CSJ6avuQRtOGH44dCeAntaQLcWt3ipBLuL1B9djLqy5Wsy7JxhYA0BOI1LF0FzjB9wTC4gOqpLFrA=rp" target="_blank">this picture</a> is actually one of the mittens viewed edge on. When you think of a long, skinny, highly fractured (&quot;jointed&quot;) mesa, it's easy to imagine part of the middle section collapsing first, leaving an isolated end pinnacle. This makes the &quot;mitten&quot; shape.</p>
<p>But why are the mesas long and skinny in the first place? If you look at larger mesas in Monument Valley, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.953757,-110.1313363,4723m/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">you can see how it happens</a>: drainages off the side of the mesa cut into its walls over time. The rock on top is harder, so erosion mostly happens bottom-up. The bigger the mesa, the faster these drainages cut, because bigger mesas collect more water for runoff. When two of these drainages are parallel to each other, they meet in a &quot;knife-edge&quot; the same way that glaciers form <a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/3846616/13/images/7/Plucking+makes+the+ridge+narrower+and+this+is+called+an+Arete..jpg" target="_blank">aretes</a> in mountains. These skinny mesas collect very little rainwater because their area is so small, so erosion works a lot slower on them. Eventually, once everything else has eroded away, all that you have left are some skinny mesas ready to make mitten shapes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about your old tricycle: the pedals were connected directly to the wheel. One revolution of the pedals meant one revolution of the front wheel, meant you went forward X distance. X would be the circumference of the wheel. A bigger wheel would mean you could go further with one revolution (but you'd need to push harder to get started). Since your legs can only go around the pedals so fast, if you want to go quickly, you're better off with bigger wheels, since your legs don't have to move as much, they just have to push harder. The downside is that it's harder to get the bike moving to start with, and much harder if not impossible going uphill.</p>
<p>We have long since solved the problem by connecting the pedals to gears, so that the number of pedal revolutions per wheel revolution can be varied depending on the gear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because gears and chains didn't exist. Without this, the only way to turn a wheel is to attach the pedals and cranks directly to the centre of that wheel. Since they're attached directly, one turn of the pedals equals one turn of the wheel, unlike a modern bike where one turn of the pedals usually equals several turns of the wheel.</p>
<p>With a small wheel, that means your legs turn very fast but you don't go very far. A bigger wheel goes further in one turn which is more comfortable, as well as easier and faster. The size of this wheel is limited only by the length of your legs, since you have to be able to reach just past the centre to push the pedals down past it. This is why all these bikes are usually of a similar size.</p>
<p>Now, you also need a second wheel so that you have something to make balancing and turning easier, as well as to stop you simply tipping forward when you pedal. However, since it's not attached to the pedals, it doesn't matter how big this wheel is and a smaller wheel is usually less bumpy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of &quot;vocal cords&quot; is pretty misleading. What you have instead are &quot;vocal folds,&quot; which are two flaps that let air travel through your larynx, which we manipulate into certain sounds using our tongue, teeth, and lips. Part of the low voice sound is the vibration your vocal folds make when they're more closed than open. When these two folds come together, the small area that air escapes through causes them to vibrate and slap together, and your voice sounds &quot;lower.&quot; Try it now; when does your voice sound lower, when you're making an &quot;s&quot; sound or &quot;z&quot; sound?</p>
<p>The deepness of one's voice is mostly determined by how low their larynx is. That's why tall people often have lower voices because their larynx is lower, which gives their vocal folds more space. Children have high voices because their larynxes have no depth, thus small vocal folds. You can raise and lower your larynx at will to make your voice higher or lower, which is what someone is doing when they're making their best attempt at a &quot;Darth Vader&quot; voice (lower larynx longer folds). </p>
<p>Therefore, during a falsetto, your larynx is raised, and your vocal folds are open.</p>
<p>EDIT: Clarity
EDIT: I changed some wording around about larynx size because some people were losing their shit about the word “neck.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like u/beto1460 said, your vocal &quot;cords&quot; are actually vocal <em>folds,</em> flaps of skin inside your larynx. When you make a sound, they flap open and closed a bunch of times per second and to regulate air flow out of your throat. Typically, though, the deepness of your voice isn't so much dependent on how low your larynx is, but on how long and thick your vocal folds are: Longer, thicker vocal folds will produce a deeper voice, because they vibrate more slowly. When you make your voice higher and lower, what you're doing is manipulating the shape and tension of your vocal folds to change the speed at which they vibrate.</p>
<p>When you speak in falsetto, your vocal folds don't close all the way. However, the vocal passage is <em>not</em> entirely open: Your vocal folds have mucus membranes on the edges, sometimes called &quot;false vocal folds,&quot; and when you speak in falsetto, those are what's vibrating together to produce the noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key to understanding this is to recall chromosome pairing. Normal cells have chromosomes that come in homologous pairs (i.e. two versions of DNA coding for basically the same genes, though with variations. Each chromosome has a version they inherited from their mother and father.). The 23rd chromosome, the sex chromosome, pair is where the X/Y come into play. Females have a paired set of X-chromomsomes, while males instead of an X paired with a Y. </p>
<p>Why does this matter? Well, when sperm are being produced, at one stage  a cell division occurs that splits the pairs apart. Every sperm gets only one version of each chromosome. For #23, that means each sperm has either the X or the Y. There are only two choices, so there's ~50% chance to have either. </p>
<p>Why does this result in ~50% males and females? When the sperm fertilizes the egg, and the chromosomes are paired up again, the maternal side only contributes an X 100% of the time. Whether the embryo will result in a male or female (in gross, simple terms), depends on whether the sperm has an X or Y, which was 50:50.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How do things catch fire without flame I.e just from heat?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only reason a flame can set other things on fire is because of the heat it generates.  So the reality is that the <strong>only</strong> way to catch things on fire (ignoring unusual chemical reactions) is from heat, and other flames just happen to be one way to provide the necessary heat.</p>
<p>Also, ask your wife how you can light a match by striking it on a matchbook if it takes a flame to set things on fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A fire just needs heat, fuel, and oxidizer. Usually once the fire starts it will generate its own heat, but it needs to be started <em>somehow</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature at which vapours of the material will ignite, when given an ignition source.</p>
<p>The flash point may sometimes be confused with the autoignition temperature, which is the temperature at which the vapor ignites spontaneously without an ignition source. The fire point is the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after being ignited and the ignition source removed. The fire point is higher than the flash point, because at the flash point more vapor may not be produced rapidly enough to sustain combustion.[1] Neither flash point nor fire point depends directly on the ignition source temperature, but it may be understood that ignition source temperature will be considerably higher than either the flash or fire point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You take one down, and pass it to your friend, so now there's 98 bottles of beer on the wall. This means you need to put a bottle of beer back on the wall to bring it back to 99. The only rule is you have to keep 99 bottles of beer on the wall. Nothing is said about it being coors light or a good stout.</p>
<p>Same way, every energy producer will have different costs to produce energy, solar, hydro-electric, geo-thermal, wind, natural gas, coal, nuclear and so on. But the system doesn't care about that, the only thing the system cares about is they have to put 1 unit of energy for every unit of energy they sell. </p>
<p>Maybe the power company you buy from sells only solar power, but it's the middle of the night, so maybe they'll pay another company to generate it for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generators bid in to the electrical market.</p>
<p>If generator A is really cheap to run, they may bid in at $10; so, if the price of electricity is greater than $10, generator A will produce electricity. Generator B may be more expensive, and bid in at $20. When the price rises to $20, generator B gets turned on. When the price of electricity goes back to $15, generator B gets turned off again, but generator A stays on. </p>
<p>The key, however, is that everyone gets paid the current price of electricity; even though generator A bid in at $10, they got paid $20 when the price reached $20. This means that they got the same amount as generator B per amount of electricity produced for all the hours in which generator B was producing, but they got to produce more, and therefore got paid more. So, its in everyone's best interest to bid in as cheaply as possible for them, creating competition.</p>
<p>Different generators also have different characteristics. Nuclear plants are very cheap to run for the amount of energy they generate, but really, really don't want to ever change their output. Oil generators, on the other hand, are very expensive, but can change their electrical output very quickly, to respond to minute to minute differences in electrical demand. Since supply and demand always need to be matched in a functioning electric grid, the ability to change output quickly can be very valuable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
