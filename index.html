		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So 100C is the boiling point for water at 1 atm. If you put a cover on the pot you prevent the water vapor that is more hot from leaving the immediate area. Doing this increases the pressure of the air and by extension the water in the pot. This is why if you have stuff in a pot with a cover and you take the cover off a lot of extra steam comes out right away. The water also boils a lot faster for a moment.
The 100 degrees is the average temperature because each water molecule that begins to vibrate at a rate where its temperature is higher than that will evaporate leaving the pot in the form of steam. That is what the bubbles are. They are the overheated water vapor coming out of the pot. Not actually air pockets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Interesting that compared to the obvservable universe and the smallest particles we know of, neutrinos, we are much closer to the middle:</p>
<p>Neutrinos are (estimated) to be as small as 10^-24m, and as stated above, the observable universe is about 8.8×10^26m.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the old days, you could stop foreign propaganda by blocking (or seriously limiting) its distribution.  You could refuse to broadcast it on TV or print it in the newspapers.  Access to mass media was limited.</p>
<p>These days, the Internet lets everyone put everything up where people can find it.  Anyone with a few bucks can host a website.  A few thousand dollars on a botnet can ensure that it trends on social media.  There's no way to tell what's legitimate reporting &amp; what's propaganda.</p>
<p>To make things worse, when the whole &quot;fake news&quot; thing got out, it quickly transitioned from a criticism of this blatantly false reporting to an insult lobbed at any news source that disagrees with your preconceptions.  We've become so polarized &amp; compartmentalized in our own little filter bubbles that people start <em>choosing</em> their own &quot;reality&quot; that doesn't challenge them.</p>
<p>The end result is that people have no faith in <em>any</em> media nor do they have any faith in <em>any</em> politicians.  When they think that everyone is equally corrupt &amp; there's no hope to change things, they disengage from politics.  When they don't vote, the more motivated party with more solidarity wins.  People with hardcore party allegiances take control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To think rationally you always should assume that you can be wrong, your previous knowledge can be wrong, people giving you information can be mislead themselves or actively trying to mislead you. That's pretty damn hard.</p>
<p>Moreover, all too often there aren't enough facts available to prove any side of the story. Rational thing to do here would be to accept that <em>you just don't know</em> (yet) who's really right, to take note of both opposing views and stay alert for new evidence. But <strong>people are afraid of not knowing things</strong> and therefore often choose the side that looks <em>more probable</em>. Now if there isn't enough evidence then you can't really assign any percentage to probabilities of different scenarios, so instead of being critical people just choose the side they have more interaction with.</p>
<p>Once you have (subconsciously) chosen the side, you don't really examine it critically any more. When some new information comes in you just examine whether it undermines integrity of your previous beliefs. If it does - the rational thing to do would be to <em>rethink your position</em>, but much easier (and much more common) thing to do is to look for ways to dismiss/undermine the new evidence.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> it is hard and time-consuming to evaluate everything critically, often you'll have to admit you just don't know stuff (whether because there are not enough facts available or because you didn't spend enough time researching the problem) and sometimes you'll need to reevaluate everything you know and to change your position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>or with someone who just straight up would not admit that they were wrong about a fact, even when you pull up the wikipedia page on your phone and show them? the most they'll admit is &quot;that's your opinion&quot; or &quot;well, that's not what i read&quot; or &quot;let's agree to disagree&quot;? refusing to acknowledge that they've lost the argument means they don't have to admit that they did. they might know they're wrong and just not want to admit it, or they might cling to their genuine ignorance because they don't want to be challenged and being corrected in an argument is uncomfortable emotionally.</p>
<p>frustrating and exhausting, right? now imagine you're at a party where this guy has already told everybody else this wrong fact, and they all like him personally and think he sounds like he knows what he's talking about. you tell a couple people the real truth but they seem disinterested because they think you're just stirring the pot. you maybe convince one or two. the rest go out and repeat the wrong fact ad nauseum until it's time to vote for the president and everyone thinks hilary clinton runs a child sex ring out of a pizza parlour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you propose stopping it?</p>
<p>Take, for example, the situation Germany is in at the moment. It's election year in Germany, and the authorities have observed with growing concern the way the Brexit referundum and the US presidential election have unfolded, and have identified as a major problem &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; is fictitious news stories, or at least wildly distorted and exaggerated news stories, which circulates primarily via social media and has a political objective. Some of that comes from obvious sources of propaganda, like the blatantly white supremecist Breitbart News; some of it comes from sources like Russia Today, a TV network that is funded by the Russian government itself.</p>
<p>Their stories, along with stories from more obscure sources, are spread partly by ordinary people on social media reading them, believing them to be true, and sharing or liking them, and partly by bots. In an era when more than half the people in the western world say they get their news from Facebook, this is very troubling.</p>
<p>In view of this, the German authorities are looking into ways of preventing the spread of &quot;fake news&quot; on social media, and have got agreements from the likes of Facebook and Twitter to help them. But how are they supposed to do that?</p>
<p>Do you fine people for failing to fact-check stories they &quot;like&quot; on Facebook? Do you outlaw memes? Do you write algorithms to detect the Russia Today logo in videos so they can be blocked?</p>
<p>In some cases the truth can be hard to ascertain: who is the final authority on what is true and what isn't? In many cases, the truth is misrepresented: it's still true, but taken out of context it's misleading. For example, it is entirely true that birth rates among certain immigrant populations are higher than the average German birth rate, and if you do the calculations on that basis you conclude that within a decade ethnic Germans will be outnumbered by other ethnicities. But that omits a lot of important information (the average age of immigrants, the lack of birth control in their home countries, that kind of thing), and in reality immigrant birth rates drop to the same level as native birth rates within one generation. So, should it be made law that you're not allowed to mention immigrant birth rates unless you cite <em>all</em> of the information? Does this mean that you shouldn't be allowed to make any kind of assertion unless you also present all of the counter-arguments? If you want to say, &quot;Angela Merkel's policies will lead to economic ruin within ten years&quot; you must, by law, add, &quot;according to some leading experts, while other experts say that her policies can only make Germany's economy stronger&quot;?</p>
<p>The more you delve into the complexities of this issue, the worse it gets -- and I haven't even started to mention the obvious pitfalls of government censorship.</p>
<p>At a basic level, you have millions of well-meaning people who don't all have a college education, who aren't experts in economics, politics, statistical analysis, science or journalism, and who therefore just share stuff they feel is important and which seems credible to them because they have no way of judging its authenticity. If you know of a way of putting a stop to that before the German elections this autumn without violating anyone's human rights, the German government would love to hear from you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I think other explanations are neglecting to mention is the change in machine learning.  Automation has been a thing for a very long time, but computers have not been powerful enough, and we haven't yet had the methods to <em>teach</em> computers to do tasks.  <em>That</em> is what is so different about automation today.</p>
<p>Before machine learning techniques were implemented, automation was very limited.  You tell a robot arm to go to <em>this</em> location, execute <em>this</em> command (like close the grabbing arm), then go to <em>this</em> location and do <em>this</em> command.  If the part the machine is supposed to be grabbing is out of position, the robot doesn't know or care.  It executes its command regardless, which means it might fail to grab the part, or grab it the wrong way and crush it, or drop it in a position on the other end that jams the entire assembly line.  For that reason, every step of the process had to be very precise.  Human workers are usually employed to check the parts and align them correctly for the robots to function properly.  It's not a very glamorous job, but it's still a job.</p>
<p>Then, we started making robots smart enough to recognize simple changes in position with cameras and settings so that a robot could take the place of a human fixing the alignment of parts.  That takes a lot of computing, because it takes recognizing that the part is out of place, then computing the changes made to put it into place, how to execute that, and then doing it.  That's not easy for a simple robot, but our technology has advanced.  Suddenly, even just standing at the assembly line realigning parts isn't a guaranteed job.</p>
<p>Then we figured out true machine learning, where we can teach robots to do complex tasks.  This requires more intricate, complicated computer networks because it isn't very efficient.  The robot has to &quot;think&quot; about all of the inputs and all of the past inputs to make a decision, which requires a lot of computing power and a lot of memory to store the data of past actions.  It also takes a lot of complicated coding to tell the computer how to do all that.  Those things are all relatively new.  Our computers haven't been sophisticated enough to handle that until recently, and computer memory is getting much faster and bigger to store the data required to do it.</p>
<p>Think about automated driving.  You can't just tell a car to turn left <em>here</em> and turn right <em>here</em>.  It has to react to pedestrians and cyclists in the road, it has to react to drivers doing the wrong thing, changing traffic lights, changing traffic patters, detours, all the actions of all the cars around it.  That's a <em>lot</em> of data to process, and there's no simple formula to tell the car what to do.  Every situation is different, every situation needs a decision instead of a command.  The ability to do that didn't exist a decade ago, or at the very least, it wasn't commercially available.  Now it is.</p>
<p>Now you really don't need <em>any</em> humans on the assembly line, except one technician to service the robot.  Humans don't fix the mistakes made by the robots, they fix the robots so they don't make the same mistakes.  Those jobs are gone.</p>
<p>And with machine learning, we can teach computers not only to act in complex ways, but also <em>to create new things</em>.  Computers are now composing music, and it's not even bad.  It's not Mozart, but it's not bad.  We have computers that can take big sets of data and output the next step in manufacturing.  Need a new car design?  Used to be you needed a guy to think up a concept car, some more guys to check the aerodynamic efficiency, some guys to consider the market and what people are interested in buying, some guys to custom build a concept model for review, then custom build a full scale concept...  Now you can have one guy feed a computer an Excel spreadsheet with sales on every car for the last ten years, and you don't even need 3D models of those cars, you <em>don't even need to Google image search them</em>, you just tell the computer to do it and it does, and builds its own 3D models.  Then the computer automatically compares trends and looks at numbers and sales and what was popular and spits out a design for you, which you can then feed into a 3D printer that builds the scale model, then feed some instructions into an assembly line that doesn't need to be told how to custom make this car, it just figures it out and makes it.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is what's different about automation these days.  Tasks that were once considered far too complicated or delicate for computers to figure out are routinely done by computers these days, or getting very close to it.  We once believed that humans with our infinite, <em>living</em> creativity would always be solely capable of coming up with new, innovative ideas, but computers can do that now, too.</p>
<p>It certainly hasn't been a fast process, we've been automating for generations now, but there's always been other things to fall back on that computers and automation couldn't handle, like driving a truck or flying a plane for the military.  Turns out, computers are taking over those jobs.  The only jobs left are menial labor, and those jobs either don't really exist because mining coal is terrible for the environment, so we stopped, or no one is willing to take the job because it's too physically demanding.  And service jobs (retail, waiting tables, etc.) but those don't pay enough.</p>
<p>The only real jobs left are super technical jobs that require years of formal education and probably more years of experience in the field (like, ironically, designing better robots).  The aging population doesn't have time, money, or inclination to get those skills, which has made unemployment so much of a contentious issue.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;But we've had this technology for decades!&quot; But it hasn't been commercially available. We haven't been using it to automate jobs like we are now.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a hyperbolic vision of the future of automation!&quot; On the one hand, yes. I did that deliberately to emphasize how changing technology is affecting the economy. On the other hand, Trump was elected on promises of employment. The problem is real. And even a few years ago self driving cars were still thought to be pipe dreams and no one was considering their impact on the economy. Now they're not even widespread and we're already talking about how they'll devastate trucking jobs. Automation isn't evil, it's inevitable. I don't think it's bad, but you can't deny that it's happening.</p>
<p>Edit^2 : I'm not saying machine learning advances are the sole reason. Other people have brought up the aging factories taking the opportunity to replace old equipment with better technology that has already existed, and I think that contributes as well. At time of writing I had not seen any answers adequately delving into machine learning, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a medium sized, family owned company. The same family has owned it for over 50 years, the founder still comes into work almost every day, that sort of thing. Really good people who really know their industry. </p>
<p>Our product has always been made with <em>machines</em>, and while the industry has been slowly moving towards automation as technology has advanced, it didn't change the fact that these machines are huge, heavy, and expensive (millions of dollars with little to no automation). Not the kind of thing you could just replace. You get good crews, you make improvements where you can, but you still have to have five or six guys running each machine, and since everyone in the industry is doing the same, you can compete just fine. </p>
<p>Now the last 10-15 years or so, that has started to change. These big, expensive machines are getting older, and they are breaking. When they break, an arms race of sorts starts to emerge. One company will buy a new incredibly fast machine that is extremely automated. One or two guys run the whole thing that six used to, and they still output twice as much as the old machines. A couple companies do that, and their labor rates drop like a rock. They charge less. Now the next time something gets to be even slightly screwy, EVERYONE just wants to replace it with one of these fast, super efficient machines. It becomes a cycle. Your competitors are getting faster and more automated, so you have to as well. </p>
<p>Now back to the company I work for. We are very much behind the times. Being the family owned, good natured people that that the owners are, they have hesitated to modernize and put people out of work. Sure, we have a few new machines for additions and new product lines, but we are also still using machines they bought 50 years ago and along the way. However, it is getting to expensive for them to run those anymore. Our competitors, and even other product lines in our own company can run the product for half the price! So while they have been squeezing every ounce of life out of those old machines, there just isn't anything that can be done. When we sell product made on those machines, we effectively break even. It keeps the crews employed, but we don't make any money. We make money off of the automated operations. As time continues, and people retire or quit, or the machines just beak, we will shut them down for good. If that doesn't happen in the next five years, we will probably be losing money on those machines, so we will be forced to shut them down and find other work for those employees. </p>
<p>The point of my little anecdote is that we are at a tipping point. It's not just big automotive companies or high-tech manufacturers that have begun automating, it's the companies that make commodity products, like boxes (which is what we do). There is probably a box plant in every city and town in this country. Thousands of them. They all will either be extremely automated, or they will close their doors in the coming years. The pressure from the larger companies has made the midsized companies automate (my company), and in turn, we will make the small companies go the same route to compete and keep up. Any that can't afford to simply won't make a profit and will go under or get bought out for pennies on the dollar of what they were worth in their prime. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right that there has been a general push toward automation particularly since the industrial revolution. In general this has improved quality of life. It is also true that since them there have been people worried about what automation was going to do to jobs, and jobs adapted.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a difference in what is happening now in both quality and quantity. In terms of quantity, the speed with which individual technology is threatening to wipe out huge swaths of the labor market is basically unprecedented. The breadth the kinds of automation that is quickly becoming available is as exciting as it is frightening  (computers are already writing short journalism pieces, driving cars, trading stocks, assisting surgery, etc.) The idea that &quot;computers will help us do the lifting but humans are always goimg to need to do the thinking&quot; is looking more and more naive.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, the gap in skills necessary to take the &quot;next job&quot; is growing. It is easier to teah a former sewer to now operate a bobin on a loom than it is to teach a former lomghaul trucker how to be a coder programming that truck. This is causing fear of a thinning out between the highly skilled and the low wage worker.</p>
<p>Or 50 years from now we could be looking back on this moment as the turning point toward a golden age in humanity. Telling the future is hard.</p>
<p>Edit: this got a lot bigger than expected. So to respond to a few comments.</p>
<p>1) this isn't prescriptive, just descriptive. I don't advocate &quot;holding back progress to save jobs.&quot; This is just a description of why people are concerned. It is easy to wave ones hands and say &quot;well, yeah, some people will be hurt and they'll just have to get with the program,&quot; but that ignores the social and political influence that that hurt and fear have.</p>
<p>2) i did not mean to minimize the huge disruption that was the industrial revolution. As a commenter pointed out, you had about 25% of the country change jobs (using the responders figure) and living location in about 3 decades. It is hard to tell if automation will have that big an effect. But if you are looking at 2050, it is very possible that we will have automation solutions for every current job that involves driving, fast food, the supermarket floor, manufacturing, increasingly detailed physical manipulations, and cooking as well as increasingly brain-intensive processes like banking, surgery, writing, accounting, etc. It is really hard to tell what will catch on and what won't. It will also be interesting to see if remote work will do anything to change the past century's flight to the city or not. </p>
<p>3.) As pointed out, this tech also has an enabling effect. Cafe press let everyome be a tshirt manufacturer, square space lets people gett simple websites up. 3d printing could drastically lower the bar in small scale prototyping and botique manufacturing.</p>
<p>4) Basic Income is one solution people go to, greater socialistic tendancies is another (and related to the first). That's possible. It's also possible that the next wave of jobs we haven't dreamed about is coming. Schools in 10 years could be teaching aduino programming in middle school and graduating students who have to take 1 foriegn language and 1 computer language as a basic requirement. Girl scouts of 2050 might be able to take a flavor profile and custom build your personal cookie delivered by drones (though if there is one thing we've learned, its that the flying car is never gonna happen).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Controls engineer here (the guy programming this stuff). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It got more flexible, so now it's cheaper to change a machine from making product A to making product B. If you were making small batches, changing products annually, or just juggling orders for different parts and you spent most of your time converting your production line, you would automate less. Now your machine automatically adjusts to handle a range of products with inexpensive change parts and actuators. Also, touch screen controls can be reconfigured way easier than buttons and dials. Think fun size candy bars vs regular or king size and Snickers vs Payday; you don't want a dozen different machines that only handle one thing, you want an easily adjusted machine that does all of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It got faster. High end automation is working in single digit microsecond reaction times and tens of microseconds for full program/network cycles completely deterministically. Back to candy, if you need 10 lines to fill the world supply of Snickers, that's a bit pricy compared to two that can fill the world supply of Snickers and Payday and have time to cover 100 Grand too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motion is way better. CNC is fine and all for hard coding a path for a tool, but multiple levels of electronic camming with profiles calculated on the fly is normal now. Robotics is easy now and when you add machine vision, it replaces anyone that ever picked stuff up on a production line. The tools and program functions to do this stuff exist and are easy and flexible to use (on some automation platforms).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Machine vision exists now. Cameras are better and the software you use to program them is better and more versatile. We aren't checking if the print is good enough for OCR or finding where a pancake is on a conveyor anymore. We're making complex visual analysis. Self driving is whole other level with mixed vision and fucking L<del>A</del><em>I</em>DAR.</p>
</li>
<li>It costs less now. To the point there are clear ROI for all but the most complex, low-skill work. I see people doing things they think are just too hard or expensive to automate (driving is a good analogy here) all the time... While I install and test their replacement that will pay for itself in 6 months. </li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the limit to automating everything is time to figure out and write the program; mechanically, humans are pretty easy to replace and processor speeds are no object.</p>
<p>EDIT: *LIDAR, I'm in machine/process automation, not self driving or defense. I just assumed they replaced &quot;radio&quot; with &quot;laser&quot;, but apparently it's &quot;light&quot;, resulting in LIDAR instead of LADAR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number of things you can automate is drastically growing, since we are no longer limited to automate the &quot;muscle&quot;, we are now starting to automate the &quot;brain&quot;.</p>
<p>In the past we had machines and robots already, but those were limited to precisely repeating tasks. All their movement was either pre-programmed or hardwired into the mechanics. If something unexpected happened, they couldn't react, they had no sensors or cameras that could tell them what is going on or ways to react to it. So you always needed humans around to monitor them and do the tasks that the machines couldn't do. If you look at those &quot;How stuff is made&quot; videos from the 80s you always see humans around the machine, as there are always steps in the production that the machine can't do.</p>
<p>This is changing now. Better cameras, sensors and AI means that we can now automate those last steps that still required humans. The robots can now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPTd8XDZOEk" target="_blank">react dynamically and are no longer required to follow a hardcoded track</a>. That kind of use is however still limited to the factory and not quite that revolutionary.</p>
<p>Where it is starting to become really interesting is outside the factories. Most obvious this is with self-driving cars. If you wanted to automate transportation in the past, you could, but you had to lay train tracks and have big control centers regulating it all. Today you can just take a car and have it drive itself. You do not need to change the environment to suit the machine, you can put the machine into a human environment and it can work it's way around. This open up a lot of areas to automation that historically didn't allow it, since there were no robots flexible and safe enough to handle those environments.</p>
<p>It also doesn't just stop with robots, a lot of jobs are already digital in nature, humans entering data into the computer and such, all of those jobs are open for grabs by AI, which has made rapid progress in the last few years and started to match human level performance in a lot of tasks. AI might still be a few decades away from passing the Turing test, but for a lot of jobs you don't need something indistinguishable from a human, but something that is good enough for the specific tasks and AI starts to be getting there.</p>
<p>All that said, it's worth keeping in mind that such revolutions in the job market don't happen overnight. A technology that has been demonstrated in the lab or on a trade show might still take decades until it is common place in every factory and often it might require to build a new factory from scratch to take full advantage of the automation that is already possible. When you look at newly build factory lines, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCgnWqoP4MM" target="_blank">Steam Controller</a> or what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_lfxPI5ObM" target="_blank">Tesla is doing</a> you will see a lot more automation than in factories that have been around for decades.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We are approaching a point where the machine can do almost all tasks just as good or better than a human. Thus making the human unneeded on the job market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Formers Competitive Powerlifter here- As far as performing a &quot;big lift&quot; goes, i.e. benchpress, deadlift, squat, etc: These movements, more when they are performed with heavy weight for either one or a few reps, require body stability, or &quot;tightness&quot;. When you breathe during a lift, your body shifts, however slightly. This is bad for the end goal of moving the weight.
So for example, the benchpress. A tense body, especially including the core, legs and shoulders, is extremely helpful in moving the weight. A breath will cause these muscles to temporarily loosen, which can be detrimental to the performer being stable. The slightest shift can cause leverages and the lifter's &quot;base&quot; to be much less strong. I myself was taught to take a big gulp of air and hold my breath until the lift was completed.
It should be known, however, that while this method is effective for moving a weight, it is not healthy in the long-run.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holding the breath braces your body by creating intrabdominal pressure.  The diagram contracts, moving slightly into the abdominal space.  The organs there are shifted and pressed against the lower back and abs.  The abs and lower back contract to counter this pressure.  This creates a sort of hydraulic support inside you.</p>
<p>On a squat, I inhale deeply and start the negative as I begin the hold.  I hit the bottom of the movement and push off.  I then exhale through the &quot;sticking point,&quot; that point where the work begins to get difficult.  I exhale fully and evenly as I push hard.  Exhaling like this adds more tension to the areas that holding the breath tensed and the exhalation increases output.</p>
<p>You need that hold because there gets a point where your body can't support the weight well because the weight is too heavy unless you do.  After a while you'll find you need a belt for very heavy lifts.  A good belt increases the intrabdominal pressure by giving the abs and back something to press against during the hold.</p>
<p>I can do about 50% more reps at higher weights (80% 1RM) with a belt than without the belt.  This is because my primary movers for the squat are outpacing my ability to support the weight in terms of strength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thunderstorms require a lot of warm, moist air moving up while a lot of cold, dry air is moving down. The warm air gets high enough that water droplets condense and make big clouds. The more air moving around, the bigger the cloud. The lightning comes from a build up of static electricity from the different air currents moving against each other. </p>
<p>If it's snowing, chances are there isn't enough warm air to form the right conditions. Snow requires cold, moist air. Dry air is much better at forming static electricity, and there generally aren't masses of air moving against each other when all the air is cold, like there would be if some was warm and some was cold. </p>
<p>Hail can often coincide with thunderstorms, however, because it's formed differently. When all that air is moving upwards, it can create some extremely powerful updrafts.

Theoretically there should be no limit, you keep smashing nuclei together to form higher and higher number elements which will decay faster than we would ever hope to detect them.</p>
<p>A more appropriate question would be, would we still consider it to be an element if it didn't stick around long enough to be detected, measured etc. for example if you scattered a proton off a Pb atom, for the fraction of a second which the proton interacts with the Pb nucleus (through elastic/inelastic scattering), would you consider it to be a Bi isotope or just a proton scattering off a Pb nucleus?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For example</p>
<p>Begin quote</p>
<p>In 1965, an extremely obese 27-year-old male, weighing in at 456 pounds fasted for 382 days (one year and 17 days) and lost 275.5 pounds.</p>
<p>Doctors from the University of Dundee monitored his condition throughout his fast. During his fast, he obese man recorded low glucose levels for 100 days and defecated every 40 to 50 days. He was given potassium tablets to keep his heart healthy and multi-vitamins every day.</p>
<p>According to ABC.au, the man was able to fast for over a year due to these factors:A year without food</p>
<p>Extreme weightloss: treating obesity by total starvation can be dangerous

Audio: A year without food (Science Online Audio)
Back in June of 1965, a Scotsman weighing 207 kilograms, described as &quot;grossly obese&quot; and hereafter known only as Mr A B, turned up at the Department of Medicine at the Royal Infirmary in Dundee.</p>
<p>He was sick of being fat and wanted to lose weight by eating nothing and living off his body fat. He told the hospital staff he was going to fast flat out, whatever they said, so they may as well monitor him along the way.</p>
<p>He ended up fasting for one year and 17 days — that's right, he ate no food at all for over a year. He lived entirely off his copious body fat, in the end losing about 125 kilograms of weight.</p>
<p>Treating obesity by total starvation can be dangerous. There are many reports of total starvation leading to death. For example, some people have died of heart failure during the fast, while another died on the 13th day of his fast from small bowel obstruction. Some people have died during the re-feeding period after the fast — one from lactic acidosis.</p>
<p>But to counter this, going hungry is natural. Humans like us (that's Homo sapiens) have been around for the last 200,000 years and for most of that time, food was not always at hand. We evolved to survive with not enough food. Some studies actually show that fasting (or at least, calorie restriction) can have health benefits under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Once you stop eating, your body gets its energy from the glucose in your bloodstream and liver, thanks to your last meal. You carry a semipermanent 0.5 to 1 kilogram of solids in your gut. The glucose from this runs out after about eight hours.</p>
<p>Then you start burning up a chemical called glycogen. Glycogen is simply a whole bunch of glucose molecules loosely stuck together. It's stored in your liver and muscles. Glycogen is really easy to break down into the individual glucose molecules from which it was made. You can burn glycogen to get the glucose you need for about another 36 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>After two or three days of fasting, you get your energy from two different sources simultaneously. A very small part of your energy comes from breaking down your muscles — but you can avoid this by doing some resistance training, otherwise known as pumping iron. The majority of your energy comes from breaking down fat.</p>
<p>But very soon, you move into getting all your energy from the breakdown of fat. The fat molecules break down into two separate chemicals — glycerol (which can be converted into glucose) and free fatty acids (which can be converted into other chemicals called ketones). Your body, including your brain, can run on this glucose and ketones until you finally run out of fat.</p>
<p>The average non-obese 70-kilogram male carries about 8,000 kilojoules of energy in glycogen, and about 400,000 kilojoules in his body fat.</p>
<p>In the case of our big Scotsman, Mr A B, the staff in the medical school at the University of Dundee kept a close eye on him. He did not eat any food, but the staff gave him yeast for the first 10 months and multi-vitamins every day. Potassium is essential for the proper working of the heart, and when his potassium levels got a little low around the 100-day mark, he was given potassium tablets for about 70 days. He defaecated infrequently, roughly every 40 to 50 days.</p>
<p>Blood samples were taken every fortnight, and his carbohydrate metabolism was checked on nine occasions during the 382 days of his fast. Surprisingly, for the last eight months of his fast, his blood glucose levels were consistently very low. They were around two millimoles, which is about half of the bottom end of the normal range. Even so, he did not suffer clinically from this abnormally low blood glucose level.</p>
<p>His weight dropped from 207 kilograms to 82 kilograms. Some five years later, he had regained only 7 kilograms.</p>
<p>In humans, fasting seems to have health benefits for high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma and epilepsy in children. In animals, fasting seems to reduce the cognitive decline that happens in conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>One problem with fasting is that you can get cranky and irritable (and sometimes hungry). Another is the lack of companionship with your fellow humans. After all, the word 'companion' comes from the roots 'com' meaning 'with' and 'panis' meaning 'bread'. If you spend lots of time not sharing meals with your kith and kin, you run the risk of becoming an outsider.</p>
<p>So to keep your friends, continue breaking bread — just don't eat it.</p>

<p>If someone starves to death, they will be extremely skinny when they die.  (See pictures of famine victims).  Being in a state of starvation is high stress on the body though, and people that are in poor health (Obesity does not promote good health) are at a higher risk of dying for tertiary reasons.</p>
<p>If you took 100 people at 10% body fat, 100 at 23%, and 100 at 35%, and put them all on water fasting, the average survival time before death is likely to be highest in those with more body fat, given the same relative health levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Alcohol gets broken down in your body by enzymes and eventually is used to make or store energy (as fat cells or for production of ATP). Someone who's body regularly deals with larger quantities of alcohol has their cells making more of those enzymes so that they can break the alcohol down faster. That doesn't mean it's healthier for them though, because all that effort is a huge strain on the liver, which not only filters impurities but also plays an important role in metabolism regulation.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Think of it like running a marathon.  If you practice everyday your tolerance for pain increases. Meaning you can push yourself further before you feel like you are on the edge of dying.  If you have ever tried running long distances without that training you would know very well that simply a few hundred meters can be enough for your body to give out. </p>
<p>Tolerance in this sense is a form of conditioning. In a way alcoholics condition themselves to ingest larger quantities of alcohol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people you see doing that end up in bad shape. They likely start vomiting and pass out. The ones who dont get alcohol poisoning have made it to that level of &quot;ability&quot; have done so through practice. A person develops a tolerance to alcohol just like anything else. </p>
<p>Edit: body mass and fat do have a lot to do with it but mostly only as a beginner. Ive seen thin/low body fat people drink like a pro and larger people get stupid with a couple drinks. I was a &quot;power drinker&quot; at 6'1 165 lbs. I quit drinking many years ago and now at 225 lbs, i would bet 2 beers would severely impair my motor skills. Practice and tolerance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely hate having to argue with the people who say this amount will make you vomit etc... I hate it because to my alcoholic husband this is just the opener for his day. He will tell me he's going to be sober, go out to &quot;smoke&quot; and another 750ml of vodka is gone. Yes he will pass out eventually but the only time he gets sick is if he is detoxing (which never lasts more than a day or so, why put your body through that?) if you have the tolerance, and a serious problem, you can easily consume this much alcohol and go back for more. It breaks my heart...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I've only seen this happen two times. once was at a drinking party  where a friend of mine was trying to prove she was a better drinker than a guy from Saskatchewan, she won but we immediately took her to the bathroom to make her throw up so that we wouldn't have to take her to the hospital an hour later.</p>
<p>the second time was while watching Archer. The various individuals seemed to managed to keep the alcohol down seemingly due to high tolerance to alcohol and by being cartoons</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
