		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially you have three constants which relate to different areas of Physics.  There is planck's constant hbar which relates to quantum mechanics,  the speed of light c,  which is to do with relativity,  and the universal gravitational constant G,  which relates to gravity. </p>
<p>There is only one way to combine these three to get a length which is</p>
<p>L = sqrt ( hbar  G / c^3 ) =1.61 Ã—10^-35</p>
<p>By dimensional analysis, this should occur as a natural length scale when dealing with the quantisation of gravitation and the curvature of space. It also occurs in an entropy calculation for black holes</p>
<p>S = A / (4 L)^2</p>
<p>With A the area of the event horizon.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will comment on Planck length in the end, but a better question is how did Max Planck calculate the Planck constant, which can be used to write down the Planck length.</p>
<p>So we know that a hot object emits radiation with certain distribution of wavelengths. This is called the black body radiation. But the exact form of the distribution was a bit of a mystery to the physicists in the end of the 19th century; it was pretty much known from the experiments, but a theory for the distribution was missing. </p>
<p>It turned out that the a missing piece of inventing this theory was assuming that light can only come in certain frequencies. Max Planck first introduced this assumption to his calculations just arbitrarily without any physical reasoning behind it. It turned out that the calculations indeed resulted in the correct shape for the black-body radiation spectrum. The only unknown parameter in the theory, the frequency spacing of different possible light frequencies, could be then calculated from the experiments. This parameter is called the Planck constant.</p>
<p>Now to your question about the Planck length.</p>
<p>In physics we often do something called dimensional analysis. If we have a bunch of parameters we know might be relevant to the phenomenon we want to study, we can try combining these parameters to produce all different kinds of derived parameters. Planck length is essentially just taking Planck constant, the gravitational constant and the speed of light and combining them in such a way that the resulting quantity has dimensions of length. This length scale is supposed to be the one at which the two phenomena represented by the ingredient parameters - gravitation and quantum mechanics - start both playing some role.</p>
<p>Planck might or might not have invented Planck length himself. Dimensional analysis as I described above is such a common tool for physicists that anyone who just knew about the three constants could immediately do it and thus the &quot;inventor&quot; of Planck length is probably not known.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To add: We don't really know if that length scale (and the other Planck scales) has any actual meaning. There are hints from theories we have at hand and it's quite believable that something ought to happen at these scales, but we don't have any experimental evidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two factors I think are worth mentionig.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Roche Limit describes the distance from a celestial body at which a satellite will be torn apart by tidal forces. It's approximate and depends somewhat on composition, but it is very roughly 2.5 radii of the main body. <a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/roche_limit.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
</li>
<li>The sphere of influence is the distance at which, in this case, the moon's gravity is less of a factor on an object than the earth's gravity. Any further from the moon than this and the object would no longer orbit the moon, but rather orbit Earth. Our moon's SOI is about 38 lunar radii <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_(astrodynamics)" target="_blank">source</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So a satellite of the moon needs to orbit at a distance greater than 2.5 lunar radii but less than 38. Closer and it would break up, further and it would drift away. Of course, as others have said, a subsatellite would not stay in this zone, as it's an unstable orbit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Children are predisposed to prefer sweet, as it indicates sugar and therefore high energy to volume ratio. As we get older, we lose some of this drive for fast, powerful energy sources.  We can tolerate more complex flavors, especially bitter like coffee or alcohol. </p>
<p>Personally, I think it also has to do with suffering hardship. A child may expend a lot of energy running around, but it is nothing like working a long day, sweating and hating the experience, and being acutely aware that putting yourself through such torture is necessary to not starve to death. A cold, bitter drink is refreshing in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Edit- Jesus, this one got popular. </p>
<p>1- I do not have a background in science, but my first statement is from memory on child psychology and anatomy/physiology courses in school. I was an art major and excellent at selecting classes that dropped my GPA while providing very little to my actual skill set. </p>
<p>2- It has been mentioned below that children also love sour- I think it's the same reason- in nature, sour tends to be fruit, and fruit tends to have sugar and vitamins children crave. </p>
<p>3- It has also been mentioned that bitter usually means poison in nature, and children tend to experience it more intensely to dissuade eating poison.</p>
<p>4- I am not depressed, but I have been. I have been over educated and working in some deep hell pits. Double edit- this is not to brag. I have a degree. I have also worked in a place where my coworkers literally could not spell their two-letter gang sign. It was grim. I know that there are many in worse positions, and that made it worse to feel like a egotistical wuss FOR feeling that way on top of feeling that way. However, in that situation, cold bitter drinks helped &quot;shock&quot; the system, embracing the bitter and embracing my situation and being able to calm down. </p>
<p>5- Some kids do manual labor. Some kids have a shitty lot. They don't like beer either. However, I don't think most children have the faculties to understand the gravity of many situations. Humans tend to have difficulty thinking to the future until their mid 20's. It's not just the labor itself, it's the &quot;oh my god, I might be doing this for the rest of my life. I might die here. I might never get to fulfill the dreams I have&quot; kind of thoughts that   struggling adults have and children don't.</p>
<p>Final edit- this was not intended to be an all-inclusive answer. I don't think hardship is the ONLY reason to enjoy beer or other bitter drinks, but I do believe it is a factor. As mentioned, we have the physiological change to tastebuds, social pressure and the chemical aspect of alcohol as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taste/smell are substantially about figuring out whether food and drink are good and full of energy, or bad and poisonous. From birth, sweet=calories=good, but infants in their first few months are pretty open to any flavor. Soon enough, though, they become more cautious, especially disliking bitter flavors. This persists for a long time, and varies genetically a bit, but sensitivity to bitterness seems to decrease in adulthood.</p>
<p>Repeated exposure helps a lot. If it hasn't caused nausea or death after a few times, it's probably not poison. Initially, beer tastes bitter and alcoholic. With repeated consumption, both the alcohol and bitter hops become less prominent, while more pleasing sensations like yeast, sweet malt, or hop aroma become more apparent.</p>
<p>Finally, there's probably some conditioning taking place. The first time one drinks beer, it tastes unpleasant. If one keeps drinking, however, it becomes associated with hydration, nutrition, and intoxication. A similar process may lead to coffee, initially quite strong and bitter-tasting, becoming associated with mild stimulation and therefore more pleasant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>B.A. in psychology with a study in neuroscience </p>
<p>Here is an official scientific explanation, keeping it simple:</p>
<p>The taste of beer is not the only taste that becomes more enjoyable with growth. First of all, the gustatory cells that make up the tongue regenerate at a noticeably reduced rate in comparison to superficial damage to our epithelial skin. Thus, damage to the tongue can last a long time and has a good chance of being permanent. An example of someone who lost their taste as a result of cancer to the tongue is the famous cook Grant Achatz. If you look into his story, you will see he regained his taste, but it only came back after months.</p>
<p>Now, with that in mind, consider the presence of taste receptors on the tongue. The distribution for every human being is going to be unique, but a common factor among children is that they have a larger amount of taste receptors that have been exposed to fewer toxins or damage. As a result, they can taste more intensely, and thus prefer sweets to bitterness. </p>
<p>So why do old people acquire a taste for beer? There's an old Slavic joke - Why does Vodka taste better the more you drink it? Because it burns your taste buds off. Joke aside, that is indeed what can happen. As we age, our taste receptors work less well and we taste certain flavors, such as bitterness, with reduced sensitivity. Of course, these changes are not generalized and there are many outliers, which is why some individuals may never acquire a taste for beer. Keep in mind though that taste is never pure and is always a complex sensation of mixed taste receptors being activated.</p>
<p>So, as we age, our tongue receptors change, and the way they change results in less sensitivity to bitterness, which enables us to appreciate the complexity in the flavors of beers more than being overloaded with the initial bitter taste. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically your taste buds, especially the ones which taste bitterness become less effective as you age. You can taste less and less of the bitterness of beer as you age.

<p>Having said that, I'm 53; I don't like beer. When I was in college and all my friends were drinking beer, I tried it too. The first few sips were OK, but then the taste was unpleasant and the only way to finish a bottle was through willpower.</p>
<p>I realized that if I stuck with it and kept trying it over and over, I'd be likely to acquire a taste for it. But why?  It has a large number of low quality calories, costs significant money, inhibits what activities I can do after drinking, and consuming it causes health risks.</p>
<p>I was never a joiner so it didn't bother me go my own way, and I had cool friends who never pressured me into drinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A random high school band teacher may be a great conductor, and a great (world class) conductor may make a terrible high school band conductor.  (Though in my experience, most conductors who rise to the top of their field are prodigiously inspiring communicators and could probably coax beautiful music out of an elementary school recorder ensemble -- but this is not to say that they would excel at the day-to-day grind of teaching young musicians).  </p>
<p><strong>IN PERFORMANCE</strong>    </p>
<p>In very, very, general terms, a high school band conductor has to put more emphasis on the mechanical elements of a performance -- keeping the beat, adjusting balance, cueing entrances and cutoffs, etc.  Depending on the level of the ensemble (which varies IMMENSELY at the high school level), the director may have to spend all of his/her energy just ensuring a mostly-accurate rendition of the music, OR with more proficient students he/she may have more room to focus on artistic/expressive interpretation.  </p>
<p>A conductor of a world-class orchestra rarely has to work to keep the ensemble together (though it depends on the complexity and familiarity of the music), and rarely has to worry about preventing trainwrecks in terms of intonation, accuracy of rhythm/pitch, blend/balance, etc.  The conductor <em>does</em> make adjustments to these elements, but on a much more subtle level that the average person would barely notice.  A professional orchestra could perform most repertoire without a conductor and it would sound fine.  But a great conductor can take it to the next level and beyond -- first of all, the conductor can hear the 'bigger picture' of the whole orchestra better than any individual musician, and second, the conductor has a vision (audiation?) of the music as he/she imagines it, and can sculpt the orchestra's performance through body language and (what sometimes feels like) sheer psychic force of will.     </p>
<p><strong>IN REHEARSAL / PREPARATION</strong>    </p>
<p>So far I'm only discussing what the conductor does <em>in performance.</em>  In reality, the conductor's main job is what happens in rehearsal.  A high school band director is, first and foremost, a teacher.  Depending on the level of the students, the teacher spends a lot of time crafting lessons to teach technical skills and concepts, as well as fixing wrong notes, developing music reading skills, working on exercises and warm-ups to improve tone and intonation, giving instrument-specific technique instructions for solving problems that the students may be too inexperienced to figure out for themselves, etc.  (Not to mention managing behavior, maintaining records, communicating with parents, and all of the clerical/leadership duties involved in classroom teaching and managing a performing organization).  </p>
<p>A world-class conductor doesn't have to micro-manage the fingers and lips of an orchestra full of technically-superior musicians--the conductor will express what kind of sound he/she wants and the musicians will know how to make that sound.  (In some cases the conductor will give specific instructions, for example telling the violins to play with the tips of their bows, or to use a specific hand position or fingering -- but this is a matter of establishing a consistent section sound and matching the conductor's interpretation, not a matter of teaching the musician something they didn't know).    </p>
<p>To be fair, a high school conductor typically does all of the things that a world-class conductor does, but often has to focus a lot more on the educational/technical/mechanical aspects of rehearsing/performing.  The artistic/expressive/interpretive aspects of music are an essential part of this, but they're not particularly effective until the kids are playing accurately and together.  Further, the level of artistry a high school conductor can coax from an ensemble tends to be less nuanced due to the relative inexperience of the students and the presence of 'weak links.'  (That said, a strong high school ensemble can play quite maturely).  </p>
<p>A world-class conductor can take most of the educational/technical/mechanical aspects for granted (at least on a macro level) and focus almost entirely on artistic expression and very subtle shading/sculpting of the technical aspects.     </p>
<p><strong>GENERAL TRAITS</strong>    </p>
<p>Ultimately, conducting is a matter of leadership and professionalism.  World-class conductors, by and large, are RIDICULOUSLY accomplished musicians with incredible ears and insanely deep and intimate understanding of the repertoire.  Every day they have to stand in front of 60-80 of the world's best musicians and earn/maintain their respect and awe.  They have to inspire and lead and communicate their interpretations of the music to 60-80 individual musicians who all have their own ideas and interpretations.  </p>
<p>High school conductors have to do the same but the leadership tends to be more about teaching and classroom management skills, similar to the leadership required of any academic teacher.  It typically goes without saying that the band director is a much more accomplished musician than his/her students (though not necessarily a <em>better</em> musician -- there is the occasional hotshot student who could compete with the teacher in certain areas of proficiency, but probably not in terms of experience and breadth of musical understanding).  But in a high school ensemble, simply being a strong musician is rarely enough to lead and inspire a group of kids, many of whom are only there for fun and don't really care much about developing into professional musicians.  A world-class conductor may get good results guest-conducting a high school band due to the awe factor and his/her fresh approaches and inspiring demeanor, but wouldn't necessarily be up to the task of the daily pedagogy and management required to prepare the student musicians.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to keep in mind that a conductor is nearly always the leader of the orchestra, too.  So for weeks and months before you see him/her waving a baton around, they were in charge of auditioning band members, selecting the music, organizing rehearsals, making artistic changes or interpretations to the piece as it goes, and directing each section and musician.  So there was a hell of a lot of behind-the-scenes work that we don't always think of.</p>
<p>As far as actual performance, a good conductor is giving a dozen instructions at once.  Speed, volume, and style are all communicated by single movements.  Are his beats large, waving motions, full of drama?  I'll bet there'll be horns blaring long, sonorous notes.  Are they short, tight, precise movements, close to his chest?  You're almost definitely going to be hearing soft, short staccato notes.  Is he facing the trombones, pushing one hand down while conducting with his other hand?  He's asking them to play softer - maybe the acoustics in this room aren't what they're used to, and they're overpowering the rest of the band more than expected.  There are a million little adjustments that will go on in any given performance, and a good conductor can make them on the fly in very clear ways.</p>
<p>And of course, all of that body language goes to the audience too.  When you see that person swinging their arms in big, wide arcs, you'll get excited, even as the music begins to swell.  And when you see them sweep their arms in, you'll lean in, straining to hear the soft parts of the music.  The conductor is a visual cue to you to tell you what your ears can expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A great conductor does all things mentioned in the thread so far, but what sets one above all others for me is of they can bring musicians out of their own heads and make them CONNECT to the music.  Technical skill is only means to an end, and in the end what really matters is if you made the audience feel something.<br />
My choir conductor will regularly have these incredibly deep speeches about the music we're performing, and he always gives us so much to think about right before we begin (these speeches are often within the hour before we go on).  He understands what is really important to the audience and people in general, and is really willing to be as vulnerable as we need to be.<br />
I remember once we were performing Eriks Esenvalds' &quot;Rivers of Light&quot;, and what he said to us was actually so incredibly vulnerable and heartbreaking that it made it hard for us to focus on the technical aspects of the piece; but we had one of our most incredible performances of that year, and the audience responded extremely well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers below, but I've found a lot of people (not the people answering below, just in general) don't really know what a conductor does. Hint: He's not just waving a stick in time to the music.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about playing in an orchestra: You can't actually hear all the other instruments. If you're in the middle of the brass section, chances are you can't hear the flutes. So you don't know if you're playing in time, playing too softly or loudly or if you need to slow down or speed up.</p>
<p>That's what the conductor is for. He's front and center and can hear everyone. So his job is basically to signal each section when to come in, indicate the tempo, when to play louder or softer...and this is really <em>really</em> difficult to do well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Working in AdTech for 4 years for various big Digital Marketing clients.</p>
<p>You can't buy most data from the bigger companies like Google and Facebook. You can use the tracking mechanisms (Google Analytics Tracking, Facebook Pixel, Conversion tracking etc) to track visitors based on Sessions mostly stored in Cookies.</p>
<p>It's stored in FB/Google's backends and if you don't have your own DMP (Data Management Platform) with your own 1st party data, then you can't buy/sell that much. You just use their FB/Google tools to build targeted audiences to better target the appropriate ads in their Ad Networks.</p>
<p>You can use their tools or their API to query your questions against the data you collected using their Analytics solutions and you could integrate some custom data sending into your own backend (CRM, shop system etc).</p>
<p>It's actually stored in their databases and they limit the granulairty of what you can get out of their APIs throuh quotas and limitations. What you get out mostly, are simple lists of &quot;show me the average shopping cart amount in USD per marketing channel&quot;, then you'll get a list that tells you:</p>
<ul>
<li>AdWords Campaign 1, 66$</li>
<li>AdWords Campaign 2, 74$</li>
<li>Facebook Campaign 1, 120$</li>
</ul>
<p>Marketers then make assumptions based on the data they get out of analytics tools. </p>
<p>For companies as big as LinkedIn, Google, Facebook you can basically be sure, that they're not selling any data. Their business model is to create the best possible tracking solution to get the most accurate data and then use that to sell you (the advertiser) the possibility to target your Ads as good as possible. So if the advertisers get better targeting, they can do better advertising, which leads to more revenue per invested advertising budget. This, in theory optimizes the budgets, and the advertisers will spend more. It's a win win: advertiser is happy to spend more, but also gets more revenue, the users get better ads that are in theory useful to their intend and the networks get more money.</p>
<p>Bigger clients (companies) usually use a marketing cloud like Adobe Marketing Cloud, Oracle Marketing Cloud, IBM Marketing Cloud or Google Analytics 360, which costs around 130+k $ per year. It allows you to actually own the data in your own DMP which is called 1st party data.</p>
<p>With a DMP you can do cool things, like sell your 1st party data (non-identifiable data, so it's not your name, it's just your cookie) in the marketplace to others. You can also buy other 1st party data from that marketplace. It's used to improve audience building and improve the targeting. Better targeting - better ads - more revenue.</p>
<p>Furthermore the analytics data is also used to optimize automated campaign optimization through automated bidding or machine learning supported bidding. Why bidding? Because in many networks you need to bid a price to show an ad to a user in real time, and the ad-network's algorithms will decide automatically which bid wins and finally which advertisers ad will be shown. The algorithms are mostly optimized to not show just the highest bid, but also the most fitting ad (best targeted ad). Those Real Time Bidding (RTB) platforms need data to show ads to their visitors as well.</p>
<p>Now there's a maret for less famous and less ethical networks. They're happy to sell anything they collect: email addresses with more dimensions like: for what site you used it to register, what interests therefore you might have, your age etc. Email marketing from those shady networks and vendors selling data is basically what then leads to spam.</p>
<p>Buying/selling names, physical addresses and other PII (personal identifiable information) is is shady business but still done on a large scale. But it's not the business model of the big networks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I ask for your license because a lot of times the driver isn't the registered owner of the car.  Sure I can look it up by name/dob, but the card lets me compare faces right there. You can give me someone's name/dob that looks super similar to you, and get away with it. Most fake IDs are easy as hell to spot. Once I get someone's license I don't even bother to look at the dates on it, I just run their license number through NCIC to make sure it is valid.</p>
<p>I ask for registration for the sole purpose of showing people their shit is actually expired. I know it is expired because I already ran it before I pulled you, but 99% of the time I'll get a &quot;it can't be expired&quot; or &quot;there is no way it has been expired that long&quot;. If they've already dug out the registration is can literally point to it and end that line of argument.</p>
<p>Another good thing about asking for documents is that it is great for getting people who are drunk/high. Most can get their IDs just fine, but I've yet to see a drunk get their registration right on the first try. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also, I'm not sure if their computers can pull your picture to verify you're not giving them someone else's name and DOB. Many rural areas probably still do radio dispatching. </p>
<p>Also, in the US there's no requirement to carry a passport or national ID card, so a driver's license is a de-facto ID card for drinking, cashing a check, renting a hotel room, whatever (If you don't drive you can get a non-drivers-license state ID card). Generally children don't have a need to carry an ID until they're old enough to drive. </p>

<p>The laser has two mirrors facing at each other. The medium between them is active so that it will radiate light in random direction when you pump energy to it .</p>
<p>Since the directions are random some of the emitted light is emitted so that it is trapped between the two mirrors.</p>
<p>Now that you havelight bouncing in between the mirrors the lasing effect can happen. The light bouncing in the medium will stimulate the medium so that it emitts light that is identical to the light already bouncing in. You get more and more light bouncing between the mirrors.</p>
<p>To get the laser beam out one of the mirrors allows some light through.</p>
<p>Also high reflectance isn't enough. The mirrors must be placed so that the light bouncing in between them forms a standing wave. Otherwise light will leak out. Without forming standing wave light will leak out even if the mirrors have perfect 100% reflectance and they are in vacuum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One thing is to get weights or in the case of a metallic bathtub magnets and place them on the sides of the tub with the curtain between the surface and the magnet. This will reduce the effect, especially if you can get them at both corners and the middle rim of the tub as well.</p>
<p>Some shower curtains have these weights/magnets <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CkxSQJRO1AY/U7qDB9CTG7I/AAAAAAAABnU/sm6bhCGZVZ8/s1600/magnetic+shower+curtain+has+magnets+embedded.jpg" target="_blank">built in</a>, while others have <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9cfUx4t_Zt4/VLHE4bXr3wI/AAAAAAAACJI/Y8GTzf0naAU/s1600/heavy-weights-for-shower-curtain-bottom.jpg" target="_blank">suction cups</a> at the bottom.

In short, the main reason is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli's_principle" target="_blank">Bernoulli's principle</a>, which states that an increase in flow rate of a fluid corresponds with a decrease in pressure. The water flowing on the inside of the shower causes the air to flow, as both are fluids. This decreases the pressure inside the shower curtain relative to the outside, which contains still air. Thus, the pressure is greater outside the curtain than inside, causing it to move inward. This works for water at any temperature, but the effect is amplified at higher temperatures because the hot air moves upward allowing cold are to enter from the bottom, where the curtain is able to move freely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's going to have their own reason, that somewhat reflects their opinions of society, so that needs to be considered, but my two cents:</p>
<p>Values and costs related to raising children.  It wasn't until fairly recently that a person would study and train for 20 years before they could start working, and education beyond that would largely effect how much you would make.  That means that in order for a child to begin making money, they need to be a full-grown independent adult, with substantial financial investment by their parents.  </p>
<p>This wasn't the case in the past.  100 years ago, a relatively young child, with relatively non-existent education could be economically productive, especially in less developed, more agricultural areas.  That means that a child could spend something like 10 years working before they were ready to go out on their own, which was an economic benefit to their families, lessening workload, <em>and</em> providing a sort of retirement plan.  They were an investment.</p>
<p>In those situations, it wasn't just economically feasible to be a stay-at-home mom, it was good business, a woman could find herself doing much better in most situations with a horde of children doing chores in a farm or working in factories, this incentivized getting <em>and staying</em> married.  </p>
<p>Today, your eight year old son, for most situations, isn't tending to the livestock.  They're going to school, costing money, and will likely leave the moment they become economically self-sufficient (in their mid-20s).  That means that raising kids is something you do for fun or self-fulfillment, and marriage goes right along with it.  If you don't want to spend all of your time raising six kids, you don't need a spouse to either make money or manage the household.</p>
<p>If you don't <em>need</em> a spouse, then the only thing keeping you together is feelings and emotion, which no matter how sentimental a person is, just doesn't have the same pull as &quot;My plan for when I get old is to live in this same house with these kids taking care of me, and if we get divorced, I'll have nothing.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We want our friends to like us for introducing them to it. We want recognition of being cool / cultured / having good taste - whatever.</p>
<p>My favorite author* on child psychology says that the deepest desire, the deepest motivator, for all people is a need to be seen. We want to be seen as valuable and something special, be accepted for who we really are. Sharing what we like is a form of openness and vulnerability, and that makes us even more focused on getting the right feedback, so we get nervous about whether this movie, or show, or music actually made the mark.</p>
<p>That's why I value it greatly when friends share their interests with me, and I make sure they are seen when they share.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to be guilty of showing things to my friends and expecting a certain reaction out of them, and it took me such a long time to finally realize why it doesn't work. Basically, it just creates a certain 'all-or-nothing' pressure that feels gross both to impose on someone else and for that person to notice is being thrust on them. Even just saying &quot;Hey I did watch this already but I'd love to rewatch it with you!&quot; subtly turns people off since they're worried you're focusing more on their reaction than discovering something together. </p>
<p>It's an understandable mistake to make - I always get a vicarious rush when someone I know discovers for the first time a long-time favorite of mine (that actually pretty much sums up nerd-dom in general). But what I've realized is that you need to either wait for them to discover it on their own, or very casually ease them into it while accepting that despite them being on the same wavelength as you in general, they might end up hating it - and that's totally okay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have that problem where my gf and I will be totally looking forward to a show but if I happen to watch an episode before her she will lose all interest in the entire series no matter what.  It basically has to be her idea and on her own terms and we must watch everything together.  She seemed totally down with the previews of Westworld but the second she found out I watched the first episode on my own she basically blacklisted it for herself.  Hasn't watched the series to this day.  Meanwhile she has no problem powering though a 22 episode season of some other random show in a week and asking me why I haven't given it a chance or why I won't rewatch it with her.  Some people just need to feel like they're the entertainers I think.  </p>
<p>Also as others have said before some of it may come from constantly worrying what your friend is thinking.  The best way to ensure your friend doesn't enjoy what you're showing them is to constantly pause the show/movie and try to get them to validate how kewl it is.  It's very awkward for them and a guaranteed way to ensure they never wanna watch anything you suggest to them again.</p>
<p>Edit: I suppose I'll add that it is indeed a dick move on my part to watch something without her that we planned on watching together.  That being said she will occasionally do the same thing.  Like I suggested she rewatch season one of Master of None so we could start season two.  She admitted to me after two days that she got so hooked she binged watched straight through season two one night while I was asleep.  I just laughed cause it didn't really bother me.  She is a binge watch pro and can burn through shows way faster than I can.  I came clean and admitted I started season five of the Americans without her and she didn't mind.  Sometimes we just aren't on the same wavelength with shows I guess.  We usually understand, but as I said above earlier she has a really difficult time getting into something I've started without her.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's cause when you watch a show, it usually takes a bit for the cast to mesh together and for them to hit a good stride for the humor. So by the time you're usually in the position where you feel this show is so great that you want to share it with people, you usually have watched a bunch of episodes already. </p>
<p>But when you typically show it to your friends, you start on the first episode, which may not be that super amazing as the later episodes are, especially once you know the characters and their idiosyncrasies yet. </p>
<p>Just recently this happened to me with Stranger Things. My roommate raved about it, and wanted me to watch it. I watched the first episode and was meh, but he insisted I watch a few more. I did, and enjoyed them. But he made his recommendation to me by the time he already saw 4 of the episodes, so his perception was a bit different. </p>
<p>Hope that makes sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agree with most of these comments, but some fail (in my opinion) to pinpoint exactly where the &quot;weird, awkward&quot; feeling comes from. I have 2 possible culprits for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Extra knowledge. When watching a series for a second time, you usually notice things that play a part later. Things you didn't notice before. This can make a series more enjoyable to watch again, but also makes you a lot more enthusiastic while watching it with the newly introduced friend. Imagine me pointing at a really small, tiny detail and saying &quot;That is so awesome&quot;, simply because it matters a lot later. kinda makes it weird.</p>
</li>
<li>And this is the big one. When watching a series that you really want someone to like, it's kinda like preparing for a date. You want it to be awesome, you want it to be perfect. Thus you notice the small problems so much more. Due to your own fear of the other person not liking the series, you instinctively notice more bad parts and end up trying to defend it, rather then enjoying the movie. Your friend will likely not even notice these small things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, our brains are kinda weirdly wired when it comes to introducing things to others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
