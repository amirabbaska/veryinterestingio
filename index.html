		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is probably pretty unsatisfying: because that's the way it is.  There is no reason that light, energy and everything else <em>has</em> to move in waves.  In fact, some really smart people (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpuscular_theory_of_light#Sir_Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a>) initially thought that light was just particles that moved in a straight line.</p>
<p>However, eventually we observed phenomena like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction" target="_blank">diffraction</a>, which posed a serious problem for the idea that light is just a bunch of particles flying through the air.  However, diffraction and other such phenomena are easily explained if light is a wave.  </p>
<p>So light must be a wave?  Not so.  Albert Einstein came along and solve the problem of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect" target="_blank">photoelectric effect</a>, which he did by assuming that, instead of waves, light actually <em>was</em> just particles flying around.  </p>
<p>So who's right?  Those who observed diffraction and said light must therefore be waves?  Or those who observed the photoelectric effect, and said that light must therefore be particles?  The answer is, both and neither.  And an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" target="_blank">experiment</a> was done that showed just that.  Turns out, light is not a wave, although it acts like a wave sometimes.  And light is not a particle, although it also acts like a particle.  It's something totally different.</p>
<p>All mass and energy in the universe is now understood to have wavelike and particle-like behavior.  So no, there is no way to transfer energy that avoids the wave-like nature of mass-energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Whilst seemingly invisible, space particles react to all types of energy particles, such that when space particles are struck by an energy particle, a particle of the same type and magnitude is ejected from the diametrically opposite side of the space particle. Like a 3-D domino effect.</p>
<p>Resulting in what seems like a continuous stream of the energy particles. As the stream of energy particles reach a harmony, the resulting harmony becomes a wave with a frequency.</p>
<p>Different energy particles have different frequencies and move through space at their allocated speed. For instance, a neutrino could travel through 16 trillion light years of steel as if it wasn't even there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It's influenced by two main things; how much an object deforms when it hits something, and how much energy it loses in that process. </p>
<p>Something very hard like a rock, loses lots of energy when it deforms but is very hard so overall can seem 'bouncy'. </p>
<p>A superball deforms a lot (relatively) when it hits something but doesn't lose much energy, so is also very 'bouncy'.</p>
<p>What influences how much energy something loses during impact is a much more complicated question.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's an extremely broad question that brings up many answers, but usually geometry, and materials.   </p>
<p>Round shapes filled with air, like balls tend to be bouncy because when they hit the ground, the air compresses to a higher pressure, and then when it returns to it's original pressure it bounces back.</p>
<p>If you are talking about rubber versus hard plastic, usually you are talking about rubber being made of long chains of organic molecules, that can be thought of like a bunch of strings tangled together in a ball.  If you pull at opposite ends of the ball, strings will slide past each other and stretch out to an elongated shape versus the coiled up shapes they started in.  Chemical bonds and van der waal's forces can pull them back to their original shape.</p>
<p>Hard Plastic tends to have their long chains of organic molecules so tightly crosslinked to other molecules that they can't slide past.  Think of them as being more heavily knotted tangled jumbles of string.</p>
<p>Hope that helps some, although I'm not sure it is a clear definition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm sure someone will school me otherwise or in more detail.</p>

<p>This is partially true, and why there are plenty of examples (especially in the earlier parts of the space program) of multiple copies of something being launched.</p>
<p>E: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_probes" target="_blank">Note how many duplicate missions there are on this list</a></p>
<p>However, at this point that doesn't really make too much sense.  That's because launch cost is enormous.  To LEO, depending on your contract, it costs on the order of $10-$50k/lb.  Since there's that whole &quot;rocket equation tyranny&quot; thing, a deep space probe will have to bring a few times its mass in fuel beyond LEO in order to get the rest of the way out of Earth's gravity well.</p>
<p>When you're talking possibly as much as $100k/lb, you want <em>exactly</em> the right instrumentation for exactly what you're trying to do.  So yes, you reuse what you can, but if the mission is better suited by something a little different -- you make something different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It may not be obvious on the surface, but there is actually a TON of reused stuff at an engineering level from mission to mission. This is especially true within each space center. </p>
<p>For example, Mars Curiosity (MSL) and SMAP are both JPL projects and are based on the same software architecture and similar hardware components (at least the spacecraft part of MSL, that is). MSL is obviously a Mars rover, while SMAP was essentially an advanced weather satellite. Not exactly clear on the surface that they share a lot of technology.</p>
<p>Another more obvious example is Mars2020, which will be extremely similar to MSL with different and more advanced instruments.</p>
<p>If you study projects a bit more closely, this sort of thing happens all of the time. Even if it isn't a near copy-paste like MSL to M2020, there is a LOT if legacy software and hardware in most science missions. Things like GNC modules, communication systems, power systems, etc. Only systems unique to that mission, usually, will be completely new engineering (such as the entry, decent, and landing phase of MSL).</p>
<p>TLDR, the software and hardware of science missions are extremely modular and there is a lot of legacy technology used, especially within each space center, even if it's not obvious on the surface. Spacecraft design is a very evolutionary process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume, you are talking about space probes of the kind that goes ot other planets. Then the short answer to this question is a partial yes.<br />
The longer answer requires understanding of how such space probes are developed, the difference between the space craft, platform and payload as well as the different requirements for different missions.<br />
First of all space probes are always developed by the big space agencies, e.g. NASA or ESA. They will announce a proposal for a mission to some planet for example. Then a lot of different researchers from different institutes will start designing instruments that will go on such a mission. The main organization (lets use ESA for this example) then selects the best candidates. Important is here the difference between the platform and the payload. While ESA provides the platform, different institutes or principle investigators are designing instruments or instrument packages that go onto the platform as the payload. The platform includes central processing units, communication, attitude control, propulsion and power management, the payload is only doing the scientific work. This means we have different requirements for the payload and the platform. The payload must fullfill the scientific requirements while the platform must fullfill the operational requirements. The conditions at the different planets are very diverse and different scientific objectives also require different operational requirements. For example the space probe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Explorer" target="_blank">JUICE</a> currently under development by ESA will spend extended time in the heavy radiation environment around Jupiter. Therefore lots of radiation shielding for both Payload and platform are needed. Spacecraft around Mars won't need such a radiation shielding.
How far away from the sun will the spacecraft be. A spacecraft around Mars can comfortably use solar sails to collect energy to power the whole spacecraft. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons" target="_blank">New Horizons</a> that flew to Pluto was too far away and needed its own power source. It used a radioisotope thermal generator instead.<br />
Another important factor to consider is the type of encounter that the spacecraft was supposed to have. Is it just a fly-by as in the case of New Horizons or is it supposed to spend extended time in orbit around its destination. Going into orbit requires extra fuel and propulsion that needs to be considered.<br />
The point with these last examples two is that these are considerations for the platform, not the payload. That means the payload is more or less independent from these considerations. That means that different instruments can be flown with only minor changes on different missions. For example the <a href="http://www2.irf.se/program/sspt/?dbfile=Rosetta_ICA&amp;link[Projects]=Launched_sp_Satellite_sp_projects" target="_blank">Ion Composition Analyzer</a> on the Rosetta mission is almost the same as the Ion Mass Analyzer on the Mars Express mission.<br />
The platform on the other hand needs to be tailored specifically for every single mission to be able to satisfy all the requirements on orbit, power consumption etc. etc. Of course if two missions have similar requirements the designs will be similar. But you need to consider, we don't launch these kinds of missions very often. So after launching one we learn new things from that mission. For the next mission the lessons learned can be applied and the design be improved.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Really what I am trying to say is that these kind of missions are not built all together but in separate modules and some parts of these modules can be reused. But most cannot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I could be wrong but the way you phrased this question leads m to believe that you are making a false assumption. It is not often that a mission in space is a broad exploration. They almost always have a very specific objective. Sending a duplicate probe doesn't really do much good if you send it to a different location. You don't just send to probes and say: &quot;Alright, we will send two probes and wherever they happen to land, that's the area we will study. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The reason I'm asking, is that I rarely see any unremovable stains or other problems with my clothes after a single wash in a 40C cycle - perhaps I see a problematic stain only once or twice a year. (This is with the exception of old clothes I use for yard work or car repair, which I don't expect to get clean at all). Yet, all the ads make it seem like stains are a huge issue - so is this just marketing BS, or is it something that would have been the case some time ago?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might want to ask this is r/neuroscience. I'm an undergraduate student with a very limited understanding of this topic, but nobody else seems to be giving you a good answer, so I'll give it a shot. </p>
<p>From what I understand, you have down-regulation of serotonin and norepinephrine receptors after chronic antidepressant use, but this isn't necessarily a negative thing, it's just evidence that those receptors have been particularly active lately. However, this increase in activation actually causes changes to happen in the cell that are hypothesized by some to treat the underlying cause of depression. The most important change is an upregulation of proteins in the cyclic-AMP pathway, including the transcription factor CREB, and its gene products such as BDNF, a cell-growth and synapse-stability-promoting protein, and it's receptor, TrkB. This is particularly important in the hippocampus, because it's implicated in increasing the number of synapses, the strength of synapses, and possibly promoting neurogenesis, and hippocampal volume reduction is associated with depression. The hippocampus does a lot of things, and is an important player in how your brain responds to stress. Basically, the hippocampus provides negative feedback to the stress circuit, but chronic stress can reduce hippocampal size and make it worse at its job. The stress circuit involves many other brain areas that contribute to depressive symptoms, such as the hypothalamus, which regulates sleep and hunger, for instance. Anyway, depression is really complicated and not perfectly understood, but if you want to learn more, I suggest looking up cAMP hypothesis of depression. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Apoptotic effects are not limited to neoplastic tissue. Antidepressants have been found to
cause cell death in non-cancerous hippocampal neurons in vitro
(Post et al., 2000; Bartholoma et al., 2002) and in vivo (Sairanen et al., 2005). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(apoptosis = programmed cell death).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Antidepressants increase the brain’s susceptibility to future
episodes of depression (Andrews et al., 2011). They cause neuronal
damage (Kalia et al., 2000), apoptosis (Post et al., 2000; Bartholoma
et al., 2002; Sairanen et al., 2005), and dematuration (Kobayashi
et al., 2010). The evidence that antidepressants directly promote
neurogenesis is equivocal. It is quite possible that any neurogenesis that does take place is a compensatory response of the brain to
antidepressant-induced apoptosis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also emerging evidence of a condition named &quot;post-SSRI sexual dysfunction&quot; (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778697" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778697</a>).

Since our body controls its muscles through the nervous system with electrical signals, an overload of these signals might cause serious contractions and even paralysis.

The major way people die from electric shocks is if it goes through the heart. Your heart is a finely tuned machine that does not appreciate a sudden external signal saying contract all muscles. If you're lucky, your heart resumes beating with its normal pattern. If not, hope someone around knows CPR.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is also a bugbear for medical shows - the device with the paddles and the shouting clear doesn't restart the heart, it stops the heart and is used when the rhythm has gone wrong (called fibrillation). The heart can then restart itself with the correct rhythm (hopefully).</p>
<p>Edit: thanks to the 5000 electricians who have correctly pointed out that devices exist for checking if a circuit is live. Use a device if you have one (and if you haven't got one, why are you working on your electrics?). The only time that tip saved by bacon was when I found an unknown wire in my loft. The main house breaker was off, but it turned out some enterprising previous owner had hooked the loft lights up to my neighbours power. 240V is unpleasant (and made my hand &amp; arm contract fast enough to bruise all my knuckles on a joist).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things really. One of the biggies, is that often electrocution over rides conscious muscle control, and so the person who becomes electrocuted is unable to let go or jump back out of harms way once it starts. They may be thrown clear by their own muscles spasming, or they may instead grip the wire even tighter. </p>
<ol>
<li>Your autonomous nervous system such as heart beat and your internal organs, uses electrical impulses to keep everything working. Electrocution can interrupt or over ride these signals, preventing the heart from beating correctly or sometimes stopping the heart all together. In order for this to happen, the electricity must pass over the critical chest area and vagus nerve. For example touching a livewire with both hands would form a connection from one hand, through the arm, chest, and out the other arm, stopping the heart. Grabbing it one handed might cause it to form a circuit going up the arm, down the side of the body and through the feet. </li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn't take much amperage for this to happen, but it usually requires high voltage. Also alternating current is more disruptive to the body than direct current, and more likely to electrocute somebody even at lower amps and voltage. </p>
<p>And #2 Amperage can cause burns. The same action that causes the filament in a light bulb to glow bright orange, causes your body tissue to get hot and can cause electrical burns as the rapid influx of electricity pushes past the electrical resistance of the body and creating heat in it's wake. These types of electrocutions may not stop the heart, but may literally cook the body. People who get electrocuted and have to have limbs amputated, are usually the ones who were burned by high amperage but not long enough to kill them. </p>
<p>Direct Current with low resistance and high amperage can cause electrical burns to a person just as readily as alternating current can. Amps kill and amps burn. Even a lower voltage direct current could burn you readily if the amperage is high and resistance is low. </p>
<p>This is also responsible for the numb tongue you get when licking a 9v battery. The tongue completes the circuit and begins to be burned, which causes us to yank the battery away before any real damage is done. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Those are the kinds of effects from lower amounts of power, like household electrical outlets.  </p>
<p>Once you get up to larger amounts of power ( for example a piece of equipment touching an overhead line, or giant cable that power buildings), your heart stopping is the least of your worries.  Your heart will be cooked far beyond well done before it even has a chance to stop.  It would cook you instantly from the inside out.</p>
<p>A downed live power line can kill you even if you are standing ten feet away, and you can be electrocuted by standing with your legs too far apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main options, one is much more practical than the other.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the characteristics of the other planet to define the units of time, just as we do on Earth.  This includes the orbit around its star, any sort of satellite (lunar) orbit, rotation around its axis, etc.  Just like on Earth how there are solar and lunar calendars still in use to this day.</p>
</li>
<li>Normalize everything to Earth days and Earth Years.  This is highly impractical for living on <em>another planet</em> but can be useful during transit in between planets.  Our astronomical values are already highly Earth-centric, such as the distance unit of AU's (avg. distance between Earth and the Sun), Earth days and Earth years.  However, these are intended for easier relative understanding, not so much practical use of potential future space travelers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to point out two additional things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ever notice why there are 12 months, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes and seconds in an hour and minute respectively, 360 degrees total in a circle?  It is because these numbers are <em>anti-primes</em> meaning that they have multiple divisible factors and are <em>versatile</em> for the sake of the ordering and division of units.  It is completely arbitrary how many numbers we assign to these values, as you can divide up a specific amount of time into any units that you want, although it is more intuitive to use ones that have multiple divisors.</p>
</li>
<li>Ever wonder how Earth time zones were first made and why?  Prior to the invention of the locomotive, horse-travel was simply too slow and inconsistent to warrant there being different time zones.  You would base your arrival time as, well, the time it is at your destination.  This was still the case in the early days of locomotive travel (3:10 to Yuma, anyone?!) where the name of the specific train ride had the destination time printed on it as its unique identifier.  It wasn't until a little later when people realized that it was a huge pain in the butt to have to keep two separate times for long-distance travel (both the departure and arrival times *at their specific physical locations) and their actual time of travel.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is kind of unclear, do you mean (1) how would we define past time (i.e. make a geologic time scale for another planet) or (2) how we would count time (i.e. deal with the fact that the length of a year and day may be very different from that of Earth)? For both, we can use Mars as an example. </p>
<p>For the first, establishing geologic time is based on pretty much the same principles on Earth, namely breaking time into chunks based on major changes in some aspect of the planet. <a href="http://palaeos.com/precambrian/martian_timescale.html" target="_blank">This</a> is a nice write up of some of the basic principles of establishing a geologic time scale (in a very simple and general sense) and provides two examples of proposed Martian geologic timescales based on either crater density or chemical weathering.</p>
<p>For the second, various schemes have been suggested for keeping track of the differences between Martian and Earth time (a practical concern especially for dealing with things like rovers on Mars). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> entry for this provides a decent amount of detail. In essence, most of the efforts are to establish something like how we deal with time on Earth, but modified to account for the local changes in length of day etc. For example, for each lander mission, a new 'time zone' has been established basically centered on the area of the lander. I'm not aware of any strict proposal of how to establish date and time systems for any generic planet based on the details of its day and year length, maybe another panelist will chime in on that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A balloon isn't perfectly round because it has the opening and the rubber might not be equally thick everywhere, but a bubble becomes perfectly symmetrical because there is no reason any side should be favored over another, so everything is evenly distributed.

<p>The thin film of soapy water is comprised of molecules that want to pull each other together - and they do.  The air that is surrounded by the thin film of soap is being contracted by the film - because it is a gas, it exerts an equal force on every surface point touching it.  </p>
<p>The film contracts until the forces causing the contraction are balanced by the pressure of the trapped air (which exerts a force that would otherwise cause the bubble to expand).  At this point, the two forces are in equilibrium (balanced).</p>
<p>Mathematically, the only possible resultant shape is a sphere.  Any other shape would have some soapy film molecules closer together than other soapy film molecules in the film and would cause the resultant shape to no longer be in equilibrium with the compressed gas - the shape would then undergo a change towards equilibrium - and the only resultant shape in which <strong>every</strong> soapy film molecule is pulling on an equal number of soapy film molecules is a sphere; the only shape in which every single point on the sphere is exactly the same as every other point on the structure (this is untrue for every other geometric shape).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although you related your question with medicine, I have experience with NMR in chemistry research. Not exactly the same technique, but the principles are the same.</p>
<p>In my experience the complete (+99%) relaxation of protons is around 10 to 15 seconds, but most of them will have relaxed in about 3 to 4 seconds, so this is the usual time between scans. Sometimes, a proton can relax more slowly due to its &quot;chemical circumstances&quot;, but in general is not the case.</p>
<p>Is it fast? Is it slow? It depends on what you expect. You can consider it fast if you want to know how much time will pass before your body gets &quot;normal&quot; after an NMR scan, as seconds is fast and days would be slow. But spectroscopically speaking, it is a slow technique. IR, or UV-visible fluorescence have relaxation times around nanoseconds. Compared to that, 3 seconds are a lot. In fact, in chemistry is enough for two species in equilibrium to interconvert, so it's not uncommon to get NMR espectra of the average of those two compounds, as in that amount of time you see both many times. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The time to return to equilibrium after a scan is likely the same as the T1 relaxation time. T1 is MRI name for the spin-lattice relaxation time. We measure this in the scanner for different tissues to detect changes in the chemical composition of the tissue (largely in neuroscience.) The main difference is that we are measuring a return to equilibrium in the scanner after excitation, but the same should be true for ‘removing’ the field.</p>
<p>White matter T1s range from about 1100-1700 ms, gray I think is a bit shorter. Times increase with field strength. The equation is m(t) = m(0) * ( 1 - e ^(-t/T1))</p>
<p>This also gets used to help detect tumors by adding T1 relaxing agents (the contrast Chuck Norris is suing alters the T1 relaxation time.)</p>
<p>And, old school resistive scanners (sub 0.5T usually) and some of the experimental ultra low field scanners like MGH’s 0.065 T can be turned off more easily since they are not superconducting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in an experimental solid-state NMR lab, but the physics is identical.  I read through some of the answers and it's just not complete or just outright faceplamingly WRONG.</p>
<p>Before I launch into my tirade, let me establish that signal /= population. </p>
<p>Short answer: Population decays exponentially toward its equilibrium population distribution described by a time constant T1.  The signal itself decays by dephasing in a similar exponential-decaying fashion with time constant T2.  How efficient the T1  processes are are directly related to how large of an oscillating dipole moment is felt by the nucleus. In more laymans terms, the ability to induce a spin flip. To expand on /u/javier1287, protons in a dangling protein chain generally relax faster compared to something like protons in a rigid mineral, since there are fewer chances for inducing a spin flip.</p>
<p>Long-ass answer where I'm going to include less-relevant information since there's misinformation in other answers:</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics approach:  There's a natural distribution of spin up to spin down (for I=1/2 nuclei, like 1H) since there is an energy difference between these states in a magnetic field, there is an equilibrium population difference described by Boltzmann statistics.</p>
<p>There is ALWAYS a static magnetic field on, B0, defined in the z-direction, it is NEVER turned off.  It is this field that creates the Boltzmann distribution that the populations decay toward.</p>
<p>During an experiment, you perturb the population distribution of spin up and spin down, creating 1st-order coherences.  The population distribution is now out of equilibrium. After some time, through interactions, this distribution will naturally be achieved.</p>
<p>Spin-lattice (T1) interactions relate to spontaneous 1H spin flips induced by interacting with a moving dipolar moment, like an unpaired electron or any moving molecule.</p>
<p>Relaxation agents used in MRI capitalize on having a species with unpaired electrons.  Unpaired electrons have HUGE dipolar moments Gadolinium for example can have an electronic configuration with 7 unpaired electrons!  Any protons near a relaxation agent will relax toward its equilibrium population distribution at a much higher rate due to the much more likely event of a favorable interaction causing a spontaneous spin flip.    If you have infinite spin flips, you achieve the Boltzmann distribution (equilibrium).  We say &quot;good enough&quot; after we're ~99% the way there, which is about after a time 5*T1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The protons are aligned with a magnetic field, and when the magnet is turned off they snap out of alignment. When they ping in or <em>out</em> of alignment they give off a little radio signal which is what the detector uses to make up a picture.</p>
<p>In short, what you're asking about is actually how the MRI actually makes images, so yes it's very fast.</p>

<p>Protons cannot flow.  They never leave the nucleus and if the nucleus moves, the whole atom and thus the conductor itself is physically moving.</p>
<p>In semiconductor electronics we have a confusing concept of charge carriers &quot;n-type&quot; and &quot;p-type&quot; lattice materials.  This kinda implies protons could move, but it's not the case at all.  Immobile as always.  Rather, the p-type lattice material (a substance of combined atoms, not an atom) can lose an electron, but it <strong>cannot</strong> gain an electron.  We call that motion of a &quot;hole&quot; but that's just a vacancy opening up in adjacent atoms as the electron picks up and leaves, rather that motion of an proton.  n-type material can gain an electron but cannot lose an electron.  Both are unlike plain copper which can gain or lose electrons.</p>
<p>If you put n-type and p-type physically against one another and attach copper wire to either side, something bizarre and mind-bogglingly useful happens: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>electrons can freely flow through the copper -&gt; n-type -&gt; p-type -&gt; copper, which isn't remarkable.</p>
</li>
<li>if you reverse the voltage source, electrons try to flow from copper -&gt; p-type, then stop.  p-type cannot send electrons to an n-type it's physically touching.  So NO current flows that way.</li>
</ol>
<p>THAT is now a diode!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
