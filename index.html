<p>When your eyes have nothing to focus on they will relax to tonic accommodation which is the point where muscles rest with minimal nervous innervation.</p>
<p>If you suddenly hit a wall, your eyes will accommodate to the proximal distance of that wall based on previous life experience.</p>
<p>Edit: Accommodation is where the lens in your eye (imagine a magnifying glass) changes power to help bring a near image into focus.</p>
<p>Edit2: A few of you are curious about relaxing your eyes and accommodation to relieve eye strain. You can use the 20/20/20 rule: every 20 minutes stare at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. </p>
<p>Edit3: Accommodation is fully relaxed at 20 feet (6 meters) which is why you're tested at this distance when at the optometrist's office. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In case you are asking about the &quot;market&quot; part of the stock market, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, Euronext, and other exchanges exist to provide &quot;liquidity&quot; to existing and new investors. Put simply, these are places for existing shareholders to sell shares (receive cash) and prospective shareholders to buy shares (pay cash).</p>
<p>Others in this thread have used a shipping expedition as an example. Let's say you invested £1,000 for a 1/5 share of a particular ship bound for India to get spices and return to Europe. Half way through the journey, you receive news that the ship successfully made it to India, loaded up with spices, and is now on its way home. There is still risk that the ship might sink on its way home, but the risk is now roughly half of what it was at the outset of the expedition. Let's say a new investor is now willing to buy your 1/5 share for £1,500. If you sell your share to the new investor, you make a £500 profit even if the ships sinks on the way home. On the other hand, you give up whatever profits you could have made if the ship does make it back successfully.  </p>
<p>A stock market is simply a place where buying and selling of these shares can be done on a regularized basis. There are rules that make shares trade-able (e.g. if you own one share of GE stock, it has the same value as everyone else's share of GE stock). Further, there are brokers (think of them as middle-men) that facilitate trading. Now, there are also electronic matching systems that can directly match buyers and sellers without the need for brokers. The goal of the stock market is to have the most efficient flow of buying and selling of shares for investors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stocks were invented as a way to share risk. European countries had trading expeditions going to Asia and Americas. These expeditions took months or years and were hugely expensive to fund but when successful they were absurdly profitable. The problem was that a ship could sink or get robbed by pirates, or a number of other problems.</p>
<p>The investors also had to stay solvent while waiting for the ship(s) to return.</p>
<p>At one point some very smart people in Netherlands figured that if they sold &quot;shares&quot; of these expeditions they could get many more people involved as investors, thereby the risk would be shared among a greater number of people/companies.</p>
<p>Once the expedition returned the company was dissolved and the profits, or losses, were divided up according to who owned what percentage of shares. Your reward was directly related to how much you invested.</p>
<p>Over time this mechanism evolved to companies in general, not just companies setup for trading expeditions.</p>
<p>Simply put it's a way to raise capital, across a large number of investors which all shares the risk and reward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say it costs you £5,000 to get a ship to sail to the Raj and back and you'll make £10,000 when it arrives in London. You have £5,000 to invest and put it in a single ship, the ship (sinks in a storm/gets taken by the damned French/gets taken by the damned Spanish/gets taken by pirates) you are down £5,000.  </p>
<p>Now lets say insted of investing in a single ship you own 100% you take 1/5 of 5 ships, owning 20% on each. All five leave London to go to the Raj and return with spice. One of the ships sinks/taken the other four return. You get a share of the profits proportional to your ownership, 1/5 of 4 ships carring £10,000 each meaning you get £8,000 an increase of £3,000.  </p>
<p>Now let's say all but one sank, you only get £2,000 back an decrease of £3,000 which is better than losing all £5,000.  </p>
<p>So let's invest in more ships with the £5,000. Say you buy a 2% stake in 50 ships (£100 into each). Of the 50 ships 47 return meaning you get £9,400 when they return.  </p>
<p>Losing a single ship when you own 100% means you drop £10,000<br />
Losing a single ship when you own 20% means you drop £2,000<br />
Losing a single ship when you own 2% means you drop £200<br />
By investing the same ammount into more ships for a lower percentage you don't have as big of a loss when a ship doesn't return. With the investment:profit ratio you need 25% of the ships to return to break even. It makes sense to own less % of more ships for this reason.  </p>
<p>Let's say you are a Captain of a merchant ship, you want to sail to the Raj to buy spice of the Indians and sell it to the English. It costs money, you need to pay the crew half their wage and have funds to buy the spice. Accept patronage from wealthy investors inreturn for them taking a share of the profits keeps you making money.  </p>
<p>It was highly successful for trade so other industries took it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>With a stockmarket everyone knows where to go to find companies to invest in.  What's more, they now have access to millions of small investors rather than a few wealthy ones which can amount to the same thing.  This dramatically increases the pool of money available which spurs development.</p>

<p>I think flipping the question around like that may help clear up some confusion. Up quarks mass in at about 2.3 MeV. Down are about 4.8 MeV.</p>
<p>2*2.3 + 4.8 = 9.4<br />
2.3 + 2*4.8 = 11.9</p>
<p>However the proton is considerably heavier than either of those numbers at about 938 MeV. Same goes for the neutron at 939 MeV.</p>
<p>Why the huge discrepancy?<br />
Why is the difference not even close to a quark mass?<br />
What, really is the internal structure of the proton?  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A slightly more elaborate view of hadrons:
They're a quark/antiquark/gluon soup.
The proton has 2 more up quarks than up antiquarks, 1 more down quark than down antiquarks.
The neutron has 1 more up quark than up antiquarks and 2 more down quarks than down antiquarks.
The kinetic energy + potential energy (energy stored as inteactions) between all this particles in the soup is what gives hadrons most of its mass. The remainder mass is gained by the interactions between all this particles and the 3 remainding fundamental forces of nature + higgs field.
The interactions, for example, with the electromagnetic field are going to be diferent since the proton has charge and the neutron does not.
This extra potential energy shows itself as mass acording to einsteins mass-energy equivelancy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimpanzees have been taught sign language, but their abilities only rise to the level of a human 2-3 year old child. At that age, children produce what is called &quot;telegraphic speech&quot; which are simple 2-3 word sentences that lack grammatical complexity and variety. They do not use function words (and, if, or, but, for, etc) and use limited verb forms.<br />
Psycholinguists interpret this to mean that chimpanzees are capable of symbolic thinking (to understand how symbols refer to things and actions) but are not capable of grammar, which is the crucial part of language that gives it &quot;generativity&quot; or the ability to say the same thing in a variety of different ways, and to produce novel/original ideas.<br />
One of the main theorists on this topic is Noam Chomsky, whose claim is that that grammatical part of language is instinctual and unique to the human brain, embedded into what he calls the Language Acquisition Device.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Second, it's not like nobody has tried to figure it out. There were attempts to teach them sign language, but they just don't seem to get it. They don't understand what the researchers want them to do, they don't even try to attempt imitating human words like some other animals do. The idea of verbal communication seems to be completely alien to them.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last names were a method to distinguish between multiple people with the same name. They fall into several categories. </p>
<p>1) Occupational. Smith, Wright, Cooper, Fletcher, etc were all professions. So John the blacksmith eventually was shortened to John Smith. </p>
<p>2) Geographical. Names like Hill, Dale, etc are physical descriptions of locations. Hank from over on the Hill became Hank Hill. Some languages use the names of villages and cities as well. Any name in German that has &quot;van&quot; in it means someone from the city/village that follows. Similarly Spanish names with &quot;de&quot; in them mean the same thing. </p>
<p>3) Descriptive. Red, Black, Green, White, etc were names given to people referring to a physical characteristic that they had. Hair color, eye color, skin color, etc. There are also slightly more obscure names like longfellow that refer to height, and other similar descriptions. </p>
<p>4) Familial ties. Eric son of James became Eric Jameson. Irish names with &quot;Mc&quot; and Scottish names with &quot;Mac&quot; means &quot;son of&quot;. Irish names with &quot;O'-&quot; like O'Riley means &quot;grandson&quot; or &quot;descendant of&quot;.</p>
<p>5) Bestowed names. You also have names that were bestowed on someone by a religious figure or by a Monarch when they entered the ranks of nobility. The names that Monarchs take when they take the throne would also fall into this category. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For example, in Javanese culture, there's no such thing as surname, so Javanese people usually are mononymous (one word name). If they have more than one name, usually they're unrelated from their parents' name, so both the first name and last name are given. Although, some Muslim Javanese adopted Malay conventions of name giving (derived from Arab), which is 'given name' + 'bin'/'binti' (son of/daughter of, respectively) + 'name of father', kinda like Scandinavian naming conventions with their -son and -dottir.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably already mentioned, but to sum it up evolution is driven by competition amongst and within species for niches (a fancy term for the roles that a species plays in their environment - for example, large cats occupy a niche that could be described as stealthy apex predator). &quot;Intelligent, tool making critter&quot; is the human &quot;niche&quot;. At one point, this niche was up for grabs, with many different species of intelligent homonid competing to occupy and dominate within that niche (when modern humans appeared, the world was occupied by at least five other species of &quot;bipedal, tool and culture making apes&quot;, and likely more that we haven't discovered, including Neanderthalis, Denosovan Man, Red Deer People, Homo erectus, and Homo floriensis, though there is some debate over whether or not denosovans and red deer cave people are simply subspecies of neanderthal or homo erectus). Homo sapiens, our own species, had slight advantages that enabled us to outcompete the other homonids and &quot;win&quot; this niche for ourselves. Once a species loses its niche, unless it adapts to a new role then it won't be able to secure resources for itself that it needs to survive, and will eventually go extinct. A followup question, then, is why did humans win instead of the competition? Erectus was physically stronger and - at least the male specimens - grew a bit taller than modern humans (I have a pet theory that &quot;giants&quot; are cultural memories of prehistoric encounters with clans of Erectus), but they had smaller brains and were likely limited in their capacity to develop language and culture. We really don't know much about the denosovans and the red deer cave people because we have such few fossils of them, but Neanderthal was widespread in Europe and quite succesful. Built like the stocky dwarves of Tolkien's fantasy (they were short, strong, barrel chested and incredibly tough, with thick bones), they also had many adaptations to the cold, including larger nasal passages for heating their breath and great physical strength (muscles keep you warm). The theory is that Neanderthal was less omnivorous than homo sapiens, and was essentially an ambush predator - their favored hunting tactic was to sneak up on prey and grapple it to the ground (we know this because they had a lot of bone injuries that forensics associate with close-quarters fighting). This worked well during the periods of glaciation, when herbivores like the Irish Elk were forced to migrate through Europe's many valleys in a constant search for thawed patches of grass, making it easy to catch prey in an ambush, but as the ice retreated this tactic was less and less practical. Homo sapiens, being adapted to running and likely practitioners of persistence hunting, which involves following prey over vast distances until it drops from exhaustion, could hunt in open plains and generally had access to a larger variety of potential prey animals. One could say that humans won the evolutionary race because we had the longer legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the case of animal intelligences provided by galacticleofin, there were actually other sapient species on our planet, as well. Most notably, the Neanderthal. Not technically an ancestor itself - human ancestors lived alongside them, and there's even genetic evidence of cross-breeding. Archaeological studies indicate that they were intelligent and cultured, likely more than our own ancestors at the time. However, our ancestors were significantly more aggressive and competitive...</p>
<p>So. long story short: there are no other forms of intelligent life on earth because we already killed them. And hey, to go back to animal intelligences, look at endangered species lists - we're killing them, too.</p>
<p>EDIT: As an additional remark, the common pig is evaluated to be about as smart as a 5-year-old human, with intelligence much greater than dogs, rivalling apes and porpoises. It's why they make such smart and loving pets, if you have the space for them. And guess what humans usually do with those?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of misleading answers here, including ones suggesting we're just underestimating intelligence in other species. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Lets get the basics right first. Humans are far far more intelligent that anything else on the planet. Its objectively not a disputable point. Just look at the neocortex and try to find equivalences in animals.</p>
<p>That said the question becomes suddenly more obvious when you first look at a slightly different scenario. Imagine going back many many millions years in the past, say right as the first birds were taking flight and asking why arent there other species that fly? Or going back to when the first mammals were evolving and asking why arent other animals warm blooded, or give live birth and so on.</p>
<p>The reality is, things take time, and something has to come first. And given how evolution works, usually that something with the advantage then proliferates massively, and often evolves into different paths. It just so happens that when that 'something' is intelligent introspective life, it tends to ask why are we so intelligent and why arent others just as intelligent yet?</p>
<p>So just like the 'birds' first evolved flight and then expanded out to all areas where flight offered advantage, or the mammals first evolved warm-bloodedness, live-birth etc and expanded out to all areas where that was advantageous, the homo branch of primates too happened to have first evolved high intelligence, very very recently in evolutionary history, and are in the process of essentially expanding to all areas where intelligence is advantageous!</p>
<p>In fact, it looks like they will soon be expanding out into space, possibly other planets, maybe even star systems, and they might even ditch biological evolution all together for artificial or digital-and-computing substrates and designed evolution of intelligence. So absolutely without doubt, in the next couple thousand years, and for sure in couple million years, there will be literally thousands and millions of kinds of intelligences populating the universe, all of which will be trace back the evolution of their intelligence capable lives to early humans!! </p>
<p>TL;DR : We are just really really early in the evolution of intelligent life, geologically and evolutionarily speaking. So you just need some patience, in a couple just a couple million years (and much less if we go digital), there will a splendid variety of intelligent life forms that will evolve out of humanity.. almost in the same way we have thousands of kinds of birds all evolved out of the first flight capable dinosaurs!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large brains require a lot of calories to run, and intelligence grants diminishing returns once you can catch your prey efficiently.  Hominids were apex predators with a relative food abundance (endurance hunting works against almost anything and we're omnivores), especially after mastering fire.  Anthropologists estimate it only took ~10 hours/week for food gathering, so we had a lot of idle time so we started sexually selecting for intelligence, building things that improve our survival odds, etc..</p>
<p>Aside from the food abundance, one also needs hands.  Dolphins are smart, but lack hands so they never developed technology.  Likewise, intelligence requires experience so one also has to have a decently long lifespan.  Octopuses are also rather smart &amp; possess tentacles, but sadly they don't live long enough to do much.  They also don't communicate as much as dolphins or humans, so acquired experience dies with the individual.</p>
<p>Given that Homo was the first technologically advanced genus on Earth, the odds of having an energy surplus, dexterous hands, communication, and probably several other factors must be fairly low.  It's one of those things that doesn't help a lot until it hits a critical threshold, then it's a game changer, so it's not a common evolutionary path since evolution doesn't plan ahead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>GMail is an email provider, and has to work with other email providers. Even if they implemented end-to-end encryption, they couldn't use it with other providers unless those providers also used the same system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GMail's servers read your email to see whether they are spam, and to target adverts at you, and to provide fast, high-quality search of your emails. All of these are impossible if GMail can't read the email because it's encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>If GMail stored your mail encrypted, as well as being unable to search it, it would all be unreadable if you lost your private key, or if you moved to a computer where you didn't have access to it. Storing it in the cloud would require another layer of interoperability (you'd need a way to get the key into GMail), unless Google itself stored the key, in which case Google could also decrypt your emails. If GMail stored the email unencrypted, there would be no point.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's good to compare the service with WhatsApp. WhatsApp does everything through your phone. If your phone is off or without internet, it doesn't work anywhere. This means they can store your key on the phone and have it only decrypt stuff on the phone. Because it's their own protocol they can build the key management right into it and don't need to worry about some other service not supporting the way they do encryption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The problem is that nobody uses encryption. If I send an encrypted e-mail te Jeanne Doe, she needs to be able to read it. It's not that hard (2 Buttons in enigmail) but already to complex for the average mail user.

A big selling point of Gmail is their great spam prevention, which only works based on Google's ability to read emails en mass and get feedback (whether from automated AI data mining or manual user reports) about whether or not certain types of email are spam. If they couldn't access the plaintext of your emails, then spam prevention could only be done client side, which would be much less effective (less processing power, delays incoming mail, can't share results with other users as easily, etc). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/uh-okay-I-guess's answer is exactly correct, but when you think of it, you can even understand <em>why</em> N(1 + 1/2 + 1/3.... + 1/N) is the number of attempts needed.</p>
<p>It becomes easier if instead of looking at the number of rolls as a whole, you add up the average number of rolls to &quot;move&quot; from a number of combinations remaining to one less combination remaining.</p>
<p>The first term is number of tries needed to move from 36 combinations remaining to 35. The second is the number of tries needed to move from 35 to 34... and so on until the last term you're looking at is the average number of rolls needed to get the one remaining combination.</p>
<p>The first event always needs exactly 1 try, because everything you try always works. For the second one though, you have a 35/36  chance of getting it right each time you try, so you need on average 36/35 tries (because 36/35 tries * 35/36 likelihood = 1).</p>
<p>The pattern continues. For the third event you have 34/36 good outcomes, and hence expected 36/34 tries on average.</p>
<p>You're going to see this follows the pattern 36/36 + 36/35 + 36/34 + ..... 36/1 = 36(1/36 + 1/35 .... + 1), which is exactly the formula given.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<pre><code>n * (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n)</code></pre>
<p>or about 150.284 rolls.</p>
<p>(I find it interesting that the Wikipedia link starts out by asking not for the <em>average</em> number of rolls, but the cumulative probability distribution: &quot;What is the probability that more than t sample trials are needed to collect all n coupons?&quot; ... then goes on to never answer that question.  More on that shortly.)</p>
<p>Others have already asked what I think is actually the more natural problem here: suppose that we are only concerned with the <em>total</em> of the roll of the two (identical) dice, then what is the expected number of rolls to observe all totals from 2 through 12?  This problem is harder, since the individual outcomes are not equally likely.  One of several ways to approach this is using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle" target="_blank">inclusion-exclusion principle</a>, an alternating summation over each possible subset of roll totals, like this (in Mathematica source code):</p>
<pre><code>f[p_List] :=
 Total@Map[
   (-1)^(Length[#] - 1)/Total[#] &amp;,
   Subsets[p, {1, Length[p]}]]</code></pre>
<p>which for the non-uniform distribution of roll totals 2 through 12 with 2 dice yields an average of about 61.2174 rolls.  (This is also the idea behind computing the CDF for the equally likely case.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
