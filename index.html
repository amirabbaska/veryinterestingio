		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is a combination of a neurological response <em>and</em> an emotional response.  I think it is the emotional response that makes the experience of the pain high or low.  I suspect some people have been told to tough it out, or just walk through it, so their &quot;emotional&quot; response makes the pain more tolerable.  The neurological response is pretty much the same, although some studies have shown there may be a genetic influence.</p>
<p>Everything I've read about pain makes me think it is one of those things that medicine really doesn't understand very well.  Perhaps that's why it is so difficult to answer your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its partially both.
I have something called sensory processing disorder: sensory seeking behaviors.
I have broken limbs 4 times. During the last two I didn't cry at all, and when i broke my arm in four spots, i casually got up, walked to the nurse and someone took me to the hospital. I started crying halfway to the hospital.
This disorder basically makes pain reception, and all feeling reception limited to some degree.  Compared to my brother, those around me and what i perceive to be the norm i have an extreme pain tolerance. I was also raised in a, more or less, suck it up based environment.
Basically its both, but in my case it leans towards less sensitive pain receptors (technically speaking its ineffective transmission of data to my brain)
I hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As one of the people who has a high pain tolerance I can say from my personal experience I generally do not feel the same pain that other people do. Point in case I recently had out patient gall bladder surgery. Surgery was at 7:30 am. By that evening I was back on my feet and just taking a little tylenol to deal with what pain I was feeling. (Which mostly was just surface irritation.) When I was talking with the surgeon they told me to expect to be laid up in the bed for about a week with the pain. I returned to work 3 days later. I had a similar thing occur with getting my wisdom teeth pulled. I had a reaction to the gas so my dentist removed all 4 teeth with nothing but local anesthetic. I took tylenol that night and that was the extent of pain killers I took. </p>
<p>The caveat with my pain tolerance though is that pain medication does have little effect. If I've got a headache or sore back I can take 4 500mg tylenol or ibuprofen and feel little to no relief. The same with the few narcotics I've received from surgeries and procedures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short and Simple: Nobody manufactures the drugs for lethal injection in humans, so we wind up using <em>really old</em> drugs or a cocktail of things not meant for the purpose of killing humans. Also, there aren't many doctors willing to administer lethal-injections... and improper application can leave someone alive and in agony instead of dead.</p>
<p>Longer and Detailed: The Pharmaceutical Companies that make the drugs for Lethal Injections <em>know</em> how radioactive the topic of Capital Punishment is. Anyone associated with it is poisoned. Social Media will <em>crucify</em> anyone who sells the drugs used to kill people... and that will result in lost business across <strong>all</strong> of their products.</p>
<p>There aren't many executions in the United States, even when the needed supplies are available. That means that lethal injection drugs are a <em>really</em> niche product. The lost profit from <em>not</em> selling the drugs for Lethal Injection is <strong>much</strong> less than the lost profit from losing sales in every other sector.</p>
<p>So... that opens up another question: Why isn't there a company that <em>just</em> fills the need for lethal injection drugs? </p>
<p>The answer to that is that you can't make a profit in that market alone. It's a ludicrously small market, needing less than a thousand dosages of your product per year. Since you can't sustain a company <em>on</em> lethal injections, and any company that could afford to do it as a side-gig won't touch it with a ten-foot-pole, there's no supplier.</p>
<p>Which brings us to what we use: Old drugs from when companies <em>would</em> sell them, a finite supply that grows less effective with time; and trying to mix a cocktail of drugs that will do the job... to sometimes horrific results.</p>
<p>Doctors and Nurses to administer the lethal injection are hard to find for the same reason. The entire concept of Capital Punishment is <strong>radioactive</strong>. Even if the state shields you from being fired from a hospital or losing your license to practice medicine, your patients <strong>will</strong> eventually learn what you did... and a lot of them are going to look for a doctor that doesn't kill people. Losing your patients isn't worth whatever the state pays you to kill someone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, a simple and effective means is available: Nitrogen. It makes up 70% of the atmosphere, and breathing in pure nitrogen feels no different than air. The lack of oxygen would make you pass out, but without any of the buildup of CO2 that is associated with suffocation (burning lung sensation). </p>
<p>It is dangerous in industrial settings where a few breaths can render someone unconscious without realizing that they aren't getting oxygen. For this reason, you have to have an oxygen monitor in areas where nitrogen is present in the workplace. There were 80 deaths in US workplaces from 1992 to 2002 due to nitrogen asphyxiation. </p>
<p>In fact, wikipedia tells me that Oklahoma signed a bill authorizing nitrogen asphyxiation when lethal injection chemicals are not available. </p>
<p>I believe that historically, the method was seen as &quot;too humane&quot;, which is interesting since lethal injection is also supposed to be humane. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that because of the controversial nature of capital punishment every aspect is made harder. Everything from what drugs to use (companies don't want the PR of being &quot;the executioner&quot; and will likely sue if their drugs are used for the purpose) to who does it (medical professionals are morally and in most cases legally disallowed from causing harm).</p>
<p>There are also legal guidelines for how you are allowed to kill people (the harsh and unusual punishment - type of deal) restricting the executioners methods.</p>
<p>Basically you end up having to use a hammer to screw in a screw.</p>
<p>Whereas with animals, theres no controversy, in fact it is widely regarded as merciful if the animal is seriously ill, and thus we can use the best drugs for the job and the best professionals to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to answer this.  It has nothing to do with what medications we can get or not get.  You can kill someone with pretty much any of the drugs used, in adequate dosages.  The issue (as mentioned once or twice below) is that it's not always a trained professional.  IV's infiltrate.  etc.</p>
<p>But.  Having said that.  I've read a fair number of newspaper and internet stories on &quot;Botched&quot; lethal injections.  It is EXCEEDINGLY common, after reading the article, to realize it was NOT botched at all.  It is very frequently a description of what people look like as they die.  Not many lay people understand that almost everyone gasps, occasionally coughs, etc as they go through agonal respirations.  They twitch.  they look like they are convulsing.  one of the listed side effects of propofol (used in some lethal injections) is &quot;myoclonus,&quot; which is &quot;twitching&quot; for the layperson.  </p>
<p>And it can take a very long time for a heart to stop.  10, 15, 20 minutes.  Just because it took the guy 20 minutes to stop breathing does NOT mean he suffered AT ALL.    If you're unconcious, you don't really care whether you are breathing or not.
I'm an anesthesiologist.  A HUGE number of my patients stop breathing.  they gasp, snore etc.  That's why i'm there, to make sure that doesn't result in death.  They also twitch from the drugs.  Big deal. they are unconcious the entire time.</p>
<p>the only way they can REALLY suffer is if the paralytic is given with no sedation.  That would suck.</p>
<p>TL;DR
gasping, twitching and turning blue are pretty normal and doesn't relate to discomfort.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To keep it really simple:</p>
<p>Lets say I own a large company in the US called XYZ Records America which records and sells music albums online.</p>
<p>You buy an album from me online for $10 (+state taxes which come out of your pocket, not mine). Lets assume that on average it costs me $0.50/album to record and produce the album, $0.50/album to maintain the servers and site, and $1/album in royalties to the artist.
For each album, I get $10 in revenue, and have $2 of expenses, for $8 of profit.</p>
<p>Corporate income tax is only paid on the profit my company makes, so I pay the tax rate on $8. Lets assume it's 25%, which means I'll have to pay $2 in tax. Now my net profit is only $6.</p>
<p>As a corporation, my primary goal is to increase profits. More profits = more money for me, more expansion for the company, more jobs or better pay for my employees, more charitable donations, etc. No matter what my philosophy is, it's almost always driven by more profits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$0.50/album goes to recording. Maybe I can negotiate this down, but that means paying my workers less and that wont make them happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$0.50/album goes to server management. Maybe I can outsource my servers to Asia for a better rate but at a customer service loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$1.00/album to the artist. Maybe I can skim them for more next album, but they could always sign with someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could also sell the album for more, but then that could hurt sales, and the artist would want more.</p>
</li>
<li>$2.00/album is taxed. It's already the biggest factor in my profits, and if I were to shave costs elsewhere, this would go up.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's obvious in this example that the most effective way to increase profits is to pay less tax.</p>
<p>So what do I do? I send my accountants on a quest to find an answer, and they come back to me with the information that Ireland's corporate tax is only 10% instead of the 25% I pay here. So what do I do? Well I could move the company there, but there's a lot of assets in the US. I don't want to relocate the studios, servers, etc. I'll lose business if I do that.</p>
<p>Instead, lets just found XYZ Records Ireland. I'll structure my brand so that they're the &quot;Parent Company&quot; of XYZ Records America.
All of the licenses XYZ Records America owns, I'll &quot;sell&quot; to them for $0.01 each.
When I record a new album in the U.S. I can immediately sell the rights to XYZ Ireland for $0.01.</p>
<p>Now I still want to <em>sell</em> the albums in the US to the same customers. So when you go to my online store and buy a record from XYZ America, I'll sell it to you for $10 just the same. You won't see a difference.</p>
<p>When I do that though, XYZ America will account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$0.50/album towards recording - this covers the operating expenses for producing the album.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$0.50/album towards server management - this keeps the site up and running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$1.00/album royalties to the artist</p>
</li>
<li>and lastly $8.00 in licensing fees paid to XYZ Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<p>My revenue was $10, my total expenses were $10, &quot;damn, the company didn't make any money&quot;. No profits to report, and 25% tax on $0 is $0 to pay in tax.
I end up paying no tax in America. </p>
<p>I still have to report my income in Ireland though.
So per album sold in America, XYZ Ireland's books look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$8.00 revenue from licensing fees (Paid by XYZ America to XYZ Ireland).</p>
</li>
<li>$0.05 in operating costs to keep XYZ Ireland operating (I have an office to pay rent in, and a few employees there)</li>
</ul>
<p>XYZ Records Ireland reports $7.95 of profits per album. The tax on that is 10% of $7.95, so I'll pay $0.795 = $0.80.
Net profit is $7.15 per album.</p>
<p>By opening a parent company in Ireland, I can now earn $1.15 extra per album.
I pay $0 to the US government in taxes, and I pay less tax overall.</p>
<p>If I sell 1,000,000 albums every year, that's $2,000,000 that the US Government no longer receives from me, and it's $1,150,000 of extra profits for the company.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>International tax lawyer here--</p>
<p>This topic is a bit of a sore subject with me, as it is FAR less prevalent than people like to believe.  Many of the so called 'planning techniques' that have been listed have been shut down.  More on that in a bit.</p>
<p>The potential for abuse comes in large part from arbitraging the two major types of tax systems--worldwide and territorial.  Territorial means that the local country taxes the taxpayer on monies earned in that country--so a Mauritius company generally wouldn't tax you on income the Mauritius company earns in England.  Worldwide systems (like the US), however, tax you on 100% of your worldwide income.</p>
<p>So if the Mauritius company has 100 income in the US, and 100 income in Mauritius, and a 15% corporate tax rate, it would be paying $15 on its Mauritius income, and 0 on it's US income for a total of 15/200 = 7.5% tax.  (Please keep in mind, this is HUGELY simplified right now--I'll complicate it in a bit.)</p>
<p>Compare to the US.  The US company might have 100 in Mauritius and 100 in the US, and it would pay 35% of 200 = $70 = 35%.  </p>
<p>If there were local taxes applied (lots of rules around this, including treaties, local law, etc.), the numbers change.  The US would likely apply 35% on the Mauritius income, so the Mauritius company would actually be paying 35% of 100 US income and 15% of its Mauritius income for a total of 50/200 or 25%.</p>
<p>Obviously, the US company can't be competitive with those kinds of rates, so the US government actually allows a deferral of tax even though it has a worldwide system.  If the money isn't distributed back to the US (under the assumption that it is reinvested in Mauritius to build additional wealth), the US won't tax it.  Don't worry, though--there are a lot of anti-abuse regulations here (the concept of controlled foreign corporations, subpart F income, passive foreign investment companies, immediate income for excessive cash/cash equivalent build ups so that companies don't hoard cash overseas to avoid tax, etc.).</p>
<p>Bottom line, you can shift income using a number of different methods, and you shift it to where the tax rates are lowest.  That's just good business practice.  People whine about corporations paying their 'fair share' as if that was a stick in the sand.  If foreign corporations have a super low foreign tax rate (e.g. what about the 20% rate in the UK?) then how are US corporations with a WORLDWIDE 35% rate supposed to compete on similar products?  If the US government starts forcing all companies to pay 35% on their worldwide income with no deferral, and no ability to shift things around, any foreign corporation would be able to beat them out of the market--you can't beat a 15% lower cost easily.  If we tax our corporations out of business, we (a) have nothing to tax, and (b) no where to work to earn a living.</p>
<p>Smart US corporations use every trick in the book to minimize (NOT AVOID) their taxes.  They have to in order to get their effective tax rate down around to the same worldwide level that foreign corporations routinely see.  However, for every 'trick' you see, there is generally a countervailing anti-abuse regime to prevent people from abusing it wholesale.  For instance:</p>
<p>USCo owns Cayman Co.  US Co makes a widget for $50, sells it to Cayman Co. for $50, and Cayman Co. sells to client for $200.  That would leave $150 in the Cayman Islands for a 0% rate.  Transfer pricing regulations require a fair share of profit amongst related parties be given at each level, so this no longer works.  (There are also rules on manufacturing that would also disallow this scenario.)  Transfer pricing impacts the profit percentage, intercompany loans etc.  Basically any transaction between related parties have to be set at a rate a reasonable 3rd party might accept.</p>
<p>Most treaties now contain a Limitation of Benefits clause that disallow use of the treaty in certain abusive scenarios.</p>
<p>The US only allows deferral of active income, so you can't just shift all of your profits overseas and leave them to avoid US tax.  (Subpart F income, passive foreign investment company rules)</p>
<p>BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) rules are being promulgated worldwide after the OECD recommended them.  These rules target financing structure where the Cayman company might 'lend' $1B to the US, and the US pays 'interest' (e.g. sucks the profit out of the US).  These are a recent change, and there are a TON of countries putting these new rules into effect (like 30+ of the biggest countries, and more following).</p>
<p>Local rules tax income locally before it goes to the parent corporation.  (e.g. UK taxes UK income before the income goes up to the foreign parent)</p>
<p>Many jurisdictions have withholding on payments leaving the country.</p>
<p>There are also indirect taxes that can impact the profits of companies (taxes on gross income, taxes on gross assets, value-added tax, sales tax)</p>
<p>I won't say that there aren't abuses, but the abuses are becoming much harder to find, and are constantly under attack.  When you see an article claiming 'abuse,' please keep in mind that you are (at best) getting about 30% of the facts, and most of the authors are being sensationalist to spur readership.  They don't care about reputation or honesty, so much as they do about creating a furor--usually over nothing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's one from personal experience.</p>
<p>I was the financial analyst for Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou's personal holding company, the EasyGroup.</p>
<p>EasyGroup owns a big chunk of EasyJet, EasyHotel, EasyGym, EasyPizza (no rly)... the list goes on.  Basically, if it's easy and orange, EasyGroup owns it.</p>
<p>EasyGroup is a Cayman Islands registered company.  In the Cayman Islands, there is no corporate tax.</p>
<p>EasyJet plc is a London based company.</p>
<p>Every year, EasyJet is required to pay EasyGroup a certain percentage of its revenue.  This is paid to the EasyGroup as a &quot;brand licensing fee.&quot; </p>
<p>In layman's terms, this means that EasyGroup owns the brand &quot;Easy&quot;, and EasyJet is simply renting the brand FROM EasyGroup.</p>
<p>Accounting-wise, this means that EasyJet has an expense called &quot;brand royalties expense.&quot;  A company deducts its expenses before paying taxes, so this income comes out of EasyJet from pre-tax money and is never taxed.</p>
<p>This income is received by the EasyGroup, as an accounting line of &quot;brand royalties income.&quot; </p>
<p>However, as I mentioned before, in the Cayman Islands, there is no corporate tax.  So this income engenders a 0% income tax.</p>
<p>All well and good, now the money is sitting in a bank account owned by a Cayman Islands company.</p>
<p>The second part of the step is getting the money from the EasyGroup to Sir Stelios.  </p>
<p>Stelios himself lives in Monaco.  Monaco is a country that has a 0% personal income tax.</p>
<p>So, EasyGroup pays Stelios this money as a dividend.  The money now transfers ownership from EasyGroup to Stelios.  </p>
<p>Normally, this would be when someone would pay personal income tax on their income, but because Monaco has no personal income tax, again this transfer of money experiences no taxes.</p>
<p>Thus, through this method, Sir Stelios earned hundreds of millions of quid while I worked for him, and paid less in taxes than I did as his analyst earning 40k EUR per year.  (I had to pay for my caisse publique, UEI, and French pension/social security).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most loopholes occur during international transactions. When you're dealing with the laws of dozens of countries it's easy to find an obscure scenario where you pay less taxes than you otherwise would need to. This is extremely common in video game sales, where up to 50% of your revenue may come from digital goods. Digital sales are 'new' when it comes to tax laws and they don't handle them very well.</p>
<p>Many companies have a tax shelter based in the Netherlands. The company based in the Netherlands 'owns' the IP for a specific video game.</p>
<p>When you buy a video game in the US or say France, you pay money to a company in that country. That company pays royalties to the company in the Netherlands that owns the IP. So they get to write off that amount as a business expense and pay less France/US tax.</p>
<p>Then, you have the  Netherlands based company which made all the profit from the smaller international offices. US law, for example, says they should pay incomes taxes to the country that earned the income, Netherlands law says you should pay taxes to the country it originated from. </p>
<p>As a result, you pay no one taxes. Since you aren't paying income tax on up to half of your revenue, you pay less tax overall as a business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Foreign or even Aus owned companies (mining companies are bad for this) will have their overseas branches lend money for projects etc to their Australian operations at ridiculous interest rates far above market rates so it looks like the local arm isn't making any money and therefore isn't taxed as much.</p>
<p>The other one mining companies use are &quot;marketing hubs&quot;. This means the Australian operations of BHP or Rio Tinto for example will sell their commodity to a Singaporean or Hong Kong trading house (owned by the same company) at a discount rate then they will sell the product to the end customer. Same deal as before in that the transaction by the local operation is less than market value for the goods so less tax is paid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Its been shown that the axial tilt of mars has changed dramatically in &quot;cosmically recent&quot; timescales.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue with vaping is that it is a relatively new way to use nicotine. It took decades of research and observation to identify the adverse health effects to chronic users of other tobacco products, and it will likely take a similar amount of time to confidently identify any problems that arise with e-cigarette use. That said, e-cigarettes do not contain the same harmful ingredients as cigarettes, which probably makes them safer, although I can't say how much.</p>
<p>There have been some studies that show using e-cigarettes increases your risk of developing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or increased phlegm production. It is possible that it could increase your risk for heart disease, although that risk seems to be hypothetical at the moment.</p>
<p>As far as cancer goes, while many of the carcinogens found in cigarettes are much lower in e-cigarettes, propylene glycol and glycerol (the main components in the liquid cartridge) both break down into several potential carcinogens. I can't say whether this makes lung cancer/disease more or less likely, however.</p>
<p>And of course, nicotine abuse is bad for your cardiovascular system. That has not changed.</p>
<p>TLDR; it's up in the air. The general consensus seems to be it is likely safer than cigarettes, however it's possible that there could be some bad stuff in the vapor. If there are negative health consequences, we won't really find out until people start getting sick, unfortunately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vaping is unhealthy compared to breathing in fresh air. It's healthy compared to breathing in cigarette smoke. It's healthy compared to inhaling aeresolized fat molecules from a deep fryer. It's all relative OP. </p>
<p>The ELI5 answer is that vaping has not shown any long term health problems for users yet, but that this is still being studied closely. Vaping can help cigarette users quit smoking and it has none of the negative health effects that inhaling cigarette smoke does. People that switch to vaping to quit cigarettes can look forward to similar health levels as non smokers. </p>
<p>While all of the ingredients in e-juice are approved for human consumption, there may be different health effects inhaling an aerosol of flavorings versus swallowing them. For example soda pop is okay to drink, but if you inhaled it, you would not find it agreeable and it could damage the lining of your lungs. While eating flavorings is healthy, the jury is out on effects of different flavorings on the lungs. </p>
<p>A cigarette is consumed by burning it and inhaling the combusted gases, tars, ash, and chemicals released from combustion. Combustion isn't perfect and so a wide range of chemical compounds, many of which cause health problems are released. Vaping is not burning something, it is converting a liquid into an aerosol and inhaling it. This does not significantly change the chemical makeup of the aerosol versus the liquid juice. </p>
<p>More details: </p>
<p>The main materials are vegetable glycerin and polypropylene glycol. Both of these are FDA approved and safe for consumption and have no known health problems inhaling. </p>
<p>The nicotine content varies from 0mg (none) to 24mg (around a cigarette strength). Nicotine is a drug, and in high concentrations it's a poison. This is mainly a concern for people handling 60-100mg/ml laboratory grade nicotine for mixing their own juice, but you wouldn't want a child to get a hold of a bottle of e-juice, or spill it on your shirt and ignore it. </p>
<p>The main point of contention are the flavorings used to make the juice taste good to the user. The majority of these flavorings are USDA approved for human consumption, but the long term study of inhaling them is on-going. Most of the dangers you hear about from vaping products are a class of flavorings known to cause popcorn lung in high concentrations and prolonged exposures. To date there have been no instances of this occurring in any vaper, and the evidence of this occurring outside of factory conditions where workers spent hours a day breathing concentrated diacetyl in are anecdotal. Still though, better safe than sorry, and most vaporizer juice companies avoid these flavorings and volunteer laboratory results of their juice tests. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we don't read into your question at all, the answer is of course, vaping is unhealthy.  Inhaling any foreign substance is generally going to be unhealthy.</p>
<p>If you're vaping or thinking about vaping just to vape, and not as a smoking cessation method, please don't, it's pretty dumb.  If you insist, at least use zero nicotine juice.</p>
<p>All that said, if you're using vaping to quit smoking cigarettes, that's a different conversation.  I smoked for 25 years and quit the day I got a vape setup.  I vaped for 2 years, slowly lowering my nicotine intake, and then I quit the vape, about a year ago.  It was pretty effortless, although I'll stress that using a vape to quit smoking requires </p>
<p>1) a good investment in a quality kit</p>
<p>2) another investment in a quality BACKUP kit and accessories so when your batteries are dead or you're out of coils or juice, you're not forced to go buy cigarettes.</p>
<p>3) the right amount of nicotine in your juice.  If you're still feeling the need to smoke a cigarette, increase your nicotine.  I started with 18mg/ml, you may need 24mg/ml, or 9mg/ml might sate your craving.  It depends on the person.</p>
<p>I felt respiratory improvement after 2 weeks of not smoking.  I certainly felt it in my wallet (vaping is ridiculously cheap compared to smoking), and I even felt it in my personal life, my wife really liked that I didn't smell like smoke.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Nicotine by itself is not actually all that harmful, its similar to caffeine. No reasonable person will argue that it is not addictive, it clearly is. However, it is well understood that people get addicted to cigarettes because it is a highly efficient nicotine delivery system, but they are killed by the other components in the cigarette.</p>
<p>Many of the chemicals in smoke which are known to be harmful come specifically from the combustion. If you were to dry out some lettuce and smoke it, you would inhale many of the same carcinogens. Used properly, vaping does not burn anything - i.e. there is no combustion. </p>
<p>However, it is possible to 'dry hit' a vape - such as when you forget to refill the tank. This causes the cotton to burn and therefore creates the same types of carcinogens to be produced as in cigarettes. Some studies of vape technology have reported very high levels of formaldehyde, specifically, but examining the materials and methods of these studies shows that they were almost certainly burning the cotton. Therefore, high levels of formaldehyde actually are a good litmus test for the validity of a study. If the levels are too high, they are likely studying older technology and using it improperly. This is not to say the scientists involved are incompetent or doing this deliberately, the technology has improved very significantly in the last few years.</p>
<p>Public Health England <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e-cigarettes-around-95-less-harmful-than-tobacco-estimates-landmark-review" target="_blank">has concluded through scientific study</a> that vaping is about 95% less harmful than smoking. This does not mean that vaping is harmless, simply less harmful. </p>
<p>What is <strong>not</strong> yet known is the long-term effects of vaping. The first e-cig was invented in 2003. There were only a handful of products on the market before the last few years. We have about a century of data on smoking and its long term effects. </p>
<p>Is it possible that in fifty years we will learn that vaping was in fact more harmful in the long term? We cannot rule that out, but we have no reason to believe it will happen. However it is known that continuing to smoke will be harmful, so for people like me who have had no success quitting without vaping it is worth a try. We have a choice between something that will definitely kill us, or something that might but more likely won't.</p>
<p><strong>TL,DR:</strong> If you've never smoked, its probably not a good idea to start vaping. If you can quit smoking without vaping, quit smoking. However, many people have been unable to quit smoking without vaping, and reducing harm is better than continuing to smoke.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for an e-cig company working for a friend. He made millions when it first became a big hit (here in Canada) 6-8 years ago. My job was to make the juices, i.e. liquids that go into the devices. I was labels as an &quot;E-Liquid Engineer&quot;. It kind of made me laugh, and it was then I realised sometimes the words &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;highly trained&quot; gets thrown around more often then it should. </p>
<p>Essentially, what I was tasked with doing was mixing the core ingredients of the chemicals. There are two main ingredients, PG (Propylene Glycol) and VG (Vegetable Glycerine). Depending on the type of vape you want, be it more cloud, or smoother vape, etc. you would change how much of each of those main parts go into the mixture. </p>
<p>People normally want a flavour to go along with the vape. I would add from a variety of flavours to the concoction. These flavours would range from something sweet, to fruity, to ones that taste like normal cigarettes. Most of the flavourings were harmless in their own, with most being simple flavour shots you could get at grocery stores or bulk barns. Others were concentrates mixed with a few other harmless ingredients. </p>
<p>The last ingredient was the nicotine. It wasn't mandatory to have nicotine added to the bottle. There are many different &quot;strengths&quot; you can purchase, ranging from zero nicotine, to an extremely large amount (sometimes more then a regular cigarette). As others have mentioned, the nicotine is certainly a harmful chemical, and the vapes with in included should not be deemed &quot;healthy&quot;. However, without that included, most vapes are relatively harmless. Of course what's even healthier then ingesting the PG and VG would be not vaping at all. </p>
<p>I worked there for a couple of years, and I never vaped. I never smoked, so I felt no need to. It was a little odd being the only non-vaper, because vaping becomes a lifestyle of sorts. It's something a lot of people who begin vaping reaaaally get into. </p>
<p>Bottom line though, the nicotine in the is essentially the worst part of vaping. Without that, it's truly not that bad. I mean, eating a Big Mac could probably prove to be worse for you then vaping without nicotine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

More likely it won't run into much and will eventually get stuck in a huge orbit around a black hole after being swung around a few it was too fast for. Maybe align close enough to something like a star or black hole and get sucked in. A couple billion years from now.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spacecraft are shielded to prevent damage from micrometeoroids. These are normally called MMOD (Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris) shields, though the debris part is only relevant in Earth's orbit, not in the case of Cassini in a far away planet.</p>
<p>The basic principle is using several layers of a shielding material to break the incident micrometeoroid into dust before impacting successive layers that will stop the fragments. The first layer will be inevitably penetrated if the micrometeoroid is big enough as all the force is concentrated in a very small area. But when it breaks, smaller pieces of dust will expand and hit the successive layers over a much larger area, so they can resist well.</p>
<p>Of course this can't stop micrometeoroids of arbitrary size, so there's always some probability of penetration. There are models of micrometeoroids and orbital debris to estimate these probabilities, such as ESA's Master 2009. They are mostly based on data from NASA's LDEF and ESA's Eureca spacecraft. The shields are then calculated to stop particles up to a certain size so that the probability of hitting a bigger one becomes low enough to be acceptable.</p>
<p>Here's a slideshow that is focused in the ISS but the basic principles of shields are roughly the same: <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120002584.pdf" target="_blank">https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120002584.pdf</a> . The main difference is that the ISS is in a much more harsh environment due to the abundance of orbital debris, and safety is more critical as it bears human lives. (Not sure if Cassini's orbit brought it very close to the rings - in that case, yes, it must have faced lots of micrometeoroids).</p>
<p>Edit: found a source that mentions Cassini specifically: <a href="https://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1107.pdf" target="_blank">https://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1107.pdf</a></p>
<p>It confirms Cassini's environment is much less aggressive, they only care about very small particles, so the MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation for thermal control) is enough protection to work as a micrometeoroid shield at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One of the basic functions of a skeleton (exo or endo) is simply to provide structural support for the creature, so it can move. If it has a exoskeleton it has no need of an endoskeleton, and vice versa. </p>
<p>However i'm not sure if you would classify a creature which has an endoskeleton, but also has some kind of bonelike armour (not connected to the endoskeleton) under this category.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Our endoskeleton is made up of the cartilage-derived bones of the spine, limbs, ribs, and cranial base. The rest of our bones are intramembraneously-derived and are effectively exoskeletal. This includes the face and cranial vault as well as parts of the shoulder. Reptiles, amphibians, and fish tend to have much more exoskeleton. In sharks, the exoskeleton is secondarily reduced are replaced with an array of tiny teeth called denticles.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Nothing man made has left our milky way galaxy. Few man made things have left our solar system. We figured out the shape due to a couple of different pieces of evidence. One being that we live in a 3 spacial dimension universe. And so, when gravity sucks in gasses to collect matter, they flatten out and then spiral. Minutephysics has a good video on this. Our solar system is another example of this and is why almost all galaxies and solar systems are so flat. Another piece of more observable proof is statistically it should be. Looking at other galaxies and noticing that a vast majority are spiral makes sense for ours to be as well. And finally, you can see it. With the naked eye. When it's dark enough out, you can look up and see a smooth line of our galaxy with rounded ends (because youre viewing a disk from the side). And additionally with that you can kinda make out the spiral.</p>
<p>I'm a physics student. But because im just a student I don't know every piece of evidence. There is more than likely more that i don't know about, but this is what I know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually a lot of different shaped galaxies. A large number of which are elliptical galaxies which are hardly flat disks or spirals, but are much more three dimensional. There are disc galaxies that are flat like spirals, but with hardly any star formation. There are also irregular galaxies with hardly any shape at all!</p>
<p>What evidence do we have that we live in a spiral galaxy? That has to do with star age and it's position in our galaxy. Something shared by all spiral galaxies is called the halo. The halo is located around the center of the galaxy and part of the halo consists of a large amount of star clusters (huge number of stars tightly bound together by gravity). These star clusters orbit, not in the plane of the galaxy, rather in a bulge or sphere around the center. What's neat about star clusters is that most of the stars were formed at the same time, and are ancient.  They are some of the first starts to form in a galaxy and are still sticking around for the ride. When astronomers looked into the center of our galaxy(into the brightest part of the Milky Way) they found tons these star clusters, all orbiting the center of the galaxy, some outside of the galactic plane. But when we look the other way we see mostly stars outside of our galaxy or young stars. That is because in spiral galaxies stars are constantly being formed in the spiral arms. </p>
<p>So to recap, we know we are in a spiral galaxy because the observable structures all match with what we know about spiral galaxies from observing other galaxies. Every spiral has a halo with old stars and arms with young stars and that's exactly what we observe in our own galaxy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The clinical lab deals with liquids (blood, urine, spinal fluid, etc.) and microbiology while the anatomic lab is exactly that: for anatomic parts! </p>
<p>So if you got your appendix removed it will go the anatomic pathology lab to be &quot;grossed&quot; (measured, described) and sectioned. What we do to the appendix depends on what it was taken out for. </p>
<p>No matter what we will snip off the entire distal tip (the end opposite the side that attaches to the cecum) as that can harbor a kind of tumor called a carcinoid tumor. We will then serially section the appendix looking for any abnormalities. What does the lumen contain? Fecal material, fecoliths, blood, pus, nothing? How does the serosa (the outside of the appendix) look? Is it dull and not shiny? Does it have purulent exudate on it or the attached fat (mesoappendix)? Is it torn or is there a perforation? Finally, we look at how thick the wall of the appendix is (they are usually about 0.2 cm thick). </p>
<p>A normal gross dictation of your presumably normal appendix that may have been incidentally taken out will look something like this:</p>
<p>Received fresh labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, and additionally labeled &quot;appendix&quot; is a 6.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter appendix with 2.0 cm of attached mesoappendix. The serosa is pink-tan, smooth, and glistening. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 0.2 cm lumen containing blood and a 0.2 cm thick wall. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1A = entire distal tip bisected longitudinally
1B = representative cross sections including inked proximal margin</p>
<p>Edit: So if you have appendicitis I will look for purulent exudate on the serosa, in the appendix itself, and will make sure there isn't a perforation. </p>
<p>Edit 2: The sections I submit in cassettes are then processed and cut by histotechs. These small (think micron size sections) are then stained (usually with hematoxylin and eosin) and the pathologist will examine the slide under the scope. They perform the final diagnosis; in the case of appendicitis looking for neutrophils inside the lumen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I would like to point out that body parts that are removed are not necessarily unnecessary- even the appendix, the archetypical useless organ, is currently thought to provide some function (providing a safe store of positive bacteria to re-populate the intestines after something like diarrhea flushes them out)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've got a story about the old methods of disposal. For reference, I am an environmental geologist and was working near Flint, MI a few years ago.  Had to do a subsurface investigation at one of the vacant hospitals because for 30+ years they dumped all biowaste into an open pit west of the hospital. They filled in the &quot;skin pit&quot; (what my coworkers and I dubbed the dump) in the late 1980s with building debris from an old on-site church, and then paved over it for extra parking. We drilled the pit and found significant contamination, including formaldehyde, in the groundwater. All of the houses down-gradient of the hospital had to connect to city water. Pretty gross considering how long they were drinking that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
