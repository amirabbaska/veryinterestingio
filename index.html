		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can covalently bond with up to 4 other atoms, and it forms reasonably strong bonds with itself as well as with Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and a few others.</p>
<p>Carbon can serve as the &quot;backbone&quot; for constructing an effectively infinite variety of complex chemically active molecules. And because of that variety it presents the possibility for a nearly infinite variety of carbon based molecules with different chemical properties.</p>
<p>To take some examples from biology: you can have sugars which are basically cyclo-esters (a carbon chain that is connected back to itself but with an oxygen atom in the chain) with hydroxyl groups attached to every carbon atom in the chain (a sort of &quot;super&quot; alcohol). Sugars are polar molecules, they dissolve easily in water. They're remarkably good for storing energy because you can basically just split it in half into two pyruvate molecules and get free energy. But if you link a bunch of sugars together you can produce cellulose, which has very different properties from sugar. If you modify the sugars slightly by adding an amide group and form those into a polymer you can create chitin (the material of the exoskeletons of crustaceans, insects, etc.) which has very different properties compared to both glucose and wood, though it is closely chemically related.</p>
<p>Alkanes are long chains of carbon atoms each linked to two other carbon atoms and (usually) two hydrogen atoms. Fats are made out of long alkane chains bonded to a carboxyllic acid group and then sometimes attached to something else (like glycerin or a phosphate group in the case of phospholipids). An ordinary fat is extremely non-polar, so it doesn't dissolve in water, phospholipids have a polar end and a non-polar tail so they form into bilayers serving as cell membranes, for example. Proteins are made out of strings of carbon based molecules that start out as amino-acids (a carboxyl group with an amine group on the next carbon over) which enables the formation of amide bonds. The backbone of a protein's peptide chain is a series of [NH] [CH-R] [CO] [NH] [CH-R] [CO] (and so on), with different R groups corresponding to different amino-acids. Without the N or O atoms the peptide chain wouldn't be feasible, but without carbon it would not work at all, and the R groups are also carbon based. That basic structure makes it possible to create a huge array of micro-polymers (proteins) that can have an enormous array of different physical and chemical properties ranging from something as &quot;simple&quot; as a structural protein of hair to something as complex as a component of an electron transport chain designed to serve as a component in the machinery of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>In short, the variety of molecules that can be created with carbon based chemistry and the enormous span of different properties those molecules can have is what makes that chemistry so deep and interesting. It's particularly suited to use in the field of nanoscopic molecular machinery, which serves as the foundation for all life as we know it, but even that is only a fraction of what's possible with organic chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of stuff!</p>
<p>Most people mentioned the 4 bonds, and at least one mentioned that its the smallest element that can make 4. But consider that it's also the smallest element to make more than 2 bonds, and its also the smallest element to make more than 1 covalent bond.</p>
<p>Why is &quot;multiple bonds&quot; an important concept? </p>
<p>Because we exist and move about in 3 geometric dimensions! Imagine you have one atom of Hydrogen, what relative space does it occupy? A point. Now that Hydrogen covalently bonds to satisfy its outer shell requirements and makes a Hydrogen molecule. What relative space does it occupy? A line. Oxygen will bond with two hydrogens, the angle provided by these bonds will allow for a plane (2 dimensions). But, A single molecule containing Carbon can make enough bonds to occupy all three dimensions in space.</p>
<p>Why is being the smallest element important?</p>
<p>Because everything that is; has resulted from an initial state of free floating protons, electrons, and neutrons (shortly after the big bang). </p>
<p>The easiest element and Isotope to synthesize is Hydrogen: A free proton needs to capture a free electron to create an electron shell orbital. This is highly likely due to the attractive force of different charges in electromagnetism. After that the next easiest isotope to create is deuterium. A Hydrogen nucleus (proton) absorbs a neutron (which is not affected by electromagnetism). After that its Tritium: Deuterium absorbs a Neutron. </p>
<p>Then the next most likely thing to happen is that Tritium absorbs another neutron. When that happens, one of the neutrons changes its &quot;spin&quot; and becomes a Proton. A Beta particle is emitted (with negative charge) and a charged helium atom is produced (This method of Helium synthesis is far more likely to happen than a Proton nucleus absorbing another proton due to electromagnetism repulsion factors). The charged helium will then rapidly acquire another electron to form a neutral Helium atom.</p>
<p>This method of synthesis will continue on down the line, making the smaller elements much more likely to be synthesized than their larger counterparts. That means..... There is way more Carbon than say Silicon which makes it more LIKELY to be used in a system.</p>
<p>Carbon also has an equal number of &quot;extra&quot; electrons from the next lower electron shell (S1) as it does &quot;missing&quot; electrons from its next higher full electron shell (S2, P2). This means that not only is it incredibly electroneutral, but it can be altered equally to the left and right by bonding it with a more electronegative (which will steal electron density) or electropositive (which will donate electron density) functional group.</p>
<p>This means carbons can function as neutral, partially positive, AND partially negative. That means it can make LOTS of different bonds with lots of different types of elements and functional groups. It ALSO means that it can bond well to itself while still leaving room for other bonds to be made. For instance an N2 gas bond will have a triple bond, but won't readily bond again (or react which is why it is considered largely inert). That makes it not so great in creating longer chains. O2 gas, and F2 gas are much the same in this respect. But carbon will use it's partially positive nature to form a third or 4th bond with a partially negative atom (like a nitrogen, oxygen, or hydrogen).</p>
<p>Those Carbon-Nitrogen, Carbon-Oxygen, and Carbon-Hydrogen Bonds are literally what make nitrogenous bases, monosaccharides, and amino acids possible. Further, they facilitate those monomer units to polymerize into more &quot;living units&quot; (DNA, Proteins, Polysaccharides, ect.).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon is the smallest element that makes four bonds. </p>
<p>Larger elements hold onto their electrons less because of their size, and this makes them more metallic. Once you start acting metally you  get kinda pigeonholed into making quite metal-like bonds which are far less vared and far less able to be fine tuned and specialised than covalent bonding networks like non-metals can do. If you can covalently bond you can form a variety of patterns in the bonding network that make different substances - different types of lipids, inorganic crap, sugars and stuff if you throw oxygen in... you know. Variety. Different properties.</p>
<p>But metallic bonding is so blurry and non-speciifc you lose that ability to differentiate materials a bit. They're all pretty samey the more metallic you get. So carbon being the least metallic and most common is the best one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Carbon, in its native state, has six electrons that are contained in 2 orbital types: s and p. The s orbital is closest to the nucleus and has two electrons that the atom really likes to hold on to. The p orbital, or more specifically orbitals, can exist in three different orientations along perpendicular axis. The electrons in these orbitals aren't held as tightly as those in the s orbital and are able to more freely bond with other atoms that have available electrons in the correct orbital orientation. It is also the p orbitals that are responsible for double and triple bonds in alkenes and alkynes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Grapefruit and other foods contain substances that can inhibit the activity of these enzymes, stopping the metabolism of these drugs. It can either lead to dangerously high levels of the drugs remaining in your system, or in the case of drugs that need to be broken down before they're active, dangerously low levels as the pro-drug you've taken isn't getting metabolized properly.
Also, it can result in other enzymes acting on drugs that aren't usually active or sufficiently active, resulting in the wrong kind of metabolite forming, which can be harmful as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical Student.   </p>
<p>Many drugs are metabolized by a certain enzyme called CYP P450 (or other enzymes that are also within the CYP family). Warfarin is one of these drugs. CYP P450 is basically what is breaking down warfarin in your body.  </p>
<p>So, anything that changes how CYP P450 does its job of breaking down warfarin will impact how warfarin works. Different drugs and other things (grapefruit juice, St. John's wort) either make CYP work better or inhibit CYP.   </p>
<p>If CYP is made to work better, for instance by St John's wort (commonly used for over the counter mild depression), then CYP will be breaking down warfarin super fast. The warfarin can be broken down so fast that it does not reach the level needed to actually thin the persons blood. To say again, by inducing CYP to breakdown warfarin better, warfarin cannot reach therapeutic levels.   </p>
<p>Another example is the CYP inhibitor cimetidine, which is commonly found in over the counter stomach medication (it's an antacid). Cimetidine is a CYP inhibitor, meaning CYP is not breaking down warfarin as well as usually. So, since warfarin is not being broken down, it causes warfarin to reach possibly toxic levels. Patients are at increased risk of bleeding.   </p>
<p>Overall, warfarin is not that great of drug, partially because it is dependent on CYP for breakdown and for a variety of other reasons. It also requires constant monitoring because it can be difficult to maintain within therapeutic range. Look up the list of things warfarin interacts with, and you'll be surprised that it's the most commonly prescribed drug thinner in the U.S.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruits contain furanocoumarins, which mess with a particular enzyme that decomposes a lot of drugs.  On the one hand, that means if you eat a grapefruit, the drug can stick around in your system, and next time you take a pill you've actually got a double dose.  On the other hand, some drugs are actually precursors of the active chemical, so no enzyme = no active drug.</p>
<p>The cranberry interaction is contested, and I'm not aware of any study that's shown how it actually interferes with drugs.</p>

<p>But I think others in the thread have made warfarin sound worse than it is. I barely even think about it anymore. Every day I have the same amount of vitamin K by measuring out some broccoli on a food scale. This is second nature to me now and takes no extra time. (It's also helpful for counting calories w/ other foods.) I know (roughly) the translation of that amount of broccoli to other common vitamin K greens like lettuce, and I know the foods to completely avoid (kale is ridiculously high in K).</p>
<p>Blood draws are also not an issue. I have a home testing machine that involves just pricking your finger. You barely feel it and you get the results near-instantaneously. My levels have been A-OK for the last 5 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Imagine that there is an old-fashioned war, on a battlefield, with troops rushing towards each other and going at it with hammer, tongs, tooth &amp; claw.
The two sides would be the bacteria that are trying to multiply fast enough to bring troops to the front line, and their opponents are your neutrophil leucocytes, or white blood cells, that are getting to the front from the war factory of your bone marrow and making an amphibious landing via your bloodstream.
Both sides are dying in droves. Their dead bodies are what makes up pus, which is actually often sterile, oddly enough.
In the rectum/anus, the bacteria are fighting from a very small beachhead, uphill, and are vastly outnumbered. It's like the body has a tsunami of troops.
While rectal abscesses and infections do occur, mostly it is because there is a compromise in the ability of the body to deliver troops to the front line, or the dead bodies accumulate in a pocket, like and abscess, so you can't clear the dead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's use humans as an example. Most of our cells have two complete sets of 23 chromosomes (46 in total). One of those in each set is a sex chromosome, that exists in X and Y versions. In females, both sex chromosomes are the X version, in males there is one X and one Y.</p>
<p>Sperm and egg cells, however, have only a single set of 23 chromosomes. Each one is more or less randomly chosen from one or the other of the two complete sets we have. Since females have two X chromosomes, all egg cells contain an X chromosome. But since males have an X and a Y chromosome, sperm cells have either an X or a Y, with a 50:50 mix.</p>
<p>So when sperm and egg combine to give two complete sets of chromosomes again, if the sperm cell contains an X, the offspring will have two X's and will be female. If the sperm cell contains a Y, the offspring will have an X and a Y and will be male.</p>
<p>tl'dr: sperm cells randomly get assigned an X or Y chromosome, and that ultimately determines the sex of the offspring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned Fisher's Principle, which describes why the sex ratio of most species is approximately 1:1 between males and females.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a situation where male births are less common than female births and, subsequently, there are fewer males than females in a population. This means a male in that population will have better mating prospects than a female because the male has are more mates to choose from. A male can, therefore, expect to have more offspring. That means if any set of parents in this population are genetically predisposed to produce more male than female offspring, they will then tend to have more of grandchildren born to them. Therefore, whatever male offspring favoring genes they have, will spread more quickly, and this leads to male births becoming more common in that population. As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, whatever advantage associated with producing males dies away. The same process would occur if the situation was reversed for the sexes. Therefore the 1:1 ratio is the evolutionarily stable strategy.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed &quot;less common&quot; to &quot;more common&quot; at the beginning so it made sense.
Edit 2: Changed &quot;more males&quot; to &quot;fewer males&quot;. I hope this makes sense now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we speak out loud there are 2 signals that the brain receives: the internal monologue and (assuming you are not deaf) auditory feedback from our speech output. This may be why we tend to think we are speaking louder than we actually are. Your brain also receives a 3rd feedback signal from the articulation/speech muscles. Your brain learns to associate all 3 signals with each other (thinking a word, with the sound of the word, and the movement of the speech muscles needed to speak the word).</p>
<p>So if you are thinking internally, your conscious brain will only receive the internal monologue signal.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned, the internal monologue is extremely closely related to the production of speech (this topic is known as &quot;embodiment&quot;). Studies show that when people read text silently, muscles used for speech are slightly activated. Also, speech production areas of the brain are activated when people speak internally. This all suggests thinking and speaking use similar neural pathways, and so the brain perceives thinking almost like speaking.</p>
<p>Note: this is referring to clear-cut intended internal speech. More ambiguous &quot;thought&quot; is going to be much more complex.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The act of speaking, the sound of speaking, and the internal thought which is correlated with the speech, are all highly associated with each other (They use similar brain pathways). So when you &quot;hear&quot; yourself think, it is probably because you are activating the same brain pathways used for normal speech and hearing</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is marvelous. All that is you are the stories you know and or believe in. Many of these clips drop unused on the cutting room floor. Most, though, make up you and the stories you believe. Let us keep focused on your question and not include genetics.</p>
<p>With one exception, all of the words we think about do, though, include genetics as a foundation, OK, enough of that.</p>
<p>Let us consider, this the inner monologue never stops during our consciousness. There is always some kind of flurry of disjointed or coherent words flowing from where to where?</p>
<p>What we are hearing are words, sentences, paragraphs, and on we go. Yet, back to your question, keep in mind that you do not own this inner monologue, it happens. You don’t control it. In the brilliance of youth they are extremely vivid monologues. As you grow older you lose your acuity as you do your muscle fibers.</p>
<p>That should be enough of a scaffold to answer your question. The answer to your question lays in what is listening to this monologue. What is listening is your body and as your body is the instrument of the brain, it plays on and on. This music coincides with your emotions that start the process. The genius of the system is that as these musical vibrations flow in and around your whole body, so does your body, using the same instrument to emerge as your awareness of what you are thinking. We are music beings. Think of stones thrown into a little pond. Each of the waves created continue on the way uninterrupted so that when it encounters another wave they slip through each other.</p>
<p>I guess there was a little more scaffold required to understand the answer after all.</p>
<p>Yet, now we are ready!</p>
<p>The anatomical devices that form words out of these directed emotions is physical. Vibration enters the interpreter and from the interpreter, words emerge according to our culture and upbringing. Well, where does free will come into this? When do we control these thoughts?</p>
<p>We don’t. The words that flow through us are a river of words and like a river directs itself on a course of least resistance. There is no free will.</p>
<p>The watched is simultaneously the watcher. This watcher translates these codes into a learned language.</p>
<p>All this is possible because each of us has a personality and it is this that is the course of least resistance. What you say to yourself is heard using your ears, but in this case there is no outside vibrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Water has the advantage of being slightly more common than ammonia or methane; in addition, it is liquid at higher temperatures, which means that life forming in water has more energy available to reproduce and move around. So we're not sure that extraterrestrial life forms in water, but water is probably a good guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haldane and Oparin suggested that the early ocean contained the necessary chemicals to form life. They theorized that the Earth's atmosphere was not oxygen rich but reducing which would have allowed catalytic reactions to happen allowing the formation of early building blocks that could form to give complex molecules which can lead to early life.</p>
<p>25 years later, Miller and Urey conducted an experiment that was similar to Oparin's and Haldane's theory. They combined hydrogen, methane, ammonia and boiling water in a flask to represent what Earth was like before life and used electric sparks to catalyze the reaction. The end result was the formation of amino acids and nucleic acids.</p>
<p>If Haldane and Oparin are correct, the nucleic acids would be the simple molecules giving way to amino acids and proteins. </p>
<p>A theory that is widely popular in biology is the idea that life came from RNA because it would fit Haldane's and Oparin's theory. Ribozymes are RNA complexes that can act as enzymes to catalyze RNA expression. If RNA formed, it can form ribozymes which can bind and express RNA. We know that DNA  is read and translated to RNA which is transcribed into amino acids which forms proteins which forms tertiary structures like muscles.</p>
<p>We also know that organisms do not need &quot;nice&quot; conditions to survive. We have already discovered bacteria that live in highly acidic conditions with little oxygen for respiration. </p>
<p>If we're asking about having similar conditions for sustaining life, the answer is yes. Different conditions can sustain life. </p>
<p>If we're asking if different conditions can give rise to life, who knows? If we're going with the RNA-first theory then maybe all we need is carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen along with some catalytic event to create nucleic acids and amino acids. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really. A lot what you're tasting is actually the changing in flavor of the oils as they pick of contaminants, and the loss of the strongest and most aromatic flavor notes which are composed of very volatile molecules. In short, coffee just doesn't last long, even as a bean. Once you brew it, the clock is really ticking. </p>
<p>Ice coffee is then solution, because the cold mutes the bitter notes and you end up with something closer to a milder version of the original. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coffee tastes different when it's been sitting out for a while because compounds in it become oxidized from exposure to the air and because the high temperature (for hot coffee anyway) accelerates chemical reactions which ultimately affect the flavor. There are other factors that affect staling of coffee but the big ones are oxidation and temperature. These chemical reactions can't (realistically) be reversed so you wont ever get the freshness back, and by reheating old coffee you'll only increase the rate of chemical reactions which lead to it being stale in the first place. If you kept brewed coffee somewhere with no oxygen and at a low temperature then you could reheat it later and it would probably taste fresh. Once you pour coffee into a mug and it's exposed to the air and ambient temperature then it's just a matter of time before it becomes stale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually types of toothpaste that are not based on fluoride, but on other substances that have some degree of research as to increased efficacy.</p>
<p>For example, sensodyne in Canada/UK (not sold in USA due to patent nonsense) contains not plain sodium fluoride, but rather NovaMin, a bioglass that is designed to (in a simplified sense) fill in gaps in the teeth.  Certain toothpastes, typically available as a special treatment in some Dentist offices, use nano-hydroxyapatite which some studies show to be superior to sodium-fluoride in the remineralization of enamel.  While you can't buy either in US stores, except perhaps as an expensive once-off in the right Dentist office, they're readily available on Amazon.</p>
<p>This goes way beyond ELI5, but here's some research articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enamel surface remineralization: Using synthetic nanohydroxyapatite</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3636833/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3636833/</a></em></p>
<p>The use of biomimetic nanohydroxyapatite as a remineralizing agent holds promise as a new synthetic enamel biocompatible material to repair early carious lesions.</p>

<p>The nano-hydroxyapatite is a revolutionary material with a wide use in dentistry. With regard to restorative and preventive fields, nano-hydroxyapatite has remarkable remineralizing effects on initial lesions of enamel, certainly higher than traditional fluorides used until now for this purpose. Nano-hydroxyapatite is, in fact, a better source of free Ca, and this is a key element as regards the remineralization, the protection against caries and dental erosion. </p>

<p>Thirty sound human premolars were divided into <em>nanohydroxyapatite group</em> (n = 15) and the <em>sodium fluoride group</em> (n = 15)...The results showed that the nanohydroxyapatite group produced a surface morphology close to the biologic enamel, the increase in mineral content (Ca/P ratio) was <em>more significant</em> in the nanohydroxyapatite group (P &lt; 0.05) and the SMH recovery was <em>closer to the baseline level</em> in the nanohydroxyapatite group (P &lt; 0.05).</p>

<p>Forty-eight human enamel blocks were assigned to four groups (N=12): (1) control (without agent); (2) fluoride varnish (Duraphat); (3) nano-HAP paste (Desensibilize Nano P); and (4) casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) paste (MI Paste Plus)...After the cariogenic challenge, the nano-HAP group showed significantly higher KHN and %SMHR values than varnish. The CPP-ACP group showed no increase in KHN. The nano-HAP group showed, via AFM, a protective layer formation with globular deposits on the surface....SMHR and AFM morphology revealed that nano-hydroxyapatite paste showed a protective effect against in vitro enamel caries development.</p>

<p>It was concluded that all the three desensiting agents were effective in the dentine tubule occlusion. In addition efficacy of nano-hydroxyapatite toothpaste was greater compared to the other desensiting agents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Novamin seems somewhat similar, it's a &quot;bioglass&quot; that is supposed to fill gaps in enamel and reduce tooth sensitivity, though it may also promote remineralization.  Like I said, it's in sensodyne (interesting, it is not in US sensodyne, only in other countries like Canada and the UK).</p>

<p>The scoring and the percentage of occluded dentinal tubules by Novamin containing toothpaste was significantly better compared to arginine or the control toothpaste. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here. There are minor differences overall. But really we just recommend one with fluoride that you like for most people. I've seen people comment on here fluoride has no effect. I'm not going to post a long rambling post but that's just wrong. As the hydroxyapatite in enamel loses its ions from acid (which happens around ph 5.5) the hyrdroxyl group is replaced by the fluoride which creates fluoroapatite which is dissolved at pH 4.5. This is a great deal difference as it's the pH scale. I know that's not explain like I'm five but it is. Tartar control has pyrophosphates which do help slightly. Sensitive usually uses another type of fluoride called stannous fluoride or a chemical potassium nitrate to reduce sensitivity. Both work for minor sensitivity. Whitening has a higher RDA value usually which means more abrasive. Cosmetic claims don't need evaluation so those are almost all marketing. The triclosan in Colgate total does have studies backing it up but there is the debate of triclosan in products contributing to antibiotic resistance but it's mainly with hand soaps so it may or may not be around on toothpaste in the future. </p>
<p>Well. Looks like it was a long rambling post. But to sum it up. Brush for two minutes twice a day. The two minutes is not only to do a good cleaning but also to give time for the fluoride to work. It's also recommended to not rinse after brushing especially at night to allow for more contact time. Just spit out excess. </p>
<p>Edit. Also there is also Mi paste/tooth mousse which has ACP which is a bioavailable way for the ions to remineralize without fluoride. But you lose the benefit of creating the fluoroapatite. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in the industry and in the US we are regulated by the FDA. Toothpaste is what's called an over the counter drug. This means that it has some claim that has been substantiated by a study, and an active ingredient that works toward that claim. </p>
<p>In the case of Toothpaste it might have an ingredient like Sodium Flouride 0.24%  there's lots of testing that will substantiate that Flouride at that percent prevents tooth decay via prevention of softening of the enamel. </p>
<p>Now Toothpaste may something like &quot;appears whiter&quot; and this can be a cosmetic claim. Basically they got 20 people in a room and asked them &quot;after using it for a week do your teeth look whiter?&quot; get enough people to say yeah, and now you have label copy. But if they add 0.04% hydrogen peroxide as a whitening agent, then it will say it on the label. </p>
<p>So what's this all mean? If two completely different Toothpastes have the same exact active ingredients they are essentially the same.  Everything else is taste and filler. It also means if a Walmart brand has the same active ingredients it's just as good as the brand name. Likely also made in the same place.  </p>
<p>Edit to add: any OTC drug has a number on the back you can call and ask to see the studies that back their claim. Cosmetics also. Just call and ask, &quot;can I see the study that you use to verify the claim of 10 x brighter?&quot; they have to be able to prove it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

One example is the Sensodyne line, which btw I am from the UK and I believe the active ingredients across the pond are a little different. Anyway, your dentist may recommend you 'Sensodyne' tooth paste for sensitive teeth, but which one you should buy actually depends on a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensodyne rapid relief contains strontium acetate, which effectively blocks the tunnels leading to the nerves within your tooth to sooth pain and, long-term, block the nerves off.</li>
<li>Repair and Protect uses NOVAMIN, which I believe is not approved by the FDA in the US, which actually rebuilds the exterior of your tooth over the dentin, blocking off these tubules that cause pain within your teeth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Colgate's sensitive line uses completely different ingredients, I think. Anyway, not a professional - I just have sensitive teeth - but that's all certainly true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the formulations are certainly different between companies, as far as the results go the differences are not enough to be noted on a clinical scale in my experience talking with patients for the last 10 years.  Some, like Colgate Total use Tricoslan ( now banned and soon to stop because of the risk of bacterial resistance) while Crest Pro Health uses Stannous fluoride instead of Sodium Fluoride, though again in my experience the average person will not be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>The two exceptions to that rule would be toothpaste's like Sensodyne or similar products from other companies, as these contain Potassium Nitrate 5% as an additional active ingredient in addition to Sodium Fluoride. Also, if you are at a high risk of cavities or have extremely dry mouth a RX toothpaste with higher fluoride concentrations (most common being Prevident 5000) may be prudent.</p>
<p>My recommendation to patients is to get the cheapest toothpaste you can that contains Sodium Fluoride or the equivalent unless you have problems with sensitivity, in which you should look for a tooth paste with Potassium nitrate.  In my professional opinion if you want whiter teeth you are better served using a peroxide based whitening system from your dentist or from things like OTC whitening strips.</p>
<p>TL;DR: There are no real differences except if you have specialized needs in which other products can be recommended by a dental professional.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Isn't it illegal to take someones money and not give them what was promised in exchange?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first off, and this is extremely important to understand, you haven't already paid for your own social security. You've paid for your grandparents' social security. The whole system kinda works on the honor system where you pay in and in exchange the next generation will pay for you. </p>
<p>Now the problem comes in that there's less children in the next generation and the current generations are living longer and longer than ever. So, we can either seriously jack up the tax on younger generations to try to break even or we can cut benefits/eligibility/etc. on the older generations.</p>
<p>Edit: With regards to the rest of your question it is important to realize that the government isn't some person that you can take money from. It's not like you get your SS check from Paul Ryan or Nancy Pelosi's bank account. Rather you are getting your check from then next generation of American workers, who didn't vote for social security in the first place. If you want to argue from a position of justice, why should these individuals be required to pay for your social security?</p>
<p>Edit 2: Also, it helps to recognize that the social security trust fund is not some massive reservoir of reserve funds. It's around <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Trust_Fund" target="_blank"> 2.7 trillion</a> which sounds like a lot but is only about <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank">3 years of the nation's social security expenditures.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To best understand how SS works, think about how the first generation of recipients received the benefit. Those who met eligibility requirements were able to receive the benefit the first day of the program, even though they never had a single penny deducted for the program their entire career. </p>
<p>The money for that first group of benefit checks came from deductions taken the same month from those who were employed that month. That new deduction was tough on the employed, as it was like an immediate pay cut but it was generally understood that they would eventually see the benefit when they retire. </p>
<p>And it works the same today. Each generation accepts a lower take-home pay by funding the program for today's retirees with the expectation that the following generation will do the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will speak only to Social Security:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Social Security contributions by you go to pay the benefits of retirees today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There used to be a lot more people paying into social security than were receiving benefits.  (It has dropped from a 13:1 ratio down to a 3:1 ratio.)  The reason is that people are living longer than they ever have now, and more individuals qualify for benefits from a program that used to strictly be for individuals 65 and older only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social Security's structure (in its current form) will fail eventually.  I want you to visualize the structure of Social Security.  Lots of people on the bottom paying a certain amount of money into the system that pay for the benefits of a few people above them.  Now add another layer at the bottom with more people paying for the individuals that were on the bottom, but are now in the middle.  What does that shape look like to you?  You're right, it looks like a pyramid and Social Security is the biggest pyramid scheme ever devised in the history of the world.  Every time they increase taxes, or reduce benefits, all they are doing to extending the perceived viability of a system that WILL collapse someday and leave a whole generation of Americans holding the bag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To those individuals that believe having the trust fund invested into treasury bonds is a good idea:  You are crazy, or deluded, or both.  The US government takes the funds &quot;invested&quot; into treasury bonds and uses them for day-to-day general expenditures for the government to continue to function.  Even with those funds the US government runs a huge deficit.  It is just now getting to the point where Social Security will need to call in those markers on the treasury bonds, and then the US government will not only have those funds to borrow anymore, but they will also have to pay back the funds that it's borrowed to this point.  A full economic collapse would not be out of the realm of impossibility at that point IMO.  Let's use an example.  You have $1 million in a retirement account.  However, you live beyond your means on a day-to-day basis.  You decide it might be a good idea to loan yourself the money from your retirement account to make ends meet, because frankly living within a sensible budget sucks.  When it becomes time to retire, you now need that money that was in your retirement account, but you've already loaned all of the money out of the account to yourself.  Does that sound like sound financial planning to you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, but didn't we run a surplus back when Clinton was in office?  Um, no we didn't.  The US government actually ran a deficit.  However, it got enough money from the Social Security Trust fund so that $60 million of deficit looked like a $30 million surplus.  I can't find it now, but I researched the shit out of this in college.  The President of the United States issues a letter each year on the national debt.  In Bill Clinton's letter during one of the years where he claimed that the government ran a surplus was this little gem of a quote, &quot;The national debt does not include money the government owes itself.&quot;  And make no mistake that the federal government owes money to Social Security than it does to any other creditor.</p>
</li>
<li>It's beyond a political issue now, but the only way to fix Social Security permanently is to have a percentage of your paycheck (let's say 10%) go into an account that is earmarked for you only and invested into actual stocks/bonds/mutual funds/etc...  If you don't pay into the system, then you don't get anything out.  If everyone had 10% of their paychecks set aside for their 40 or 50 years of employment and invested in good investments then everyone would have plenty of money to retire with. As it is, someone is going to get screwed, and the younger you are the more likely it is that it's going to be you.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did not see anyone touch this part, but some have made some very good points.</p>
<p>As others have said, you are not paying for you, you are paying for those on retirement and your kids will pay for you. </p>
<p>Ida May Fuller, I think, was the first to collect social security. She paid in something like 30 cents and collected a check for 30+ years. This should show the hazard of the program. It only works as long as the population ratio of payees to retiree's stays positive. </p>
<p>There are two major factors you need to consider:</p>
<p>Payee to collectee ratio, and life span </p>
<p>When social security was started the payee to retiree ratio in 1940 was 159:1. So 159 people were paying payroll taxes for every person collecting a check. </p>
<p>That ratio started dropping immediately, and never got better. 1960 it was 5:1 and in 2013 it was below 3:1 (2.8 I think). </p>
<p>So in 1940 you had 150 people paying for the care of one person, by 2013 you had three people paying to care for one person. </p>
<p>Why? Well life expectancy for one. In 1940 the average age before death was UNDER 65. Today it is closer to 80. Simply put, most people never collected from social security in 1941 since they died. Now you are expected to live 15 years collecting payments!</p>
<p>That kind of system is unsustainable. We either need to have more payers, or extend the benefit date to 80 for the system to work the way it was written. </p>
