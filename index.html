Well those 8-10 slices would probably end up costing the company maybe 2 dollars total. So, they are still making a profit on you. Maybe less of a profit on you in particular, but still a profit. And even if a few people are able to pack away enough to outpace the profit margin, the vast majority of people will not, and that more than makes up for the outliers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the current comments about pricing to the average appetite, buying in bulk, reducing the number of dishes and the rest are all correct. One factor not mentioned here is psychology. A well run buffet is really carefully laid out, and every dish and decoration is there for a specific reason: to get you to eat more of the cheaper ingredients.</p>
<p>First thing you see when you get to a typical buffet? Soups (one of the great &quot;trash disposal&quot; dishes), breads, and a salad bar and/or cold veggie dishes (sometimes cold meat dishes as well, but these tend to be &quot;trash disposal&quot; dishes like terrines). These cost pennies and fill you up fast. </p>
<p>Next up? The hot food. The meat dishes (the expensive stuff) will be displayed REALLY well, as that has been shown to discourage a lot of people from &quot;ruining&quot; the display by taking a lot, and they are surrounded by really delicious carbs and veggies. Effect? You take a lot of side dishes, and little meat.</p>
<p>Also, if the designer/chef is doing it right, clearly visible is going to be a bright and attractive dessert area. This adds the &quot;I've got to save room for dessert&quot; element which again reduces how much of the expensive main dishes you consume.</p>
<p>When you finally get to desserts you are full of soup, bread, salad and hot veggies. The desserts are all cut really small so you feel like you are getting a ton of dessert by picking 5 different kinds, but they actually only equal one normal dessert. </p>
<p>Lastly, the restaurant (as mentioned elsewhere) does mark up drinks way more than standard, but the will make sure that your water is full all the time. You take a sip? A waiter is there filling it up. Water makes you feel full faster, and makes you eat less. They want you drinking as much water as possible (assuming you aren't buying their overpriced drinks).</p>
<p>There are a hundred other little tricks that chefs use (directing your eyes using garnishes to dishes that cost less, using bone-in meats to increase the apparent volume of your food while reducing prices, using dishes that have lower-cost ingredients, saucing everything they can, etc) but those are the main ones. You couple that with clever pricing and knowing the average consumption and buffets can make you a killing, and tend to have way higher profits than plated restaurants.</p>
<p>Even those of us who consider ourselves to have a huge appetite, the likelihood of you actually costing the restaurant money is really low (at one place I worked, it would take 7 full plates of food to hurt us at all, and whenever someone managed it, they were such an outlier as to not matter at all to the bottom line)</p>
<p>The one thing that could potentially cost the place money? Time. Restaurants live on the fastest turnover of seats possible, and buffets tend to get people to linger. That is why you will never see a buffet without a time limit. That is not to stop people from over-eating, it is to get them out the door so another paying customer can sit in their seat.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose you order a spicy tuna roll at a typical Japanese restaurant. The raw ingredients are probably $0.50 - yes, sushi-grade tuna is expensive, but the amount in a single roll is tiny. Most of what you're paying for is the time for the staff to take your order, for the sushi chef to individually prepare your roll, and bring it to your table, then adding it to your bill, and everything else that goes with table service.</p>
<p>At a buffet, the chef is making dozens of spicy tuna rolls at the same time, which is far more efficient. They may even be using a machine to help make the rolls more quickly. They're probably also using lower-quality fish, so maybe $0.35 for the raw ingredients and a tiny fraction of the human labor. There's no table service and everyone pays the same amount so paying for your meal is very fast and efficient.</p>
<p>Finally, all-you-can-eat restaurants know that not everybody eats the same amount. Perhaps they lose a bit of money when you come in to eat, but if you like it a lot, maybe you bring your friends and many of your friends don't eat nearly as much so the restaurant comes out ahead on average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Brushing too hard, or with a hard bristle toothbrush, won't damage enamel (the outer, protective layer of the teeth).  It's simply too hard of a material.  It CAN however, damage the gum tissues and/or the cementum (a much softer layer that covers the root surface) of a tooth.</p>
<p>Brush too hard =&gt; damaged gums =&gt; recession =&gt; exposed cementum =&gt; damage or removal of cementum =&gt; sensitivity, root surface cavities (BAD!!)</p>
<p>For healthy individuals during a cleaning, yes the hygienist or dentist is carefully removing calculus/tartar  (not scraping off enamel as op suggested) from the teeth.  Even with these instruments, it is very difficult to damage the enamel.  </p>
<p>For individuals with periodontal or gum disease, they often already have recession and exposed cementum (from the bone loss, recession associated with periodontal disease) and yes, we can do damage.  In these situations, we will use an ultrasonic scaler to remove the calculus rather than scraping the teeth to avoid damaging these tissues.  </p>
<p>TL: DR - just use a soft-bristle toothbrush, or even better, use an electric toothbrush that tells you if you are brushing too hard</p>
<p>EDIT: calculus = tartar </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of misinformation here</p>
<p>As many have said, the key factor here is frequency. If you had your teeth scraped with the metal instrument (periodontal scaler) twice a day every day, you would see damage. Dentists and hygienists are trained to scrape your teeth to remove calculus or tartar from your teeth but minimise damage to the tooth structure as well. </p>
<p>Now where people seem to be getting confused: the damage that hard toothbrushing can cause. Hard traumatic toothbrushing can cause damage in two ways: to the gums and to the teeth. Hard toothbrushing can risk damaging the gums and cause recession (shrinkage of the gum away from the tooth). Bleeding from the gum is very rarely a sign of excessive toothbrushing and more likely a sign of gum inflammation (gingivitis or periodontitis). If you have persistent bleeding from your gums, you should have them checked by a dentist to assess for the cause. It's worth noting that aggressive toothbrushing can damage the gum, but not cleaning the gum margin risks gum problems as well. Remember, what you are trying to remove (plaque) is actually soft and so doesn't need to be scrubbed off. </p>
<p>Now unlike what many people are saying here, hard toothbrushing can cause damage to the tooth structure as well. The most common area to see this is around the necks of the teeth (where the tooth meets the gum). This is because the enamel (the hardest structure in the body) ends around this point and so is less resistant to wear. This is called toothbrush abrasion. Look it up if you want to get an idea what it looks like. Enamel is much less likely to be worn away with a toothbrush but if the enamel is softened with acid either from the diet (fizzy drinks or citrus drinks) or from the stomach (reflux) then a toothbrush can wear the enamel away too. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The answers here are incorrect. Mass is <em>not</em> in general conserved, only energy is. </p>
<p>Since you are releasing energy, the mass of the products is lighter than the mass of the reactants. This is because to release energy, the potential energy of the chemical bonds must have decreased. This is the same as a decrease in mass, since E=mc^2</p>
<p>Now you may ask if E=mc^2, then why is the mass not the same if the energy is the same? It's because E=mc^2 is only true for a object at rest, ie not moving. In general, there are other terms that contribute to the energy. A photon, for example, has energy but no mass. When you burn something and release heat, you release it as thermal (kinetic) energy and light. These forms of energy do not contribute to the mass of the system; only the chemical potential energy in the matter does. This has decreased, so you have decreased the total mass of the system. </p>
<p>That said, the change in mass is negligible. C^2 is really big, so it takes only a tiny bit of mass to release a lot of energy. For most reactions you can ignore it and assume the mass is roughly the same. But it is important to remember that it's not the same in theory.</p>
<p>Edit: I have a degree in physics. Of course I could still be wrong, but I doubt it. If you disagree with me, please explain why. But don't just downvote an answer because it's different from what you learned in your grade 11 chemistry class.  </p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass–energy_equivalence" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass–energy_equivalence</a></p>
<p>The important phrase is </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chemical</strong>, nuclear, and other energy transformations may cause a system to lose some of its energy content (and thus some corresponding mass), releasing it as light (radiant) or thermal energy for example. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit 3: I'm also kinda wrong. As many have pointed out, the answer depends on how you consider the question. First, do you mean weight, relativistic mass, or invariant mass? Second, do you consider the box to be your system, or each molecule to be a separate system, and add the masses of them all? Roughly speaking, do you mean the mass <em>of</em> the box, or <em>inside</em> the box. I assumed op meant the sums of the invariant masses of each molecule, in which case the mass is not the same. The invariant mass of the box as a whole does not change, nor does the weight of the box or of the particles inside the box. I'll leave my answer up since the other answers were right for the wrong reasons, but keep in mind that while my explanation is correct, the result might be wrong depending on how you consider the problem</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As others have pointed out, only energy is conserved not mass, but the change in mass is usually imperceptible. </p>
<p>I've done a calculation using the famous E=mc^2 for how much mass you would need to get the energy released by burning a kg of paper. In reality the change of mass to energy isn't occurring as directly (the energy comes from breaking chemical bonds), and there's probably a lot more going on making my &quot;calculations&quot; totally useless, but anyways... </p>
<p>If we suppose that a we get  30000 kJ of energy burning a 1kg of paper (using approx. numbers for 1kg of coal from <a href="https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kgSKE-to-kJ.html" target="_blank">here</a>) and we use the rearranged formula m=E/c^2 we get the number 3.338 *10^-10 kg or </p>
<p>0.3338 nanograms, which is basically nothing :)</p>
<p>This is how much mass you would need, if you could transform it directly to energy, but again the real process is probably a lot more &quot;messy&quot;, making concrete numbers useless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sail is a lifting body, like a wing. As long as the sail is in the right position it will generate lift; or create lower air pressure on the outside of the sail than the inside. When this happens the sail will, like an airplane wing, move towards the low pressure side. This creates movement, just like it does in an airplane. </p>
<p>The reason the sailboat moves forward instead of moving towards the lifting side of the sail is that the sail is connected to the boat, and the boat is in water, and the water has much more resistance than the air. So, the shape of the hull transfers the lifting force of the sail and turns it into forward motion. </p>
<p>So, a sail is basically an airplane wing that's vertical instead of horizontal, and the sailboat hull is the tool that transforms the sideways pull of the sail into forward motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>IN short - as is noted, the sail acts like (is) a wing, as air moves across it it generates LIFT ( a force).  This is NOT the same as being &quot;pushed on&quot; by the wind, as many people think how it works.</p>
<p>The Lift (force) of the wing is perpendicular ( right angle) to the wing, and a portion of this force is in the forward direction of the sailboat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say your car is facing (and being pushed) East, but you want to go North.</p>
<p>You can turn your steering wheel to your left, which is North in this case. Your car will turn, and its existing speed/momentum will carry it North. </p>
<p>In fact, if you turn just a <em>little bit North</em>, that force pushing you to the East will continue to speed you up. If you were facing completely North it wouldn't have any effect since it would try to push your tires sideways. But if you compromise you can travel Northeast, while you're being pushed East.</p>
<p>The part of the picture you're missing is that boats have a &quot;grip&quot; on the water that lets them convert a force (or momentum) in one direction to another direction. It's much like car tires which roll forwards, but don't slide sideways. This has to do with their hull design.</p>
<p>So the sail itself, despite all the complexities, is <strong>not</strong> pulling them forwards. It's mostly pushing them sideways. But the hull converts that into forward motion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you asking specifically about how &quot;square&quot; sails work, rather than about how sails work in general?</p>
<p>If so, then the important thing to understand is that square sails are not kept perpendicular to the direction the ship is moving in all the time. That's just their center position, which might be used if the ship is sailing directly downwind. However, if the ship is sailing across the wind, the sailors will rotate the horizontal beams the sails are attached to (the &quot;yards&quot;) around the masts so that the sail is at an angle to the wind, generating forwards thrust. <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6e/11/f5/6e11f56313294ef7a3cc350a075fc38b.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a photo I googled up of a square rigged ship with its sails quite clearly angled.</a> The wind is clearly coming from the other side of that ship.</p>
<p>A lot of nautical jargon from the age of sail (which we'd probably think of as &quot;pirate talk&quot; these days) had to do with the specific details of how to manipulate the sails of a ship. Each rope and each part of each sail and mast had a specific name, so a captain could order the sailors to adjust the sails exactly how he wanted them.</p>
<p>For example, to rotate the sails the way I described above, each yard has a line running from each of its ends towards the rear of the ship (either on the deck or, for the upper yards, on a mast further back). Those lines ares called the &quot;braces&quot;. Each one will have its name qualified by the side of the ship it's on and the yard it's attached to. So a specific one would be called something like the &quot;starboard main top brace&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i'm probably wrong on a lot of this, but my amateur understanding from sailing is that sailboats all have what's called &quot;keel&quot; (on smaller boats it is removable and usually called a &quot;centerboard&quot;)  - this is essentially a part of the boat that extends below the waterline to a significant degree. it's not as tall as the sail is, it's probably usually about 1/4 of that height.</p>
<p>what happens is the wind pushes on the sail, which is attached to the mast, which is attached to the boat, and makes the boat tilt away from the wind. but the keel in the water resists this tilt due to the weight of the water acting upon on it. Since the force being applied to your now unbalanced craft must be vented somehow, this results in lateral motion (with relation to the wind)  of the entire boat. </p>
<p>since you've also got a &quot;bow&quot; (front) and a &quot;stern&quot; (back) on your craft, you're making it easier for the boat to go laterally in one direction than the other (ie, &quot;forwards&quot;). stick a rudder that can move back and forth on your stern and now you can steer the thing.</p>
<p>you can sail with the wind behind you, but you won't go as fast as you can when sailing &quot;sideways&quot; in what is essentially using the boat (sail/mast/keel system) as a <em>lever</em> to amplify the power of the wind. of course, you cannot sail directly into the wind, and so much of the skill in sailing is figuring out how to arrange your course (in a zig-zag) such that you can arrive at a location that might be  upwind of your starting point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you do have a dimmer switch and it allows some amount of current through in the off position (might be defective/damaged/not quite pushed all the way off) then it could be producing the interference.  Most dimmer switches work by very rapidly flickering the power going to the light.  Current running through a wire produces a magnetic field, an amplitude fluctuated (flicking the power on and off very quickly) magnetic field is an AM (amplitude modulation) radio signal, thus when the dimmer rhythmically interrupts the current it produces a weak AM radio signal.  The reason the interference would clear up when you turn the light fully on is that the current is no longer fluctuating, the magnetic field is steady, and so it no longer interacts noticably with the radio.  Credit to <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/dimmer-switch.htm" target="_blank">http://home.howstuffworks.com/dimmer-switch.htm</a> for filling me in on dimmer switches.</p>
<p>I can imagine a defective or damaged regular switch creating the same power flickering effect in the off position, never providing enough continuous current to cause the bulb to heat up enough to glow, though I'm not sure how specifically that might happen.</p>
<p>tldr: a bad or broken dimmer switch can turn your wiring into an AM radio transmitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a long shot, since we know nearly nothing about your wiring.<br />
Every conductor carrying a voltage is an antenna.  So is the wiring in your house.<br />
The length of the antenna has to be adapted to the wave length (and therefore the frequency) of your signal.  E.g. a 100Mhz signal has a wave length of 3 meters.  ( Wavelength = speed of light / frequency ).  Antenna length like 1/2 wavelength, 1/4 wavelength also work well.<br />
.<br />
My guess is that the length of a wire in your house matches to the wavelength of your am radio. The wire is a weak antenna, but it's close to your radio, so it can distort the signal enough to create interference.<br />
As soon as you turn on the light the switch closes and increases the &quot;length&quot; of the wire, increasing the length of the antenna.  The interfering signal cannot be transmitted well be this &quot;new&quot; antenna -&gt; the interference is gone</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All wires act as antenna. When those wires pick up a signal that you want, it's a good antenna. When they pick up signals you don't want it's a bad antenna.</p>
<p>{And when wires are run near each other then they act as transformers, which is, for the purposes of this discussion a kind of antenna as well, except it picks up power.}</p>
<p>Most of the time we don't notice this antenna effect because our equipment has been designed and built with these effects taken into account. A good radio appliance will filter the power <em>and</em> the ground and do its best to isolate the receiver and amplifier circuits from the power lead effects.</p>
<p>It appears your radio... not so much on the filtering.</p>
<p>Others have mentioned crappy dimmers.</p>
<p>But in truth a wire connected at one end and not at the other is very much what most antenna are. Further long wire that is disconnected at one end, connected to ground at the other, and connected to a radio receiver right next to where it's connected to ground, is a very good antenna indeed.</p>
<p>So if the ground in your house is less than optimal, and your radio doesn't have good power lead filtering, and your light is off, and your radio and light are very close to one another electrically (like on the same trunk of the ground and maybe the same electrical breaker, which is highly likely) then when your light is on the closed and energized loop of current is a bad antenna. But when the light is off, the long lead up the ground, through the light, and back to the switch is a pretty good antenna.</p>
<p>If there are crappy things generating electrical noise in your house, like &quot;electrostatic air purifiers&quot; or old televisions, or dirty motors in old refrigerators... or if there are high energy things near your house, like weather and local industry, the effect will be amplified.</p>
<p>As an experiment I'd suggest getting a cheap surge suppressor/filter (e.g. like a computer &quot;power strip&quot;) for the radio to see if that cuts the noise.</p>
<p>There's an entire topic about &quot;transmission line effects&quot; that people make their career specialization in electronics. It's full of this sort of thing, and how to stop minimize this sort of thing.</p>
<p>The exact cause in your exact case can not be told with certainty from the information you've provided. But chances are it's just &quot;hey this long wire that doesn't go anywhere right now when the light is off is a bonus antenna that my cheap radio doesn't know how to cope with.&quot; And a cheap surge suppressor might be enough to fix it.</p>
<p>Worst case you've got a bad/corrupted/crappy ground in your house and you are far away from the neutral on the power pole, so fixing your situation would require getting an electrician to come in and wire a ground spike or three (the dryer your climate the more/longer the spikes needed) into your wiring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>remember there is <em>no such thing as absolute speed</em> - <em>except for the speed of light</em></p>
<p>things only move at some speed <em>relative to an imaginary reference point in space</em></p>
<p>for example, how fast are you moving <em>right now</em>?</p>
<p>you're sitting in an office chair, so your speed is 0, right?  only relative to the ground</p>
<p>the ground is actually spinning about the Earth's axis, so that's your actual speed, right?  only relative to the axis</p>
<p>the entire Earth is flying around the Sun, so that's your true speed, right?  only relative to the Sun</p>
<p>the Sun is circling the galactic core at tremendous speeds (dragging the Earth and you with it) so finally we've found your true speed?  only relative to the galactic core</p>
<p>the entire galaxy is hurtling through space, dragging with it the Sun, which is dragging the Earth, which is dragging you, so there is our true speed?  only relative to other galaxies nearby</p>
<p>our local cluster of galaxies is moving together through space.  but only relative to some other cluster of galaxies.</p>
<p>there is no &quot;center&quot; to the universe, there is no fixed reference point anywhere, so if I fly <em>away</em> from the galaxy at some tremendous speed, then the galaxy <em>seems</em> to be moving faster.  but if I move <em>within</em> the galaxy at the same speed, then that galaxy <em>seems</em> to be stationary.</p>
<p>we can define the &quot;center&quot; of the universe as any arbitrary point, and all the math still works out the same.  if we want, we can make our galactic core the &quot;center&quot; of the universe, and then all the other galaxies are flying away from us.  or we can make our Earth the &quot;center&quot;, or any other galaxy - it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>if we calculate the speed our galaxy is moving relative to the closest galaxy, then we are moving at x km/s.  but if we calculate the speed of our galaxy relative to a galaxy 4 billion light years away, then our speed is x + y km/s.  which speed is our &quot;true&quot; speed?  both.  neither.</p>
<p>when you understand the idea that <em>all ideas of speed</em> are <em>relative</em> and, in a real way, <em>imaginary</em> and that <em>everything is moving</em> and <em>nothing is moving</em> all at the same time, then it will start to make sense to you why the &quot;speed&quot; of the object emitting a photon has no effect on the speed of the photon itself.  you might say that object is moving at 1,000 km/h, another person might say 1,000km/s, and another might say it is stationary.  the object has no true, absolute, speed.  </p>
<p>in a way, you can think of photons <em>as the only things in the universe that actually have a true speed</em>!  from a photon's &quot;perspective&quot; <em>everything is moving at the</em> <strong>same</strong> <em>speed</em>, which is <em>not moving at all</em>!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Speed is defined as distance (space) divided by time.  If the speed is held constant, that means something <em>else</em> must change for the emitter as it moves.  In this case, Einstein realized that both space and time must change instead.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no they wouldn't.</p>
<p>The long answer is a bit more complicated. Basically one of the implications of Einstein's relativity is that light is moving at the speed of light, relative to everything, all the time. Trying to explain why that is the case is like trying to explain why gravity exists, some things are just rules that exist in the universe.</p>
<p>The reason this is even able to happen is because of time dilation. Which is a science term for saying the faster something is traveling relative to you, the slower it's clock appears to be ticking.</p>
<p>There's actually quite a lot to unpack from that last sentence, I'll try to explain some important points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The only speeds that matter in the universe are relative speeds, so the speed of one object compared to another. There is no universal reference point, or grid that you can use to measure an absolute speed relative to empty space.</p>
</li>
<li>Time dilation doesn't make sense in respect to your everyday experiences of Earth. Why should time move slower if you are going faster? At the end of the day the fact that light is always moving at the speed relative to everything means it has to exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the equation for velocity is: velocity=distance/time</p>
<p>The equations we came up for time dilation are a result of the fact that light needs to be moving at the same velocity, relative to objects that are moving at different velocities. The only way that can happen is if distances between you and everything else change as you move faster, or if time does.</p>
<p>Obviously distances don't larger between you and something as it moves faster, so the rate at which time flows must.</p>
<p>Working on the assumption that light moving at the same speed all the time is just a fundamental fact of the universe, we can do a little visualization of why time dilation works (and why it's only really noticeable at high speeds/relativistic speeds/&gt;~60% speed of light).</p>
<p>Imagine there is a spaceship with a photon of light bouncing between two mirrors placed on the floor and ceiling of a spaceship. You are standing on earth, when the spaceship isn't moving (relative to earth) there is no time dilation (not entirely true because gravity, but we can ignore that here). At that point from the perspective of you and someone of the ship, the light is moving up and down, the exact same movement for both observers. When the ship is moving however, this changes.</p>
<p>To the person on the ship, the photon is still traveling straight up and down. But to you, it is moving in a zigzagging pattern through space. This is because it is both bouncing up and down, and in a ship that is moving forward. Because the speed of light has to be constant, something has to change here, since the photon is traveling a longer distance in the same amount of time. The distance it is traveling won't shrink to compensate (the ship doesn't get smaller, well not really anyway), so instead time has to pass more slowly from where you are observing the ship in order for the speed of light to be constant. </p>
<p>For example, if the ship was moving at half the speed of light, the photon would be bouncing at 45° angles from your perspective, and time would be moving at 87% of its normal speed relative to you in order to compensate.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note here is that you are moving more slowly relative to the people on this ship too. Which sounds like it shouldn't be able to happen, but the difference in time is made up when the ship decelerates back down to your speed. This is getting into general relativity though, which is beyond me, I have only learned special relativity so far, which in relativity for objects that aren't accelerating (or decelerating). General relativity covers acceleration and its effect on time.</p>
<p>TLDR: Relativity is weird, and light is always moving at the speed of light</p>
<p>And as a side note, I hate you for being on the front page, I love talking about physics, but I spent way too much time typing this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are certainly differences in perceived loudness of given stimuli between animals, but that is not necessarily tied to ‘better’ hearing. Hearing can be ‘better’ or ‘worse’ in many ways. In terms of the evolutionary advantages of hearing, detecting very quiet sounds, subtle differences between two detectable sounds in both frequency and intensity, and the range of frequency response of the organism are quite important. A given stimuli evoking a ‘louder’ percept is probably much less important. However, an animal with lower absolute thresholds for hearing sounds (that is, they can hear very quiet stimuli) would also typically have lower pain thresholds at a given frequency (suggesting, though not definitely demonstrating, that they hear it as ‘louder’). </p>
<p>If you are interested in more detail, especially links to more reading and thoughts on some of the methodological intricacies that would enable answering this question more definitively:</p>
<p>Loudness is a psychological phenomenon that can't be measured with nearly the sort of precision as sound pressure level (in dB) or sound intensity (in pascals or other units), but there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics" target="_blank">psychophysical</a> studies quantifying loudness using self-report, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold" target="_blank">detection thresholds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain" target="_blank">pain thresholds</a>, and many other methods. In humans, these methods can yield well-characterized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" target="_blank">equal loudness contours</a> that describe the relationship of loudness and sound pressure at various frequencies.</p>
<p>While the self-report measures of many psychophysical studies may seem 'soft' as a metric to many scientists, they are extremely well-studied and, while much noisier than most methods of 'harder' sciences, highly reliable if done properly. In non-human animals, this practice can be significantly more difficult. Typical methods include using response latency (or reaction time) as a substitute measure for loudness, which has been shown reliable in some studies like [this one]( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4955967" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4955967</a>). There is also [a fascinating study]( <a href="http://asa.scitation.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/doi/10.1121/1.3641449" target="_blank">http://asa.scitation.org.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/doi/10.1121/1.3641449</a>) on dolphins that trained the animals to discrimate sounds based on loudness. </p>
<p>Using methods like this, one could operationalize the definition of ‘better’ hearing (for example, lower absolute threshold at frequency X), you could quantify relationship between that definition of good hearing in different species capable of being trained to discriminate loudness, and then see if that measure of ‘good’ hearing correlated with hearing sounds of a given sound pressure level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually has to do more with physics. 'Loudness' can't exactly be measured as it is a unique experience to the individual. What can be measure however and is often what certain animals have over humans is the ability to detect different levels of Hertz (Hz). Humans hear the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz, while dogs as an example hear from 67 to 45,000 Hz (or 45 kHz). Dog whistles are just above human hearing at about 23,000 Hz to 54,000 Hz (Which is why some don't work: dogs can't hear them too).</p>

For most animals there is a clear breeding season mostly visible by color change and/or smell change in one or both sexes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an anthropologist, I’ve always thought the answer to this stems from one of our closest evolutionary relatives, the Bonobo.  Bonobos are also sexual throughout their entire lifespan, and juvenile sexual “play” happens quite a lot.  Like us, Bonobos have sex frequently, in a variety of positions, engage in homosexual behavior, and seem to enjoy themselves quite a lot.  However, <em>also like us, sex seems to serve a different purpose in Bonobo society than pure reproduction.</em>  In Bonobos, it functions to soothe aggressions between individuals.  Someone’s upset? Have sex with them.  Want someone’s banana? Don’t just take it and beat them up, have a little sex with them.  Infant is fussing? Masturbate them a bit to calm them down.</p>
<p>Flip to humans.  We also engage in a diversity of sexual acts (unlike other primates), and sexuality also serves a different purpose in our society than just pure reproduction.  It’s not mitigate aggression, but it probably evolved in its current state to form bonds between two individuals or a group of individuals (not saying that’s how we always use it, but that’s probably what it evolved for).  </p>
<p>In short, in evolution, moving sex out of a purely reproductive context has had all sorts of downstream effects, including high levels of sexuality, even when reproduction is taken off the table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I think one needs to unpick several assumptions about sex to find an answer.
Couldn't all creatures be called 'sexual' because of reproduction? When does the sexual nature of animals start and finish? Does life span play a part? What about social taboos and the effect of sexual practice? Does level of consciousness play a part on sexuality? Do animals in the wild have different sexual drives to human animals? Would we behave more animal like if our society was different? Why are we more organised and discreet about sex compared to animals on the wild? Do survival and hygiene have anything to do with our sexual behaviour?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, having an erection or being <em>capable</em> of climax is not the same as 'being sexual'.  Some of that is just &quot;being biological&quot;.</p>
<p>That aside, we can imagine all sorts of benefial aspects with regards to survival of humans.  Firstly, we used to die a lot younger so being sexual all your life likely connected a lot more to the time period when you could reproduce.  That's probably pretty important!</p>
<p>Additionally, maintaining familial bonds - of which partner-sex is a part - has probably been beneficial to survival of family and community and a key advantage the world.</p>
<p>For me, the ability to continue to provide sperm as long as possible has also probably been better than an alternative - more sperm supply = good (old man sperm! yay!).</p>
<p>There are monkeys that have casual sex and that have non-reproductive sex, child &quot;sex play&quot;, and post menopausal sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read that the ability to have sex all year long, which is especially special for human females, makes it possible for a female and a male to stay in a relationship for a while, which increase the probability of survivance for their child. Since males are using less energy to have babies because to make them it only really requires to have sex, while for females (at least for most primates) it involves pregnancy and nurturing the baby, it makes males more likely to try to have more sex than females. As human's evolution made them more and more social animals and smart, it increased a lot how much care a human needs to fully grow up. It then became less good evolutionary wise for males to just have tones of babies. So females ended up evolving to have sex all year long, which is kind of an evolutionary compromise since males already had those genes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>why are we also capable of sexual activity well past our sexual prime?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For males, it's simply because since they don't loose a lot of energy, it's just more worthy to take a chance to have a baby, even if there is less say 1 chance out of 10 that he doesn't survive. Most animals actually can reproduce all their adults life, and if they can't, they die really soon after. There is little evolutionary reason for an animal to survive if they don't reproduce. </p>
<p>For females though, the question isn't really why they can have sex, but more why can't they actually reproduce? Or why didn't they evolved to have more ovules? Enough till they die? Well, a teacher of mine said that it's because since it takes so much care for humans to raise babies, it's evolutionary more worthy for females, once old, to take care of their grandchildren more than having a baby on their own. For an old woman, having a baby on her own would mean both big probability to have a sick baby (since older people have bigger chances to have an unhealthy baby) and big probability to don't have that many years to take care of it too, since they can get sick, and/or die since they're old. So, as their grandchildren are also their own DNA, it's worthy.
Then, why is it like that for females, more than males? Because females are always sure it's their own children and grandchildren since they get pregnant. While males sometimes, raise some other's man children, which means that them taking care of &quot;<em>their</em>&quot; grandchildren must be less worthy than keep trying to have children on their own. </p>
<p>(P.S. sorry for the poor English.)</p>
<p>Tltr; humans take so much energy to raise that it's more worthy for people to have just a few and to actually make sure they fully grow up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

First of all it needs to be established that, despite what people say, 4chan is heavily liberal. That's a fact. However where it gets confusing is in defining Liberal. 4chan subscribes to classical liberalism, which is essentially freedom above all else. And that is 4chans main driving force (or was, some say it became to moderated so 8chan became a thing, but that's besides the point). However done confuse that with being altright. There is a large socially right wing faction on 4chan (different to economically right), which opposes socially progressive.</p>
<p>As to how this happened, it is partially due to simple politics. To understand 4chan you must understand it's antithesis, Tumblr. Tumblr represents the far left side of the internet (socially speaking) where as 4chan are the far right. This is largley why 4chan and Tumblr are what they are, they stand tonoppsoe each other. That is not to say that they could not exist without each other, however they both grow due to their reactions with each other, and both attract people who oppose what the other site believes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>4chan is likely not significantly more conservative than other social media platforms,</p>
<p>The right are more vocal than the left, or at least they are recently. 4chan gives equal footing to all posts, where on reddit and Facebook there is an echo chamber effect, meaning if you're not a trump supporter, you're generally less likely to see pro trump posts.</p>
<p>/pol/ is the alt right board of 4chan, and they have a tendency to post political posts on other boards such as /trv/, making them seem more numerous than they really are. If you want to see more left oriented discussions, check out /news/.</p>
<p>I'll also point out here that the lack of an echo chamber means the alt right is challenged on their beliefs on 4chan, where on reddit and Facebook they spend their time constructing strawmen.</p>
<p>In short, 4chan makes it easier to make more noise as one person, but demographically, 4chan is likely not much different than reddit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are ever more boards, but /b/ is still /b/ and /v/ is still /v/ and so on.  Some people come and go, however, the general place stays the same.</p>
<p>When the whole &quot;Anonymous&quot; hacker thing happened nothing changed on 4chan.  It was still the same groups of people hanging out there that had always been there.  With the creation of a collective name though it gave a small sub-set of people an easy way to coalesce.  Suddenly 4chan hacker &quot;Anonymous&quot; became a thing everywhere even though it was no more or less of a thing on the site than it had been before.</p>
<p>The only thing that has changed on 4chan is the creation of the term &quot;alt-right&quot;.  Now all the little bigots have a common name to collect themselves around.  With a name, cause, and rules they seem like a bigger group to outsiders.  To those of us who have been there a long time it is the same group as always.  No more.  No less.</p>
<p>Honestly, if somebody came up with a name for it you could just as easily make 4chan out to be the home of an open progressive sexuality movement.  An active /lgbt/ board, /soc/'s nebulous sexuality, and /b/ &amp; /v/ love of transporn would make the perfect examples.  Just give it a good name to gather around and watch it take off as the next group defining 4chan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This was the genesis of modern shitposting. On the /b/ forum, which famously has no rules except &quot;Don't post anything illegal,&quot; ironically posting racist shit became a fun thing to do, but even on /b/, at the time, far-right bullcrap was the subject of mockery. See also their raid on white supremacist talk show host Hal Turner.</p>
<p>The original owner of 4chan, created /n/, a board for discussing news and current events. Stormfront, a racist website that /b/ would often raid at the time, moved in and started posting unironically. The board was closed, and eventually reopened as /pol/ and /int/ - Politically Incorrect and International. Stormfront returned and continued to be awful. This time they weren't stopped, because it was funny, at first, to see white supremacists from the previous generation being all &quot;HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDS, THE BLACKS SURE ARE UPPITY AREN'T THEY HA HA HA.&quot; It became less funny when they snared angry young people that were better able to fit in and spread their toxic beliefs to other popular, loosely-moderated boards like /v/. This eventually resulted in shenanigans like gamergate.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting a lot of different answers here, and most are correct but people here are talking about cash donations.  There's another big type of donation that rich people make too and that's in illiquid/non-marketable assets such as real estate and/or shares in private companies.</p>
<p>The ELI5 is a little difficult, but the gist is that for private companies, getting a 'value' is about 99% art and 1% science.  Accounting is a lot more assumptions and guess work than people would like to publicly acknowledge.  </p>
<p>So what an individual can do is offer to donate, say, 10% of his company to a charity.  Let's say that the company did really well last year so that guy can easily find an accountant to say that 10% is worth $10M. So the guy has a $10M tax deduction he can use as he sees fit (subject to AMT and other shit, but you get the point).  The guy also knows that last year's performance was a blip and if he repeated that 10% donation this year, he'd only get a valuation of $5M.  In effect he's got an extra $5M from the valuation.  </p>
<p>When I was younger, I was on the young alumni board for the university I went to for undergrad and we used to see this all the time.  Someone would donate property/illiquid securities/art/etc with an 'assessed' value of (say) $10M, but when the school went to sell it, they'd only realize (say) $3M in cash.  But the guy would still get to keep the $10M tax deduction. To a guy like that, a $10M tax deduction could be worth $4m to $5M easily.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're wondering, and yes this is in that 'gray zone' that's just millimeters from being tax fraud.  However, the IRS rarely pursues these cases 1) because they are <em>really</em> hard to win, 2) the school doesn't really care b/c they still just got a $3M donation, and 3) the school isn't going to 'help' the IRS (beyond bare minimum compliance) b/c the school would have to give up the $3M.</p>
<p>A similar, but different, application of this idea is where Mitt Romney reported a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/whats-really-going-on-with-mitt-romneys-102-million-ira/261500/" target="_blank">$102M IRA</a> by having accounts toy with the value/valuation of the assets within the IRA.  There's no reasonable way you could ever get that much into an IRA....unless you got your accountants to depress the value first then re-value later.</p>
<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> I'm getting a lot of questions about how this worked for Romney.  Here is a <em>purely hypothetical</em> example based loosely on when Bain Capital took out Domino's Pizza that I put in a lower comment - I'm putting it here so more people see it:</p>
<p>I'm going to make up the exact numbers, but this is the mechanics: Romney had a type of retirement account where you could but $30K cash per year in the account tax free. He also had a private equity firm invested in private companies.</p>
<p>Romney took $30K cash, put it in the retirement account each year - tax free. Each year, his accountants would say, 0.X% of your portfolio companies is magically equal to $30K, so Romney would take the $30K cash in the tax-sheltered IRA and buy 0.X% of his companies personally. He did this for about (I think) 15 years. After a while, he converted it to a ROTH IRA meaning that he'd pay a small one-time tax hit but withdrawals are tax free.</p>
<p>Later on, his private equity company would sell the individual companies that it owned (or take them public). When they were sold, Romney would recognize the gain BUT it was now within the tax-sheltered IRA he'd pay no taxes and because he converted to a ROTH IRA, he pays no taxes on withdrawals. Genius.</p>
<p>Here's a sort of hypothetical example. In 1998, Bain (Romney's PE company) bought Dominos Pizza for $1.1B. They probably used a standard PE structure meaning that they borrowed $1.0B and put down cash for $100M. So the company is $1.0B debt and $100M equity. Romney puts in $30K each year to buy some of Dominos ($30K/$100M = .03%/year). He buys .03% per year, for a total of .45% of Dominos after 15 years. At this point, he converts from a traditional IRA to a ROTH IRA paying roughly $100K in taxes ($450K in contributions multiplied by his tax rate at the time of the conversion - maybe a little more or less than $100K, but in the neighborhood).</p>
<p>Then they take Dominos public, which they did. Dominos is worth $10B as of right now, so Romney's 0.45% of Dominos would be worth $45M. <strong><em>All completely tax free</em></strong> because its in a ROTH.</p>
<p>In reality, he has an IRA worth $102M, so my example is off by about half, but you get the basic mechanics. The IRS looked at it and said it was aggressive but not illegal when he ran for president in 2012.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of things to consider here.  I can tell you how <em>I</em> manage this.  But...firstly, yes...in the end if how you receive &quot;value&quot; is cash-this-year then keeping it rather than donating it almost always better.</p>
<p>Couple o' things I do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>donating appreciated assets vs. cash.  If i have a stock that is worth $100,000 more than when I bought it, I could sell it and pay taxes on that 100k and then donate it and get a tax-brackets-worth of deduction (plus this income will influence my tax bracket potentially).  But..if I donate the asset I avoid the taxes associated with that 100K appreciation and then get the 100K tax deduction.  So...if that asset is the the thing I can live without this year I can give 100K by donating the appreciated asset vs. $60K if I sell, pay taxes on it and then donate it.  So...this strategy allows me <em>do more good</em>.  </p>
</li>
<li>I have a small foundation (which I've converted now to a much simpler donor advised fund that is easy and everyone should do!).  This allows me to donate money <em>when I have it</em>, but give it to charities <em>when I want to</em>.  This works by having the donor advised fund (or the foundation) itself be a charitable organization.  So...the tax deduction date/event is putting the money in that fund (you can never get it back).  Then you actually have the money distributed to charities when you want to.  For me this means I can support some organizations every year even though some years it's either less tax advantageous to do so (e.g. a generally down year) or I'm just not comfortable giving up the money that year.    </li>
</ol>
<p>(combine 1 and 2 together and what I generally <em>really do</em> is donate appreciated assets to my foundation / donor-advised-fund).</p>
<ol>
<li>There is &quot;soft value&quot; that comes from being able to make charitable donations.  These are undoubtedly create indirect economic return to the donor.  </li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the day, when people say they are avoiding taxes with charitable donations they are not keeping more money, but they are <em>controlling the use of more of their money</em>.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that you can't &quot;make money&quot; by donating cash and writing it off, though, as others have mentioned, donating other assets can result in a net gain.</p>
<p>However, there a few other circumstances where it make economic sense:</p>
<p>1) The donation gets you something that you would have purchased anyway, but now you can write-off the cost. Examples could be as small as swag from your local public radio station or as large as a year of tuition or even a building named after you. I'm not saying that people reap a profit from this, but they get the benefit (which may be worth alot to them) AND they get it at a reduced price because they can deduct it.</p>
<p>2) If they donate it to a non-profit which they control. They can then set their friends and family up as employees and pay the money to them and also write it off as a deduction. This happens pretty often with athletes and celebrities. Hopefully they are also doing some charitable good, but it's often pretty sketchy and there are some high profile cases where it looks like almost nothing charitable was happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, the average person doesn't really understand accounting/taxes that well and will just repeat information they don't understand. I've seen redditors downplaying donations to charities from wealthy individuals as if it's nothing because &quot;it's just a write off.&quot; </p>
<p>In general, when donating money or items you just reduce your income by the amount of money donated or the value of the item donated. If you made $10,000,000 in a year and donated $9,000,000 to charity during the same year, you'd essentially be taxed as if you made $1,000,000. Considering that someone who made $10,000,000 would only pay at most ~$4,000,000 in Federal Income Taxes on that amount, donating $9,000,000 to reduce your taxes by $4,000,000 obviously costs more than simply paying the taxes.</p>
<p>Additionally, lot of people here have already explained some &quot;loopholes.&quot; A couple I've seen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Donating a cheap piece of art and inflating it's value. This is 100% tax fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donating assets that have appreciated in value. E.g., you paid $1,000 for stock that is now worth $1,000,000. While this is a valid tax strategy, you are still not coming out ahead by donating. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donating shares of a private company (so the market value is unclear) and having an accountant inflate the value is also tax fraud. Just because the IRS won't go after you does not mean that something is &quot;gray area.&quot; </p>
</li>
<li>Donating $5 worth of clothes to Goodwill and saying you donated $500 worth is tax fraud.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not something the truly rich do, but us middle to upper middle class do this sort of thing:</p>
<p>If you are donating goods, say, used furniture, you can write off the value of the furniture.  The IRS does not question values under $500.  So, rather than sell that couch on Craigslist for $50, you donate it and write off some semi-realistic value close to but under $500 for it.  Tax on $500 of your income is more than the $50 you would have made selling it.</p>
<p>Bag of old clothes?  $5 at a yard sale or say $400 in reslae value donated and deducted.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Do this a lot, and you actually can save a decent chunk on your taxes, plus your donations can hopefully do some good.  You can donate items under $500 multiple times without proving value.  However, if you abuse this I'm sure the IRS will abuse you.  We do donate stuff probably 10 times a year as we tend to purge regularly and have a kid who outgrows clothes constantly.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I'm not advocating or engaging in illegal activity.  This is perfectly legal so long as you actually donate the goods, get an actual receipt from the charity, and deduct fair market value.  All of which I do every time.  There are plenty of tools out there to determine FMV if you cannot do so yourself or if you want to err on the side of caution.  </p>
<p>Further EDIT:  IRS Rules, specifically mentions the $500 thing on stating you need to file forms demonstrating value over $500 where appropriate: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
