		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gauss-Bonnet identifies a fundamental connection between geometry and topology. And, perhaps more crucially, between local properties and global properties.</p>
<p>In a sort of naive sense, topology is about ignoring geometry (topology is much more subtle and complicated than this, but roll with me here). Given a topology, what about a space/surface/what-have-you stays the same given continuous transformations, i.e. stretching and pulling and twisting? The classic example is recognizing that a coffee cup and a donut are the same topological &quot;shape&quot;.</p>
<p>Geometry is generally much more concrete. You're measuring angles and curves and distances, the properties of an immutable object.</p>
<p>What the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem is saying is that the total curvature--defined as the integral of the Gaussian curvature--of a surface is directly proportional to its Euler characteristic, which is basically the number of &quot;holes&quot; it has in it. The first is a geometric property defined locally. The second is a topological property defined globally. This is a kinda ridiculous connection because you can do <em>crazy</em> things to a surface with continuous transformations. Completely change what it looks like. But because the Euler characteristic is constant, the Gauss Bonnet theorem says that the total curvature won't change.</p>
<p>Intuitively this really just means that, no matter how you do it, continuous changes to the curvature of a surface will be balanced out elsewhere on the surface, so that the total curvature remains unchanged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason why Hydrogen has multiple energy levels in spite of the different energy states corresponding to the same two particles (a bound proton and electron). The wavefunction of the same three bound quarks can take on multiple excited configurations - the lowest energy for uud is the proton, the next highest is the Δ^(+), and then I think there are higher resonances also called Δ but with masses specified. The energy of the bound state gives the total state most of its mass (E = mc^(2)).</p>
<p>The Δ baryons have spin-3/2, so one way you can think of the Δ^0 and Δ^+ are as excited states of neutrons and protons respectively. This suggests a picture of adding the three spin-1/2 quarks up, and by the rules for adding angular momentum in quantum mechanics, you can either get total spin S=1/2 or S=3/2 with zero orbital angular momentum, and then whether an s-wave uud quark combination is a proton or Δ^+ depends on whether the spin is added to 1/2 or 3/2.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_spin_crisis" target="_blank">This picture is actually wrong though</a>, since quarks in a proton do seem to have significant orbital angular momentum and gluons apparently contribute significantly. So we have a very incomplete picture on how these quark wave functions &quot;look.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are suggesting tons of alternatives to your problem, but not actually answering the question. Here's why:</p>
<p>Youtube has a bunch of different product and engineering teams. Some work on the mobile app, and some work on the desktop/mobile web product. YouTube, most likely, gets different usage on both of these platforms, so the amount of engineers assigned to each of these platforms (in order to make updates on each of these) vary based on said usage.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are also &quot;endless&quot; amounts of fixes and feature improvements YouTube can make at any given time. As a result, these bug fixes and feature improvements need to be &quot;prioritized&quot; (i.e., ordered by priority) since YouTube doesn't have &quot;endless&quot; engineers to work on them. The feature of a &quot;minimized&quot; player on the web/mobile web platform of YouTube probably hasn't been prioritized for various reasons:</p>
<p>1) It's probably not that big of a use case, especially given all the alternatives people have mentioned in this thread</p>
<p>2) there are other important features/bugs the team needs to work on before implementing something like this.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants (and seeds) sense temperature in a number of ways, though it is not precisely known how seeds 'count' how many days/hours they've been at cold temperatures. However, as others have pointed out, t is known that plant hormones such as jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and gibberellins all play an important role in either inducing or repressing dormancy and germination.  </p>
<p>Some of the ways plants sense temperature changes may give us some clues as to how they might 'count' how long they've been at a certain temperature. For instance, plants actively adjust the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes to maintain fluidity and functionality of said membrane in response to decreasing (or increasing) temperatures. By decreasing the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids (i.e. adding more unsaturated fatty acids) the membrane will remain fluid at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>Now, if you think of a seed as a bank and each structure (organelles, membranes, etc) within the seed as a separate bank account, with transactions between accounts being represented by biochemical pathways and money being the separate chemicals and molecules involved in these pathways, it could be that by draining one 'account' continually over time (like the account that produces the precursor to unsaturated fatty acids) in order to increase the amount of 'money' allocated to another 'account' (the membrane), it could be that the plants eventually realize, &quot;Oh shit, its been cold a long time, maybe we should germinate the next chance we get because this really sucks.&quot;</p>
<p>On the note of hormones: they, like fatty acids, have to come from somewhere; often they have to go somewhere as well. Source and sink. So, if the enzyme that produces the hormones from whatever precursor molecules and the enzymes that move these hormones from the source to the sink are both more active at lower temperatures than the enzyme that senses this hormone at the sink, it's likely that the hormone will build up within that sink (a tissue, organ, etc). Excesses in certain hormones at a given location past a given threshold can lead to genetic reprogramming; it can turn genes on and off. So, if the sink enzymes are not active, and the concentration of the given hormone continues to increase over time, it could then activate genes that cause germination. On the other hand, if the temperature isn't low enough (and therefore the sink enzymes can effectively process this hormone in some way) or the duration isn't long enough (and therefore the concentration of the hormone doesn't reach a particular 'gene activation threshold') the genes may never turn on and lead to germination. </p>
<p>tl;dr No one really knows exactly how seeds do it, but hormones and membrane fluidity could be a potential signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Different kinds of plants have adapted differently. The ones that require exposure to prolonged cold before germinating appear to produce more of a plant hormone that stimulates germination when it's cold. There is presumably a threshold that allows germination to proceed in the right conditions after that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While some Christians prefer the King James translation of the Bible, there are many, many translations of the Bible in many different languages, made at different times. Christianity is a world religion, and has become very aggressive about translating its holy texts into whatever languages its people speak.</p>
<p>The original languages of the Bible are Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. What we call &quot;Modern English&quot; didn't exist until shortly before the time of Shakespeare - and the King James Bible. There are earlier English translations, but they're even more difficult to read for people nowadays.</p>
<p>The influence &amp; staying power of the King James Version comes from a couple of things: the translation was made after the invention of the printing press, so it was widely available. The translation was authorized by the Church of England, which used it exclusively, so anywhere that the C of E had influence, the KJV did too: it wasn't too long after the KJV was published that the British Empire circled the globe, bringing British culture and religion with it. And the KJV was, for its time, the best English translation available.</p>
<p>There are other translations of the Bible made about that time and later, but for centuries the KJV remained dominant for the reasons above. But languages change over time, and the meanings of words change. Eventually re-translation is necessary. The last century has produced a number of very good English translations now widely used by English-speaking Christians. (My favorite is the English Standard Version, first published in 2001.)</p>
<p>But because the KJV was the dominant translation for so long, its language has become entrenched in English-speaking society. And people like tradition. It feels weird to change how a holy text reads or sounds. People stick with what they know or what they're used to. Therefore the KJV is still around and will still be around for many years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>National Geographic <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/12/king-james-bible/nicolson-text" target="_blank">published an article</a> a few years ago, which speaks to both the poetics and the influence of the KJV on the English language. It's worth a read.</p>
<p>Curiously, there are some concepts that are holdovers from the KJV that are so ingrained in the Christian tradition that they've persisted into an era in which other English translations are preferred. For example, everyone knows that Moses parted the Red Sea, despite that this is evidently a mistranslation, and should be the &quot;Sea of Reeds&quot;. The latter could perhaps describe wetlands and tidal flats that would make more geographical sense.</p>
<p>Another holdover from KJV is that we largely still infer that Jesus was a carpenter, owing to the stated profession of his father. However, the word given for Joseph's profession is tekton, which is also used for stonemasons. The KJV translators were largely from Western and Northern Europe, and went with &quot;carpenter&quot;. </p>
<p>However, contextual clues would seem to suggest stonemason. Stories about Jesus routinely find him using analogies about building with stone. &quot;The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,&quot; although here, &quot;cornerstone&quot; may actually read &quot;head of the arch,&quot; which would suggest not only a stone analogy, but also an understanding of the construction of a Roman arch. There are metaphors about safe places to build, adding rooms to houses, etc, all of which were stone structures.</p>
<p>But, KJV established certain readings, and they outlive that particular translation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(wall of text incoming, but it's relevant to the question.. bear with me!)</p>
<p>In the early 16th century, the Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus tried to compile a 'New testament in Greek' as a comprehensive version didn't really exist and there were doubts about the quality and integrity of the few manuscripts that were available for study around that time. The New Testament texts had been written around 50-150 AD (as is commonly accepted) but around the 15th/16th century, most known Greek manuscripts were only a couple of hundreds of years old - anything older was either lost and forgotten in monasteries all over Europe, or worn out beyond use, or decomposed due to the age of the biological materials used to write on, for instance. </p>
<p>So, Erasmus studied the few manuscripts he could find and, in 1516, published the first edition of his New Testament in Greek - which became popularly known as the 'Textus Receptus' (TR for short) There were several revised editions later, as more/earlier manuscripts were found in monasteries and such and textual variants were discussed, accepted or rejected. For a long time, the TR was the gold standard of Greek New Testament - and it had a large influence on the KJV; the translators that made the KJV made extensive use of it. You could even say that the KJV is largely based on the TR!</p>
<p>Now - Erasmus lived in northwestern Europe. The manuscripts (parchments) he could study, came from the western church, via Byzantium (eastern Roman empire). In later centuries, howver, archeology and other research yielded many new texts for study, not parchments from the western (byzantine) tradition, but from sources in Egypt for instance: papyri, often much older than the parchments Erasmus had. Some of these papyri are dated to the second and third century AD, which brings ur much close to their time of writing, when compared to what Erasmus had to work with! These texts are sometimes called 'alexandrian' (from Alexandria in Egypt), to distinguish them from the western 'byzantine' texts. </p>
<p>Slowly but surely, the influence of these alexandrian texts grew. And newer compilations of a Greek New Testaments (such as Nestle Aland) which replaced the Textus Receptus, made good use of the more ancient alexandrian sources, with their own unique textual variants. This leads to textual differences with the Textus Receptus of course!</p>
<p>So how is this relevant to the usage of the KJV today? Well, most newer bible translations no longer use the Textus Receptus as source, but newer compilations such as the already metioned Nestle Aland. But, there is a specific subset of christians that do not accept the alexandrian textual variants as valid; they consider them corrupted by gnostic influences and/or other early heresies, or by theologians such as Origenes for example. These christians only want to use a bible translation that is based on the TR and that pretty much leaves you with the KJV only!</p>
<p>In Dutch, we have the 'Statenvertaling' bible translation, which was based on the TR and made in the early 17th century, and here, too, we have people who only want to read that one translation for pretty much the same reasons.</p>

<p>1) Is to be word for word as accurate as possible. You don't look at the context, inference, anything like that.  Tree = tree even if the description sounds what we would call in English a bush.</p>
<p>2) They try to figure out the idea they were trying to get across and use the best words in English to convey what was trying to be said, and that's what they translate it to.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Christian pastor, college prof, academic writer here. </p>
<p>The vast majority of Christians do not prefer the KJV over the translations in their language or ones that are more modern. </p>
<p>Some are vehemently opposed to anything but KJV, King James Only-ist, and they have been mentioned. This is rare but very energetic. I don't fight with them, I just tell them I pledge to obey and believe the KJV, too. They tend to be conspiracy theorists that think that other translations have been damaged. And 9/11 was an inside job. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned the Bible wasn't &quot;written&quot; but translated from manuscripts that came from real historical figures and groups.  These manuscripts number in the thousands, with many, many copies of each book spread all over the Ancient Near East, Egypt, Asia Minor. </p>
<p>That's much better than having one &quot;original&quot; manuscript as far as increasing or improving certitude. One &quot;original&quot; can always be faked. But thousands of almost identical copies spread over the known world can't be faked. Copies buried in a cave can't be faked. </p>
<p>So the KJV was translated from a group of manuscripts available during the 1600s that were pretty good, though not as good as the ones we have now, and that's enabled us to clear up some confusion about certain words--not teachings, not doctrines, just very fine adjustments in the precise word or semantic range of a word. So modern translations are generally better, although some have been influenced by modern gender-equity issues to make them neutralize pronouns and things like that--I'm not for it. If the Bible is a very male oriented book, then for truth's sake, make that clear in your translations. </p>
<p>But even then, we are talking about whether we use it or he. Not a big issue (except in Galatians 3-4). And then not a big issue except for scholarly types. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who says it's less painful? Posture issues aren't just due to not feeling like standing up straight. Your muscles work together and against each other to hold your body in certain positions. Poor posture habits tend to cause a muscle at one end of a joint to be overly tight, while a muscle on the other end to be overly relaxed. In trying to correct that imbalance by simply standing up straight, you're forcing the muscle that's so used to being relaxed to try to counteract the muscle that has been straining, which leads to pain and discomfort, so the person will go back to whatever poor posture position they were in that isn't uncomfortable. Over time, it starts becoming unbearable to just stand up straight, and requires a significant concentrated effort and constantly reminding oneself to manually fix their posture, because their muscles will force them into the poor posture position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you are experiencing back pain, a postural disorder MAY be to blame.

Standing with a slight curve forwards and back is better but it's something that many people naturally fight as they don't want to feel like their stomach is sticking out.  I had back problems for ages until I did some research and realized it wasn't that I was &quot;pulling it out&quot; every now and then it's that I had horrible posture while standing and sitting.</p>
<p>After some research I found the best piece of advice was to pretend you have a tail like a monkey, when you are standing or sitting you want the tail to be going back and up, not down. This forces you to tilt your hips forward and puts the rest of the spine in the correct position. </p>
<p>It was uncomfortable for a few days but once I got used to it the difference was amazing, I feel and look taller, I haven't had major back pain in years and the uncomfortable strain I'd get from sitting so long was gone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What makes these mushrooms easy to cultivate is that they are happy living in their preferred medium: soil for some, like the buttons or liberty caps, or on dead wood like oysters and shiitake.</p>
<p>Truffles are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza" target="_blank">mycorrhizal</a>, which means they are dependent on a symbiotic relationship with the roots of specific plants, in this case trees.  While we can certainly spread truffle spores in areas where the right trees grow, that relationship can't be forced, and it can take years for the mycelium to intergrow with the tree roots to the point that the mycelium is healthy and strong enough to fruit.</p>
<p>Even if this condition is met, most mushrooms require specific environmental conditions in order to fruit, so you've got to have the right climate, altitude, seasonal amounts of moisture, etc.  </p>
<p>This is the same reason that other mycorrhizal mushrooms like chanterelles are not cultivated on a large scale: they require very specific symbiotic relationships that cannot be forced or rushed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		</h2>
		<!--<span class="date">2017-05-14</span>-->

	</div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a guy on reddit who insists that the Lense-Thirring effect (L-T) somehow causes the orbital plane of a planet to align with the equatorial plane of the (rotating) star about which the planet orbits. Similarly, the orbital plane of a moon would align itself with the equatorial plane of its host planet, assuming the planet is spinning. He cites <a href="http://philica.com/display_article.php?article_id=281" target="_blank">this paper</a> to support his thesis.</p>
<p>From what I've read about L-T, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9704065.pdf" target="_blank">this is not the case</a>: the orbital inclination, or the angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane, remains the same. However, the orbital plane precesses about the axis of rotation of the star. And there's also nodal precession, too, but that also doesn't affect the angle of the orbital plane.</p>
<p>The one case where L-T <em>does</em> result in something aligning itself with the equatorial plane is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1975ApJ...195L..65B" target="_blank">in the accretion disks of Kerr black holes</a>: if (for some reason) an accretion disk forms that is out of alignment with a fast-rotating black hole, L-T causes the the orbital planes at different distances to precess at different rates, which causes shearing in the viscous mass of the accretion disk, and as the disk relaxes into a lower energy state, it will end up in the same plane as the plane of rotation of the black hole. But this is due to internal friction within the disk, and that is not a significant factor in ordinary orbital mechanics involving stars, planets, moons, and even rings.</p>
<p>Is he right, or am I? Or are we both wrong?</p>
<p>Edit: concise answers such as &quot;you are right&quot;, although appreciated, tend to be too short and will be pruned by automod unless there is some additional supporting argument. Let's not be lazy!</p></div></div>

<p>That is not a paper, that is a text published on something similar to a web forum, by <a href="http://philica.com/advancedsearch.php?author=4682" target="_blank">an author</a> who posted various nonsense articles there. Oh, and he is not a physicist, just in case you wondered. But he finished courses in college physics.</p>
<p>&quot;Your surgery will be done by our new surgeon. Don't worry, he never did surgery before, but he finished all his college biology courses!&quot;</p>
<p>Lense-Thirring does not change the inclination, and even the precession effect is negligible for the solar system. It is of the order GS/(c^2 r^(3)) where S is the angular momentum of the central mass. For the Sun and Mercury, we get a time scale of 100 billion years (<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+pi*((speed+of+light\)%5E2+*+(58+million+km\)%5E3\" target="_blank">calculation</a>)%2F((gravitational+constant)<em>2</em>10%5E41+kg+m%5E2%2Fs))).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm far from an expert, but I think the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon" target="_blank">the orbit of earth's moon</a> is inclined by 5 degrees to the ecliptic and between 18.3 and 28.6 degrees to earth's equator disproves that guy's theory.  Since the moon doesn't align with earth's equatorial plane, then the L-T effect doesn't require moons to orbit on the equatorial planes of their planets.</p>
<p>There might be something to the idea that the L-T effect caused the  early sun's accretion disk to orbit on its equatorial plane, which is why the planets tend to orbit very close to the ecliptic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently doing a masters astrophysics course where we touched on the L-T effect during a black holes module. I am inclined to agree that you are correct (in fact, your explanation is a nice clear one). </p>
<p>Though just to clarify: the L-T effect causes a precession of the plane of an inclined orbit, like a spinning coin on a table top. The inclination is affected by dissipation of energy in the disc (from different orbital radii precessing at different rates). In our coin analogy, though it is spinning, it only falls down because of friction dissipating energy.</p>
<p>So, the L-T effect may have had some impact in the early solar system with regards to the protoplanetary dust disc. But without a source of dissipation, the L-T can do nothing more than precess an orbit, not change the inclination. Does it precess the moon? Yes, it probably does on some level. However the masses of the Earth and the Moon are so tiny that the L-T effect may as well not exist (especially when compared with the much more important tidal forces present in planetary systems). </p>
<p>I've had a quick look through the first paper, and I don't really trust any of it at all. It doesn't seem to have been referenced by anyone and the whole thing seems off. The arguments they've used don't seem to add up either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not on the theory side, but there are plenty of known planets with orbits completely misaligned to their host star's rotational axes, with some proceeding retrograde. These orbits are very close in (orbital periods of days), where any GR effects are far stronger than the Earth-Sun system! The planets and stars are also old enough that they've had several gigayears to realign their axes through whatever mechanism you choose, but haven't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>By using the concept of frame-dragging force, we can explain many puzzles in our universe such as the formation of planet rings and the problem of angular momentum transfer in our solar system. It can also explain why our moon is moving away from earth.</p>

<p>Implies that there is actually an unanswered question of why or how angular momentum in some objects is converted to linear momentum in others. That's not true, it's a well understood mechanism that can be modeled based on the distances, rotations, and mass distributions involved. <a href="https://squishtheory.wordpress.com/why-is-the-earths-rotation-slowing/" target="_blank">Here is a decent overview</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How would you know that any given business was hiring illegal immigrants in order to boycott them?</p>
<p>1: There are plenty of people who are first generation legal immigrants, you can't go by appearance, language, or mannerisms.</p>
<p>2: companies hiring illegals tend to do so in to positions that are not exactly customer facing (ie: farming, janitorial work, construction, factory workers, etc.) so you probably wouldn't see them anyway.</p>
<p>3: Some illegals use falsified information to appear to be citizens, so even the companies don't necessarily know they hired illegals either.</p>
<p>If it ever comes in to the news that a company has been using illegal labor, it's usually as part of a story where they were caught and the government is either detaining the illegal immigrants for deportation proceedings, or investigating the company in question to see if they can be fined(or both) so there's little point in further punishing them via boycotts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
