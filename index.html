If it wasn't what they did for a living (i.e, smith, thatcher, cooper) it a reference to their lineage. Someone might introduce themselves as David, son of Douglas, son of Brian. This was the Irish tradition and O' meant &quot;grandson of&quot; while Mac meant &quot;son of&quot;. So David would be David MacDouglas or David O'Brian. However, David's son William would be William MacDavid or William O'Douglas. At some point where surnames had to be preserved to record family relationships for inheritance and the like, the name &quot;froze&quot; at that point and was adopted as a static surname for future generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Portable chargers and phones are not directly connected batteries. The portable charger has a boost converter, that takes the voltage (between 3 and 4v) from the internal battery(ies), oscillates it to create an alternating current that can be boosted in voltage using a coil, capacitor or both, and then it gets rectified back to DC at 5v (USB standard).</p>
<p>(edit: in a discussion below, I'm corrected: the current is not alternating, is in fact pulsating DC. And therefore doesn't get rectified to 5v, it gets smoothed to reduce ripple) </p>
<p>The phone, on the other side, takes the 5v from the USB input and steps it down to the required voltage to charge the internal phone battery. That varies according to the technology of the battery, the charge remaining in it, the charge speed the phone wants, and so on.</p>
<p>When you connect two batteries directly, yes, they more or less reach an equilibrium, because as the most charged one (higher voltage) recharges the empty one, its voltage decreases as the other one's increases. When there is not enough difference of potential (voltage, in other words) to make the charge flow from one battery to another, they reach the equilibrium.</p>
<p>In the portable chargers, the boost circuitry makes sure the output voltage is 5v as long as possible, of course by drawing more current from the lower voltage internal cells, because in both sides of the conversion circuit the power should be almost equal [ P = I * V ] (ignoring losses in the conversion). So the charger extracts more current from cells to generate those 5v the phone needs, and the phone as long as it haves the right voltage, can charge the internal battery, so eliminating the &quot;equilibrium&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people can give a more detailed and strict answer, but this is the way I get it.</p>
<p>PD: sorry for any mistakes, english is not my main language. Regards!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always find it easy to think of electricity like water. In this situation you have two pools, the portable charger and the phone battery. If your phone pool is low then the circuit board in the charger acts like a pump that takes water out of the charger pool and pumps it into the phone pool. This allows it to take all of the water out of the charger pool and put it in your phone pool. This fills up your phone pool even to the point of being fuller than the charger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of circuitry between the batteries that makes it all work.</p>
<p>As for the charged device, it's (most commonly) provided with 5V DC, whilst the battery tops out at 4.2V. There's charge-regulators between the 5V and the battery that makes sure charging stops when the battery is full.</p>
<p>As for the portable battery charger. Let's assume (for simplicitys sake) that it's a small one. It'll contain one Li-Ion battery that'll have 4.2V when fully charged, and 2.8V when it's practically dead.</p>
<p>Now, to charge the other device, it'll need to provide 5V. It does this through a &quot;DC-DC Boost converter&quot; which increases the voltage provided by the battery to 5V.</p>
<p>Now, this is not some physics-breaking EE voodoo. It's all about energy. If your device wants 1A current at 5V to charge, and your portable battery chargers battery is at 3V, the boost-converter will draw 1.666A from its battery.  (  5 <em> 1 = 3 </em> 1.666 )</p>
<p>This is of course assuming 100% efficiency, which isn't attainable. Most well-designed boost-converters are above 90% efficient though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna try and simplify things a bit here. These portable batteries, as correctly described in the other posts, has some circuitry that allows it to charge your devices. But the part of that circuitry that actually prevents the current from flowing in both directions, is called a Schottky diode, or blocking diode. It's like a one-way check valve and will only allow current flow in one direction. </p>
<p>This is actually what keeps them from reaching &quot;equilibrium&quot;. Cheers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all probes are crashed down at the end of their mission, and the crash itself is more complex than just getting rid of the probe. When they do crash a probe on purpose, it's often to collect new data that they could not otherwise get.</p>
<p>For Cassini in particular, they are planning what they call its <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/overview/" target="_blank">Grand Finale</a>. From now until September, Cassini will dive between Saturn and its rings several times, gathering data on those regions which we've never been able to explore before (and most likely sending back some <em>incredible</em> pictures of the inner rings and planet atmosphere).</p>
<p>On the final orbit, the probe will dive into the atmosphere of Saturn, sending back data on the atmosphere itself for as long as it can survive. At some point, the probe will simply burn up and disintegrate, much like a small meteor burns up in the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<hr />
<p>Other than gathering data on Saturn, NASA is also concerned that some of Saturn's moons - Enceladus and Titan - may contain organic life, even if just microscopic.</p>
<p>Similar to the Prime Directive in <em>Star Trek</em>, they don't want to risk contaminating those environments in the case that Cassini - after it spends all its fuel making orbit adjustments - crashes into one of them. So, disposing of the probe completely by burning it in Saturn's atmosphere is the safest way to prevent it from being a nuisance in the future.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it's nice to see NASA and JPL cleaning up after themselves. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Casini in particular was sent into the atmosphere of Saturn so that it couldn't accidentally contaminate any nearby moons potentially capable of harboring life. While it's pretty long odds that it would succeed to do so, destroying the probe in the atmosphere removes them entirely, and at the time the plan was to send future probes anyway that could take over the operation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>To rephrase: they try to get as many different data as possible, and during the crash (or in the period leading up to it) much unique data is returned. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The #1 reason is to preclude any possibility that Earth-based lifeforms on the probe itself contaminate a possible source of extraterrestrial life. Space probes like Cassini are sterilized to kill anything off before they are launched, and of course outer space is not very conducive to life. But there's no way to guarantee that <em>some</em> microbe won't manage to survive the trip. </p>
<p>Should we one day discover extraterrestrial life on Europa, or Titan, or Enceladus, it would be a major bummer to determine that such life wasn't extraterrestrial at all and had just hitched a ride on an old probe a few hundred years before. Even worse: our Earth-based microbes might kill off any extraterrestrial life before we know it's there.</p>
<p>We limit where probes land on Mars for the same reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

From my experience, the reality is that you never get a clean shave in a series of single passes no matter what blade you use. </p>
<p>In my case it takes multiple passes in different directions to get what I consider a clean shave. The first pass removes the shaving cream and some of the hairs and the lubricating strip ensures that the next pass glides smoothly. It also may have some impact on the angle of the cutting action. </p>
<p>Then consider that as the lubricant wears off the angle changes and the razor may not cut as well over time as the angles gets ever more flatter. How hard you press the razor into your skin may also affect the angle and at what angle you hold the blade may impact its effectiveness if the lubricating strip acts as a fulcrum to lift the blades away from the skin surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Example: A few years ago, my old public high school was awarded a $10,000 grant for general improvements. Rather than utilizing that money to repair sidewalks, renovate the 40-year-old bathrooms, or upgrading our library computers, they renovated the football field/track, even though our football team was second-to-last in the league.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Easy, the sports culture in the US grew up alongside the schools.  Have you noticed that sports around the world are centered around &quot;athletic clubs&quot; and such?  Well in the U.S., most began as high school and college sports and with no pro sports (apart from like golf, baseball and a few others) even the best athletes would quit after graduation.   The idea of serious athletes became culturally relegated to school age men and women until the 20th century, so naturally, the fierce regional rivalries that sports usually breeds, emerged in the high schools and universities in America, not clubs.  </p>
<p>Even when pro sports came of age, they paled in comparison to college atmosphere and energy for decades.   </p>
<p>The 20th century saw the Olympics and other international competitions take hold.  While other countries developed through sports clubs and creating &quot;Ministries of Sport,&quot; the United States had no need since, their schools were doing all the work already, and they were an instant heavy hitter on the international scene, dominating in a lot of sports.    </p>
<p>To this day, the US has never seen a need to develop the nations athletes any other way than using the High Schools as the prospect developer and the colleges are training centers.   This is hurting a few US sports, like soccer, where academies are only just now finally being built that train players much better than the NCAA.   A lot of Men's sports are suffering because schools are legally obligated to have an equal amount of male and female athletes.  Plus, the governing NCAA puts strict training hour restrictions on the athletes.  Which makes sense so a coach doesn't overwork an engineering major, but is bonkers for a US male gymnast who is going to the Olympics against a Chinese athlete who trains 10 hours a day. </p>
<p>EDIT:  I posted this in a comment but it's very topical here.   Stephen Fry described college sports as basically the most American thing to exist.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, other countries don't.</p>
<p>In other countries, sports are generally run on the 'pyramid system', which means that a team can advance into the league above by winning the league below.  Theoretically, any amateur team right at the bottom, even as a 'hobby team' has the potential to go right to the top.  As every community will have a team at some level, the local support tends to attach itself to this team (or the nearest professional team, or both) rather than to the local high school.</p>
<p>In terms of advancing to the professional leagues, individual players will often be signed up to the youth system of a professional club, so unlike the US, success at sport in the education system does not provide a direct pathway into the professional game, hence it has less consequences, even if the players involved are just as committed as in the US.</p>
<p>In the UK at least, university sports are taken more seriously than high school sports, and playing/training facilities are often very good, although large scale stadia as in US college football are unheard of as are the sums of money invested - again, this is because university sport does not generally form part of the pathway into professional sport.  </p>
<p>Certain events between rival universities may attract large crowds, but often that's related to the tradition of the event, rather than the importance of the event as a sporting competition, although the events may still be keenly contested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here in the UK it tends to be clubs outside of schools rather than the schools themselves. Schools have sports teams but usually limited to the popular ones, mostly football, cricket, rugby, netball and athletics. Fee paying schools will typically have different sports they have teams for in addition to the above.   </p>
<p>Anything who shows talent will often sign up to the youth team for established sports so if that happened in the US you would have the LA Lakers under 11 team for example, and it is at that level that the real competition exists. As there is no draft system it also suits the clubs as they can uncover and develop a potential £100m player without having to buy them from another club.  </p>
<p>I do like the school sport culture in the US though. Until you hit the big time the only people in the crowd will be parents of the players. Must be nice to run out in front of hundreds or even thousands of kids supporting you at that age. I used to be a mid-talent runner and was lucky enough to be cheered on by about 150 people once and that was amazing. I never won anything though but just having people cheer your name shaved half a second off each lap. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High School Baseball is still a thing in Japan and ridiculously popular. The annual high school tournament is broadcast live on TV and becomes a source of national pride from whatever prefecture they come from. Its called <strong>Koshien</strong> and the entire thing sweeps up the country like crazy. When I was in Okinawa, everyone was glued to the TV to watch a bunch of 18 year old kids slug it out on account of the fact the local team from that area got to the final.  </p>
<p>Football (soccer) less so, but they do broadcast the high school cup final live on TV as well. </p>
<p>Baseball in Japan is kinda fucked up though. The professional league loses a shit ton of money because they still run it like its the 1960's and don't understand the modern-age with slick marketing and whatnot. A big problem you have is that many of the kids at the high-school level get really bad coaches and they are often worked to death. Especially at Koushien. Matsuzaka Daisuke who latter played in MLB, once pitched 17 innings, as a high-school kid. Crazy. </p>
<p>The whole concept of sport-science, technical coaching, fitness etc is very low. And its all blood and thunder nonsense. This is why soccer is continuing to dominate because they take a 21st century approach and get in qualified coaches teaching kids and get them thinking like athletes at a young age. You don't get that in baseball. Its all tradition and bullshit.</p>
<p>In terms of facilities and spending, I really can't comment that much. But often I find that Japanese schools pay for a lot of shit for their kids. And they'll equally build an arts centre and baseball field as much as they do tennis courts and libraries. Its equal opportunity  spending all across the board if you go to a school which excels at pumping out gifted kids in whatever field.</p>
<p>I will say this though, they train like a motherfucker. 5-6 days a week. Very common for sports teams in Japan, even to the university level. Even if the team is shit, they'll still train. Its the whole 'ganbaru' - never give up bullshit which consumes the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, sports are seen as a (potential) revenue stream for the school if they can get people attending games, paying for tickets or concessions, bringing in grant money from organizations that do scouting, etc.</p>
<p>Often, the sports programs get more attention because the administration believes that money put in to the sports teams is money that they will see returned and able to be reinvested in other areas.</p>
<p>It's not always(or even often) a net benefit to the school to put that money in to sports, but it's something that has to be examined on a case by case basis for each school- if the school budgets in your area are a matter of public record, it might be interesting to compare sports spending to revenue from sports related sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>911 gets special consideration by the carriers due to FCC regulations.  This means a couple of unique things for 911 calls.  </p>
<p>First, even if the phone does not have a service plan attached to it, it can still call 911.  No service/no bill, doesn't matter, your phone is still allowed to make 911 calls.  Keep in mind though, that since your no-service phone doesn't have a phone number attached to it, if you get disconnected the 911 operator cannot call you back. </p>
<p>Second, no bars doesn't necessarily mean you can't call 911.  For most numbers your phone has a minimum threshold of signal required for it to even attempt to make a call.  If the signal is less than what would represent 1 bar on the phone's display, the phone won't try a call because it knows that it's likely to fail/cause a bad experience for you.  For 911 though that rule does not apply.  Your phone could have 1 of 10th of 1 bar worth of signal, and it will still try and call 911. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

the hardware required to make calls/get internet is already in the phone. the sim card is just the pay card to access that.</p>
<p>now the 911 call will just skip all that and directly connect to the services. afaik every carrier has to agree to let 911 calls through from anyone without charging or authentication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A completely deactivated phone still has the antenna and parts inside it necessary to talk to a cell tower.  When the phone talks to the cell tower, it provides its credentials, and the tower authenticates that your phone should be allowed to make calls.  This is checked when you try to make a phone call.</p>
<p>When you call 911, the tower sees that you are trying to call 911, so it skips the part where you have to authenticate your phone and are just let through to the 911 system. (or, rather, allows the call to happen, but it will still grab what information it can to identify you- which could become relevant they needed to trace you back- say if the call disconnected, or if you were making a prank call)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only thing preventing a deactivated phone from making a call is software, either on your end inside the phone or on the carrier's end in the network servers. The hardware is always there. Even actions like turning off the Wi-Fi radio or mobile data on an active device are all software commands that either tell the various hardware pieces to power down and not send data to the processor, or tell the processor to ignore whatever data is being sent to it from said hardware. Samsung forced a software update that locked out and bricked the Note 7s that people didn't want to turn in, preventing them from being used.</p>
<p>The always-on 911 feature is just software. If certain conditions are met, e.g. the phone is locked but you perform the correct sequence of actions to place a 911 call from the lock screen, the software will unlock and open whatever hardware has been deemed necessary to complete that call. This includes communicating back to the carrier's servers that the lock-screen-911 feature has been activated and the call must be allowed to pass through. The server will then make the necessary changes and connect the call.</p>
<p>If the signal is weak, it may be possible to reallocate power to certain hardware and/or software resources to try and internally boost that signal so the call can still be made. Since this extra power boost would drain the battery faster and is not necessary for the vast majority of regular calls made, it would not be made available outside of the 911-call-on-a-locked-phone scenario. But this would only work if there was a signal to boost in the first place. No signal means no call.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Gerrymandering for racial reasons has more case law and is more likely to be thrown out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that most of the comments here are in error. The prior Supreme Court cases have not ever found that partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional, quite the contrary. The only reason that the Supreme Court has found for overturning district gerrymandering is for racial reasons, and even then they are of two minds. </p>
<p>Consider a state that is 60% white and 40% black. What should the legislature of that state look like? If the two populations are evenly mixed, then every district will be predominantly white and they could very well end up with an all white state congress. On the other hand if there were some all white districts and some all black districts and the districts all had the same population, then the most likely outcome would be a 40% black and 60% white congress. Which is the most racially unbiased result? </p>
<p>So, gerrymandering is sometimes used to increase minority race representation in congress and sometimes it is used to decrease it. The Supreme Court generally finds as you might expect in those cases. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if a gerrymandering case is brought to the court that doesn't have a racial component, they have generally not heard the case, since there is precedent that partisan gerrymandering is not illegal. There is no obvious part of the Constitution that it violates. Sometimes a case might be partisan or it might be racial and they will hear those cases. </p>
<p>Some states have laws against partisan gerrymandering, which changes things. And it appears that public opinion on the matter might be changing which is forcing the SCOTUS to be willing to reexamine this precedent. For the first time in a long time the SCOTUS is going to rule on a case of strictly partisan gerrymandering this year. </p>
<p>TL;DR: partisan gerrymandering is mostly legal, but that may be changing, both at the state and federal levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a difficult thing to manage.  As a result of a Supreme Court ruling in regards to civil rights the states are not allowed to spread minority votes across district lines since it was determined that that doesn't give them a strong enough voice and doesn't allow them a united voice as well as the advancement of minority politicians in Congress.  The court actually requires states to intentionally create districts that have a majority population of minorities.</p>
<p>States largely complied.  But, as time has gone on people often believe that giving minorities their own districts actually hurts their political power because states put them all in their district, they get one politician and then the rest of the districts aren't a melting pot.  So now there is a push to try to prevent states from districting based on racial lines, but the Supreme Court has already required them to do this.  So it's a very fine balancing act the states have to go through, and in many cases they exploit the Supreme Court requirements/ruling to their political advantage.</p>
<p>And if you removed the racial districting you might actually lose minority representation in Congress in terms of number of minority Congressmen, which people don't want.  So gerrymandering is this strange mix of affirmative action for Congress and political gamesmanship to protect a party's numbers in Congress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And the federal courts have upheld this, I should add.
Here's the relevant Wikipedia source, if you'll accept this:</p>
<p>Other states including California, New Jersey and New York have opted to protect incumbents of both parties, again reducing the number of competitive districts. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Pennsylvania gerrymander[5] effectively cemented the right of elected officials to select their constituents by eliminating most of the grounds for disenfranchised constituents to challenge gerrymandered lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Person 1 makes $1,000,000 per year.  They spend 25% of their income on the necessities of life, like housing and food.  They spend some on car payments and other luxury items.  They spend $1,000 per month on food.  They save around 33% of their income for retirement.</p>
<p>Next is a person who only makes $20,000 per year.  They don't save anything, don't have a car and don't spend on luxury items. They spend $500 per month on food, 50% of their income on rent and the remainder of things like a cell phone and bus passes.  They have very little money leftover at the end of each month. </p>
<p>Now, each person gets a 10% raise. What happens.</p>
<p>Well, person 1 does not really change much.  They might make a special purchase, but chances are they'll just increase their savings a little.  This additional income does not provide person 1 with very much real world benefit in their day to day life (aka utility).</p>
<p>Person 2 on the other hand. They might be able to get a better apartment.  They might be able to get a cheap car or pay a back bill that has been eating them via interest payments.  Person 2 spends all their income on necessities of life, so additional income provides them with tremendous real-world benefit.</p>
<p>This same effect can be seen with even larger sums of money.  Say each of those 2 people got a windfall equal to 1 years salary.  If that happened to me, I could repay my credit cards and car payment and still have enough left over to have a downpayment on a home.  I'm living paycheque to paycheque and such a windfall would really change my life.  Someone who's already earning lots might just dump the whole amount into savings, or buy a better car or nicer house.  Not really life changing events, but still beneficial things. </p>
<p>So the less money you have, the more the next bit of money means to you.  Poorer people tend to spend more of their money on critically important things.  Wealthy people tend to spend more on those important things, but not as a percentage of their overall income. So additional income means &quot;less&quot; to a wealthy person than it does a poor person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first $500 toward housing is more useful/important because it determines whether you have a home or not; while the second $500 determines whether it's 1 bedroom or 2 and what neighborhood it's in; while the next $500 determines a second bathroom and whether the kitchen is from 70's or 2000's; at $5000 rent it's about ocean views or private tennis courts... at each level, the next set of dollars are less and less important to the basic role of housing and more about qualitative enhancements. So we tax less the dollars that determine whether somebody has something important to living or not, and tax more dollars that would otherwise go toward enhancing that thing, because it easier to settle for 4 bedrooms instead of 5 than to afford an apartment or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the more money you have, the less important any given dollar is. </p>
<ul>
<li>Person 1 has $5 dollars to pay for lunch. He pretty much have to spend all $5 and is left with 0% remaining. </li>
<li>Person 2 has $10. She could spend it all on lunch, but wouldn't <em>need</em> to; she can still get the same $5 lunch as before. She might splurge and get an $8 meal, but she'll have 20% of my money left over. </li>
<li>Person 3 has $50 and can afford to get anything he wants. However, even if he went nuts and spent 5 times as much ($25) on  lunch, he'd still have 50% of his money left over. He'd have 10x as much money as Person 1, but doesn't need to spend it all for lunch like the first person did. In fact, he could buy lunch for all three of them and still have money left over.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason that this comes up in tax policy is that it is easier to collect taxes from the last two people than from the first one, because those people have money that isn't <em>needed</em> for something. </p>
<ul>
<li>Taxing the first person $1 means that that person would have $1 for food; he'd go hungry. Taking any more in tax means that they'd be extra hungry.</li>
<li>Taxing the second person $1 means that her extra money is reduced by 50%. Taking any more would eliminate their savings or force them to get a cheaper lunch.</li>
<li>Taxing the third person $1 would reduce their savings by 4%. They'd have to take a lot more before he couldn't pay for his chosen meal. </li>
</ul>
<p>As such, it can be seen as more fair (or at least more effective) to tax those people who don't &quot;need&quot; the money than try to take it form those who do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Your mobile phone in your pocket is actually much brighter than the sun in radio waves. And if aliens were to look at our solar system in radio, they would see Earth as millions of times brighter than the Sun.</p>
<p>However the other responders are correct that if you look at the energy output from the sun, it is much brighter at higher energies of light. And these are far more dangerous. Apart from specific microwaves that excite water (in a microwave), the radio end of the spectrum is very low-energy and harmless. So while our devices are comparatively very bright in radio, they carry a tiny amount of energy and negligible risk to humans. With ~billions of people exposed to radio waves every day, it would be completely obvious by now if we had a problem.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Are artificial radio waves intense compared to the sun? Yes, they can be.</p>
<p>Are they dangerous to humans? No. They have very little energy and don't interact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Compare that to a cell tower. I had some issues finding exact figures, but most of what I saw points in the direction of cell towers having an actual radiated power output of 10s of Watt at the most. Unless you're climbing into one, you're only getting a tiny fraction of that power.</p>
<p>There's a reason why we make panels specifically to collect sunlight and not other types of radiation. And there's a reason we spray ourselves with sunscreen, but there's no anti-WiFi spray. What the Sun bombards us with is vastly more intense than anything our puny devices can produce. Not to mention that sunlight, being mostly visible light and infrared, with a hint of UV, consists of photons with higher energy than the RF radiation produced by electronic transmitters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That is insane nonsense.  As /u/Rannasha said, the rule of thumb is that when the sun is shining it hits every square meter with about 1000 Joules of EM energy every second.  Conversely, an incandescent lightbulb gives off about 5 Joules per second and a radio tower gives off about the same.  A Wi-Fi router gives off about 0.1 Joules a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since it hasn't been mentioned yet: Blackbody radiation.</p>
<p>There is the constant black-body radiation coming from the Earth, your car, your house, and anything else at any reasonable temperature.  Everything above 0K (ie, *everything) emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation with a distribution of frequencies related to their temperature.</p>
<p>The blackbody radiation is exactly what a <em>thermal</em> camera is measuring.  It identifies the intensity of the infrared electromagnetic radiation to estimate the temperature of the emitting surface.</p>
<p>When you see hot metal around 600^o C start to glow?  That's just where the blackbody spectrum has reached significant visible frequencies of light.  Light bulbs work off the same principle.  Fire does too.  The dramatic heat you feel from putting your face near a campfire, many times the heat felt from the Sun, is just some visible (and mostly infrared) electromagnetic radiation hitting you and warming you up.  Incidentally, the Sun is mostly all blackbody radiation too.</p>
<p>And microwaves are lower energy than infrared waves. Though really all non-ionizing radiation should be weighted roughly equally when measuring total power and estimating damage.</p>
<p>The levels of background <em>microwave</em> radiation now from cellular are probably higher than background levels.  But only because everything is too hot to give up significant microwaves.  They're busy spitting out <em>more</em> energetic infrared energy.</p>
<p>Not that any of this logic will do any good 'debating' with people who first established their opinion by a route other than logic.  Might help with your audience though.  The Sun is brighter than any city at night. And standing in the sun makes you feel warmer than standing in the middle of 50 cell phones.  Considering how poor of penetration all non-ionizing radiation has through water, everything gets integrated together as heat on your skin.  If these people fear electromagetic radiation, they're going to have to find a way to turn the sun off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There could easily be other environmental issues causing the link (herbicides used in right of way maintenance), but the amount of low frequency EM energy (enough to light fluorescent tubes) and ionization products is far higher than can be found in most other environments.</p>
<p>While high frequency EM radiation is more energetic than lower frequencies, we have also evolved to be resistant to EM fields commonly found in nature, even though they are relatively intense (sunlight). </p>
<p>There is some evidence to suggest that lower frequency EMF can interfere with the electrical and ectrochemical processes of living things under specific circumstances. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single transistor doesn't really allow you to do much, at most to take two bits and barely perform an AND or OR operation on them and only then if you're willing to throw in a resistor as well.  Lets say that you want to do somthing more complicated like add two 32 bit numbers.  The most transistor efficient way to do that without also adding resistors will take 16 transistors per bit or 512 transistors total.</p>
<p>But you don't want a computer that only adds numbers.  You want a wide variety of instructions you can execute, you want some way of choosing what instruction you execute next, and you want to interact with memory.  At this point you're up to 10,000s of transistors.  That will give you a computer chip with the sort of performance you would have seen in the 1970s but with somewhat faster clock speeds because of our improved ability to work with silicon.</p>
<p>Now lets say you don't want your entire operating system to crash when there is a bug in any program that you run.  This involves more transistors.  And you probably want to be able to start one multi-cycle instruction before that last one finishes (pipelining).  This might get you up to executing one instruction every other clock cycle on average.  That'll cost transistors as well.  This will grow your chip up to 100,000s of transistors and will give you performance like the Intel 386 form the mid 80s.</p>
<p>But this will still seem very slow compared to the computers we use nowadays.  You want to be able to execute more than one instruction at a time.  Doing that isn't very hard but figuring out which instructions can be executed in parallel and still give you the right result is actually very hard and takes a lot of transistors to do well.  This is what we call out of order execution like what the first Intel Pentium Pro had in the mid 90s and it will take about 10 million transistors in total.</p>
<p>But now the size of the pool of memory that we're working with is getting bigger and bigger.  Most people these days have gigabytes of memory in their computers.  The bigger the pool is the longer it takes to grab any arbitrary byte from it.  So what we do is have a series of pools, a very fast 10kB one, a slightly slower 100kB, a big 10MB one on the chip, and then finally your 8GB of main memory.  And we have the chip figure out what data to put where so that the most of the time when we go to look for some data it's in the nearby small pool and doesn't take very long to get and we're only waiting to hear back from main memory occasionally.  This and growing the structures that look forward for more instruction to execute are how computers changed until the mid 2000s.  Also going from 32 to 64 bits so that they could refer to more than 4GB of memory, the biggest number you can say in only 32 bits is 4294967296 so any memory location over that number couldn't be used by a 32 bit computer.  This'll get us up to 100 million transistors.</p>
<p>And from the mid 2000s to the mid 2010s we've made the structures that figure out which instructions to execute next even bigger and more complicated letting us execute even more instructions at once.  As we grow performance this way the number of transistors we needs grows as the square of the performance, on average.  And we've added more cores on the same chips letting us grow performance linearly with transistors as long as software people can figure out ways to actually use all the cores.  And now we're up to billions of transistors.</p>

<li>
<p>&quot;Instructions&quot; can mean a lot of things. Anything from adding two registers together, to doing complex DSP calculations, to reading from peripherals or memory, to all sorts of other things. Different processor architectures have different instructions, and a different amount of instructions too. More instructions means more transistors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of the extra transistors are logic to allow the processor to execute instructions more intelligently. This includes things like caching, pipelining, branch prediction, out of order execution, hyperthreading, and others. For example, say you get an instruction to request a value from a peripheral (say, a video card). You know it's going to take tens of times longer for the video card to respond than it is for you to execute another instruction, so you grab the next instruction and start working on it while you're waiting for the answer from the video card. Then when the video card responds, you stop what you're doing and handle the rest of that instruction. All the reasoning to juggle those multiple things, and know whether or not the subsequent instructions rely on the answer from the video card, and what order will be the most efficient to execute instructions in while still returning a correct answer, takes extra logic (transistors). And this (overly simplified) example is just one technique out of many that modern processors use to be more efficient in execution.</p>
</li>
<li>Big caches, like what other people said. Caches are places to store data and instructions so that you don't have to wait for the latency of the RAM when you're requesting those things from memory. At the speed processors operate at, the latency of RAM is actually very significant, and a big part of it is due to the physical distance between the RAM and the chip, that is, because nothing can move faster than the speed of light. So caches are smaller, superfast memory banks that are on-chip so they have lower latency. And the fastest kind of memory is transistors.</li>

<p>I am going to disregard some things you've asked, for the sake of simplicity, but here goes:   </p>
<ul>
<li>more parallel processing possible (more cores, multiple ALUs, [pipelines]

<li>more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache" target="_blank">cache</a> (faster memory access)      </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the transistor counts go up when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>change the 'word' size (eg: changing from 32-bit to 64-bit computing)</li>
<li>increase how much physical memory is supported by the CPU</li>
<li>add new instructions to the chip, such as: MMX, AVX</li>
<li>add new features to the ship (Integrated graphics)</li>
</ul>
<p>instructions also vary in turnaround time: <a href="http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf</a></p>
<ul>
<li>simple math instructions (such as adding/subtracting and bit shift operations) have a turnaround time of 1 clock cycles</li>
<li>complex math instructions like trig functions might take over 300 clock cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>what instructions are run can greatly vary the IPS amount</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
