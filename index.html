That means that a baby can only receive a heart from another baby - there's no room to stick an adult heart in. In these cases, yes, the organ does grow with the child. When they first started doing heart transplants, they weren't sure if this would be the case or if they would have to re-transplant every few years as the child grew, but it turns out that the heart will grow. The donor heart maintains its own DNA (hence the need for organ recipients to take anti-rejection medication for life), and would grow according to the donor's genetic makeup. That being said, the organ would also be receiving input cues from its environment (i.e., the recipient's body) that may influence how it would grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If an organ were to grow, I’d bet that organs from children transplanted into other children or adults would grow. I haven’t worked in transplant for a while, but they would occasionally get an infant (not alive) donor and take both kidneys to put into an adult on the transplant wait list. I would expect those kidneys to grow a little over time, but probably not reach the full size of adult kidneys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gauge symmetry is the ability to make a gauge transformation on some physical system, and have the system remain invariant under that transformation.</p>
<p>Classical electrodynamics is a theory of electric (<strong>E</strong>) and magnetic (<strong>B</strong>) fields. The behavior of the fields is encoded in Maxwell's equations.</p>
<p>You can define a set of potentials (φ and <strong>A</strong>) by <strong>B</strong> = curl(<strong>A</strong>) and <strong>E</strong> = - grad(φ) - d<strong>A</strong>/dt.</p>
<p>Since the electric and magnetic fields only depends on <em>derivatives</em> of the potentials, you can obviously shift any potential by a constant and the <strong>E</strong> and <strong>B</strong> fields remain exactly the same. This is the simplest example of a gauge transformation. In fact, there is an infinite family of potentials which will lead to the exact same fields, for <em>any</em> set of fields you can come up with. </p>
<p>Classical electrodynamics (Maxwell's equations) are invariant under all of these gauge transformations, so the theory has gauge symmetry.</p>
<p>Gauge transformations take on a slightly different meaning in quantum field theory, but quantum electrodynamics (a QFT describing charged particles and their interactions with the electromagnetic field) is a gauge theory.</p>
<p>Gauge transformations can be divided up into global gauge transformations, and the more restrictive class of <em>local</em> gauge invariance.</p>
<p>Global gauge invariance is the symmetry leading to conservation of electric charge in QED. Enforcing local gauge invariance is the motivation for the theory to have exactly massless photons. Experimentally, the upper bound on the photon mass is extremely small, so it appears that this assumption in the theory is indeed justified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a description of electricity and magnetism as gauge forces <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/60z871/what_are_magnetic_fields/dfbnx08/?st=j9hzln4g&amp;sh=f1dc5c94" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is actually similar to gravity warping space, but it warps something else called the U(1) gauge group. That's a fancy way of saying that there is some kind of circle attached to every point in spacetime (a point with x,y,z,t coordinates), and the points on each circle are connected to the points on the neighboring circles.</p>
<p>The simplest case is just having each point on the circle connected to the same points on the neighboring circles, but that's kind of boring. Instead you can twist these connections so that the points are connected to points slightly clockwise or counterclockwise as you follow the connections to nearby circles. Since there is a circle at every neighboring place in spacetime, you can choose a different way of connecting to nearby circles for every direction in spacetime.</p>
<p>The connections can also be twisted in a more interesting way. If you choose a point on the circle at one place, and trace a path through points on the neighboring circles, you can choose points on those circles that were connected to the previous points in an unbroken line. You can even trace a loop in spacetime that starts and ends in the same place. But surprise! You don't always end up at the same point you started with on the circle. This is called curvature, in analogy to the curved surface of the earth. If you drive 1 mile east, 1 mile north, 1 mile west, then 1 mile south, you won't end up exactly where you started because the earth is curved (take that flat earthers!).</p>
<p>The amount of curvature (how far off your point was from the point you started from) depends on which direction in spacetime you traced the loop. And if your loop goes a bit in the x direction, then a bit in the y direction, then in the -x direction, then in the -y direction, the amount of curvature you get is called the magnetic field in the z direction (as we can see, it would be more correct to say that it's the magnetic field associated with the x-y plane). And similarly, the electric field in the z direction is the curvature in the z-t plane (the t direction is the future, -t direction is the past).</p>
<p>So now we see why there are 6 components of the electromagnetic field. There's 6 independent ways of choosing a loop to go around, by choosing a direction x,y,z,t to start the loop from and a direction to end it with. Tracing the connections between the circles at the places along the loop brings you back to a different point on the circle, and you can use the curvature of these connections along these basic directions to figure out how different your point is for any loop you choose. The curvatures in the y-z, z-x, x-y directions give you the x,y,z components of the magnetic field, and the x-t,y-t,z-t curvature gives you the x,y,z electric field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is a gauge symmetry in this context? It's a way of relabeling the circles by rotating them by some amount (after all, what does the left or the top of the circle even mean here? What really changes if the labels on the circle get rotated?). A global symmetry would be rotating them all by the same amount, a local symmetry is rotating each one by a different angle (though it has to be continuous, if the circles are nearby then they have to be rotated by nearly the same angle). </p>
<p>The interesting part is that the connection between circles doesn't get changed by this symmetry transformation, since you can figure out an equivalent connection for the new circles by unrotating the new circle, applying the old connection, and rotating it back. This combined procedure defines a new connection for the new circles that contains all the same information as the old one, even though all the labels on it have been changed by the gauge transformation. The electric and magnetic fields (the curvature of the connection) don't change either, so everything still works the same with the new labeling, so it's called &quot;gauge equivalent&quot;. </p>
<p>Charges are a way of applying this gauge transformation to things other than the electric and magnetic field, so that even though they are interacting through these gauge forces, the gauge transformation keeps everything equivalent. To accomplish this, each charge has a &quot;phase&quot; that keeps track of where on the circle it is, and when the rotations get applied they get applied once to something with charge +1, twice to something with charge +2, or the opposite rotation gets applied if the charge is negative. </p>
<p>This is how it works for the circle group U(1), the gauge group of the electromagnetic field. The Strong Nuclear force is the exact same thing with the group SU(3), though the results are more complicated because it matters in which order the transformations get applied. That complication is the reason why gluons have color charge, as opposed to photons which don't have electric charge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Words are tough for this kind of stuff.  The most accurate &quot;word&quot; definition of a Gauge symmetry, with all math jargon stripped out, is probably not very illuminating: A gauge is a redundancy of mathematical description.  In a nutshell, the goal of physics is to provide a predictive (mathematical) framework that makes quantitative observable predictions that can be verified by experiment.  This means that the sole &quot;philosophical&quot; job of a set of mathematical equations that compromise a theory in physics is that they correctly output observable predictions.  But a key corollary there is that mathematical descriptions have a freedom of expression, because they may actually say more &quot;things&quot; than can be observed.</p>
<p>From this, &quot;the rub&quot;, as they say, is that it's possible for DIFFERENT equations, when the same observable inputs are given, to produce the SAME experimental predictions outputs, for all inputs.  This is not the same as saying you can have different equations that give the same VALUE for all inputs.  This isn't possible (or I suppose trivial, depending on perspective, f(x) = x is the same as f(x) = x + 1 - 1, which is the same as f(x) = x + 5 - 2 - 3 and so on).  However, if the ways those values are different aren't actually experimentally observable then it is possible.  The different equations give different values, but those values have a commonality that happens to coincide for all the stuff we can observe.  Thus, when this happens you are said to have a gauge symmetry, which as I said is a &quot;redundancy of mathematical description&quot;.</p>
<p>When you have such a redundancy one can then also think about concretely constructing a bit of math that allows you to transform one redundant set of equations into another, which is a gauge transformation.</p>
<p>Beyond this I don't know how much can really be said without going into math, but perhaps there's enough here to motivate the idea that when you find that this has happened there is an air that there is a &quot;hidden&quot; structure to the experimentally observable phenomena.  In a sense, a complete understanding of the phenomena does not just include the experimental prediction but also this redundancy which has a concrete mathematical form.</p>
<p>In fact, the mathematical nature of these redundancies and the transformations between them is such that it turns out to be a very powerful and useful way of both categorizing and GENERATING new sets of equations intended to match phenomena and, through extension, a way of understanding and categorizing phenomena themselves. </p>
<p>For example, let's say I'm at &quot;The Bar Between Spaces&quot;, an inter-dimensional, inter-universe bar where people who live in different universes with different laws of physics like to have a drink and talk and I'm chatting up T'ed from the Dark Dimension and I want to explain to him that in my universe we have these things called electric fields and magnetic fields and they are related to each other through these complicated Maxwell's equations where the vector curl of the electric field is related to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic field and the... and so on and so on.  What gauge theory tells us is that to make Ted understand this thing I actually DON'T need to give him so much information.  All I really need to say is &quot;In my universe we've got a field which has both U(1) and Poincare local gauge invariances&quot;* and we're done.  If he's smart enough, he's got the picture.  With just that he can go and derive Maxwell's equations himself.</p>
<p>That's the power of this &quot;gauge&quot; perspective on physics.</p>
<p>*I'm probably missing a requirement there, but you get the idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If something has gauge symmetry, applying some gauge transformation (which is not every kind of transformation mind you) does nothing to the physics. A field will have a Lagrangian that is invariant through a gauge transformation under certain Lie groups. This becomes important in the fundamentals of Particle physics, where gauge symmetries hold explanatory powers that range into how mass is generated, where gravity comes from etc. </p>
<p>Look up Noether's theorem, action of a Lagrangian of a free particle and the U(1) Lie group as a starter if you want to learn more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are actually better than mine; but if you want a more basic explanation, gauge is the same thing as scale or magnitude. Symmetry of gauge is a symmetry of magnitude of something, so if you change the absolute magnitude of something, and nothing observable changes, then it can be said to have a symmetry of its gauge. The classic example is voltage, because if you perform an experiment in an isolated lab, then raise everything in the lab by ten million volts and repeat the experiment, nothing will change. Therefore, it is said that the E field has a symmetry under transformations of magnitude, or gauge. It's the same thing as saying you can never say what the absolute voltage of something is, but you can define a difference in voltage. Lots of other quantities work the same way. If so, they have that type of symmetry. (Math people are getting ready to stone me for saying this all wrong, because they have a much more precise meaning.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Depending on what kind of metal it was he was jumping into.<br />
I know horror stories from working in the aluminum factory. Your body is 70% water, and when water boils it expands dramatically. So when the body goes under the surface of the metal and boils there, it creates a huge explosion of molten metal.</p>
<p>It happens very fast and it's probably one of the more horrific ways to die. Do not recommend. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I won't talk about this guy, because I think that is disturbing, instead I'll talk generally about what would happen if a person jumped into a crucible of molten steel. </p>
<p>The water will boil very fast, it only needs to be raised 60 degrees C to boil. </p>
<p>Iron melts at about 1510c, so there's a lot of energy there, but the thermal conductivity of the various tissues will limit how fast they will heat up. Bones are made of hydroxyapatite which boils at 1500c so it will need to be heated up quite a lot.  Molten steel can also be a bit cooler like 1370c, so it's possible that it might be cool enough that it wouldn't ever vaporize the bones. </p>
<p>Also recognize that people are way less dense than molten steel, so the guy is not going to drop into it, he's going to be essentially floating or standing on it. The air is a poor thermal conductor, so the rapid steam cloud would be made when the water in his body that contacts the metal surfaces becomes superheated steam, and heats up the rest of the water in his body, so it's his own water that is heating him up.  The person would essentially boiling himself. </p>
<p>The person would essentially burst, and wouldn't have much holding him together after that.  It's possible that parts would be ejected due to the pressure, but it's likely that it would stay together and the person would fall limp.  Any internal organs would rapidly boil away the water, and the pressure would force its way out of the spine and skull and any other enclosed space. Tendons would see their water boil out as well and the body would fall to the surface.</p>
<p>The bones would heat up quite a lot, and being that they are the only really stable structure in a person's body, everything would either be attached to the bones, attached to something fleshy attached to bones, or  else would fall and contact the molten steel.  This would carbonize and otherwise pyrolize everything, and anything not carbonized would oxidize in the presence of oxygen.</p>
<p>You'd likely be left with the bones, parts of them would be charred where there was carbon left on them, parts of them would likely be white where the steam cleaned them.  They would be brittle as the cellulose has broken down, but the hydroxyapatite would still be there so they would remain solid.  You would likely have to raise the temperature and wait longer to see them fully incinerate. </p>
<p>There would be remains, but the person would die nearly instantly as the water would very quickly create superheated steam, and the steam would heat up the rest of the water in the person's body which would also boil and do the same.  It would be very dangerous for anyone nearby.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The temperature difference between the molten metal and your body would be rather large, making it so you don't immediately sink into the molten metal, just float on top of it as your body's temperture gradually changes to become similar to the excessively high temperature of the molten metal. Oh, but while you do 'float' atop the molten metal, you would also experience excruciating pain of the heat burning everything that is your body, as well as allowing on-lookers to to gaze in bewilderment or avert their gaze as your die in horrible pain. </p>
<p>In terms of the final output (the input being the molten metal and you), it would be mostly just metal. All your body would have burned up into the air as ashes before coming into direct contact with the molten metal (sorry no statue of you upon your demise). The solidified metal would most likely be the only thing that could be considered your 'remains'*, and wouldn't be used for it's intended purpose due to ethical reasons. Still would be a pretty metal way to go though.</p>
<p>*My middle school science teacher told us a story of how his old employer's company had an incident where a guy accidently fell into a vat of molten metal. They buried the solidified metal of which he died in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two parts. First I should explain 'allergies'.</p>
<p>Allergies are when your immune system recognizes a foreign object that is not harmful as harmful and attacks it - producing symptoms ranging from a stuffy nose to lethal amounts of fluid in the lungs, depending on how big a threat it thinks it is.</p>
<p>1) People can become allergic to something when, completely randomly, one of their immune cells 'suddenly sees it' and becomes activated, eventually resulting in many more immune system cells that all see the foreign object as harmful. This is also how an allergy can get worse over time - constant exposure to some allergans can cause more and more anti-allergan immune cells to be produced, causing a bigger and bigger effect every time you are exposed to the allergan.</p>
<p>2) People can become gradually non-allergic to something (or rather, their immune system response becomes muted) by exposing them to very gradually increasing doses of the allergan. This causes their body to kill off some of the anti-peanut or whatever cells over time as the body does have ways of shutting down a mistaken response.</p>
<p>2.b) People can become suddenly non-allergic to something in two ways - </p>
<p>1) Nuke the immune system from orbit, it's the only way to be sure. You can go through some surgical/cancer procedures that require your immune cells be killed off completely - often they will manage to kill off every single one that produces that allergan's antibody, rendering you no longer allergic to it. Then you die unless you get a bone marrow transplant. Measles has also been know to reset allergies by resetting the immune system. </p>
<p>2) Your body randomly kills off all the anti-allergan antibody producers on it's own. It 'suddenly sees' that they are attacking self and kills them all off.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, man! Finally my time to shine. </p>
<p>Background: I administer skin prick allergy tests and  mix/administer immunotherapy under the guidance and supervision of a physician. I AM NOT A DOCTOR.</p>
<p>Allergies come from your body encountering something and misidentifying it as a threat. Your body raises the alarm any time this allergen is encountered and sends in the troops to eliminate it. Unfortunately for you, it results in a variety of symptoms. Itchy/red/watery eyes, runny/itchy nose, rashes, migraines, sinus pressure or congestion, etc. are all common.</p>
<p>Immunotherapy, in this case allergy shots, helps to reduce allergies by introducing small, precise doses of allergens to your system. Over time the dose is increased to keep building your body's tolerance to the substance. Eventually, your body stops going &quot;red alert&quot; when you breathe in some Ragweed pollen because it's used to seeing it in larger amounts via the allergy shots. Typically, people have this reduction in symptoms for years. 3-4 years of allergy shots can lead to a decade or so of significantly reduced symptoms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies are often when the body mistakes a substance for an attacker and all the defense mechanisms kick in to try and defend you.</p>
<p>The immune system is complicated and evolves over time to adapt to the threats it finds, some allergies like hayfever can be both 'grown into' and 'grown out of' depending on what the individual is experiencing and eating. Other allergies are harder to shake or gain, as our body may find that substance vital or lethal depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>My hayfever centers around a kind of plant that grows near where my old school was, but nowhere near the town. So I seemed to 'grow into' hayfever and also 'grow out' of it, but really it was location driven. I'm probably still allergic to that plant, but it's pollen doesn't reach me anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another fun thing to think about, with people who seem to develop allergies later in life (but not the ones who have one that they grow out of)</p>
<p>There's a series of conditions that fall under mast cell activation disorders that are generally all progressive. </p>
<p>Basically your mast cells start to really inappropriately activate immune responses to the point that it seems you're allergic to everything, life itself, and it can get worse/intensified over time. So, you may have low grade symptoms as a child and seemingly be allergic to one or two things but then suddenly as an adult more body systems are more intensively involved so you seem to be allergic to more things that affect many areas of your body. It's not technically an allergy to one specific trigger but an overall overreaction of your body's immune system to the world around you.</p>
<p>This is a very newly classified set of disorders with names and diagnostic criteria only really established since around 2010. </p>
<p>There's a chance some percentage of the population generally classified with allergies actually have mast cell disorders. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Math is like a toolbox. Trying to describe parts of nature without math is like building a house with your bare hands. It can be done, but will take a very long time. </p>
<p>For both integrals and differentials it has historically been a matter of making calculations smarter, the same way tools have become smarter over time.</p>
<p><strong>Integrals:</strong></p>
<p>Say you're an ancient egyptian and want to build a house, and that particular house needs a curved gable. Naturally you want to know how much material you'll need for this gable. </p>
<p>An initial guess could be that you take the height of the gable, multiply by the width and divide by 2 to get the amount of material (similar to a triangular gable). But you quickly realize that this is not a very good approximation. </p>
<p>You then get the idea that you could divide each side of the triangle into very small parts, in the process getting closer to the shape of the gable by essentially &quot;rounding&quot; it. If you keep doing this you get to point where each part of your approximation of the gable is infinitely small. This is integration in a nut shell. </p>
<p>Say your gable can be described by the formula: f(x) = -x^2 + 2x.</p>
<p>Then the initial guess would give Area = (1*2)/2 = 1</p>
<p>Using integrals you get Area = ∫ (0 to 2) -x^2 + 2x = -8/3 + 4 ≈ 1,33</p>
<p>This is a simple example, but this could very well be how integrals first was applied in Ancient Egypt. No one knows for certain who first came up with the idea of trying to use infinitely small parts to calculate an area.</p>
<p><strong>Differentials:</strong></p>
<p>Like integrals, differentials are, simply put, a way of doing things smarter. </p>
<p>Differentials come from the idea that you want to measure the slope of something. </p>
<p>At first you might consider subtracting end and beginning to get the difference. But if you don't work with something that is a straight line, this will not tell you what the slope is at any point. To do this you have to divide that something into many parts, and now you can subtract two parts next to each other to get the slope there. The more parts you use the more precise it gets. </p>
<p><strong>Limits:</strong></p>
<p>Limits in the context of integrals and differentials are the concept of using smaller and smaller parts until you get to parts that infinitely close to each other. </p>
<p>Infinitely here just means as small as is necessary. If you for instance have the triangular shaped gable mentioned in <strong>Integrals</strong> it wouldn't make any sense to make parts smaller than each upper side of the triangle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An extremely brief summary would be like this:</p>
<p>If you look at the parabola y=x^2 +1 plotted on a graph, you'll notice that its not a straight line. </p>
<p>At first we looked at the average rate of change, e.g. if you look at the average rate of change between (0,1) and (10,101), we average a change of 10 units in y per unit change in x.</p>
<p>the formula for this was (f(x+h) - f(x))/((x+h)-x) where above, x = 0, h = 10. If we choose a smaller h, or a negative h, we can still determine this value. However, if we choose h = 0, we get 0/0, which does not equal zero, but we don't know what it is since we divide by zero. </p>
<p>So what if we choose something infinitely small for h, which is basically zero, what is that rate of change. What is the rate of change at that instant, or the instantaneous rate of change for x.</p>
<p>So if we plug that formula in with y= x^2 + 1, we find that it equals 2x. So the instantaneous rate of change at x is 2x for any point on that parabola. This is the basic premise for all derivatives is calculating the instantaneous rate of change for all points. </p>
<p>So there, we had to use limits to get around dividing by zero by dividing by almost zero, and we found derivatives.  </p>
<p>To come up with integrals, we used process similar to the following. If we traveled with velocity of 5m/s for 10 seconds, how far did we travel. Well if we graph velocity, and look at the area under that constant line of 5, we find 50 m/s*s or 50m which we know is correct. But what if we were not travelling at a constant velocity. well the logic still holds that its the area under the curve of velocity.</p>
<p>So if we use rectangles, one unit wide, each at the height of the velocity at the start of the rectange, we can approximate the distance. By using smaller rectangles, we can get a better guess. But what if we use Infinity rectangles, our guess would be perfect. So an integral is shorthand for the limit as we take an inifinite number of rectangles up to the curve from one point to another point, which happens to yield antiderivatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ancient Greeks had come up with the idea of infinitesimals, which are numbers so small that they can’t be measured. Essentially, they were mathematical placeholders. </p>
<p>The early inventors of calculus used infinitesimal changes in slope to define a function for slope along a curve (derivatives) and infinitesimal width rectangles to define a function for area under the curve (integrals.)</p>
<p>In the 1800s, mathematicians set about to define all of mathematics via rigorous proofs. When they got to infinitesimals, they could not find a way to work them into modern mathematics as they were essentially fudge factors. So they came up with the idea of a limit as a way to rigorously define infinitely small changes, and rewrote all of calculus to fit this new notation. </p>
<p>Then in the 20th century mathematicians finally found a way to rigorously define infinitesimals. But by that point limits were already the standard, so that’s the one that’s currently taught in schools. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The human cornea curvature varies, so contact lenses come in different parameters i.e. base curve and diameter to properly fit on the eye. This is why one brand can feel comfortable and another not, due to varying parameters and material. Doctors measure the corneal curvature to determine which base curve will best fit your cornea. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far, all societies have tended to reduce their population growth rate as they become more technologically developed and economically successful.  Likely reasons include better access to birth control (so having kids is a choice), better childhood health care (if your kids are unlikely to die, you don't need as many), and better retirement plans (so you're not dependent on your kids to take care of you when you get old).</p>
<p>Europe is a world leader in all of these factors, so it's no surprise that its population should be stabilizing more rapidly.  If you look below the continent scale, many individual countries also follow this pattern: the population of Japan, for example, is actually shrinking slightly.  The USA is an interesting case: while population growth is zero in large segments of its population, it has also historically had population growth due to immigration, and has many sub-populations where the factors I mentioned above (birth control, childhood health care, retirement plans) aren't easy to come by.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In the past, families would have many kids because it's likely that many wouldn't make it to adulthood. So families would have 8 or 10 kids sometimes. When medicine came around, it made it so many more kids live through adulthood and are able to reproduce. Instead of only 2 or 3 kids living out of those 10, 9 or 10 of them would. This causes a huge population boom after medicine is widespread in an area. After this boom, families start to only have, on average, 2 kids, which is exactly how many it takes to make a child, so population starts to level off. In areas where there isn't easy access to medicine, population usually climbs more so than being level.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main ways we've learned about the earth's interior is by studying Earthquakes. </p>
<p>Scientists have learned a lot about how vibrations (which is what Earthquakes are) travel through different types of materials (solids, liquids, semi-solids.)  </p>
<p>Imagine you take a big rock and put your hands on the side of it, while somebody else taps it with a hammer, you'd sense different things if the person tapped right next to your hands, or if they tapped further away, or if they tapped on the far side of the rock.  If your hands were really sensitive, and you kept a detail of what you felt, you'd learn a lot about that.  Then imagine doing the same thing with different materials, maybe a big jello mold, or an inflated basketball, or a bucket of water.  You'd pretty soon know what kind of vibrations would feel like from different kinds of taps in different places on different materials.  </p>
<p>Scientists have sensors all around the world that measure earthquakes and other vibrations in the earth very precisely.  Let's say a big Earthquake happens in Japan, it will be detected in Japan and the nearby region, but also in America, and Australia and Europe.  By comparing the types of vibrations detected in those different parts of the world, and looking at how long they took to travel, scientists can infer quite a lot about the types of material that the vibrations were traveling through.  </p>
<p>Then they take information from other scientists who have studied the kinds of stuff the earth is made of, and how those materials behave under heat and pressure.  When the different groups of scientists put their data together they are able to form a pretty clear understanding of the composition of the interior of the planet without having to observe it directly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Short Answer: Math</p>
<p>Long(er) Answer:  We don't actually KNOW with 100% certainty.  We learn new things all the time.  However using mathematical models we are able to accurately determine some things, like where fault lines and natural resources are.</p>
<p>We are also able to speculate with reasonable assumptions of accuracy on others (like the composition of the center of the earth).</p>
<p>But there are many details that we have to accept as ASSUMPTIONS - reasonable or otherwise.  We still can't predict earthquakes or volcanoes with a comfortable level of &quot;when&quot; and &quot;how bad&quot; accuracy.  </p>
<p>The exact mechanics happening underground are still mathematical models that SO FAR have done a good job at accurately explaining what happens AFTER it has happened (like earthquakes).  So we keep the existing models until a new one comes along.</p>
<p>Having taught High School science i can tell you many of our assumptions have been updated over the last few decades as we learn new stuff.  </p>
<p>Heck, Even continental drift (aka plate tectonics today) is barely more than 100 years old.  We're as sure as we can be, until we learn more :-)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers here are quite good, but I would like to add one detail. There are several slightly complicated mathematical equations (a little much for ELI5 imo), but essentially scientists use them to find the mass of the Earth. Using the vibration of earthquakes (mentioned here already), it can be found that the core is made of iron because the vibrations are different when travelling through iron as opposed to aluminum. </p>
<p>Now that we know the mass of the Earth and the size and makeup of the core, we can find how much force the sheer weight of Earth's gravity is pushing onto the core (from all directions). An iron core will change temperature with more pressure. If your mom ever cooked with a pressure cooker, that is a perfect example of how compressing the air around your food will let more heat into it. </p>
<p>We know the melting temperature of iron, and we also know how much pressure must be applied to iron to make it a liquid (or in Earth's case, a liquid under so even more pressure so that it seems like a solid again). </p>
<p>Another interesting and simple way to tell if a planet's core is hot enough to be a liquid is to observe how much the Sun's gravity pulls the planet into a slightly non-circular (or non-spherical) shape. This is how we know that Mars has at least a partially molten core, because the Sun squishes it like a pancake (very slightly) at certain points in it's orbit. If Mars had a solid core, it wouldn't squish so much. </p>
<p>TLDR: Scientists can use the weight of the Earth and it's pressure on the core to determine the temperature of the core, as long as they know the material of the core. Also molten cores make planets more squishy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Based on the recent LIGO/VIRGO discovery with the NS-NS collission creating the r-process elements we know that whatever molecular cloud gave birth to our system had to be enriched from such a collission to have the abundance of r-process elements we see. It's possible that we are the results of the supernova of those two stars and then their subsequent merger alone in which case you'd be the result of 2 stars.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the only reasonable approach to this is in terms of &quot;generations&quot; of stars.  Since the universe entered its star-formation phase, the matter from each star will gradually spread out, and the space over which it spreads is also spreading out.  I'd say it's likely that every star in our galaxy, and whole galactic clusters, if not the entire observable universe, might contain traces of the same few early stars.</p>
<p>We can track the approximate evolution of star composition through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity" target="_blank">metallicity</a>, which is apparent in the light they produce.</p>
<p>The earliest stars we can see, at the edge of the observable universe are first-generation, &quot;population III&quot; stars, are from circa 800 MY, or 13 billion years ago.  <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/06/astronomers-spot-first-generation-stars-made-big-bang" target="_blank">[1]</a>  These stars are thought to generally be quite massive, and therefore short-lived, but that's not confirmed.</p>
<p>Individual stars have hugely different lifespans, from a few million to a few trillion years.  So a low-mass star of less than 0.1 solar masses formed 14 BYA might still be young today, while other stars might be thousands of generations old.  However, we don't see any very low-metallicity dwarf stars, so at least in the part of the universe we can see, those long-lived stars are all from later generations.</p>
<p>Getting back to your question, I'd estimate that the stars from which our atoms arose are somewhere on the order of 10-100 generations old.  Early on, when things were more dense, each stellar formation might have mixed the components of thousands or even millions of nearby stars.  Now things are more spread out, but so are the atoms from early stars.  Much of that mixing is of ejecta from a &quot;cousin&quot; star, though, which may not add very many to the total.  So, as a fairly wild estimate, I'd say that it's on the scale of millions, as opposed to thousands or billions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Although, this question is impossible to answer in a strict way, isotope chemists have used the isotopic compositions of pre-solar grains to determine what kinds of stars have contributed matter to the nebula that the solar system formed from.</p>
<p>Different stars fuse elements in different ways. This results in differences in the ratio of isotopes in different stars. For example, some presolar grains contain large excesses of Carbon-13 and Nitrogen-14, which is indicative of AGB stars (red giant stars). Other presolar grains might contain large Oxygen-18 excesses, indicating derivation from supernova material.
