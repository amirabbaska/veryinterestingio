		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The principle of thermodynamics at play here is that heat flows from high temperature systems to low temperature system. The flaw with your reasoning is that you are simply forgetting this idea. </p>
<p>If you start a container just large enough to contain the liquid, so that there is no vapor phase, and then you increase the size of the container, then a vapor phase will occupy the new volume. Initially this vapor phase will have a higher temperature than the liquid, but over time the vapor phase will exchange energy with the liquid, and the temperature of the two phases will equilibrate. </p>
<p>The other thing you could image is that instead of increasing the size of the container by a finite amount, you take away the walls of the container completely. In this case the vapor phase flies away to infinity and so is not in thermal contact with the liquid. In this case, the two phases really have different temperatures, but this is allowed by thermodynamics because the two phases are not in thermal contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>No, the particles lost their additional energy from escaping the liquid.</p>
<p>Temperature is more than just kinetic energy. Anyway, the temperature is exactly the same in all phases in equilibrium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When dealing with laws of thermodynamics and temperature you cannot deal with individual particles. Any liquid or gas has a variety of particles with different energy states. The temperature is a statistical sample of these.</p>
<p>If you have a sealed container with vapour above a liquid, once equilibrium is reached they are at the same temperature because that is what equilibrium means. No net energy is transferred between them (or more accurately they both add the same amount to each other).</p>
<p>If you suddenly made the container bigger, the available space would increase, the gas would expand and pressure would drop in the gas. This would allow for more evaporation and cooling until a new equilibrium is reached. The overall system would have the same energy less the energy required to expand so would overall be slightly cooler but the gas and liquid would still reach equilibrium.</p>
<p>Perhaps a reason for the confusion is that &quot;temperature&quot; is not really a measure of the amount of energy something has but more a measure of the direction of heat flow in relation to something else. </p>
<p>What you are thinking about is similar to Maxwells Demon. There are several youtube videos that would explain this better than I could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I work at a Fortune 50 retailer and while on paper we are PCI compliant, I know that we do things that the processors say were not supposed to.. like keep CC numbers and CVS codes.  While there are some gray areas CC numbers can be stored but must be encrypted.  Well, if every CC en encrypted with the same key or hash its significantly less secure than a unique key for each card.  So while we follow the letter of the rules we really don't do it the right or best way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It is also possible that laws in these states allow the state to sue directly rather than people for various reasons (maybe the individual harms are too small to justify individuals suing, or false suits were seen as too common).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the things that &quot;Fun&quot; is, is being able to predict a result, and see that prediction be validated. </p>
<p>As a child, they're still learning a lot of things, so much is not understood and unpredictable.  A movie or a show gives them the ability to think about what is going to happen, and then have the show confirm the result. </p>
<p>As an adult, we have learned a lot of things.  Our ability to predict the result is not fun because it's not surprising.  The kids shows are simple and predictable, and the joy that we get from confirmation of that prediction is minor because it's a certainty.  </p>
<p>As an adult, I find myself watching the same shows with my daughter over and over.  I find myself looking for details, whether it's trying to build a map of the island in my head in Puffin Rock, or pick out the individual theme songs of the various creatures in Dinosaur Train.  Or finding patterns that show changes in the show's production.  I do this because I'm searching for fun, though it's a bit more work on my behalf, but it's essentially the same thing that my daughter finds fun in on the surface.  </p>
<p>I have a method of guessing what the result is going to be.  I know early in the season the production is less regular about playing the theme music for the characters, but has more location and mood based music, while later in the season the character music is dominant, less music is written, and it's generally more thematic.  So early in the season they have music for watching the sun set or walking around on the train, or exploring a new place.  Later in the season the music follows the person talking, or it's the intro theme to the type of story it is (under the sea for instance), but you rarely see music that imparts mood or minor activities, and there's less music written for a specific incident in a single episode. </p>
<p>I like watching shows with my daughter, I've never been the person to just sit her down in front of the TV and go and do my own thing.  This means I get to see this, and struggle to find something that interests me.  But I still do the same thing, recognize the pattern, predict the result, and feel good when I'm right.  For my daughter, it's the same, but the pattern that she recognizes is trivial to me.</p>
<p>I think it's very similar to how you develop a taste for music.  If you're unfamiliar with a genre of music, it's the more 'pop' type of music that is appealing. The more popular music is generally simpler, so the patterns are easy to see and predict and get validation for quickly.  These kinds of songs are catchy and easy to sing along to even the first time you hear them.  It's kind of fun when a song has a part that you can sing along to, because you can quickly make the prediction that the next verse is going to sound like this one, and get validated.  You're smart, you figured out the pattern.</p>
<p>But as you get more interested in the genre, that catchy music gets dull.  It's predictable. It's boring.  There are other genres of music that have more complex elements to them, but which are common to the genre or the artist. You start to learn these elements and can predict them, and that's exciting and fun, and you're understanding it in a deeper way than you could before.  As you get deeper into the understanding of these mechanics, you start to appreciate things that a naive observer wouldn't even have the basis to understand.  </p>
<p>This results in things like appreciation of art that is like 4 bands of color but people are willing to buy it for 75 million dollars.  Because the people who are looking at it and appreciating it have so much more background that they're using to evaluate the piece.  The naive observer can't start to even relate to the people who love it.  At the same time, the people who love it can't really relate to the people who appreciate much more accessible amateur art. </p>
<p>The child likes the same movie every day because there's a lot for them to get out of it.  </p>
<p>The adult is just way past the child in terms of what is filtered out and what is remembered and how easily it's remembered, and how predictable the outcomes of the characters in a children's show will be that they run out of that excitement quickly, and essentially can't appreciate it at the same level as a child. </p>
<p>In the same way, many adult shows, with their level of complexity and nuance, can be very boring and confusing to a child because they don't have the tools to learn and make these predictions and be rewarded for them. </p>
<p>Layering it can help.  For instance, if my daughter were to watch a television show that had in the background a bit of a backstory that took a bit of work to put together, created out of hints and things at the periphery of the action, then it would be kind of fun to watch it over and over.  The first time through the series you might pick up on some of those subtleties, and then over the course of watching it a few times you might be able to put together what's really going on behind the scenes.  Meanwhile, the child might not even be aware of that deeper story, they can enjoy the basic story. </p>
<p>Peppa Pig does this a bit by cheekily using Ms. Rabbit for pretty much every odd job out there.  In something like Paw Patrol, my wife and I have made up backstories to explain away Ryder's resources, and Mayor Goodway's incompetence.  One idea is Ryder is a juvenile god who is practicing at creating his own world. Another is that it's a bit of a Coma dream where Ryder fell into a coma during the messy divorce of his parents, represented by Mayor Goodway and Mayor Hummdinger. </p>
<p>But what I'm searching for by playing these little games and taking note of these meta-details is basically the same thing as my daughter gets.  And it's a lot of the same types of content that is directly served to me by a show like Westworld.</p>
<p>Note that some of the movies or shows that you as an adult might like to watch multiple times are typically because there are new things you might learn every time you watch them.  Consider also that kids are just a lot less skilled at picking up on those things in the same way, so they can watch the same thing over and over and continue to build on their understanding of it. </p>
<p>It's not every video.  Give a child a show that is a simple 3 minute video and try and have them watch it every day for an hour.  You'll still have a hard time keeping their attention for the first hour.  They'll get bored because there's nothing new for them to figure out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every top-level post seems to either describe others doing the same thing, or guess.</p>
<p>Here's the current, scientific understanding - excuse me, my 5yo friend, here's what scientists tell us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/never-ending-story-how-repetition-helps-a-childs-vocabulary-2220647.html" target="_blank">Young kids learn best this way!</a> It's fun, but it also allows them to repeat things until they sink in. Lots of fun play is really just practicing skills you'll need as a grownup!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/behavioral/why-toddlers-love-repetition/" target="_blank">Also, they are learning how to control their world.</a> With storybooks, they are learning how the pictures tell the story, and before they start reading they discover that those funny groups of ABC shapes <em>mean</em> something special to Mommy and Daddy. Of course, nothing ever changes with videos - except it does! They can notice new things. Ever watch a movie, and not realize something that went on in the background, or miss a character's quick reaction until the second viewing? Little kids are doing that, only with the main character's exaggerated reactions. They're absorbing social and emotional clues from the &quot;people&quot; on the video. But since they aren't as good at it as older kids, they keep practising. So, they're not directly learning to control their world, but they are studying how others provide important clues to what others are thinking and feeling.</p>
<p>This can be taken to an extreme. The great animal researcher Dr. Temple Grandin is autistic, and in her autobiography she says the other kids called her &quot;tape recorder&quot; because she would repeat a single phrase over and over and over and over - any phrase. She wasn't &quot;dumb&quot;; as an autistic person emotional clues in voice inflections were especially hard for her to understand, and she <em>might</em> have been rehearsing the word, trying to find clues to those emotions she had problems detecting.</p>
<p>Finally, the kid's show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%27s_Clues" target="_blank">Blues Clues was based on this research</a>. The originators learned that kids learned best with lots of repetition, and proposed a kind of kid show that would repeat the exact same episode every day for a week. Kids could tune in on Tuesday through Friday, and practice everything they learned on Monday. It was a HUGE hit because of this! Little kids loved it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Young children love repetition, whether it's watching a video or listening to song lyrics, because it's the best way for them to acquire and master new skills. In order to learn something well, children this age practice it until they get it right, hence the repeated watching.</p>
<p>What is your child practicing by repeatedly watching a video? It depends on the video, of course, but it could be that he doesn't yet understand the story line. And the more he watches, the better he's able to understand. Maybe he's fascinated by programs that feature songs and dancing and wants to practice the movements while singing along. Young children are almost always in the process of mastering basic skills while they play.</p>
<p>Once your child has mastered a video's dialog or song lyrics or movements, he/she wants to celebrate his/her success by participating in what he's/she's seeing, so he/she'll continue to watch. She/He'll probably announce the next plot sequence or song (in his head or out loud); for children this age, making correct predictions is the ultimate form of mastery. Since life is fairly unpredictable for them, they especially relish feeling competent and in control of what's coming next.</p>
<p>Soon they see it and recognize it from the diaspora of the rest of their experience.  That feeling of recognition is comforting because the brain wants it that way.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have worked with kids before, and my wife is a preschool teacher/has a college education about this, so I have a little more experience than most seeing a wide variety of kids learning.</p>
<p>I think you and some of the other commenters have hit the nail on the head with the repetition idea - kids have this innate desire to master and learn skills, and one of the best ways is to repeat over and over and over (i.e. learning numbers, times tables, etc.). What I would add is that many people forget what it was like to be 5, and what your attention span was like. Kids sit down to watch a movie, and it takes them more time to absorb and think through reactions. One of the key skills they are learning here is cause and effect: this character did this, so this happened.  By the time these connections are made, the movie has moved on, or an exciting scene happened that made the child lose their grasp of what was going on, etc.</p>
<p>It is actually pretty easy to test this: ask a kid about a movie they just saw for the first time, and what it was about. Most of the time, they can tell you vaguely what happened, or some of the major story points, but often they can only repeat their favorite actionish parts, or little bits that they remember. </p>
<p>Ask them about a movie they have watched more, and often they can tell you more and more connected plot points, or actually tell you the story of the movie. They will even use the word &quot;because&quot; more - Nemo's dad goes to find Nemo BECAUSE Nemo got stolen by a boat, and the sharks attack BECAUSE of the blood.</p>
<p>Another key element is that kids don't have the mental shortcuts  and patterns stored that adults do, and so they have to learn everything as a new pattern. To take the Finding Nemo example above: Kids don't know that blood draws sharks. In that scene, even though an adult can look at that and either know what is happening, or guess from context clues, a kid doesn't have that same frame of reference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's add the fact that children don't have as strong a concept of &quot;time&quot; as an adult does, nor enough experiences to compare and contrast, so they don't easily experience the thought of &quot;let's move on, I've seen this before and there's other things to do&quot;.</p>
<p>When you're a child, you don't really realize that there's been thousands of movies and television shows/episodes created since the advent of these technologies in the previous century.  You just know, &quot;Hey, there's that brightly colored show with the animated animals that make me laugh, let's see that!&quot;  And since your perception of time is slower as a child, a movie or TV show will make for an awesome afternoon.  You don't (or rarely do) hear kids say, &quot;well, there's an hour I'll never get back&quot; when bored by some experience, that's because adults are more likely to be aware of time spent during an activity -- the kid either knows bored or non-bored, for the most part.</p>
<p>As an example, I saw the Star Wars something like twelve times in the theater, Empire Strikes back another four to seven times, and Return of the Jedi probably five times.  As much as I love Star Wars, I've only watched the following movies once in the theater each (at most, some I believe I waited for video but memory escapes me there), with a follow up viewing when friends wanted to re-watch it to refresh their memory for the upcoming movies.  Why?  Because 90-120 minutes of my adult time is viewed as much more valuable and not worth spending on a repeat activity.  There are still things I'll gladly re-watch, but it takes time for the desire to return, not a matter of days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply, they are.</p>
<p>Marketing has many goals, but the general desire is to make the most number of people feel good about a product.</p>
<p>As such, they're aiming at the lowest common denominator and trying to make people correlate the feelings of sexiness or intelligence or sophistication from the commercial towards the product.</p>
<p>Let's take for example - Grey Poupon. Whole-grain mustard's difference from Yellow Mustard is that they use more than one seed, they grind coarsely, and they don't use Tumeric to make it bright yellow. </p>
<p>Dijon Mustard's difference from Yellow Mustard is again, no Tumeric, but adding in a bit of vinegar, white wine or other acidity (they used to use verjuice, but that's long gone). </p>
<p>Considering how expensive Tumeric can be and how cheap vinegars can be, it may actually be more expensive to produce yellow mustard than Dijon or Whole-Grain. It's usually not, but spice prices fluctuate.</p>
<p>But Grey Poupon is considered fancy - why? Good marketing....and really stupid people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spend about $3000/month in online advertising for my own business and worked making tv commercials for others for 20 years. I have some experience making the exact ads you are referencing.</p>
<p>You are a reddit user which is notoriously difficult to advertise to. Techniques that work on the vast majority of the population won't work on you and some of those techniques aren't even allowed to be used when advertising on Reddit because of the severe backlash it creates.</p>
<p>The best advice I was given is to create ads for a six year old audience. They have to be very easy to understand with clear calls to action. If it's an online ad it needs a huge bright CLICK ME FOR DEAL button or else I'll start getting comments from people asking how to claim the offer or the conversion rate will just be .1%. The best part of online advertising (Facebook specifically) vs TV is Facebook learns who my customer is very quickly and will start going out sniping customers for me without spending a lot on impressions or needing to use targeted keywords. I also get instant feedback when someone buys something using the Facebook &quot;Pixel&quot;. So I know how much per conversion I am spending. With TV you can't really do that. I encourage anyone that wants to sell something worldwide or even local to just use Facebook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well &quot;sound/look like are made for really really stupid people&quot; is not quite accurate to say. But there are 2 reasons they may seem dumb on constant review.</p>
<p>1) Really good commercials are made to reach exactly who the business wants to reach. Their demo. </p>
<p>Often times you may see an obnoxious loud commercial for a children's cereal that is extremely stupid to you. But kids of a certain age want it and crave it. Some of those marketing campaigns stick with us for our entire lives. Bet you still have a Trix or Cocopuffs that you get nostalgic for. </p>
<p>2). Old school marketing wants to reach everyone even if everyone doesn't want their product. (This is usually far less effective but makes ad agencies lots of money for an easy production)</p>
<p>The commercials that strive to stretch their message to try and reach the largest group of people tend to be very simplistic. The commercial is also competing against people losing attention while they wait for the show to resume, distractions, anyone near a tv but not watching. So the simpler a message the more likely it will be communicated. If you can ensure that the commercial is understandable by anyone with a 5th grade reading level, can be understood in a busy bar, or even if the tv is on mute... then you reached the most people. They however may not be the people you want to reach.</p>
<p>Bonus: REALLY REALLY SMART marketers are scary </p>
<p>Why are they scary? They not only can pinpoint exactly the type of person they want to buy their product but can manipulate the viewer into doing so with emotion or attitude. They know getting its almost about making the customer feel good about their choice of your product. They associate what the customer wants to be or feel like with their product. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea that we've 'only explored 5% of the ocean floor' is not really true (unless we have a VERY narrow definition of 'explored'). The first thing to realize is that we have data on the bathymetry (i.e. the underwater equivalent of topography) of the ocean from two primary sources, gravity data (from satellites) and sonar soundings (from ships). These data have very different resolutions and coverage, with gravity data being much more coarse (i.e. larger distances between data points) than sonar, but we have 100% coverage with gravity data. You can see a pretty good visual representation of the difference between these two almost anywhere in google earth/maps, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@29.430164,-127.8279503,126465m/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">e.g. this random spot in the ocean off the west coast of the US</a>. The linear track of clearly visible bathymetry is a strip of data from sonar dragged behind a ship, the rest of the very fuzzy bathymetry is that derived from gravity data. For the sonar data, the distance between your sonar source and the bottom of the ocean (along with the exact type of equipment, etc) will control the resolution of the data. So expanding the '5% of the ocean is explored' thing, we can put some more precise numbers on that and think about resolutions of bathymetry data, courtesy of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/just-how-little-do-we-know-about-the-ocean-floor/" target="_blank">this nice discussion in Scientific American</a>.  In short, we have meter scale bathymetry (i.e. spacing between data points is on the order of several meters) for 5% of the ocean floor from sonar closer to the ocean floor (there's the origin of our '5% of the ocean is explored' simplification!), ~100 meter scale bathymetry for 10-15% of the ocean (from sonar at the surface of the ocean), and ~5 km scale bathmetry for the entire ocean (from satellite gravity data). The satellite gravity measurements are pretty cool, worth checking out a <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/gravity-map-uncovers-sea-floor-surprises-1.16048" target="_blank">write up of the study</a> or the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6205/65.full" target="_blank">actual paper</a>.</p>
<p>With the above discussion in mind, this means that if we've explored 100% of the oceans at a resolution of 5 km, if there was an area deeper than the Marianas Trench, it would need to be less than ~5 km across. The other important consideration is that the fact that the Marianas Trench is very deep is not a surprise or happenstance, there is a very clear geologic reason, specifically because it is a trench associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction" target="_blank">a subduction zone</a>, i.e. a place where an oceanic plate is sinking into the mantle. This means that we immediately have a good idea of where very deep areas will be, and in fact virtually all of the deepest areas of the ocean are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_submarine_topographical_features#Oceanic_trenches" target="_blank">trenches</a>, i.e. subduction zones. If we look at most trenches, they are large features (100+ km across, 1000s of km long), so even with data of 5 km resolution, we have a good number of data points defining the bathymetry of a trench.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2015.00046/full" target="_blank">This article provides a good analysis of factors contributing to tree longevity</a> (a lot of it comes down to location, location, location), but doesn't address the larger question you're going for which is why certain trees have the <em>capacity</em> for a long lifespan.</p>
<p>&quot;Why&quot; isn't always a useful question in biology, or even possible to answer.  Often &quot;how&quot; is more relevant and easier to answer.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that not all trees have the capacity for a long lifespan, some species don't really appear to have a biological limit on their lifespan while others most definitely do have natural limits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.conifers.org/topics/longevity.htm" target="_blank">This transcript from a talk on the biological basis for conifer longevity</a> gets more to the point of your central question.</p>
<p><strong>TL/DR</strong> <em>that applying animal biological models and understanding to trees isn't an good way of thinking about them.  That very little of the tree is actually alive, and that, in some ways, a tree is a more like a colony than an individual organism (think coral as a loose analogy).  Some tree species appear to have a better or more robust DNA repair mechanism than others.</em></p>
<p>Some key points in the latter article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, there is no continuity of germ plasm. Many plant cells have the ability to create a new plant – a fact that we use all the time when we propagate plants from cuttings. In general, new growth occurs from undifferentiated cells in the meristem tissues, which occur in the cambium as shown here, or at growing tips of stems or roots.</p>
<p>Second, plants are modular, capable of an indeterminate number of leaves, or stems, or roots, in response to environmental changes. To a large degree these modules are independent of each other: most of the time the death of a leaf, or stem, or root does not have awful consequences for the rest of the plant. Think of the difference between cutting a limb off an animal and cutting one off a tree. To some degree, trees can be thought of as colonial organisms. How old is a colony?</p>
<p>The colony analogy is revealed in another way: trees basically consist of a dead woody core of heartwood that serves to provide structure for a veneer of living tissue. Only the veneer is alive, but when we speak of a tree being old, we usually mean that it has an old woody core.</p>
<p>One consequence of this modular and colonial growth strategy is that our perception of a tree as an individual is illogical; it is another instance of zoocentrism. To the tree, an individual woody structure is only important insofar as it provides a competitive advantage by providing an extensive root system to gather nutrients and water, or height growth that allows greater access to sunlight. If circumstance allow, the colony can easily appear as many individuals. For example, there are examples of yew trees that are thought of as being over 1000 years old because a yew tree has been growing in the same place for 1000 years; yet there may be several distinct stems, each of which has no living cell over 100 years old, and there may be no remnant of wood that is over 500 years old. How old is that tree? It depends on what you call age.</p>
<p>Telomeres are structures at the ends of the chromosome that play a critical role in cell division. Organisms with longer telomeres can sustain more cycles of cell division, and organisms with higher activity of the enzyme telomerase can better repair shortened telomeres.</p>
<p><em>Pinus longaeva</em> has significantly longer telomeres and higher telomere activity than more short-lived pine species (<em>P. taeda</em>, <em>P. palustris</em>, <em>P. resinosa</em>). Watson and Riha (2010) note that “the rate of molecular evolution in trees and shrubs with long generation times is slower when compared to related herbaceous plants with shorter generation times ... One explanation for this observation is that plant meristematic cells possess robust DNA repair and genome maintenance mechanism.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a bunch more in that transcript that's worth reading, but those paragraphs get to the heart of your question.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their evolutionary niche is in being large and durable. They're the biggest things in the forest, so they get to hog all the sunlight they want. It takes a long time for trees to grow to be so big and tough, so they need to make use of it by living long enough to produce tons of seeds.</p>
<p>Trees are most vulnerable as saplings. If they don't get eaten or trampled when they're young, they don't have much to worry about for a long time. A strong, healthy tree is quite tough to take down by anything found in nature. A long life span allows the tree to produce many seeds and maximize its chances at reproduction.</p>
<p>Insects are on the other end of the spectrum. They're small, not terribly durable, and are often food for tons of other animals. Insects also tend to have quite short lives, but that's fine since their strategy is to reproduce like crazy and survive through sheer numbers. It doesn't matter if a million ants die if there are billions more ready to replace them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In evolutionary biology, adaptations are often acquired by modifying existing structures to accomplish new tasks. </p>
<p>Symbiotic relationships have developed among plants and bacteria, fungi, insects, and these relationships are usually undisturbed unless there is an interfering force.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of trees: gymnosperms (any woody plant that doesn't have a flower) and angiosperms (any flowering plant).  Trees can reproduce asexually by budding (their cells are totipotent, and so one &quot;cut&quot; of a tree can grow into a whole organism).
Pine trees have both male cones and female cones.  They typically try to get their pollen from the male cones into the female cones of other trees (to increase genetic diversity in the population), which produces viable seeds.
Flowers (angiosperms) have both male and female parts.  Again, they typically try to get their pollen to other trees (though sometimes they do self-pollination).
Common means of getting pollination to other trees include: wind, insects (bees or butterflies), birds, or bats. Relatively speaking, these take a long time compared to organisms like humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Every visit I make to a pharmacy I'm checking the parking lot and the general look of the area for any suspicious activity and we are constantly monitoring thresholds to prevent abuse or diversion. It's not an ELI5 problem so it doesn't deserve an eli5 answer unfortunately. The problem is so fantastically difficult to solve. From the wholesaler perspective it's up to the pharmacist and physician, but when we cut thresholds they threaten to pull out of their contracts so we fee the pressure. The funny and ironic thing is that we genuinely make very little money on C2 control substances. I know that in the past we have considered not selling them in the first place but unfortunately there is a legitimate need for these medications and it's difficult to determine legitimate vs illegitimate. To solve the problem would require coordination between every doctors office in the country, all 22000 retail pharmacies, all of the chains and every wholesaler. That's why this is an issue.</p>
<p>Edit: there is some confusions between manufacturers rep and pharmacy business consultant. I do not represent manufacturers of drugs. I work for a drug wholesaler, I do not interact with the doctor and have no control over what they prescribe. I sell generic and brand name drugs to pharmacies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Canadian pharmacist here.</p>
<p>Getting opioid medications is a 2-step process: the physician needs to OK it, and the pharmacist needs to OK it. Both of these checkpoints are failing.</p>
<p>From the physician's side:</p>
<p>Imagine you're a physician and a patient presents to you saying they are in pain (or has a bad cough.) Pain is very subjective so it's difficult to judge if they're lying or how much pain they are in. These people also tend to be very clingy and would refuse to leave your office until they get something. What do you do? You give them something hoping the pharmacist would stop them.</p>
<p>There are also other perspective the physician can take. They could consider it as harm-reduction (at least they're not using xxx.) They could be an irresponsible practionner (money is involved.) They could be working in a area with a high addict population; suddenly opioids become the norm and it's hard to judge what is abuse and what is common place.</p>
<p>From the pharmacist's side:</p>
<p>A patient arrives to the pharmacy. You have your doubts that the patient needs it, but the prescription is valid. Like the physician, the pharmacist really also don't want to deal with this BS: You want to get on with your day and move onto other patients; You want to make that patient leave ASAP; You want to make money; You consider it as a harm reduction approach. If you're a busy pharmacy processing 300 prescriptions a day, you don't have time to deal with this. if you're a slow pharmacy processing 50 prescriptions a day, you really need the money.</p>
<p>If you don't fill their prescription: They might attack you or threaten to be outside for you when you leave); They might rob you (robberies for narcotics are VERY common); They might sue you for discrimination; The physician might also get mad that you for not trusting them. One other common tactics that pharmacists use is to lie that they don't carry it. In this case, the prescription is handed back to them which only pushes the problem onto other pharmacists; they can easily find someone else to fill it for them.</p>
<p>What doesn't have much repercussions is actually filling the medication. The prescriber has already OKed it and the adverse effects are well know. If the patient is abusing it or is harmed, everyone expected it so pharmacist doesn't really take the blame. Both the prescriber and the pharmacist know that they're only responsible for the medication itself. No one will take responsibility for addiction.</p>
<p>Illegitimate ways to obtain prescription narcotics are actually very limited. Addicts would much rather illegal drugs over prescription drugs that are more difficult and expensive to obtain. Common strategies these people use are &quot;Double Doctoring&quot; - going to multiple prescribers to get multiple narcotic prescription; or &quot;Prescription Forgeries&quot; - faking/copying/editing a prescription. Physicians and pharmacists who get involved in this get into a lot of shit, so they are very careful and aren't afraid to call the patient out on it with strict laws behind them.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>
<p>There are a few questions concerning how we know a prescription is forged. There are a few safety measures/red flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many pharmacies are equipped to automatically and instantly upload prescriptions online</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some pharmacies have a procedure to confirm with the prescriber for each one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance companies instantly know if it has been filled</p>
</li>
<li>Some prescriptions require special paper for the prescription to be written on</li>
</ul>
<p>Red flags include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The patient has never been to this pharmacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prescriber has never been documented at this pharmacy (they might be a legit prescriber, but far away; why would the patient travel so far)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient looks anxious/is lying/not cooperating with the pharmacist's questions/counselling</p>
</li>
<li>The hand written prescription is legible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: </p>
<p>Firstly, I am an Albertan Canadian pharmacist. I have no ideas of the roles/laws outside of the province, let alone the US or other countries. Just to list off a few things Albertan pharmacists can do: independently prescribe any medication (except narcotics), independently adapt the strength, dose, formulation, regimen, type of drug, ect. for any medication, independently renew prescriptions, prescribe in an emergency, dispense for animals, administer vaccines, administer injections, develop care plans, order lab tests, refuse prescriptions. And we get paid for all of them. Yes, even the refusal. When a pharmacist make any change, they are a sole responsible prescriber. No, family physicians aren't happy.</p>
<p>Now just because we CAN, doesn't mean we should/will. A responsible pharmacist will know when they are not competent enough and refer to someone else. This is like how although dentists are allowed to prescribe anything, they should stay within their scope. Pharmacists know the medications very well, but we're not the best at diagnosis, so we will still be referring to physicians for most ailments. Most pharmacist aren't comfortable with prescribing and will refer for most things. However, we are getting more comfortable with prescribing for minor ailments. Also, many pharmacists are also getting specializations for a specific field (eg. diabetes.)</p>
<p>Second, I am getting a lot of comments about it's not the pharmacist's business how to manage patient's prescription. This is absolutely false as this is literally our job description, especially in Canada and the US. When something goes wrong, both the pharmacist and the prescriber are equally responsible. <del>For many countries in the world, &quot;pharmacist&quot; are people straight of out high school with no higher education. In these cases, their role is very limited.</del> Looks like I'm completely wrong on this. Canadian and US pharmacists have a ~3-4 years of university professional degree, and for various reasons, we're paid literally 2-4 times more than pharmacists from most European countries (yes even the developed ones).</p>
<p>Our job description: We make sure that your medications are indicated, effective, safe, and manageable. Indicated means that it's the right medication for the right condition for the right patient. Effective means that the dose/strength of medication is appropriate. Safe means that the benefits outweigh the potential harm. Manageable means that you can actually take the medication by the prescribe regimen - this includes addiction concerns.</p>
<p>If we do see a problem, we can either take care of it independently (and be the sole responsible prescriber) or contact the original prescriber to give a second opinion (this is why your prescriptions take so long, because we're always on <del>the phone</del> hold with the receptionist.) The prescriber can change the prescription and fax us a new one or cancel it completely. Nevertheless, we will contact everyone involved about the actions we took. No matter what happens, best practice states that the pharmacist must refer the patient to someone to can help them.</p>
<p>Example 1:
A family physician gave a patient a narcotic prescription. The pharmacist caught that the patient was double doctoring. The pharmacist refuses to fill. After the patient leaves, the pharmacist notifies all prescribers involved and all pharmacies involved to cancel the prescriptions.</p>
<p>Example 2:
A dentist gave an antibiotic prescription for a urinary tract infection. Although dentists are legally allowed to prescribe anything they want, this is not within their scope of practice. The pharmacist deems the dentist incompetent in the field and refuse the fill the prescription. The pharmacist refers the patient to a walk-in-clinic. The pharmacist then notifies the dentist.' NOTE: just because it's outside of their scope doesn't mean that we have to refuse. The dentist could be fully competent and assessed the patient appropriately, plus pharmacists also can assess the patient and confirm the dentist's prescription.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prescribing opioids for pain is a murky business. You're treating something that's not objectively measurable, with something people can rapidly become tolerant to, so dosing is substantially based on what patients say. There are no tests which can establish that patient A's pain is controlled on 200 mg/day of hydrocodone but not 150.</p>
<p>The most common immediate source of pills is from friends or family, but indeed, those pills had to either come from a pharmacy or be smuggled across the border. Heroin and synthetic opioids continue to come in illegally, but pills usually come from legitimate makers. So, how does the supply get as big as it is?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prescribing too long. It's quite common to prescribe anything in intervals of a month, for no real reason besides habit and tradition. A notorious example is a 30-day supply of opioids after wisdom tooth removal, which often requires no more than a few days' worth, or can even be controlled without opioids. The rest of the 30-day supply may linger in a cabinet until someone else wants it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prescribing too much. Let's say patient A gets OK pain control on 100 mg/day of hydrocodone. They could accurately report that... but they're unemployed, and worried about making ends meet... so they say it takes 200, and sell half their supply. &quot;Pill mills&quot; may simply not care.</p>
</li>
<li>Doctor shopping. While state databases have helped reduce this problem, a dedicated person may still be able to obtain multiple prescriptions from different providers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: To clarify, doses here are purposely on the ridiculous end to prove a point about the ample supply of opioids. That said, highly tolerant users and abusers absolutely do go well into the hundreds of morphine equivalents per day.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>U.S. Pharmacist here
To answer your question directly (most responses here are parroting the everyday reasons/causes of our current opioid epidemic), you asked how is it not obvious the pills are being abused if we know the number of manufactured pills and number of prescriptions.</p>
<p>The thing is that we <em>don't know</em> either of those numbers. The number of pills manufactured &amp; sold by a company is proprietary information and therefore not publicly available. That information also wouldn't be meaningful in identifying severity of widespread abuse: Person A and Person B can both rate their pain an 8 out of 10, but Person A may need 20 mg a couple times a day to adequately reduce their pain while Person B may need 60 mg (this example is assuming neither person is lying about their pain score nor abusing the drug).</p>
<p>The story of the second number is similar. The number of prescriptions doctors' offices and hospitals' dole out just isn't data that has been extracted by anyone. It isn't public information, and again wouldn't really enlighten where the problem is coming from.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the Netflix documentary, Dr. Feelgood. It follows a physician that was convicted of widespread narcotic distribution. It really highlights the muddy line between treating someone's pain and enabling addiction &amp; dependence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Knowing how many pills are being prescribed isn't going to help anything. The problem lies in whether or not the patient is taking their meds or not. If you have medication expenses totaling $1000 a month, and you can live with your pain, selling 90 percocets for $10 a pop covers your heart meds, your blood pressure meds, and the others that keep you alive.  Nobody dies from being in pain so many of those prescribed pills get sold off. There is no way to track this without having someone physically check every patients pill bottle every day and count pills. </p>
<p>The real problem came about 5 years ago when doctors realized pain pills were being overprescribed, and cut back on how many and how often they could be dispensed. Suddenly thousands of people who are addicted to pain pills are sick. Heroin is cheap and everywhere, and if your sick from not having any pills, and you will be if you take them every day, heroin will fix that for you really quick.  No more waiting 45 minutes for swallowed pills to work, just snort a little dope and you feenit within minutes.  And it's so cheap compared to pills, I could spend ten bucks a day and not feel sick.  10 bucks turns into 20, 30, 50 bucks a day really quick.  </p>
<p>Suddenly you're unable to snort enough dope to get you high. You hate needles and you swore you'd never do this, but it's getting expensive to snort dope all day and not get the same feeling due to tolerance, so you let your friend shoot you up. The effect is super strong and immediate. Everyone I've ever know who shoots up dope says it's the most amazing and orgasmic feeling they have ever had, and it's cheaper!  Now you can use $2 worth of dope to get high, so why not double the dose and feel double good?  $2 becomes 10, 40, 100 real quick.  When you don't have dope you get sick in a few hours, really sick compared to pills, and now you're broke. You need to feel better to be yourself, so you take some stuff to the pawn shop. Then one day you realize you e taken everything of value to the pawn shop, you're sick and it's awful. Your neighbor has some nice jewelry you could get a few hundred bucks for and you'd be well for a few days, maybe a week. This is how the addict mind rationalizes these things and this is how people's lives are ruined.  I should know, I lived out this scenario for 10 years. The first time I snorted too much heroin and woke up covered in crusty vomit was the end of the rod for me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Basically sound has a huge problem crossing a barrier where there is a large &quot;Impedance mismatch&quot;  like between water and air.  When sound hits that &quot;soft release&quot; (because the air's impedance is much less than the water impedance) it gets reflected back into the water and doesn't radiate out efficiently.  You have a similar problem of sound starting in the air and moving to the water.</p>
<p>However, for sound created in water, you should be able to hear it in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes you can hear it perfectly. I am a commercial diver. We use an underwater speaker designed for divers as an emergency recall or communication system. It's about 5 grand for the whole set up but it's amazing. We spend long hours at a shallow depth, so often we play music and it travels way further then you might think. </p>
<p>Actually it's cheaper than that. Lubell labs makes ours. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can. In fact, there are purpose made speakers you can buy for your pool. It's pretty trippy the first time you hear a song underwater.
The Broadmoor Hotel and Resort had them in their main pool back in the 90's. Not sure common they are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A speaker is only a diaphram that is moved back and forth so quickly using magnets that it creates vibrations in the air that our eardrums pick up.</p>
<p>So in water there is a higher density of particles and thus would actually transmit sound way more efficiently.</p>
<p>This is why when in a pool underwater you hear everything (produced underwater) amplified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They play music everyday from speakers and you can hear the music perfectly underwater all the way in our lanes. So I don't see why an under water speaker would be any different. Maybe it would, idk I'm just a swim coach. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very good question. It depends. If you put your transmitter above ground, it is almost impossible to get the signals deep underground and it would be a waste of energy to try to. If you put transmitters inside a tunnel you can actually reach quite far with them because the signals would reflect a lot. So we could do it. We probably don't because it takes a lot of money and it isn't really worth anyone's time since you will be above ground soon anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typical wavelengths used for cellular connections does not penetrate earth very well. They can manage a few walls in the house, but put a bit of solid of stone in between, and the signal will be soo weak that you don't get any connection. So we can't use normal antennas to radiate underground. </p>
<p>Instead, we can use what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_feeder" target="_blank">radiating cable</a> (AKA Leaky feeder). It is basically a very long antenna which you put in the tunnel, and connect a cellular basestation at the end. The antenna distributes the signal along the tunnel. This is used in many underground systems around the world, as well as in airplanes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Largely it is not difficult, however it is expensive. </p>
<p>Specifically you use what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_feeder#Underground_railways" target="_blank">&quot;Leaky Feeder&quot;</a> which extends the antenna along the length of the tunnel. The user is in the same cell site/sector along the entire length of the tunnel so no rapid hand-offs are needed. Other than the leaky feeder antenna (with it's boosters), the radio equipment is the same as a normal cell site. The cell site needs power, cooling and connectivity of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IT guy from NYC not a scientist.</p>
<p>They have been rolling out 4G wireless at most stations in NYC, the only problem is your connection drops when you get a decent distance from the station.</p>
<p>For full coverage they would need to install quite a few access points (AP's) along all the tunnels so you can jump from one AP to another.</p>
<p>On a side note they offer free wifi but I abstain from using it since I'm not sure who has access to the logs.  I certainly wouldn't order anything or provide personal information while using it.</p>
<p>Long story short, it can and is being done but it's costing a lot of money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
