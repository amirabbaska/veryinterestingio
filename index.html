When the compression stops the change in pressure allows the blood to fill the heart again, much as it does between heartbeats. The valves in the heart keep everything going in the right direction. </p>
<p>The compressions also ventilate some air in and out of the lungs as the chest size expands and contracts. It is not as good as regular breathing though or having a bag mask, but it should be enough to keep the bare minimum of oxygen circulating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also, research shows that it takes a few minutes for the pressure in the system to build up adequately each time you start compressions. </p>
<p>So it's essential to compress hard, compress fast, and avoid even momentary interruptions whenever possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your heart is made up of four chambers with valves. Blood comes in the right side from the body, goes to the lungs to pick up oxygen, then returns to the left side of the heart before going to the body.</p>
<p>During cpr the chest is compressed which squeezes the blood out of the heart (into both the lungs and the body) the compression of the chest also causes negative pressure which causes the heart to fill with blood. This is why you want to minimize hands off time during CPR and why the standard in adults has changed to 30:2. </p>
<p>As an important note your blood has some oxygen in it even without respirations. Studies indicate oxygen levels can supply about 10 minutes of compression only CPR. This is why a lot of protocols have been down playing the importance of respirations (paired with the risk of infection and the concern of lay responders about doing it improperly) </p>
<p>If you are having an cardiac arrest because of an electrical disturbance in the heart you will likely need a defibrillator to stop the disturbance and allow the heart to beat properly again. If it has another cause CPR can provide time to treat the problem with medicine, surgery or fluid.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the animation, you can clearly see that by applying pressure on the sternum and indirectly on the heart, it makes the blood flow through the body, especially the brain. Plus, it also applies pressure on the lungs, which keeps the air going in and coming out of them. As expected, with such constant and high pressure, the ribs are often cracked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ATM's in my bars and restaurant. You can choose to lease or buy a machine. I always choose to buy as the return is better. I go through a company that manages the transactions which is supplied by the guy which provided the ATM. We charge 2.75 a transaction and they take .25Â¢ of every transaction. I fill the machine with cash myself and there is a kinda dumb rule to somehow prevent money laundering that the cash that I put in I have to first deposit into the bank before I put it into the machine. So I literally will walk into a bank with $20,000 in twenties and deposit it and then withdraw the same money five seconds later and put it into the machine.  </p>
<p>I don't see why you couldn't have an ATM in your house, but you would lose money on the transaction fees. I'm sure there is a way to setup a machine that would just spit out money at your hearts desire, seems like an expensive novelty item though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: I'm a controller at a bank. </p>
<p>ATMs work like a grocery store. It's all volume. The cost to pay someone to refill the ATM will likely cost as much as you make on fees unless you are in a very active ATM location (casino, strip club, low income grocery store, tourist area of a major city) for most ATMs, 10 transactions in a day would be on the high side. At an average of about $80 per transaction, that's $800/day. Most ATMs hold about 6-8k so you are refilling about 2.5 times a month. </p>
<p>Now you're sayin &quot;well you're making $35 a day! It doesn't cost that much to refill!&quot; But ATMs only make money on non-clients of the operating bank. If you bank with ABC Bank and use only their ATMs, you don't pay fees. The bank makes nothing, the ATM network doesn't get a part of that fee. So really it's more like $10/day/machine, split between the bank and the processor. For someone to use an armored car to transport cash is about $100/hr. So that breaks even. The bank basically gets free advertising out of it. We have a nice sign that everyone has to walk by and our clients get free usage of an ATM. </p>
<p>The Operator gets half of the fee revenue and that covers their costs to keep people employed to maintain, clean, set up, move, all of the machines. They basically break even on the day-to-day keeping up of the machines. </p>
<p>What they do have is an &quot;interchange fee&quot; paid to the operator. A few cents per transaction on every transaction paid to them by the card company to use their card. So our bank uses the same network operator as every other local bank. And while we only have 15 machines with our name on them, the operator has about 1500 machines. They're doing 15,000 transactions per day, making about 6 cents per transaction. That's $900, 365 days a year. Or about $350,000. The more machines they can add, the more that base number goes up, the more they make. </p>
<p>To give a more complete answer to your other questions, the answer is both yes and no. </p>
<p>A bar can buy an ATM, contract with an ATM company, and fill the ATM themselves. But this is VERY frowned upon. Filling your own ATM in a privately owned establishment is basically a big red arrow that points at your place with a banner flying behind a plane that says &quot;WERE LAUNDERING MONEY IN HERE!&quot;. </p>
<p>So yes, you CAN do it, but expect to be audited and expect your bank to probably not bank you if they find out. The regulators go apeshit on banks that bank people that own ATMs to the point where it literally costs more to bank them than the bank makes. The bank has to basically hire someone to just monitor those accounts. So don't do that. If you want an ATM at your bar, go to the bank and ask them to put one in for you. It will be free to you and breakeven to the bank. Hell, if you're a good enough client and have enough volume, you may make a few bucks on it. But not much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So we have ATMs at the casino I work at so it isn't quite the same as bars but I can shed some light.</p>
<p>The owner of the ATM is the one who collects the fees, services the machines and refills them (via armored car service).  We drive enough business that we don't need to pay someone to have those ATMs placed.  The owners make money because we create a demand enough to make any machines placed profitable.  In addition most of the money withdrawn is spent in the building so the casino benefits from having them placed there.</p>
<p>So we are completely separated from the machines in that sense.  It benefits business to have them all over but we make no money directly from their use. </p>
<p>I doubt very much you could have an ATM at your house outside of maybe just buying an old out of order machine.  It wouldn't be worth it to the company to place one there and stocking money into it wouldn't be a safe investment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can actually answer this. I used to manage a store that had private atms. We acquired them through a third party who handled maintenance and all the specifics with the banks. But they were filled by store management with company cash that was recorded on a spreadsheet that was audited by one of the accounts payable people every day. We made a substantial amount of the fee that added to store profits. So basically it just was added in as a cash inflow on our balance sheet. Unless it broke then you had to eat the cost and it screwed your quarter to a degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Doesn't say why she has to quit the royal family, but from what I see elsewhere it is outlined in a 1947 law modifying succession rules. I looked up that law and couldn't find anything referencing &quot;commoner&quot;s or marriage. I would imagine &quot;nobles&quot; or whatever equivalent aristocracy is considered &quot;valid&quot; for marriage, but it seems that nobility in Japan was also abolished in 1947.</p>
<p>Who exactly is a valid spouse to remain in the Japanese royal family? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan still has aristocratic families, even if they have a lot less power than they used to and lost their official titles. The families were not killed off, and they still tend to have their land holdings and businesses and do tend to hold very influential positions in the economy and political landscape. </p>
<p>And I am not sure about Japan, but you are generally allowed to marry extended royal family members (cousins) as well as the royal families of other nations, as well as the aristocracy of other nations. </p>
<p>Edit: With Japan specifically it seems that women leave the royal family regardless of the status of who they marry and join that family. They are only allowed to be a member of the Royal family (with the titles) if they are unmarried or are married to a male of the Royal family. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a result of frustration. Watched a study documenting frustration in animals; They basically taught a squirrel how to open a box with a nut in it, but when they made it so that the box wouldn't open or the nut was gone, the squirrel would become frustrated and try to break the box or throw it around. It was theorized that frustration in animals is a result of subverted expectations and in order to &quot;work around&quot; the new problem, excessive force was impulsive. If you can't open the box, break it. This mechanism is probably enough for regular animals, but is definitely obsolete when said animals start producing complicated and delicate machines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Nowadays, everything is solid state but back when I was a kid, transistors and diodes were in vacuum tubes. These tubes plugged into backplanes. When the device got static in it or got to where it didn't receive a signal very well, hitting it on the top or the side would jostle things internally and make those tubes get a better connection in the backplane. The tubes had 5, 6, 7 and more connectors, so getting them all to make a good connection required some tweaking by hitting sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My specific project was actually perfecting the method of giving mice cancer to use them as models for cancer treatments. </p>
<p>Basically, we order cancer cells from a company that has made a consistent, pure cell line. We feed the cells a nutrient-rich cell food and let them multiply on a plate, then inject the cells right into the mouse and let them do their cancer thing. For our purposes, we injected the mice in the ear since it has a nice supply of blood and the mice couldn't mess with the growing tumors too much (they tend to scratch/gnaw at them because tumors smell weird to mice).  </p>
<p>You can also use a &quot;seed&quot; or &quot;donor&quot; mouse, where you do the same process as above, let the tumor get freakin' huge, euthanize the mouse, cut out the tumor, then mash it into a tumor smoothie and inject THAT into another mouse. This supposedly works better as the cells are adapted to living mice already, but don't quote me on that. </p>
<p>Since our project was about measuring immune responses, our mice had fully functioning immune systems. This means that half the time the mice actually resisted the cancer, which was a bummer for our study but good for the mice I guess lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

An atomic bomb is a source of intense heat, what we normally associate with the explosion is the expansion of the surrounding air. In an overly simplified explanation, if there is no air you only get heat but not an outward explosive force. Yes rocks vaporize and all that, but his is less of a factor.</p>
<p>In fact the area around the test device is keep in a vacuum, in the museum you can clearly see the vacuum vessel and vacuum pumps associated to maintain the neighboring area free of air and water. Water creates steam. It is important to keep water and things that can be vaporized away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're in luck - this year's Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews has a special issue on <a href="http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/vol_12/" target="_blank">animal music perception</a> just for you! All these articles are free, though they are written for a scientific audience so YMMV.</p>
<p>I'll nutshell just a little: different species have different demonstrated abilities for discriminating between different parts of music. For example, songbirds have near-&quot;perfect pitch&quot; when it comes to tone frequency - however, they don't seem to pay attention to relative pitch in the way humans do. Non-songbird species, like pigeons, tend not to do very well on auditory perception tasks, but can be taught to discriminate between chords. There are lots of anecdotes about animals liking music, but few of these withstand scrutiny - one exception being Snowball the parakeet, well-known for his superb sense of rhythm, which is impressive but difficult to reproduce. All of this ends up raising the question, &quot;Why should animals care about music?&quot;</p>
<p>Because what we mean by &quot;music&quot; is &quot;human music&quot;. It's noises made by humans to entertain or otherwise interact with other humans. It has a certain amount of intrinsic value to us, but should that carry over to other animals? And if it has little value, should we expect other animals to react to it similarly or at all?</p>
<p>A colleague of mine did a study with orangutans at a prominent zoo, whose zookeepers insisted on playing loud music because the &quot;orangutans liked it&quot;. My colleague demonstrated that if orangutans were given a choice between different kinds of music or just silence, they chose silence. Of course, the zookeepers still play the music - it was never about the orangs and only about making the humans feel better. This is at the heart of our anthropomorphism of studying nonhuman animals - we are always going to carry our human baggage with us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>When indoors you're completely changing a plants environment. There is so much that can affect a plant in how it - takes up nutrients, water and light. </p>
<p>When you have a plant that in its native habitat gets a lot of light and a lot of warmth and you have it indoors with considerably lower light and temperature (when bought young they are more likely to adjust without going into shock) it is going to have to adjust to those conditions meaning - since it has less light it will need less water and less nutrients, the plant is not using all its resources up like it would so it doesn't need to &quot;re-up&quot; because it really hasn't lost much. </p>
<p>So even though it uses less there are many factors that affect the soil- AC will dry out a well ventilated area rather quickly depending on the pot type. Also many plants indoors lack humidity they'd have in their native range. </p>
<p>Having a larger pot for small roots is bad because it will not dry out as evenly, the top will become more dry while it could still be sopping wet at the bottom. Seeing that you go and water the plant again when it doesn't need it and the plant becomes water logged, suffocates and dies.  </p>
<p>The killing of indoor plants by overwatering is #1 most common, especially since when you bring a plant home, unless you have the same environment as the place you got it from in your home, it is going to go through some shock, many people don't know this and see their plant a little sad after they just got it and then panic and water the plant. </p>
<p>Plants need time to adapt. You can't just keep changing things and expect to see results in a day or two. Often times even if they look a little sad it's best to leave them be, especially if they have enough water, light and humidity. They need time. </p>
<p>Starting small when buying a plant in general is much better practice, for so many reasons. Just don't put it in a huge pot :)</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, didn't think this would get this big lol Thanks so much for such interest in plants and horticulture! </p>
<p>To be clear I was mostly talking about house plants in this, since they are a plant that is usually not of the climate where you live and is why they're a house plant because the can't live outside. (But not always- in FL many &quot;house plants&quot; can do better outside, depending on the plant still) </p>
<p>Doing my best to answer questions- you guys are lucky I'm sick and aren't busy outside :P</p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/VXypP" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple pages from one of the best houseplant books I've seen and had. There is helpful info that can be used for other plant types as well. You can get the book off <a href="https://www.amazon.com/House-Plant-Expert-D-G-Hessayon/dp/0903505355#immersive-view_1504415707650" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, its rather inexpensive and 100% worth it.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Forgot to stress the fact that many of our tap water had loads of chlorine and chloramine in it. The chlorine can evaporate out if the water is left out before use but the chloramine will not.  These are things that can really affect a plant over time. Along with mineral build up from water and fertilizer. <a href="https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/watering-and-soluble-salts-houseplants" target="_blank">Here's</a> another good resource.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a confined space, like a properly sized pot, nutrients and fluids are easily accessible by roots.</p>
<p>In a less confined space, the roots may have to work harder to reach the moist soil and fertilizer, depending on the distribution.</p>
<p>Plants out in the wild are quite different.</p>
<p>There's a few different ways plants reproduce.  Some &quot;pup&quot;.  Pups are children that grown directly off the parents and eventually develop their own root system. </p>
<p>In such an instance, the parent provides nutrients until the plant can fend for itself.</p>
<p>Another reproduction method is through seeds.  Seeds won't germinate and grow if conditions aren't favorable.  In other words, when you see seeded plants in the wild, you're only seeing the survivors who were in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Also worth considering: depending on where in the world you live, wild plants don't really have unlimited soil.  The truth is, the healthiest, most nutrient rich growing medium only covers the first couple of inches of soil.  Leaves, detritus, and other organic decompositions all provide the sustainability plants need.  All this good stuff is created at or juuuuust below the surface.  That means there's a trickle-down effect but the further down you go, the less nutrients are available.  </p>
<p>So, relatively speaking, wild &quot;pots&quot; are only 4 inches deep, not unlimitedly deep.  Due to competition between other nearby plants all fighting for the same nutrients, that pot is only inches wide as well, and not endlesslyâ open space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have read through many of the replies but have not come across one that hit on a key element of your question.  There are variables involved, relative to your question.  Different types of plants require different care and will do best with specific mediums (soil mix).  Some species of plants are water hogs (such as Spathiphyllum/Peace Lily) and some donât care how much water they receive (such as Sansevieria/Mother-in-laws Tongue).  My Professor from the University of Illinois had said that each of us could grow plants on rocks as long as the conditions were correct.  Meaning proper light, nutrients, temperature and air were at a level for the requirement of that particular plant.  Thus it is very important to choose the correct potting mix for your plant.</p>
<p>I used to be a Florist, Grower and Interiorscaper.  In fact I was one of the pioneers to help develop the Interiorscape industry.  The most challenging was putting live plants into malls, restaurants and office spaces and is probably the most relevant to your question.  I was always battling those who would pour drinks (coffee and soda) into the plants like it was a sink drain.  My way around this was to put a cone shaped piece of waxed cardboard around the plant and covered it with mulch material.  Then when a person was pouring a drink into the pot it would run over the cone and down into the outer decorative container.  This worked very well to help control the liquids that were entering the medium.  </p>
<p>As for container size, it generally does not matter to the plant as long as it is not over watered and moving to a very large pot, increase the likelihood that a homeowner would make the mistake of watering the plant.  By continuing to water at the same frequency with a higher quantity of water (to compensate for the larger pot) would almost guarantee that the plant will develop wet feet.     However, some species of plants will not flower or take-off (start to grow) until the roots have taken an abrupt turn in the medium such as growing out and making contact with inner sidewalls of the growing container.  The main reason for using smaller containers within a growing operation (greenhouse) is cost per square foot.  As a plant progresses to its salable size the plants are bumped up in pot sizes based on the determination of the Head Grower.  Having plants in containers that are relative to their size also helps the grower to have much more control over the crop.  They can easily vary moisture, adjust nutrient or micro-nutrients levels or if levels go too high, it is much easier to leach the medium when dealing with smaller pot sizes.  When plants are placed into a home or interiorscape situation.  The medium volume is important so that the plant is easiest to care for.  Larger pots will help a plant grow larger as usually determined by what is called âRoot-to-Shoot Ratioâ.  </p>
<p>I have found that bottom watering really helps in the Ineriorscape industry as plants are typically cared for and watered once per week in most cases.  Bottom watering is a whole different subject as a micro climate is created within the growing medium.  Many plants do very well with bottom watering but require a lot of work to set-up right  The medium in the container is generally layered with different mixes to properly achieve this type of micro climate that the plant will adapt to.  The setup works incredibly well for plants in low light areas and when plants are located in breezy places. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you find yourself using wrap text as the predominant setting in excel, you probably aren't using it properly. Wrap text should be the exception, not the general rule. It's most useful for #s, not text. It's not a word document application.</p>
<p>In fact, if you find yourself manually changing a lot of things in excel instead of using the innate functions, you're probably doing more harm than good. For example, manually changing row and column sizes instead of AutoFit.</p>
<p>Source: someone who reviews a lot of excel files for a living and also uses excel to summarize all the fucked up things on said excel files</p>
<p>Edit: oh my what a clusterfuck this has become. This is ELI5. I gave an answer that assumes someone is a noob. Are there people who can use excel in a way that's probably not intended and still get it to do what they want? Yes. I can write an entire research paper on excel and have it come out like it was done in word. But I wouldn't do that because it's fucking stupid. I get it that you probably want to use excel as a word application because word doesn't do a good job of formatting charts and such. This is a big question for me every time I do work as well. &quot;Is this work more suitable in word, excel, or some other?&quot; This is why I used words specifically like probably, exception, etc. I will say, if you're encouraging a complete noob to go into excel recklessly using it halfway as a word app, you are ABSOLUTELY doing them a disfavor. People like this get laughed at in the office setting, because they make fucked up spreadsheets based on never having learned how to properly make them in the first place. Further, the sad and ironic thing is, many people who think they're great at spreadsheets are absolutely horrid at them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our experiences differ.  Wanting text to not wrap is very common.  If you have a several columns and of numbers and of short text, and one column of long text, you generally want the long text to be there so you can &quot;drill down&quot; into it.  That is, it is present so you can view it as an exception, but you don't want it to distort the layout of the entire sheet when you aren't looking at one of those exceptions.  If the goal was to have the entire sheet dominated by the layout needs of a few exceptionally long cells, why would you be using a spreadsheet in the first place, rather than a word processor?</p>
<p>Also, our experiences differ on what the default actually is.  In excel, the default when opening a txt or csv file is for it to have most of the cells not wrap, but then a few scattered cells, for no apparent rhyme or reason, get automagically set to wrap.  So to get back to sanity, you have select the entire spreadsheet by hitting ctrl-A, (or ctrl-A-A, or ctrl-A-A-A, depending on version), then hunt down where they hid the wrap button this time, and then click it twice (the first time wraps everything, the second time unwraps everything, including the things that shouldn't have been wrapped in the first place but were).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people who put long things into a cell aren't planning to keep that cell it's default 8.43 width. Overflow is helpful for seeing how wide a column needs to be. Since Excel's primary function is dealing with numbers, those numbers aren't likely to overflow terribly far. And even with a paragraph of text, if the default was to wrap text an 8.43 width cell, you'd end up with a row that was ridiculously tall and might not fit on the height of your monitor.</p>
<p>If you are anticipating needing to wrap text, you can select all the cells (the button left of the A column/above the 1 row) and set all the cells to wrap text. I like to middle align my cells too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
