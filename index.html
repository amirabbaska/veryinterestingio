<p>For general heat conservation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huddling in groups with a constant rotation from outer towards inner and back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL7O5O7U4Gs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=159" target="_blank">Youtube Link</a></li>
<li>Thick, tightly overlapping down feathers</li>
<li>Good general body design to minimize surface area exposed</li>
<li>Thick blubber</li>
</ul>
<p>For feet specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to dilate vessels and control flow</li>
<li>
<p>very little, if any, muscle in the feet. Movement is controlled by tendons which attach to muscles located deeper in the warm areas of the body <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5tflsl/eli5what_keeps_antarctic_penguins_from_having/ddmcvqf/" target="_blank">Penguin skeleton</a> - from u/Wolfy21_</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keeping them tucked under their warmer skin</p>
</li>
<li>counter-current heat exchange: veins and arteries are organized closely together in a way that allows the blood leaving the warm heart to run near the colder blood from the feet before it actually reaches the feet. Benefit is that it warms the colder blood before it reaches the main body and the warm blood loses its initial heat to other blood instead of ice/air. <a href="https://teamatlantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ducks-heat-exchange.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>, credit to u/wildflower8872 from a similar thread years ago</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me tell you a little story that I learned in nursing school.</p>
<p>I actually asked one of my nursing professors this question too, in a joking fashion because I told him I've always wondered about it since I was a kid, and why penguins didn't melt through the ice.</p>
<p>He went on to tell me an amazing explanation as to why a penguin's foot is like a human testicle. In human biology the testicles sit outside of the body so that sperm can be produced because at a internal temperature of 98.6 degrees they cannot produce sperm. However sitting outside the body exposure to colder air can also decrease the Bloods temperature enough that when entering back into the body it could cause a person to go into shock. So in the human testicle there exists a cross current system where the artery coming out of the body into the testicles passes by the vein that returns back in thus cooling the internal hot arterial blood when it comes out, and warming back up the cold venous blood when it goes back into the body.</p>
<p>The same exact cross-current system exists in a penguin's foot so that the arterial blpod can be cooled down to a temperature that the feet can not melt through the ice and then warmed back up on its way in so it doesn't cause Penguins to go into shock.</p>
<p>And that my friends is why a penguin's foot is like a testicle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Essentially, it allows them to retain their core body temperatures by &quot;allowing&quot; their extremities to be more cold than the rest of their body.     </p>
<p>Frostbite in general happens as a result of the body restricting vessels in very cold extremities to maintain its core temperature, instead of allowing the cold blood to recirculate. Penguins, arctic foxes, and others don't have this issue, because they have counter current exchange systems in place, in which the returning blood is re-warmed by the oxygenated blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might enjoy the book &quot;Why Don't Penguins Feet Freeze?&quot; I bought it and thought it'd never come in handy, so here's my chance to shine!</p>
<p>Part of the answer has a biochemical explantation.
A binding of oxygen to haemoglobin is normally a strongly exothermic reaction: an amount of heat (DH) is released as the molecules attach. The same amount of heat is usually absorbed in the reverse reaction. However, as oxygenation and deoxygenation occur in different parts of the organism, changes in molecular environment (e.g.: acidity) can result in heat loss or heat gain in the process.
With regards to cold peripheral tissues like the feet, DH is much smaller than humans.  This has 2 benefits. Heat is absorbed by the birds' haemoglobin when it's deoxygenated. The second is a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics. In any reversible reaction (e.g.: absorb/release of oxygen by haemoglobin) a low temperature encourages the reaction in the exothermic direction. So at low temps, oxygen is absorbed more strongly by most species' haemoglobin, and released less easily. A modest DH means that in cold tissue the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin doesn't become so high that the oxygen cannot disassociate.</p>
<p>2 mechanisms are at work; penguins can control the rate of blood flow to the feet by varying the diameter of arterial vessels supplying the blood. They also have 'counter-current exchangers' at the top of the legs. Heat flows from warm to cold blood, so little of it is carried down to the feet.
In winter, their feet are held a degree or two above freezing - to minimise heat loss, whilst avoiding frostbite. (Ducks &amp; geese are similar, but if held indoors for weeks in warm conditions and then released, their feet may freeze, because their physiology has adapted to warmth which causes blood flow to be virtually cut off and their foot temp falls below freezing)</p>
<p>Tldr; they've adapted to the cold and can lessen blood supply to the feet. They also  hold their feet at a steady temp, a degree or two above freezing.
Less heat is absorbed by the birds haemoglobin when it's deoxygenated. The low temperatures encourage an even more exothermic reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you watch a real chef, you'll see they are very careful about what they touch.  They're not going to rub their nose/face and not wash their hands.  If they touch something that would contaminate something else (raw chicken for instance) they'll immediately wash their hands before they do anything else.</p>
<p>Gloves block your the transfer from stuff on your hands to things you touch, and vice versa, no more.  If you wear gloves and handle raw meat, or money, or any of the other unhygenic things and never change your gloves you're actually more of a problem.</p>
<p>But for some reason, there seems to be this belief that gloves are a panacea for anything unsanitary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Using gloves is only really helpful if you don't want to contact the things you are handling with your bare skin such as with caustic chemicals, for some reason you can't clean your hands with soap and water (which brings up the question of how your work surfaces are cleaned), and if for some reason a hand has an open wound. In those cases you bandage the wound completely and then put a glove over that. Customers not wanting skin to touch their food is purely psychological, there is no increased danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have my food handlers managers license. In my course we actually did a demonstration that showed the amount of germs that you can trap underneath the gloves. Most health inspectors prefer that you do not use gloves as they trap germs, foster a lovely moist warm environment for bacteria to flourish in, and use of gloves actually discourages hand washing.
We wash our hands constantly and mine get dry and they hurt from doing it so much in the winter. But you are better off that way, promise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Is the cook wearing the glove to protect the consumer from the person preparing food, or to protect the cook from the food he's preparing?  Sometimes, it's hard to tell. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole built from antimatter or one built from matter with the same mass are identical.</p>
<p>The quantity that distinguishes matter from antimatter is the baryon number. It is the total number of baryons (like protons and neutrons) minus the number of antibaryons. Baryon number is conserved in the standard model and that is what you would recognize as &quot;conservation of matter&quot; in some sense, and the reason for which the proton is stable in the SM: it is the lightest baryon and so it cannot decay to anything else because it needs to preserve its baryon number of +1. So the proton can only release its mass in energy for lighter particles if it meets an antibaryon carrying -1 baryon number, so they total to 0 and they can produce lighter non-baryon particles such as photons or mesons. That's why matter &amp; antimatter annihilate.</p>
<p>(A similar argument works with leptons, with a thing called lepton number).</p>
<p>These, baryon and lepton #, however, are not conservation laws with any specific deep or fundamental justification behind, they are just accidental symmetries of the standard model. (Unlike, for example, charge). As soon as you step out of the SM, these are violated. Black holes are well outside the SM and do not care in the slightest about baryon number. Black holes don't have a well-defined baryon number and throwing a proton or an anti-proton* into a black hole produces the same final black hole, whose only macroscopic distinguishing properties are mass, charge and angular momentum. After a lot of time the black hole has evaporated into Hawking radiation which is made of standard model particles, and the final baryon number of the radiation does not have any discernible relation with the baryon number of all the stuff that fell in. </p>
<p>* woops forgot: except for charge, charge is conserved even by BHs. So maybe you can throw a hydrogen atom (baryon # 1, charge 0) or an anti-hydrogen atom (baryon # -1, charge 0). Or neutron/antineutron.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole can be considered to be two separate things, one a phenomenon of matter, one a phenomenon of space-time.</p>
<p>A black hole is formed from a very high-density collection of mass. Typically this is something like a collapsing neutron star or stellar core. The composition of the matter inside the black hole after the formation of the event horizon is a very complicated question, and something that theorists still haven't decided on completely.</p>
<p>However, the nature of the black hole to the rest of the Universe is very much different. From the outside the black hole is no longer a phenomenon of matter, it's primarily a phenomenon of space-time. What's &quot;inside&quot; the black hole is almost entirely irrelevant to the rest of the Universe. This is because there is no way for the matter trapped inside a black hole to influence the rest of the Universe, except gravitationally (and electrostatically if you want to get technical).</p>
<p>Many people have a fundamentally classical idea of how a black hole works. Generally something along the lines of an object with an escape velocity higher than light, so that even light can't escape from the black hole. This ignores the fundamental nature of black holes, however, which is closely tied into relativity and the behavior of space-time. Within a black hole's event horizon there is simply &quot;no way out&quot;. The event horizon is a one way door, once you pass it there are no space-time trajectories that go forward in time which leave the black hole (in fact, that do anything other than eventually travel to the singularity). This is important to understand because it recasts a black hole from a weird phenomenon related to light somehow to a phenomenon that directly affects the nature of, well, the fabric of reality. A black hole is like a little pocket Universe with no way out.</p>
<p>Once you shift to that conception some of the details of black holes might make sense. For example, whether a black hole is made of matter or anti-matter (or, indeed, entirely of photons) is irrelevant externally. Nothing that happens inside the black hole can escape the event horizon. If, hypothetically, you had one black hole that was formed from a collapsing star and another black hole that was formed from a collapsing anti-star merging them would still necessarily result in just a bigger black hole (mass-energy is just mass-energy). What happens inside the black holes isn't something that can affect the event horizons themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question.
A few things that I'd like to point to which I think might contribute to the discussion.
The relative degree of consonance/dissonance is directly associated with the number of cycles that are required before 2 (or more) notes repeat their pattern. e.g. in a unison it is a 1:1 ratio and so the two notes are considered consonant. Whereas the tritone/A4/D5 is an irrational number which when we use the same criteria takes the biggest number of cycles before resolution/repetition of the pattern compared to other intervals. Some other intervals, depending on the tuning system used, are 5:4 or 3:2 which resolve faster than the tritone and so, are described as consonant. You can complete the mathematics for any chord and this holds up to any cultural ordering of consonance/dissonance that I am aware of.
When comparing the major key to the minor key in western music, we have a set of melodic and harmonic structures that are common to both. What is happening here is that these two keys, while both considered consonant have slightly different variations. They are tied together and comparable largely due to the dominant -&gt; tonic (V-I, whatever you want to call it) which gives us a cadence. When you compare the harmonies found in these two keys and the intervals used to create the melodies, the minor key is slightly more dissonant than the major key. Given this is the case, and making some assumptions that brains all process patterns in a similar way (big assumption, i know) I think we have an argument for a natural predisposition due to slower pattern recognition in the minor key. Perhaps the minor key lends itself to slower tempo so as to allow time for melodies/harmonies to process, this may make the association stronger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the answers are quite complete / accurate.</p>
<p>Chinese characters can be ordered in two main ways, by pronunciation and by radical. The sound of each character in Mandarin can be written out using Roman letters (a phonetic system called pinyin), which can be arranged alphabetically, A to Z. For example, the character 你 (you) is listed under &quot;ni&quot;, and the character 她 (she) under &quot;ta&quot;. Mandarin also has 4 tones, so for each sound such as &quot;ni&quot;, there will be further ordering &quot;ni1&quot;, &quot;ni2&quot;, &quot;ni3&quot;, and &quot;ni4&quot;, where the number indicates tone. So 你 is actually under &quot;ni3&quot; and 她 under &quot;ta1&quot;. This ordering is useful when you know how to say the character, but don't know/remember how exactly to write it.</p>
<p>For radical, things are slightly more complicated. Most Chinese characters can be split into a &quot;main&quot; part and... the other part. The main part, called the radical, often gives a general idea to the meaning of the character. If you know Chinese, you can easily pick out which part is the radical (it can be on the left, right, top, bottom, left-bottom, top-left, 3-side-surrounding, 4-side-surrounding, etc!). At the start of every dictionary is an index -- a list of all the radicals. Under each radical, you see a list of ALL the characters having that radical (there are very very many). Take your time to find the one you're looking for, and it tells you which page to go to for that character. This kind of ordering is useful when you know what the character looks like but not how it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Pros and cons</strong>: the radical ordering works everywhere, as long as you can read the written characters; the pronunciation ordering only works in a particular spoken Chinese language. Since Mandarin is the largest spoken language (not in Hong Kong!), that's what dictionaries always use.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>. You may ask, how do you arrange all the characters under the same pronunciation (for example 思斯絲司私撕廝 or 顆科柯棵苛)? Or how do you arrange them under the same radical (確礦碳碼 or 開關問聞)? Heck, how do you arrange the radicals in the first place (亻宀忄口火馬鳥)? In this case, we use the number of strokes. Basically, it's the number of times you have to lift the tip of your pencil to write the character, according to a standard way of writing that everyone must learn in school. This save you some time, but there can still be dozens of characters with the same radical and the same number of strokes. Check out and play with the <a href="http://unicode.org/charts/unihanrsindex.html" target="_blank">radical-stroke index</a></p>
<p><strong>BONUS2</strong>. Your title is not entirely accurate. Chinese is a language family made up of a wide range of different regional languages that cannot understand each other when spoken. Mandarin is just the name of a spoken language. There is only ONE written language, so the same character can be pronounced differently but still understood by everyone. (Except Mainland China writes most characters a bit differently than Hong Kong and Taiwan. We won't get into that here.) Since dictionaries are about the written language, you should write &quot;Chinese&quot; instead of &quot;Mandarin&quot; in the title.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Chinese characters can be ordered in two different ways:
(1) Romanised pronunciation -&gt; tone number -&gt; number of strokes
(2) Number of strokes of radical -&gt; radical -&gt; number of remaining strokes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Once you find all the 女 entries, they're organized by number of extra strokes.  So 女 is three strokes and 子 is also three strokes, so you can look it up that way.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The appearance of a character and its pronunciation has less correlation than other writing systems, so in Chinese the following two are both possible: knowing a character but not its pronunciation, and knowing a pronunciation and meaning but not knowing how to write it.</p>
<p>For the pronunciation to character index, some dictionaries have that as an appendix. The harder problem is looking up a character based on appearance with no knowledge of its pronunciation.</p>
<p>Every Chinese character is written using one or more strokes, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_order" target="_blank">stroke order</a> is more or less predictable. Furthermore, most Chinese characters are composed of simpler characters. Some of the simpler characters are considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)" target="_blank">&quot;radicals&quot;</a>, which you can think of as a &quot;meta character&quot;. There is a fixed number of radicals. </p>
<ul>
<li>First there is an index of radicals, sorted by ascending stroke count, since radicals themselves are also characters.</li>
<li>Then all characters are sorted first by radicals (in the same order as the index), then by the remaining stroke count.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are irregularities that come with the radical system, so here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>語 (&quot;language&quot;) has a total of 14 strokes. Its radical 言 (&quot;speech&quot;) happens to occur on the left-hand side. 言 has 7 strokes, so first you look up 7, and find arrive at the page where all 7-stroke radicals are. Once you locate 言, it tells you which page to start for all the 言-radical characters. Once you flip to that page, there are 14 - 7 = 7 strokes remaining, so you keep flipping forward until you get to the 言-7 section, and that is where you will find 語 as well as any other 17-stroke whose radical is 言.</li>
<li>情 (&quot;emotion&quot;) has a total of 11 strokes. Its radical 心 (&quot;heart&quot;) also happens to occur on the left-hand side. The inconsistency is that in radical form, it is 3 strokes, but in isolated form, it is 4. A lot of radicals diverge between radical form and isolated form, e.g. 水 (&quot;water&quot;) is the isolated form and the left-hand side of 河 (&quot;river&quot;), 氵 is the radical form. For the purpose of looking up the radical 心 itself, you use 4. But for the purpose of calculating the remaining stroke count, you use 3, so 11 - 3 = 8. The character 情 can be found in the 心-8 section.</li>
<li>慶 (&quot;celebrate&quot;) has a total of 15 strokes. Its radical 心 (&quot;heart&quot;) is in the middle of the character. Not every character's radical is on the left-hand side! In this case the actual occurrence is in regular form, so 15 - 4 = 11, so 慶 is in the 心-11 section.</li>
<li>花 (&quot;flower&quot;) has a total of 8 strokes. Its radical 艸 (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;) is on the top of the character, in the radical form of 艹 with 4 strokes. This is a double whammy! Not only is the radical not on the left, but the radical itself has two different forms just like 心 (&quot;heart&quot;). Where you would find 艸 is a more interesting question: some dictionaries say 艸 itself is 6 strokes, while some prefer saying 艹 is 4 strokes. They are the same radical in two different forms, so it's a matter of preference and standards. The character 花 can be found in the 艸-4 section.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The radical can reside anywhere in the character, but the most common locations are on the left or on the top. The right or the middle are less common, but it can happen.</li>
<li>A radical may have two different forms. One is the isolated form, when you write the radical as its own character. The other is in radical form, when you write the radical as part of another character. Depending on how common the isolated form is, one may look more alien than another. For example the isolated form 水 (&quot;water&quot;) is just as common as its radical counterpart 氵, but you seldom see 艸 (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;) other than in the context of radicals and the radical counterpart 艹 occurs much more frequently as part of other characters, e.g. 花 (&quot;flower&quot;), 草 (&quot;grass&quot;), 藝 (&quot;art&quot;).</li>
<li>How many strokes a radical has is trickier if it has two forms. The Taiwanese Ministry of Education, for example, prefers the stroke count of the radical form.</li>
<li>How many strokes a character has is less contested, but can happen. This is due to disagreement between whether a stroke is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_(CJKV_character)" target="_blank">simple or compound</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going back to the two different problems whether you know the character's pronunciation: on a desktop computer it is very common to input a character's pronunciation and let the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method" target="_blank">IME</a> automatically choose and / or let you select the right character. Other IMEs work by letting enter a series of radicals (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie_input_method" target="_blank">Cangjie</a>) or straight up let you use a trackpad or touch surface to handwrite characters for recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to have to come at this from the other angle:</p>
<p>The reason that poor people tend to get screwed by the Legal System is because they are saddled with a Public Defender. </p>
<p>Public Defenders aren't bad Lawyers, they're usually <em>shockingly</em> competent at their jobs. <em>However</em>, due to their small numbers, Public Defenders are required to take on an <em>insane</em> number of cases. Public Defenders <em>usually</em> don't have much time to prepare for a case. Most can't afford to spend more than 15 minutes on a single case, and are <em>insanely lucky</em> if they can afford an hour of preparation for a single case. </p>
<p>It's virtually impossible to win a case without time to prepare. You need to research the relevant Laws, and <strong>all</strong> of the Case Law that is binding in your Jurisdiction. Then you need to review the Prosecution's Evidence, and get Evidence that was illegally acquired or questionable thrown out. You also need time to coach your client on how they should behave in court.</p>
<p>It's <em>physically impossible</em> to accomplish <strong>half</strong> of the preparations required in an hour, much less 15 minutes. As a result, most Public Defenders recommend that <em>most</em> of their Clients just take whatever plea-deal is offered by the Prosecution. It'll be a lighter punishment than they'd receive if they go to court and lose, and the odds of not losing are <em>basically zero</em>.</p>
<p>The exception to that <em>most</em> are clients who <em>can</em> realistically be defended. This generally means that the Case against the Client is full of holes to the point where the <em>Jury Members</em> would probably catch the procedural errors, or relies upon evidence that's <em>blatantly</em> inadmissible in court.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, Wealthy People can afford to hire a Private Lawyer. These Lawyers can control their case-load, ensuring that they have <strong>all</strong> the Preparation Time that they need. They can take their time, do their research, coach their client, and pick apart the Prosecution's case.</p>
<p>Even if the client is blatantly guilty, the Lawyer can actually hold the Court to the Letter of the Law regarding sentences... but this is going to require some explanation.</p>
<p>Most Judges in the United States, outside of the Federal Circuits, are <em>elected</em>. Because of our current culture, it's best for a Judge to maintain a public image of being &quot;Tough on Crime.&quot; If you pass down a relatively light sentence on someone, you can bet your ass that your Opponent in the next election will plaster it all over their campaign ads. As a result, Judges are incentivized to be as harsh as possible when it comes to sentencing.</p>
<p>This trickles up to the Federal Circuit as well. Federal Judges are generally drawn from State Judges, and getting promoted up in the Federal Circuits requires you to be Nominated to that position by the President of the United States. <em>Being</em> a Candidate for a Federal Bench (which you can hold for life) requires you to hold onto your State Bench. Moving up in the Federal Circuits requires the President to move you up... and the President has incentives to put Judges that are &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; onto the Federal Benches.</p>
<p>However, a Good Lawyer can hold a Judge's feet to the fire when it comes to sentencing. Excessive Sentences can be used as a justification for Appeals, and having your judgements <em>overturned</em> by a higher court hurts your chances for advancement <strong>even more</strong> than not being &quot;Tough on Crime.&quot; A State Judge up for re-election can spin not being &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; as being &quot;Merciful,&quot; but it's difficult to spin &quot;Incompetent Judge's Decision Overturned by Appellate Court&quot; into something vaguely positive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Additionally, rich and famous people often have options less well off people don't.  A prosecutor might be willing, for example, to let a famous person off with &quot;community service&quot; because they think kids will actually listen to them and not, say, do drugs if they go around telling people not to, something that wouldn't be true of your average accused. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My brother is a piece of shit wife/kid beater and he ALWAYS seems to get off easy. He's broke as shit and usually drunk and usually unemployed. Whenever he gets arrested, and he has been arrested at least 4 times now (that I know of) its usually for beating his wife or fighting with neighbors/strangers or some other gang related shit, at least 1 weapons charge. Either way, the most jail time he has gotten was 3 months, 3 glorious drama free months. Then business as usual when he gets out.</p>
<p>Once he and his wife apparently got pulled over for driving erratically (he was drunk) and the cop gave him a stern lecture and asked his sober wife to drive instead than sent them on their way. Oh his kids were in the car. Good times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For ground round, we would take straight peeled knuckles from the back hip area, and add in the same trimmings.  We would run 85/15 for chuck, and 80/20 for round.  We added less fat to the chuck, as we were also putting in steaks with fat included, plus the chuck cuts themselves have fat throughout.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My butcher does math and then uses a scale. </p>
<p>A bit of information on the process.  Our grocery store gets beef in two ways.  One is a tube of ground beef, the other is vacuum sealed primal cuts.  From your primals you get items like a sizzler steaks, rib steaks, spencer steaks, bottom round roasts, et cetera.  In order to get these from the primal, we use an item like a band saw or a knife to cut them into smaller parts than the slaughterhouse sends us.  During this process we'll trim fat and bone from the meat and put it in a big plastic bin.  Now we buy beef by the case, but that case's prize is set by it's weight, so trimming trims from our margins too.  Because we have a meat grinder, however, we can buy tubes of grinds at 83/17 instead of 80/20, and then just add the extra 2% in trim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter <em>can</em> actually be created spontaneously in our universe, but only if it is immediately destroyed. In all empty space, particle-antiparticle pairs are constantly forming, existing for a fraction of a fraction of a second (ridiculously small time scales), and then annihilating. Normally this is not an issue and doesn't violate conservation laws, as the particle pair is immediately destroyed, before it can interact with anything, and so the total energy of the system is still 0. We call such particles &quot;virtual particles&quot; because they don't (or shouldn't) exist. </p>
<p>Interestingly, these pairs are the reason for Hawking radiation - if a pair is produced on the edge of the event horizon if a black hole, then it is possible for one to fall into the black hole while the other escapes. This causes a problem - energy has been produced from nothing, and that just won't do. To rectify this, the universe determines that if the particle which escaped is made of positive energy, then to keep the energy of the system at 0, the particle which fell into the black hole must have had negative energy. Thus, the black hole loses mass, which escapes in the form of the newly created positive energy particle.</p>
<p>In some ways, it's possible to view the universe in a similar manner. Our universe could be made of <em>loaned energy</em>, which will one day disappear or be destroyed and hence return the overall system to 0 energy. This is a very basic view of some very complex ideas and it's very speculative, but I hope it helped you to understand one of the possibilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The caveat here is, we really don't know what happened to 'start' the universe. It's not something we can test or observe, and it doesn't appear to be a repeatable process still occurring today.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's first of a caveat that energy conservation probably does not apply on a cosmological scale. </p>
<p>But aside from that, there's a simple classical physics notion that might help. That idea is that there is no absolute scale for energy in classical physics. Let's take the example of a roller coaster, where you probably remember that the total energy of the system is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy: E = KE + PE. As the roller coaster descends from the top of the hill, the potential energy PE decreases, and the kinetic energy KE increases, but the total stays the same the whole trip. Customarily, one says the PE is zero at the bottom of the hill and positive at the top of the hill. But the kicker is that you could also say that the PE is zero at the top of the hill and negative at the bottom of the hill, and the physics of the situation is exactly the same. The only difference between these two choices is a shift in the overall value of the total energy E. This tells you that the physics doesn't depend on the total value of E, only the <em>changes</em> in PE and KE that happen while stuff goes on.</p>
<p>In a very rough sense, you could say the same thing about the big bang. You could suppose that prior to expansion there was a state that was all potential energy, and then there was a change in that state that converted it into other forms of available energy, which created the universe. Well, how much was the original PE to begin with? It doesn't <em>matter</em> because the only thing that counts is the exchange of that PE to other forms of energy.</p>
<p>This is so ELI5 that people might complain about its accuracy, but hopefully this gives some idea why it may not matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>black holes must be significantly heavier than the Planck mass M_P, which is about 22 μg. Anything quite heavier can form a (extremely short-lived unless it is really heavy) black hole, while anything quite lighter cannot. So yes, poppy seed is good, <em>E. coli</em> bacterium doesn't work.</p>
<p>Imagine you have an object lighter than M_P and you're trying to compress it to inside its Schwarzschild radius, which is smaller than the Planck length l_P. In fact, ignoring some pesky numerical factors, you have the formula</p>
<p>M / M_P ~ R / l_P</p>
<p>where R is the Schwarzschild radius of the mass M, the radius in which you'd have to compress M to make it a black hole. Since at the length scale of l_P smooth classical spacetime stops existing to give way to a quantum foam, for R to be smaller than l_P sounds already fishy. </p>
<p>But you try anyway. What you find is that well before your compressing mass even reaches the Planck length, in compressing it you have already given it a lot of energy, which increases its mass (through E = Mc^(2)). In the end, it turns out you have made it into a black hole with M &gt;&gt; M_P and R &gt;&gt; l_P. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Could a poppy seed become a black hole if crushed to small enough space ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but it would blow up immediately.</p>
<p>Black holes emit Hawking radiation. The smaller the hole, the stronger the radiation, which makes the hole even smaller, which makes the radiation even stronger... repeat until KABOOM.</p>
<p>A poppy seed is pretty much at the size (I mean mass) where it goes kaboom in an instant. The energy equivalent of the mass of a poppy seed is a small tactical nuke. Do not try this at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth mentioning that both matter and energy warp spacetime, so enough of either can warp it severely enough for all trajectories to end at the singularity.</p>
<p>If enough photons are gathered together in a small enough volume their combined energy will create a black hole. This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics\)" target="_blank">Kugelblitz</a>.     </p>
<p>Photons (the force carriers for light) do not have mass. So no mass is required for a black hole to exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
