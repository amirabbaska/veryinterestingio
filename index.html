		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is saying &quot;the money,&quot; and while that's definitely correct, it's not the whole story. From the 1830s on, <em>average</em> Americans have had a healthy skepticism of authority (religious, scientific, political, etc) and <em>felt empowered to their own opinions.</em> </p>
<p>P.T. Barnum capitalized on this in his 1840s and 1850s exhibitions––he'd stoke up a controversy and get public naturalists (what we'd now call amateur scientists) to argue over it in newspapers. Then Barnum would come out with an ad saying something like, &quot;When doctors disagree, the public must decide!&quot; This tactic almost got one of his agents beaten in South Carolina, where the disagreement between doctors got particularly heated. </p>
<p>By the early 1900s, science was becoming a more professionalized field, and we see scientists start to argue that the public doesn't really have a right to decide on things outside of their own expertise. &quot;Leave it to the experts,&quot; scientists basically said. But the American people didn't really start buying it until the post WWII era, when a combination of things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Nuclear Age and the rivalry with the USSR made STEM politically crucial</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science popularizers like Feynman and Sagan bridged the gap between &quot;elite,&quot; professional science and non-experts</p>
</li>
<li>Personal computing made the power of STEM and technology comprehensible on the individual level. There's a bit difference between some scientists in a room with ENIAC and a guy in his garage tinkering with an Commodore 64. </li>
</ul>
<p>From there, some segments of society (generally the people more open to technological and social change) embraced the authority of STEM professionals and made them much more likely to accept something like climate change at face value. Other segments of society (generally the people more socially conservative, who opposed rapid change and wanted to keep the status quo) kept their skepticism of scientific authority, preferring to defer to their own person judgement and investigation. </p>
<p>So that's just another piece of the puzzle, along with money. But there's more to it than those two things, even. We now through around the term &quot;science&quot; as though it has a set meaning. But in fact, science as a term is culturally constructed. Note: I'm not saying that science as the empirical observation of phenomenon is culturally constructed, but that the <strong>term</strong> science is culturally constructed. And what that means is that all the stuff that gets added on to the act  of observation and experimentation is determined by people. So the very definition of what is &quot;right&quot; science and what is &quot;wrong&quot; science is at stake. Climate change skeptics demonstrate the flexibility in the term &quot;science,&quot; because to them they're being just as &quot;scientific&quot; as their counterparts. Skeptics just reject what they call &quot;consensus science&quot; and embrace a more generalized Baconian approach, in which any evidence against a theory blows the whole thing to hell. (Actual historians of science, I apologize for butchering that––it's not really my area, please do correct me). </p>
<p>In addition to money and skepticism of authority, then, there's also the complicating factor of the term science's ambiguity. </p>
<p>So I guess the upshot is that this climate change issue won't be solved JUST by fixing the money problem. There are also culturally conditioned ways that people think about the world around them that make it difficult for them to accept climate change. That's why it's so hard to change their minds––but I hate the term &quot;cognitive dissonance,&quot; which Bill Nye is so fond of saying. Medicalizing their worldviews is dismissive and, frankly, disrespectful. It's not that these people are too dumb to accept the truth and therefore just launch themselves into denial land. It's that, to them, your point literally doesn't make sense. (My point with this is to respect people whose views differ, even when those views seem crazy. If we just dismiss everyone we don't agree with as having some kind of psychosis, we're only going to perpetuate the dehumanization of our countrymen and women...and look where that's gotten us.)</p>
<p>*EDIT: Thank you kindly for the gold, ma'am or sir. I'm in bed sick today, and your kindness made me feel a bit better :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to a cost/benefit analysis. In order to have an impact on the climate we need to implement costly changes to our economy which harm businesses, jobs, employment and global trade.</p>
<p>So the question then becomes what should we do and is the cost worth the benefit.  Often times the benefits are not measurable, yet very expensive.  Some say we should make those changes anyway, others say no thanks.</p>
<p>I'll give an example using one of the biggest global policies to fix climate change was the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol was an international treaty that was an expansion on a previous agreement from 1992 that put binding agreements in place for nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions by pre-determined amounts. Essentially it put target reductions out at specified points. So in 1 year reduce by X, in 5 years reduce by Y, in 10 years reduce by Z, etc.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton signed the protocol, but the President doesn't have the authority to force the nation to do such things, it required a vote in Congress. After Clinton left office there was a movement in the Senate to refuse the Kyto Protocol from taking place. A resolution passed in the Senate <em>unanimously</em> to prevent it citing major economic harm if the United States actually went through with it.</p>
<p>The problem with the Kyoto Protocol is that it targeted large westernized economic power-houses like the United States and exempted 80% of the world, including major players in the global economy like China and India. It would have seriously harmed our economy more than any other while giving major advantage to other nations impacting our economy and global trade.
Eventually even Canada, who signed, backed out because it was harming their economy and they had enough.</p>
<p>Pros: If (a big if) all the countries signed the Kyoto Protocol actually followed through with its targets, climate modeling suggests it would have reduced global temperatures by 0.11-0.21 degrees Celsius (0.28-0.38 degrees Fahrenheit) by the year 2100. In other words, the impact would have been within the margin of error and the change likely would have been immeasurable. I guess this is a pro.. it wouldn't have actually helped the environment in any realistic way, but it wouldn't have hurt it either.</p>
<p>Cons: Would have crushed our economy while favoring exempt nations like China and India further advancing their economic status.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for Gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's origins have pretty much always been hand-in-hand with the political environmental movement, which has a radical fringe.</p>
<p>In the 1970's and early 80's, the dominant scientific idea was that pollution was going to cause a new ice age, and our use of fossil fuels was to blame.  Other propaganda along with this was that we only had a few decades of oil left.  Given the nature of the oil industry, and basic economics, this becomes pretty much irrelevant.  So, despite the 'consensus' of the scientific community, those who are over 40-50 years old see credibility issues, having heard these types of complaints before.</p>
<p>The way it really becomes a political issue is that governments enact policies to restrict oil use, raise taxes, or introduce other laws and regulations that make it more expensive or difficult to use coal, oil, gasoline, and other carbon-based fuels.  This makes things complicated, as carbon based fuels are, without a doubt, the cheapest and most flexible energy supply we have.</p>
<p>And the consequences of restricting carbon emissions are huge, but generally under-reported.  Setting aside the importance to our own economy, if you want to fight third world poverty, you want them to have a much access to cheap energy as possible, not to delay their growth 10-15 years until the price of solar and wind power drops.  And in the meantime, the truck that brings food from the farm country out to the villages isn't a hybrid.  By our standards, it is a poorly maintained, super-dirty diesel.  So third world countries are probably not keen on supporting major restrictions on carbon.  Neither is the Middle East, where Oil Exports are the main economic production.  </p>
<p>So since it is a huge issue that impact different industries, different companies, and different types of people differently, it has become a huge political issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels and pollution put out by manufacturing plants. </p>
<p>In order to fight climate change, we need to change our energy consumption to resources that don't cause climate change, such as renewables like solar and wind. We also need to change how we consume energy and output pollutants, such as more energy efficient cars and regulating manufacturing. </p>
<p>These changes are brought about by regulations and incentives put forth by the government. Such as incentives for developing and building solar and wind farms, and taxes against oil and coal.</p>
<p>Big companies, such as oil and coal producers, and manufacturers don't want these changes to go into effect, because those changes will hurt those companies' profits. Therefor they lobby to congress <em>not</em> to implement changes that are good for the environment, but bad for big business. </p>
<p>In order for those people in congress to justify <em>not implementing</em> measures that will help the environment and reduce climate change, (and thus try to <em>appear</em> as if they are acting in the peoples' interest and not in the pocket of big energy companies) these congressmen attempt to debunk climate change in general. Therefor saying &quot;Climate change is not an issue, therefor we do not need to support renewable energy / do not need to curtail oil &amp; coal industry.&quot; </p>
<p>That is how you end up with some people in congress (those in the pocket of energy companies) claiming that climate change isn't real - arguing with others in congress who are trying to curtail climate change (and &quot;save the planet.&quot;)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Texas, many people rely on the oil industry for their livelihood. If oil fields were to be closed in favor of green energy, many Texans fear that they will lose their jobs and be out of work completely. This also has an indirect effect. Texas is filled with oil towns where the majority of people with money work in an oil field. By extension, many businesses also set up shop there as the employees need to ship somewhere. Because of this, if the oil fields were to close, many other un-related businesses may close.</p>
<p>The oil industry has a major influence in red states and they spend a lot of money influencing research which favors their point of view. Climate change will regulate the oil industry and became more of a partisan issue as many people believe that there is some agenda from the left which will punish red states in favor of blue states who may benefit from green energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scientists are being really cagey about their hypothesis until they publish—understandably.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39686055" target="_blank">BBC article</a> seems a bit misleading in that it says &quot;it does not stem from the interaction of solar particles with the Earth's magnetic field.&quot; but if it's a plasma passing within 300km of Earth, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere#Earth.27s_magnetosphere" target="_blank">well, well inside</a> the magnetosphere and must be interacting.</p>
<p>A more appropriate statement would be that it does not stem from the interaction of solar particles with the Earth's <em>atmosphere</em>.</p>
<p>While auroras CAN stretch up to 1000km from the planet's surface, the Kármán line (typically thought of as the &quot;edge of space&quot;) is at about 100km up, so this beam is traveling through space largely unhindered by collisions with atmospheric gas, which is where a genuine auroral glow comes from. It seems likely that it IS a solar wind event, possibly a stream of ionized hydrogen, i.e. protons.</p>
<p>It may be that the plasma is hot enough to emit these wavelengths thermally, but it's also possible that we're seeing <a href="http://jila.colorado.edu/~pja/astr3730/lecture10.pdf" target="_blank">synchrotron
or cyclotron radiation</a> from the plasma's interaction with the planet's magnetosphere. There are plenty of other possibilities, but that's <a href="http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2017/04/photographers-discover-new-pseudo.html" target="_blank">this physicist's current best guess</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you talk about potential of any sort (gravitational or electrostatic are the most popular), you have to set a 0 point. Potential is the work done in moving something from point A to point B. </p>
<p>For terrestrial usage, that 0 point is taken as the surface of the Earth. You have to do work to raise mass above the surface, thus at a distance r (&gt; Re), potential is greater than 0. </p>
<p>But we also often use 'infinity' as a 0 point in electrostatic problems, or in dealing with Earth orbits. In that, we have negative gravitational potential since the Earth does work on the mass when bringing it closer to itself from 'infinity'. </p>
<p>The negative mass-energy required in an Alcubierre drive is to regular mass what negative charge is to positive charge in a way. Rather than increasing the density of energy around it above the vacuum energy density, this 'negative' mass-energy would instead decrease it. You can imagine it as normal mass-energy pulling in things and the negative mass pushing that same mass-energy away (opposites repel)</p>
<p>I'd be happy to explain further if my explanation wasn't up to snuff (still working on it!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The negative Newtonian gravitational potential energy between two objects is only a convenient convention, because in classical physics (and quantum mechanics) all that matters for potential energy is the difference in its value between locations. Unless there are black holes involved, you can always use gauge freedom to set the potential energy to a positive number at every point (just add a huge number to the potential energy everywhere in the universe).</p>
<p>In contrast, the negative mass required for an Alciuberre drive is a quantity that is truly physically negative as measured by a local observer - if the observer pushed it it would move in the opposite direction of the push (F=ma, m&lt;0). We currently don't think that such a material can exist, but we can't rule it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The second law of thermodynamics tells us that thermal energy spontaneously flows from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. Thus, it follows that no set of lenses and mirrors built around the sun can heat the earth to a hotter temperature than T<em><em>Sun</em></em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the power radiated from a back body is proportional to P~AT^(4). </p>
<p>Now imagine you could engulf <del>sun-earth</del> a system of two black bodies with radii R<em><em>1</em></em> and R<em><em>2</em></em>, where R<em><em>1</em></em>&lt;&lt;R<em><em>2</em></em> with a parabolic mirror, such that the sun and the earth are in the focal points of the parabola. Let us furthermore assume that the larger black body is held at a constant temperature T<em><em>1</em></em>. Then, all the power radiated by either body will be focused on the other. Thus it follows that</p>
<p>A<em><em>1</em></em> T<em><em>1</em></em>^(4) = A<em><em>2</em></em> T<em><em>2</em></em>^(4)</p>
<p>Hence, since A<em><em>1</em></em> &lt; A<em><em>2</em></em> it follows that T<em><em>1</em></em> &gt; T<em><em>2</em></em>.</p>
<p>But that violates the second law of thermodynamics. </p>
<p>Where did I go wrong?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here seem to be missing the point and attempting to reconcile your example by pointing out flaws in the exact situation that you've considered.  I imagine that what you're really trying to ask is &quot;How is it that body A can heat body B to a temperature higher than its own temperature?&quot;</p>
<p>The problem is that the Stephen-Boltzman law is not exactly what you believe it to be.  The Stephen Boltzman law states that the energy emitted/absorbed by a body is proportional to its surface area times the <em>difference</em> in temperature to the fourth power.  This means that as the colder body heats up and the warmer body cools down, the temperature term approaches zero.   So, as they reach the same temperature, the energy exchange becomes zero, thus they reach equilibrium at the same temperature and the second law of thermodynamics holds.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I'm getting a lot of responses pointing out that the Stephen-Boltzman law indeed states that the emitted radiation of a body is proportional to its absolute temperature to the fourth power.  This is true, but you must consider that the body is also <em>absorbing</em> energy from its surroundings.  This means that the <em>net</em> energy gain/loss is proportional to the difference of the objects temperature to the fourth power and the surrounding temperature to the fourth power.  In the case that OP describes, the two bodies can be considered to be surrounding each other.  </p>
<p>To be clear:  when I say &quot;difference in temperature to the fourth power&quot; I mean T1^4 - T2^4 , NOT (T1-T2)^4 .  I was unclear in my initial response because the end result is the same: equilibrium when T1 = T2, so it was unimportant to stress the semantics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun approximates a constant temperature in the real world, as it loses heat to space.</p>
<p>In your example, you are supposing you can channel all the heat from the sun, to your planet.</p>
<p>Now, the planet will warm up. The sun would also start warming up, since it's radiating a lot of heat, which can only go the planet, then back again, but you've artificially fixed it to have a constant temperature.</p>
<p>Your essentially saying, your sun is producing power ~AT^4, but you've fixed the T, so you've just said your sun produces constant power. Your system consists of only one object which can heat up, the planet. So of course you'll get nonsense, since you've defined a closed system with constant power input, with only one object which can vary in temperature. Whatever magical device is keeping the sun cool, has to dump that heat somewhere, so it's dumped on your planet.</p>
<p>[EDIT] As other people have said, the other problem with your supposition, is that you need to take the Area into account for absorbing the heat, as well as emitting it. The large sun will only have its energy focused down at the other focuii to the same area as the sun, while your planet is much smaller. This means the planet will only receive A2/A1 * the input energy.
Image your idea without the planet, and just a spherical mirror. Now you have a sun outputting P power, but fixed at temperature T. Where does the heat go? Well, it obviously is going to your magical sun-constant-temperature machine...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What you want is an ellipsoid, with the Sun and Earth at the two foci.  But that won't work either.  Since the Sun is a finite size, not all of its light will be projected to the opposite focus.  Instead, the mirror will form an image of the sun that's <em>about the same size</em> as the Sun.  Since the Earth is smaller, some of the light in that image will miss the Earth, bounce off the mirror again, and (probably) go back to strike the Sun.</p>

<p>While you are correct about the power emitted from each black body, all of the energy from emitted energy from body 1 does not go to body 2. The radiated energy does not radiate normal to the surface, but rather radiates in every direction at the surface.</p>
<p>So every point on the mirror would have to reflect the incoming radiation from multiple directions into one direction which isn't possible.</p>
<p>In a vacuum without the mirror the answer to your question would be view/shape factors. Probably could do some really complicated math in your mirror system to find the view factors remain the same. (this last part is just my assumption based off my knowledge)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Then, all the power radiated by either body will be focused on the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, how does this follow?  </p>
<p>Secondly, Stefan-Boltzmann's law is a RESULT of Planck's law (i.e. black-body radiation).  So certainly doesn't contradict it.</p>
<p>But thirdly, enough about the lenses.  Just imagine I have two objects, object A and object B encased in a vacuum surrounded by a set of perfect mirrors.  And let's imagine that the fusion of the sun simply stopped, so that there is no more heat energy entering the system.  All you have is two thermal reservoirs exchanging energy/heat through radiative heat flow.  You get a net flow of heat from the hot object to the cold object until they reach thermal equilibrium.  That's pretty much it.  Imagine the case of two parallel planes.  They just swap energy back and forth bringing each other towards equilibrium.  Now imagine one plane was smaller, the colder plane, so there cross-sectional areas are not the same anymore.  So now, in our prison of mirrors, some of the light emitted by the larger object misses the other object and reflect back to it (and is presumably absorbed).  ALL that means is that the heat flow from the hot plane to the cold is SLOWER.  Not that you've beaten the tendency of hot to flow to cold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus it follows that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't just set these things to be equal.  Even if lenses were magic, how would that make this equal?  All this tells us is that IF the Earth were the same temperature as the sun  THEN it would radiate its heat away through black-body emission at a slower RATE.  Which tells us nothing about the thermodynamic equilibrium of the Sun-Earth system.</p>
<p>At the end of the day a lens just exposes some solid angle of emission of one object to some solid angle of the other.  This neither tells us anything or changes anything about how the net flow of energy between that connection works to bring them into thermal equilibrium.</p>
<p>Fourthly, what's with all the lens questions in the last few days?  Is it all because someone read What If that was published years ago?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I can answer this!</p>
<p>Our mood is affected by specific chemicals in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine (and many others, but these are the main ones).</p>
<p>For this explanation, it isn't important to understand what these chemicals do exactly. The only important thing to know is that these chemicals are responsible for <em>many</em> more of our brain's functions than simply our mood.</p>
<p>If you've ever lived in a house with old or poorly installed wiring, you may have noticed that when a large appliance starts up (like a washing machine or refrigerator), the lights in other parts of the house will dim. </p>
<p>This is a good analogy for what's happening in the brain.</p>
<p>How much of each of these chemicals we have (and how they interact), depends on many factors. I won't list them all, that would be impossible. But here are some major ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current diet (could be excellent or terrible)</li>
<li>Time of day</li>
<li>Current physical fitness (could also be excellent or terrible)</li>
<li>External stressors (like loud noise or sitting in an uncomfortable chair)</li>
<li>Internal stressors (like exercise and/or illness)</li>
<li>Mental stressors (like worries and/or happiness)</li>
</ul>
<p>When the body is trying to use these chemicals to adapt to changing conditions, sometimes it has to allocate brain chemicals in a way that negatively affect our mood. It can &quot;dim&quot; us, just like those dimming lightbulbs, and we don't know why because we can't feel those other things the brain is using those chemicals for.</p>
<p>Notice that I included both what we would consider &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; influences on our current state of being. </p>
<p>The real bitch of mood disorders caused by chemical imbalance is that the negative mood can <em>sometimes be brought on by being otherwise good to yourself</em>.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing such feelings here are some suggestions, because I've been through it, and I wish someone had told me what I'm about to tell you.</p>
<p>First a disclaimer: <em>I'm not a doctor, this is not medical advice, and if possible you should try to find a therapist that works well with you if your mood is impacting your life in a bad way.</em> I also know that sometimes it's impossible to see a therapist/doctor because of financial (or many other) situations, so here are some techniques that work for me. <em>They may not work for you,</em> but they will at least give you a place to start, and hopefully begin to feel that your mood is something you can control or at least influence instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>Whether you're able to start looking for a therapist right away or not, hopefully you can use these as stop-gap measures until you can find a professional that works well with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a single deep breath, and remember it's just a ride.</strong> I usually go to existential places when I get sad. It helps me to remember that while it may be a shitty ride, it's still just a ride, and however bad I feel, if I can make it through the next minute/hour/day, it's likely to change for the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drink a big glass of water.</strong> Dehydration can wreck my mood even if everything else is going great for me. I take a drink, sit still for a bit, and see if I feel better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A bad mood does not equal a bad person.</strong> I was raised to believe that I'm a bad person, and always will be.  Even if you weren't raised to be religious, many cultures attribute a moral value to how useful or good we are able to be. A sad mood can wreck my ability to do anything for a while, but <em>that does not make me a bad or ineffective person,</em> it just means I'm a good person who has some hard shit to get through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cry.</strong> I don't usually have time to feel sad about things the way I'd like to or need to. Sometimes many small events in my life build up to the point where I just need to sob about them for a while. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eat something.</strong> Something healthy if at all possible. A popular saying is &quot;food is the original anti-depressant,&quot; and it's true. I try to seek out something healthy to eat, but if there's nothing else around and I need to eat some junk food to make it through the day (a serious problem in Western cultures, but especially the States), that's okay. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If I can't eat healthy, or if I simply over-eat, try eating &quot;one less.&quot;</strong> A friend once told me that &quot;willpower is a muscle. I have to start small and go easy on myself while I practice.&quot; That little comment changed my life. Sadness and obesity go hand-in-hand, like Strong Sad from Homestar Runner prancing along with another Strong Sad (god I hope this isn't a terrible reference). So, when I began my journey of trying to manage my weight, I began by eating and/or drinking one less serving of whatever I was having in a meal: If I usually would drink three sodas, I'd only drink two. If I would usually eat five slices of pizza, I'd only eat four. In that way I very slowly trained myself to simply eat less. Now, this doesn't mean that the food I was eating was necessarily healthier. <em>But.</em> It meant that mentally I had developed a habit that made it <em>much easier</em> to make positive food choices for myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take probiotics.</strong> Gut health <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gut-week-gut-brain-axis-can-fixing-my-stomach-fix-me/" target="_blank">can improve mood.</a> Probiotics help, and they're in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=probiotic+gummies&amp;oq=probiotic+gumm&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3398j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">gummy form now.</a> If I can't afford probiotics, eating yogurt is a great way to get helpful bacteria into my belly. As I continue to improve my eating my mood <em>does improve</em>. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Gut problems might be caused by common allergens.</strong> I'm not trying to be gross, but it's a very addressable problem that many people just don't talk about: I'll put myself out there and state that I had a <em>lot</em> of problems with gas/bloating/diarrhea for years. It turns out I had a food allergy, and eliminating that food from my diet improved my belly feels dramatically. 8 kinds of food account for 90% of food allergies. I tried removing them one at a time, and if I didn't feel an improvement, I was free to add that one back into my diet:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Milk (mostly in children)</li>
<li>Eggs.</li>
<li>Peanuts.</li>
<li>Tree nuts, like walnuts, almonds, pine nuts, brazil nuts, and pecans.</li>
<li>Soy.</li>
<li>Wheat and other grains with gluten, including barley, rye, and oats.</li>
<li>Fish (mostly in adults)</li>
<li>Shellfish (mostly in adults)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean/pick up &quot;just one more than before.&quot;</strong> In the same vein as &quot;eat one less,&quot; I gradually exercise my willpower muscle by doing <em>just one more thing</em> than I did before. If yesterday I did nothing, I put one sock in the hamper. If I put away one sock yesterday, I try two today. And so on. If I then collapse back into bed, I know that I made an improvement. It may seem stupid, but here's what <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/120532-when-asked-how-do-you-write-i-invariably-answer-one" target="_blank">Stephen King said:</a> &quot;It sounds too simple to be true, but consider the Great Wall of China, if you will: one stone at a time, man. That's all. One stone at a time... I've read you can see that motherfucker from space without a telescope.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a shower.</strong> Feeling clean helps my mood a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a walk.</strong> Gretel Ehrlich said &quot;walking is also ambulation of the mind.&quot; If I walk at all, I’ve taken a step (several, actually) to improve my condition, and to be healthier. Double bonus. If I walk for 30 minutes, I have successfully exercised for the day. Triple bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage stress in whatever way works.</strong> I've tried yoga, volunteering, calcium antacids, rubbing my head, stretching, breathing deeply, screaming, punching a bag, lifting weights, helping a friend out, journaling, listening to soothing music, and a bajillion others. I try anything I can think of, and keep the ones that work.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Take a dry erase marker, and write a positive thing about myself.</strong> This one frankly sounded stupid when I first heard it, but I got so desperate I gave it a try. And it works. I wrote things like &quot;I love me,&quot; &quot;I am a good person who wants to do good things,&quot; &quot;I am great at <strong><strong>__</strong></strong>,&quot; &quot;I'm a beautiful person,&quot; and many others on my mirror. I'd say them to myself 10 times every time I looked into the mirror. At some point, those sayings became my internal monologue, and I started to feel better about myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not trying to preach, and what I posted might not work for you. But I sincerely hope it does. If you are feeling sad and need someone to talk to, please PM me. I always want to help someone who's going through what I've been through. </p>
<p>If you are feeling like you don't want to exist (which one of my friends wryly referred to as being &quot;casually suicidal&quot;) the suggestions above might help, but also might not be quite enough to get you to feeling balanced and level. If you need someone(s) to talk to, try /r/depression and/or /r/suicidewatch </p>
<p>I really hope this helps. Love you all.</p>
<p>EDIT: Formatting.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Added a section about &quot;one less.&quot; Again, hope this helps. &lt;3</p>
<p>EDIT 3, THE GILDED BUGALOO: ...I really don't know what to say. Thank you all so very much for your words of gratitude and encouragement. All I've ever wanted to do was help people, and today it seems like I did. I'm intensely grateful for you all. Thanks for being here, thanks for being alive. You matter. Even if you don't hear it ever as much as you should, you matter, you're worthwhile.</p>
<p>I can't say it any better than this: &quot;But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that, even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you, <em>I love you.</em> With all my heart, <strong>I love you.</strong>&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mood can be altered by any number of factors ranging from environmental to physiological. Chances are, when mood is altered, it's not actually for &quot;no real reason&quot;. Even mild things that you're not consciously aware of will cause your mood to shift either positively or negatively. Hungry but still have to wait an hour for lunch? Now you're grumpy. Weird dream last night? Now the rest of your morning feels off. Something as simple as a television show or song with a certain atmosphere will cause someone's mood to shift. The possibilities are kind of endless. </p>
<p>One thing you have to remember is that mood and overall mental health are controlled by a very complex set of physiological factors. Your nervous system, hormones, and even the bacteria in your gut all work together to create a balance of both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; emotion. So, at any one time, fluctuations in these areas can cause you to experience fluctuations to your emotional state, even if there's no obvious external reason for you to feel differently. </p>
<p>I'm not a neuroscientist or psychologist, so I'd love to see someone provide a more in depth answer in this area. However, I will say that emotions like anger or happiness or disgust (etc etc) all play a very large role in our decision making and motivational processes. This means that we NEED emotion to properly function and make decisions. This includes sadness as well. So, you might even be able to argue that episodes of sadness (even for no real reason), are inevitably needed to keep us functioning. </p>
<p>EDIT: When I say that we need emotions in our motivational or decision making processes, I'm referring to something in psychology called &quot;the somatic marker hypothesis&quot;. The hypothesis states that emotional &quot;markers&quot;, such as the sweating and rapid heart beat associated with anxiety, help us to make decisions where cognition alone might fail us. The parts of the brain associated with the somatic marker hypothesis are the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. When damage to these areas occur (such as in traumatic brain injury) it has been found that individuals are more likely to make risky decisions on gambling tasks. Why? Because they aren't experiencing the same emotional reaction to betting or losing, meaning they are less likely to &quot;learn from their mistakes&quot; because they don't experience or process disappointment or regret in the same way. There are lots of studies done on this using something called the Iowa Gambling Task. That's just one example of how emotions impact decision making. Feelings of fear and regret play a huge role in mitigating risk behaviour alone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>People may know that dopamine is the big one people talk about, where for example in game design designers know how to structure a level and the rewards you get so that you're getting a little &quot;dopamine hit&quot; that keeps you playing.</p>
<p>So, as you're going through a day, say a really good day where you wake up with your loved one, have an awesome breakfast, you rock your job that day, or maybe it's a day off, regardless it's an awesome day, or for some folks maybe even just an average day. Your brain is producing dopamine, and receiving it. Neurotransmitters travel from axons in your brain, to dendrites, where I like to think of axons as a driveway, and a dendrite is where you park at the end of it (there's actually a little gap between the two physically but I digress). So you create dopamine, receive it within a dendrite and after a while it gets spent. After a while of being pretty happy, you'll have exhausted the dendrites ability to receive dopamine (as it gets &quot;spent&quot; it creates gunk that gets in the way...this is where an expert could define his better).</p>
<p>So naturally, after receiving dopamine for so long you simply won't be able to for a little while, which is where sleep comes in but that's a whole other topic.</p>
<p>A good example is drug use, where cocaine will spike up your dopamine levels for a while and exhaust your dendrites faster, so you get a big happy for a while, then crash. </p>
<p>As people have said already it's partially environmental and partially physiological because all sorts of factors can change your brain chemistry. Naturally your brain goes through ebbs and flows of various neurotransmitters and sometimes, you're happy, and sometimes you're just down.</p>
<p>I hope that was a decent explanation!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vipassana (insight) mediation has been helping me  answer this question and understand it in the context of my own life recently. </p>
<p>I've found that part of the answer is because our mental constructs of our &quot;self&quot; and the world around us often set us up for unnecessary suffering. There are many common tendencies identified in Vipassana, from what I've learned it seems to boil down to our inherent desire for things to be different than how they are, that insistent feeling of &quot;not enough&quot;. We humans often place our happiness and contentment in the future rather than in the present, &quot;When I accomplish A, then I will be happy&quot;.  </p>
<p>Many of our societies are structured to reinforce this too, once we graduate awful high-school then we get to go to college and THAT will awesome. Then we're in college and when it sucks we think &quot;oh but when I'm out of school and have a job and get married then I'll REALLY be able to live my life&quot;. Then adult life is feeling like it's not quite enough and we think &quot;Well when I retire and buy that boat THEN! I'll truly be free and happy&quot;. Then you retire and maybe buy the boat but somethings inside you is still grasping for... What?...Then you die. Vipassana has helped me learn how to release this grasp, albeit one struggling finger at a time. </p>
<p>Another inherent trait of the mind that I find leaves me with  unexplainable sads is when my mind has been constantly flooded with thoughts and carried away by them. We sometimes end up so carried away that we're drowning, trying to parce out and solve too many problems at once. Our minds go into overdrive and get burnt out and we feel helpless and sad. </p>
<p>Learning to give the chaotic monkey mind a break through meditation (calm, nonjudgental, ardent observation of thoughts and sensations perceived by the mind and body) creates space and cultivates awareness of the thoughts and sensations that float by or carry us away. By doing this we gain insight into the habits of mind and learn what tends to lead us to suffering and discontent. It's often said meditation helps show you how to sit at the train station and decide whether or not you want to get on the train of thought that's passing by. This rest can also give the deeper subconscious processes a chance to take a crack at sorting out the &quot;problems&quot; that seem to be drowning us. It's like when you're doing the dishes and AH HA! the answer to the problem you were struggling with all day just appears in your mind, seemingly out of no where. </p>
<p>The trick (in vipassana) is to dissolve these constructs and our identification with them, cultivate ardent awareness of our minds and subjective perspectives, and ultimately see reality as if each second is the first and last second in the universe. </p>
<p>If any of this resonates with you, Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Gunaratana is a great starting point and reference especially if you don't have a teacher. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mental Health counselor here:
The first comment was pretty right on. However, I'll add some things:
First, we evolved to live in groups, so we had to have a mechanism to make that happen. Emotion is that mechanism. The word Emotion comes from the Latin &quot;Emovere&quot; which means 'to move.' It moves us to make changes in our lives to accommodate other people. Second, because evolution tends to co-opt existing structures for new means, our emotions ride on the same nervous system as pain and pleasure. So when your feelings are hurt, <em>they really do hurt.</em> Finally, any 'negative' emotions stand out in our memory more than 'positive' ones, because it is useful for our survival to avoid hazards. Negative emotions typically have a danger or loss attached to them some way, a warning for us to behave differently, instructions on how to stay safe within the tribe.</p>
<p>So when you are 'suddenly' feeling sad, what is probably happening is that some change has happened in your environment (internal or external). Your brain, that lovely organ that tries to make sense of it all, takes that stimulus and drops it into your habitual thinking patterns. For example, if low blood sugar is the issue, your brain will know it does not have the glucose it needs. It interprets the output as &quot;something is wrong.&quot; Your habitual thought patterns take over from there. </p>
<p>Please don't ask for references; I'm on the west coast and it is still early. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientist's don't actually know. The prevailing theory is because of where the cells originate and the difference between stem cells and simply having cells divide.</p>
<p>When we are a fetus, growing inside the womb, our Stem Cells are being used to build everything. It is building bones and muscle and organs and skin. Stem Cells are blank discs that hold the information to do anything in the body.</p>
<p>After we are born, we no longer produce stem cells in such quantities. Instead our individual cells will divide. This is what causes skin to grow back over a cut. It is just the skin growing back.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Scientists aren't sure. Figuring it out would help amputees regrow at least rudimentary body parts and even organs. Most studies on the topics look at reptile DNA since so many lizards have the ability to regrow tails and even appendages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The problem seems to be that we can no longer &quot;remodel&quot; tissue, even if we can grow it. Wound healing usually involves cells of the same type, growing to replace tissue. So blood vessels make more blood vessels, skin cells make more skin cells etc...and the wound is patched up.</p>
<p>Creating any kind of structure requires cells to not just grow, but also adopt shapes and properties in a series of co-ordinated steps such that you end up with, say a finger. It seems this ability to grown <em>and then remodel into an organ</em> is lost in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes we can heal cuts and wounds. But in bigger and deeper wounds, the new tissue isn't even of the same quality as the original tissue. There is more fibrous tissue that lacks elasticity. If you have a large scar, you can tell that it doesn't stretch the same way as the surrounding skin. Scar tissue isn't as as resilient as the original tissue. So to say that we can regrow skin is almost a stretch, let alone grow new limbs. If we did grow new limbs, I image they would be shriveled up little things that wouldn't compare to the originals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wound healing, complex as it is, is predominantly scar tissues.  Once all the white blood cells are done with cleaning the area, what remained after it completely healed is collagen fibers.</p>
<p>Now compare that to a limb: in a single finger we have, from superficial to deep, the skin (collagen), nerves, blood vessels, muscle fibers, bones, and a bunch of other cell types that I've neglected to mention.  All of these are layered in concert so that our fingers can operate and look the way they do.  </p>
<p>A human fetus in growth has certain chemical factors in play that dictate where a certain cell type will migrate, where some cells will undergo apoptosis, and when to divide.  A grown human simply lacks most of the ingredients needed to grow back an amputated limb. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Primitive humans, or the genus <em>Homo</em>, first appear in the fossil record approximately 2-2.2 million years ago. Their brain size was still small, though, similar to relative apes. What distinguished these early humans is the evolution of the first metatarsal, the first metacarpal, the gluteus maximus muscle, oblique muscles, pectoralis major muscle, and the ball-and-socket joint in the shoulder. These adaptations allowed for elite throwing, subsequently making primitive humans power scavengers. Evidence of such throwing is drawn from the discovery of rock or manuport clusters made by <em>Homo naledi</em> circa 1-2 million years ago.</p>
<p>In accordance with the social coercion theory, primitive humans evolved elite throwing abilities first, which prompted successful cooperative group hunting of larger prey; consequently, communication and larger brain size were a result. Thusly, early humans banded together, and if one human was a liar (cheating or stealing) or did not contribute to the group, he/she/it would be outcast by the rest of the group. In turn, that human was significantly more likely to die, as well as fail to reproduce.</p>
<p>To answer your question, no, primitive human groups did not have leaders. These primitive human groups followed prey, and cooperative hunting was the primary goal of the group. Essentially, it was “monkey see, monkey do.” It wasn’t until the appearance of <em>Homo sapiens</em> with significantly increased cranial volume that social structure and hierarchy started to take shape, which didn’t occur until about 500,000-700,000 years ago when humans and Neanderthals diverged from the common ancestor <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>.</p>
<p>Speculation and debate of Neanderthal behavior is inconclusive and not much is concrete or certain about their social behavior. From the fossil record, however, their bones do provide insight. Evolving separately from humans over a few hundred thousand years, Neanderthals developed marginally larger brains than humans but the shape of the brain divergently evolved. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that Neanderthals inhabited Eurasia, while modern humans (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) thrived throughout Africa. Compared to humans, Neanderthals lived in smaller groups, generally less than 10 individuals. Neanderthals were, however, capable of communication, evident in the similar evolution of the hyoid bone and the larynx, but it is predicted that Neanderthal speech was less developed human verbal communication.</p>
<p>Human groups did not have leaders until finally the development of coercive weapons such as the bow, atlatl, body armor, spears, and swords. As such, the leader of a group was typically the best or most fit warrior. Men became warriors in order to protect their women and their facility to reproduce. This caused a dichotomy in social structure, dividing men and women. Of the men, the best warrior usually lived longer and as a result had more life experience. Mosaics of Alexander the Great and marble statues of Caesar depict these two leaders as elite warriors brandishing coercive weapons in order to appeal to the self-interest of himself and his fellow warriors. Brutal, public force was used to keep the rest of the group in line.  From the historical record, Ancient Rome had the coliseum and Ancient Meso-Americans like the Incas and Aztecs had graphic public beheadings and executions.
I hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It offers lots of data about societies just before the first point of contact with Europeans, several of them still at Neolithical stage. You can see there that even the simplest societies had two hierarchical levels at least. This means that they did not only have one chief, but some kind of overchief above the chiefs. However, there were several societies without any hierarchy beyond the local community, meaning no states or similar.
Concerning the question about the origin of political organization, in the field of economic history there has been recently a lot of discussion around an article using Murdock's Atlas and concluding that it was the geographical potential of growing crops what caused the emergence of more complex societies. Here you can read an understandable summary of the original paper:

<p>The full formula for massed and massless particles, with motion, would be:</p>
<p>E^2 = ( mc^2 )^2 + ( pc )^2, where p is your momentum.</p>
<p>The formula for momentum is p = mv for objects with mass, or more accurately p = γmv. γ here is the lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1- v^2 / c^2 ), which only becomes relevant at very high speeds. There's also p = h / λ, where h is the planck constant and λ is wavelength, which also counts for massless particles.</p>
<p>Here's also another formula for massed particles that our physics curriculum preferred:</p>
<p>E = γmc^2</p>
<p>If we're not dealing with relativistic speeds, you could probably use the classical formula for kinetic energy instead, and get:</p>
<p>E = mc^2 + 0.5<em>m</em>v^2</p>
<p>Which seems to be giving me approx. equal answers until we get to v&gt;0.4c, which is when it's about 1% off. v = 0.68c is when it gets to be 10% off, and v=0.94c is when it gets 50% off target.</p>

Wouldn't you only gain potential energy, via being elevated, if you were elevated away from a resting state?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, be aware that &quot;moisturizer&quot; is a marketing term with no scientific or clinical definition. For all intents and purposes, ordinary old tap water, absorbed into the skin via a warm bath, relaxing sauna or cooling swim, is a &quot;moisturizer&quot;. That's why your skin feels so nice and soft after those activities ... at least for a while.</p>
<p>Secondly, you must understand that the &quot;moisturizer&quot; branch of the cosmetics industry is a high-stakes, billion dollar game played by a thousand vicious competitors who are all forever seeking an edge in the marketplace, and therefore consumer deception is a common, even universal practise. Thirdly, be advised that the vast majority of their research and development expenditures are focussed on marketing and persuasion - certainly not on something as peripheral to their bottom line as producing a <em>better formulation,</em> or anything. In fact, most manufacturers devote far more time, money and energy to designing and producing an attractive <em>container and label,</em> than they ever do on designing, producing or improving their actual <em>product</em>.</p>
<p>As to your actual question:</p>
<p>Be they the $60-for-a-tablespoon-in-a-crystal-pot variety, the ubiquitous, sink-side blue jar variety, or your drugstore-brand &quot;family size&quot; pump bottle of white goo, <strong>all commercial &quot;moisturizers&quot; work in exactly the same way.</strong> They all provide a bit of water that penetrates cell <del>walls</del> <em>membranes</em> (tnx, u/YXAndyYX) to rehydrate and plump up the outermost few layers of dead skin cells that form your epidermis. Typically, their water content is around 65%. In addition, they all contain (@~25%) some sort of grease, wax or oil to trap that water inside, so it isn't just immediately evaporated away again by your excessive body heat ... you sultry thing, you. </p>
<p>In that regard, the only advantage all those hundreds of modern &quot;moisturizers&quot; have over your grandmother's go-to for dry skin - petrolatum, aka Vaseline - is that makers have gotten more sophisticated at finding different formulations and combinations of grease, oil and/or wax that don't feel quite as slippery or greasy to the touch, once the cells have absorbed all they can, and the leftovers remain on the surface of your skin. </p>
<p>This is the reason why, for example, Johnson's Baby Oil encourages you to slop on their product immediately after you shower: to seal in that tap water you've just absorbed (which needs to be done within 5 minutes of showering, or it's gone), and to ensure that any excess oil you might apply will rub off on your towel and/or your fresh clothes, and thus appear to have been successfully &quot;absorbed&quot; by your skin. (What - did you think there was some sort of <em>magic</em> involved? JBO is merely a fine mineral oil with some scent added; buy a store brand and save some money.)</p>
<p>Some expensive products meant for the delicate skin of the face contain a proprietary dermal irritant like CEF. Such products basically inflame the dermis, which causes its cells to temporarily inflate by taking up plasma, which in turn reduces the appearance of facial wrinkles for a few hours (rather like blowing up a withered, half-deflated balloon). But eventually the irritant is neutralized by the body's defences, the dermal irritation subsides and its cells deflate themselves, allowing wrinkles to re-emerge - thus setting up a new and lucrative cycle of product consumption.</p>
<p>There are many other formulations. Some makers add a preservative like paraben to extend shelf life. Some add a humectant to absorb and trap additional water for a longer-lasting experience. Some add collagen, which is nothing more than un-absorbable connective tissue, typically sourced from that rubbery skin inside eggshells; you might as well rub yourself with actual eggshells, for all the moisturizing benefits topical collagen will provide. Same goes for added keratin, which is mostly sourced from cattle horns and hooves acquired from slaughterhouses. I know: eww, right? </p>
<p>Some products increase their appeal by including pleasant odourants, like rosewater (St. Ives) or menthol (Noxema). Some add vitamins, in the hope they will appear to consumers as being able to &quot;nourish&quot; skin (hint: they can't). </p>
<p>Both useful and useless additions to moisturizers come and go in phases. At one time, sheep lanolin was popular; but it's stinky, and was largely abandoned when less pungent plant-based greases were developed. Chlorophyll was once a widespread addition, though nobody ever got around to explaining its benefits, or the supposed parallels between plant and skin chemistry. A few years ago, PABA was all the rage as a UV-blocking additive, until someone pointed out that the living tissue of the dermis was actually <em>incapable of absorbing</em> topical PABA. In fact, the only way to get it into dermal cells where it could do some good was to <em>drink</em> the damn stuff, eight hours before exposing oneself to the sun. Vitamin E is/was a popular addition, at least until clinical studies indicated it actually had no better moisturizing effect than any other fine, plant-based oil. And the most recent additive fad seems to be hemp oil, Harrelson help us.</p>
<p>BTW, dry skin isn't actually a health issue, unless it's so profound that cracks appear in the epidermis, exposing the living dermis to the outside world and all its microscopic creepy-crawlies. It's really more of a comfort and aesthetic issue. Still, if severe enough, it can interfere with quality of life, and it makes some people quite miserable.</p>
<p><strong>Edit @ 24 hrs:</strong> at the request of mods, I provide a couple of citations, below. There's a lot of good info out there, but I would recommend that readers stick to those sites offered by legitimate medical and research facilities, universities with teaching hospitals, and so on. Don't rely on general interest sites (<em>cough</em>WebMD<em>cough</em>) or any site offering to sell you product. </p>
<p>Even worse for providing dubious information and specious assertions are the commercial web pages of the retail cosmetics industry. If the link has a little &quot;registered&quot; symbol in its name, just walk on by. <strong>It is revealing that the first 500 or so links provided by any Google search for &quot;moisturizers&quot; consist <em>almost entirely</em> of cosmetic manufacturers' websites, rather than to legitimate clinical information. It's the same reason why the first thing one encounters upon entering a department store, is the makeup counter. (Hint: $)</strong>  </p>

<p>A way to do it  is to measure contrast. It you take the difference between two adjacent pixels on the sensor the maximum difference will occur when the image is in focus. It is obvious when you think about it because a out of focus image is blued and the difference between pixel will be smaller then in a in focus image</p>
<p>Laser Auto Focus was used on cell phones. If that is used the a LED or laser is used to illuminate the subject with a short puls. The device measure the time it takes for the light to travel to calculate the distance </p>
<p>Phase detection is also used where the incoming light is split into two images and compared.

<li>contrast detect (most compact and mirrorless cameras.) the camera hunts back and forth until it detects dramatic transitions between two colors in a defined area. </li>
<li>phase detect. (DSLRs) There is an autofocus sensor separate from the imaging sensor in a camera. This sensor detects only portions of an image in multiple places. When out of focus these portions are considered &quot;out of phase.&quot; How &quot;out of phase&quot; these portions are how much the camera should turn the lens to focus. Users of old film cameras used <a href="http://blog.epicedits.com/wp-content/uploads/manual-focus-indicator-1500.jpg" target="_blank">a split prism in the viewfinder</a>  <strong><em>edit</em></strong> - since phase detect is difficult to explain in words it's basically a modernized version of the split prism, and the mechanism has been moved out of view. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rangefinding and Contrast-detection autofocus have already been covered, but phase-detection is more important than rangefinding, and historically was more important than contrast-detect. It's still used on every SLR camera and is generally better.</p>
<p>First of all you have to know what makes an image blurry when it's out of focus. This is because light from a single object - let's say the tip of your subject's nose - can travel different paths before getting to the film or image sensor. In particular it could travel straight into the middle of the lens, or more towards one of the edges. If these rays of light aren't all brought into the same point on the sensor then they get smeared over a big area, and you get a blurry splodge instead of a nice nose.</p>
<p>Contrast-detection works by looking at the splodge and shifting the bits of the lens around until it's less splodge-y and more nose-y. But this is unreliable if your nose happens to be indistinct and splodge-y already - what then? Well we can do this more intelligently. Remember the different paths light can take, through different parts of the lens? We can separate out the light going through different bits of the lens and divert it towards special auto-focus sensors. Now, the images formed on these sensors will be much less blurry, even when the image is out of focus, because each image is formed from something more like a pinhole camera. Instead, the images formed will be different from one another - shifted with respect to each other. (This makes a lot of sense if you think about it - the blurred main image is formed from infinitely many slightly-moved images all on top of one another)</p>
<p>So now you can shift the lens's focus mechanism and the camera will see these two little images line up with one another - and then you're in focus. Another advantage is that you can tell which direction you have to move the images in to line them up, and this how to adjust the lens; with contrast-detection you only know that it's blurry and have to guess which direction will make it less blurry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Active autofocus involves measuring the actual distance to the subject, usually by infrared or ultrasonic rangefinders.</p>
<p>Passive autofocus is more common. It involves finding the greatest contrast between pixels. This is easier than it sounds. Imagine a dark subject on a light background. To focus on the subject, you place the autofocus sensor on it's outer edge. The sensor is a small line of pixels such that, when oriented correctly, the dark subject is on one half and the light background is on the other. When the subject is out of focus, the dark and light pixels will be blurred together into a middle value. Focus is performed by moving the lens toward or away from the imaging device. As you move the lens toward the correct focal point, the subject's edge sharpens and the dark and white values become distinct. Eventually the lens moves past the point of focus and the values blur together again. The autofocus computer looks for the point of maximum difference between pixels on each end of the autofocus sensor. It basically steps the lens forward while calculating &quot;average value here minus average value there&quot; and stops when the calculation goes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. This is the point of focus. As such, the autofocus does not focus on a single point. It requires a small region of contrasting values.</p>
<p>SLR cameras use small dedicated cross-shaped sensors much like the one described above, while fixed lens cameras or your phone use the imaging sensor itself. The principle is the same in either case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
