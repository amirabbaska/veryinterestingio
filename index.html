		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are several ways that a cell phone could prevent itself from charging from a given charger. I don't know the specifics of Apple technology, so I'm not sure which method is being applied, but here are the two most likely scenarios:</p>
<p>1) The Apple charger digitally communicates with the phone. This would require some sort of microcontroller in the charger, and the communication would likely be some sort of embedded systems communications protocol like I2C or SPI. This approach could help with battery life / charging efficiency, or more likely, it's just a cash grab (because most companies put the smart charging technology in the phone and their phones are charger-agnostic).</p>
<p>2) Your charger isn't providing enough amperage. The USB standard dictates 5V of potential, but the amperage can vary. My Samsung phone gives me an error saying that charging isn't optimized if I use an off-brand charger with limited amperage output. When I buy a third party charger (e.g. a car cigarette lighter USB), I make sure that it's rated for at least 2A. Then it charges just fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s little bit more complicated than “flowing energy”.</p>
<p>If you have an USB charger, it will have 4 wires.
5 Volts, data+, data- and Ground. 5V and Ground are the two wires completing the power circuit, like battery + and -. Since a charger does not need digital communication, the two data lines are used to identify the charger capabilities by setting these at a specific voltage defined by Apple. Indicating if it’s a 1 Ampere charger (iPhone) or a 2A (iPad) or any different.</p>
<p>Once you plug in the phone it detects the signals and determines if everything is correct.  </p>
<ul>
<li>is it a genuine accessory/cable.</li>
<li>Is it 5 Volts?  </li>
<li>Is it a USB Host?</li>
<li>Is it a charger?</li>
<li>Can it provide enough ampere.
Charge!</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it starts charging the battery at the rate the phone wants, or the maximum the charger can supply.</p>
<p>Simply put, for the phones perspective, the only thing separating genuine Apple chargers from fake ones is the identification voltages on the data signals, and the quality of the 5V regulation. </p>
<p>Apple also put some chips in the Lightning plug that do some authentication if the cable is genuine and some basic power quality test. Once the cable is approved it does not play part in charging anymore, besides being a wire.</p>
<p>If the charger does not have a USB type A socket, this authentication chip will be inside the charger, and can be a fake one as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dillution technique isn't being used anymore, because it is subjective. Every persons tolerance to capsaicin is different and actually rises, the more of it you intake.</p>
<p>Today a <strong>high-performance liquid chromatography</strong> is used. The heat producing chemicals in a chili are observed, measured and then transfered into the scoville system, because it is the familiar one. Every chili or sauce has different components with different amounts of capsaicin in different parts of the plant, therefore it is often difficult to measure the exact &quot;spice-level&quot;. It is still more usefully and accurate than the old procedure.
There are a lot of crazy methods for classifying hotness, for example the <strong><em>Dremann Hotness Scale</em></strong> where the chili are measured in their spiciness in relation to the salsa they are in. </p>
<p>Hope this helps and I apologise for any grammatical or orthographical errors, English isn't my first language.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally, the Scoville Scale was a human-driven test. The dried peppers were powderized and diluted in sugar water, and a panel of 5 humans tasted the dilutions until a majority of them detected spiciness. If that dilution was, say, 1/1000th of the original solution, then the scoville rating was 1000 * 100 = 100,000 Scoville Units.</p>
<p>But this scale had flaws: Between labs, you could easily get a 50% difference in ratings. So a new unit was developed: Scientists established a standard curve for spiciness, and then looked at what chemicals were in each level of spiciness using a tool called High Performance Liquid Chromatography. They made a new scale based on <strong>American Spice Trade Association Pungency Units.</strong> But because Scoville was already publicly known, they came up with  a conversion between ASTA Pungency Units and Scoville: 1 ASTA Pungency Unit = 16 Scoville Units.</p>
<p><strong>TL DR</strong> Originally, Scoville ratings were done with an elaborate taste test. Today, Scoville ratings are calculated by a lab test based on chemical composition of the peppers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're going to kill a virus, you have to have something to target. By inserting itself into the host genome, it becomes virtually invisible to the immune system. Viral RNA hanging out in the cytoplasm is easily recognizable. Viral dsDNA within the nucleus looks just like any other human dsDNA. At that point, the provirus can persist until environmental conditions within the host become more suitable (i.e. person becomes immunocompromised), at which point it will begin replication and packaging of viral RNA. </p>
<p>If you think retroviruses are inefficient, let me tell you about partial dsRNA viruses, such as Hepatitis B. In order for them to replicate, they must first enter the cell, and replicate the template strand in order to produce a fully circularized dsDNA. Then, they produce an RNA intermediate. The RNA intermediate is then transformed BACK to ssDNA via reverse transcriptase, which is then replicated to package the partially dsDNA genome into new viruses. </p>
<p>So you insert partially double-stranded DNA into a cell, make it fully double-stranded DNA, form an RNA intermediate, reverse transcribe it into ssDNA, then replicate it to produce the partially dsDNA genome to package. Why bother with the RNA intermediate? Virologists hypothesize that it allows for introduction of genetic variation, since the reverse trancriptase is relatively low fidelity (not very careful/accurate). EDIT: As /u/eng050599 pointed out, the HIV reverse transcriptase is also very low fidelity, and is believed to also act as a mechanism of introducing genetic variation. </p>
<p>The ability to evade the host immune system indefinitely offers a selective advantage over other viruses, therefore allowing them to persist despite their odd mechanism of replication. Either way, evolution doesn't <em>necessarily</em> select for efficiency, as long as it works well enough.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In Eukaryotes, DNA is almost always inside the nucleus. Because of this, defense mechanisms have been naturally selected for finding DNA outside of it and breaking it down. That way, you protect yourself against those nasty Adenoviruses.
However, it is believed that retroviruses have been selected exactly because of such defense mechanism: they're able to get around it, turning its RNA into DNA very close or inside the nucleus, &quot;dribbling&quot; the enzymes responsible for the defense process.<br />
Hope you understand it now!<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Virology graduate student here. I'll put in my opinion but it's more of the same info that's been said. As others have said, evolution doesn't decide what's &quot;best&quot;, it simply leads to a result that works. Obviously reverse transcription works; HIV emerged into humans not too long ago and there are tens of millions of people infected, and that's with excellent drug therapies. Imagine how efficient it would be without drugs. Again as others have mentioned, reverse transcriptase (enzyme that converts RNA to DNA) is very inefficient and makes lots of mutations. This occurs at about 1 mutation in 5000 nucleotides, so there are roughly 2 mutations made every time the genome is copied. This is unprecedented when compared to how DNA, or even RNA, polymerase functions. This gives the virus an advantage because it can evolve rapidly. This increase in the rate of evolution of the virus lets it mutate quickly to avoid drugs and the immune system. The virus doesn't care if it makes defective genomes and &quot;dead&quot; viruses by mutating a lot. As long as a lot of them are still infectious that's a win for the virus. Your question doesn't really have an answer. It's asking why evolution chose to do with it did, and the answer is always random chance. It happened to be that RT worked, and don't fix what's not broken. I'd love to answer any other questions you have though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I think your question is a good one, but demonstrates a huge misunderstanding of evolution. There is no 'point' in evolution. There is no goal or intent and not everything that evolves is at all more efficient or better. Instead, evolution works on what's available. What characteristics (both genetic and phenotypic) exist and what mutations occur. Evolution doesn't start from scratch with every organism, it modifies what came before and that might not lead to the 'best' outcome, just one that allows an organism to reproduce and pass on its genes long enough to establish itself in the gene pool.</p>
<p>Edit: I know this didn't answer your question regarding retroviruses and the specific advantages they might have, but I really think all of biology makes more sense once the idea of 'direction' of evolution is dispelled with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Simply put, this is a problem entirely about energy. Yes it would be possible to calculate the time, but as some other folks have said, there are a number of variables... although I think it would be simpler than most people are thinking - but that may just be me fondly remembering kinetics. Oil (type?) and water are well known so many of the required variables are likely available on the Internet.</p>
<p>I can see an experiment where one could heat water up to mix with oil and then rapidly cool it to a temperature that would cause separation (based on the phase diagram ie spinodal decomposition) and then time it until the oil had visually separated. I suppose the experiment is probably easier than calculating.</p>
<p>TLDR: Yes</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you don't actually sense temperature directly (your body temperature stays almost constant in most situations), you sense the flow of heat into or out of your body. Metal conducts heat very well, so when your warm hand touches it, a lot of heat flows out of your hand and spreads out into the metal before it can reach equilibrium, and your body has to work harder to keep your hand warm. In contrast, touching a good insulator like wood will not feel that cold, since you almost immediately warm up the part you are touching and that heat stays in just that location, requiring little flow. For the same reason, a hot piece of metal will feel hotter than a piece of wood at the same temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

So what matters in the change of those temperatures is the heat flow into or out of your body.  That relies on Conduction, Convection, Radiation, and evaporation.</p>
<p>Highly conductive things that are cooler than body temperature feel colder than things that are bigger insulators.  Like why concrete floors feel colder than carpeted floors, even though they are the same temperature.  It's the same reason when it is 70 degrees out in the sunshine, it feels great, but if you are in 70 degree water in the shade, you'd shiver, and actually, if you stayed long enough (a day or 2), you'd die from hypothermia because it would transfer heat away from your body too fast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

However, unlike substances absorbed in the stomach and small intestine (oral administration into the hepatic portal vein, which brings everything through the liver first), medication administered sublingually goes to the heart <em>first</em>, then on to the liver if it happens to travel inferiorly (downward). This is why nitroglycerin is administered sublingually to treat angina pectoris (cardiac-related chest pain).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here. Certainly not a board-certified expert yet, but I can weigh in a bit on this. The benefit of taking medications sublingually (below the tongue) is that the drug enters your blood more quickly, and has a greater opportunity to exert its effects.</p>
<p>Consider this -- when you take a pill, it needs time to pass through the stomach and be absorbed primarily through the intestines. After it's absorbed by the gut, the first place that blood goes is straight to the liver. Your body is smart, and it's configured to send the &quot;collecting&quot; blood from the gut right to the liver in case you've absorbed something bad. Some drugs are highly susceptible to this process, which is called &quot;first pass metabolism.&quot; In fact, some drugs can't be given orally at all, because having all of the dose hit the liver right after absorption ensures that they're not gonna be effective. This is why you can't take birth control with certain antibiotics (Rifampin) -- the antibiotic makes the liver more trained for destroying it and similar drugs, including birth control. Additionally, some drugs simply aren't absorbed at all by the gut, so you can't get them in that way.</p>
<p>When you're absorbing the pill elsewhere, be it under your tongue or through an IV, it isn't all going straight to the liver. Yes, it will eventually get there, but it will do so more slowly and not at once. In the meantime, the drug can spread throughout your blood and reach other targets in the body rather than hit the brick wall that is your liver. There is a greater chance for the drug to do its job, as opposed to going &quot;Stomach -&gt; Liver -&gt; Gone&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For most drugs, First Pass Metabolism breaks down the majority of a drug.  That is, after it is swallowed and absorbed, it goes first to the liver where a large amount of broken down BEFORE getting into systemic circulation.<br />
Going across your oral mucosa (buccal or sublingual) means I gets into systemic circulation (1) quickly, and (2) at a high blood level.<br />
Not all orally disintegrating drugs are able to cross the mucosa like this.  Some are just better tolerated if they melt away in the mouth.  These still get swallowed and get metabolized. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Laughing signals to another person that you enjoy their company, but also that you aren't going to attack them. And it's audible for the same reason that we make other mouth sounds: more communication. This is a useful skill in a species that works in groups.</p>
<p>Imagine that someone accidentally trips you and you fall on your ass. You <em>could</em> get angry, and some people would. But others would feel compelled to laugh, even if it's awkward. We tend to like those people more, because they're reassuring the rest of us that the situation isn't that bad. </p>

Laughing is a similar response, but it's an &quot;all clear&quot; message instead of a warning. It means you've spotted something that <em>looks</em> dangerous but isn't. Like shouting, &quot;don't worry, false alarm!&quot; </p>
<p>That's why jokes are always about subverting an expectation, usually hinting at something dangerous or taboo. The difference between a smile and a laugh is whether or not the punchline, or realization of a non-threat, is surprising enough. Like the difference between noticing a scary shape in the shadows or having something jump out at you. The first might scare you, but the second startles you. Laughing is the &quot;all clear&quot; equivalent of being startled. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A psychology professor/researcher in CU Boulder has a theory around this called the <a href="http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/mcgrawp/Benign_Violation_Theory.html" target="_blank">Benign Violation Theory</a></p>
<p>From the site:  According to the theory, a violation refers to anything that threatens one’s beliefs about how the world should be. That is, something seems threatening, unsettling, or wrong. From an evolutionary perspective, humorous violations likely originated as threats to physical well-being (e.g., the attacks that make up tickling, play fighting), but expanded to include threats to psychological well-being (e.g., insults, sarcasm), including behaviors that break social norms (e.g., strange behaviors, flatulence), cultural norms (e.g., unusual accents, most scenes from the movie Borat), linguistic norms (e.g., puns, malapropisms), logic norms (e.g., absurdities, non-sequiturs), and moral norms (e.g., disrespectful behavior, bestiality).</p>
<p>However, most things that are violations do not make people laugh. For a violation to produce humor it also needs to be perceived as benign. That is, it needs to seem okay, safe, or acceptable. Research in HuRL has highlighted three ways that a violation can seem benign: 1) Alternative norms (e.g., one meaning of a phrase in a pun doesn’t make sense, but the other meaning does), 2) commitment to a violated norm (e.g., men find sexist jokes funnier than women do), and 3) psychological distance (e.g., “comedy is tragedy plus time”).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My father was one of 8 brothers. he himself had 3 sons (2 different marriages) his middle son has 2 sons (again 2 different partners) and is expecting a 3rd son in the next few months. nobody else in our family has kids yet.... now based on the fact we are taught all the way through schools that the boy girl chance is about 50/50, that makes the chance of my family's male child run of 14 children in the region of 1/16400... i.e pretty unlikely</p>
<p>Obviously we could just be incredibly Lucky/Unlucky (delete as appropriate) but i'm curious to know if there is anything that makes people more predisposed to creating male or female offspring? </p>
<p>edit: seems like there isn't much in the way of conclusive evidence that people are genetically predisposed to have one gender. just down to luck of the draw for the most part.... apologies to the mods for a topic that seems to thrive off anecdotal evidence and speculation. looks like you've been kept busy.</p></div></div>

<p>At lower temperatures, foods will brown due to similar reactions, but form flavor and aroma compounds instead of deteriorating completely. If this is done with amino acids and proteins, such as the grilling of meat, it is called the Maillard reaction. If it is done with carbohydrates such as sugar, is called caramelization. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burning could also be called carbonising. I'm sure there's someone who can explain better than me, but burning food is the exact same as burning a lump of wood. Burning is a chemical reaction called combustion, and I can't remember any exact formulas but it uses oxygen, along with the organic compounds in the wood or food (generally composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen with some other fun things in there). One of the by products of the reaction is carbon dioxide which is just released into the air, and another is solid carbon, which is the black stuff left behind. Sorry if this answer is a bit long but basically;</p>
<p>TLDR: it goes black because the combustion reaction uses up most of the other parts of the compounds in the food, and what's left is solid carbon which is black.</p>
<p>Edit: as a few people have pointed out, it is incomplete combustion that produces solid carbon, which is the result of imperfect combustion conditions, for example not enough oxygen available for the reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a combustion reaction, the same as burning wood. Ideally a carbon-hydrogen source reacts with oxygen to form CO2 and H2O. This means if you burned anything carbon based, there shouldn’t be anything left of the material other than water and carbon dioxide gas. But oxygen is the limiting reagent in this reaction which gives harmful byproducts like CO and volatile organic compounds and leaves unreacted products like  plain carbon (the black stuff). Charcoal is essentially just carbon and is often used as briquettes in barbecues because of the increased heat it gives off compared to wood. Its created by limiting oxygen during the combustion of wood to a point where only hydrogen, water and methane are released from the wood leaving behind pure carbon. </p>
<p>tl;dr The black stuff is carbon from incomplete combustion of anything carbon based</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of comments here are getting at the carbonization part, i.e. the fact that most organic matter such as food is made out of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and other elements (N, S, P), and that when you burn it, the H and O is evaporated away in the form of water (H2O), leaving behind a bunch of C.  (This is a super simplified picture actually, food is very complex and consists of complex macromolecules such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, etc., and they all respond differently to combustion/pyrolysis--with some of them actually becoming quite tasty!  And while the stuff left behind is mostly carbon, a lot of other residual compounds are also present.)</p>
<p>A detail I want to point out though is that not all carbon is black!  For example, diamond 100% consists of carbon, but it is actually clear and transparent.  This is because carbon atoms can be arranged in many different ways, leading to the existence of different forms of carbon, called allotropes.  Some of these forms of carbon include materials such as graphite, diamond, buckyballs, graphene, and amorphous carbon.  Now you might remember from chemistry that every carbon atom can form up to four bonds with its valence (outer shell) electrons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Eight-allotropes-of-carbon.jpg" target="_blank">Visual guide to allotropes of carbon</a></p>
<p>If you take a look at the image linked above, you can see that while in diamond, every carbon atom is bonded to exactly four other carbon atoms, for other materials such as graphite, the carbon atoms are only bonded to three other partners!  When this is true, the extra electrons not participating in the fourth bond are actually &quot;delocalized&quot; or distributed/shared among all the carbon atoms, sort of like a giant shared electron cloud.</p>
<p>Now to fill in the last part of the picture, where does color come from?  Basically, when light or any other electromagnetic radiation hits a material, it can either be transmitted, reflected, absorbed, or scattered.  Light also comes in many different frequencies, and each color is associated with a specific frequency/wavelength.  For example, blue light is 450-500 nm, orange light is 590 to 620 nm, etc.  When you view a colored object such as an apple being red, that means that for the white light (from the sun, artificial lighting, your camera's flash, etc.) shining/incident on the apple, all the colors making up the light are absorbed/scattered EXCEPT for the color red, which is reflected back at your eyes.  Now here's the interesting part--what colors an object absorbs/scatters is completely dependent on its atomic/molecular structure!  For diamonds, the carbon atoms form an extremely well-ordered and regular, almost perfect, lattice, and the frequencies of energies they absorb are very narrow as a result.  This in turns results in diamond not being able to absorb/scatter any colored light in the visible spectrum, and diamond being a clear and transparent material!  On the other hand, for materials such as graphite, the delocalized electrons we mentioned earlier have a lot of freedom of movement, and their random motions enable them to absorb/scatter a broader range of frequencies, including visible/colored light.  This results in graphite's blackish color, since almost nothing is being reflected back at you.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, burned food is mostly amorphous carbon, graphite, and miscellaneous random carbon nanostructures such as nanotubes, all of which do a mighty fine job of absorbing/scattering all the visible light you can throw at it.  In general, the more disordered/random/amorphous a material is, the better it is at absorbing/scattering light.  If only burning food could create diamonds though, but alas, that process takes quite a bit of energy input (high pressure, high temperature, or Superman's grip) to get all the carbon atoms to form that nice, ordered lattice.  Anyway, it's just super interesting how it's not only important to consider what a material is made of, but how the stuff it's made of is organized!  The chemical/physical basis of color is also a fascinating topic to consider, since the color of things (pigments/dyes, veins, the sky, etc.) is something we take for granted on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Probably not quite ELI5, and I'm pretty rusty on my materials science, but just wanted to share my perspective on things!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
