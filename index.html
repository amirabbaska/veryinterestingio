But even using that, it takes more than 3,000 calories to accumulate 3,000 calories, because processing those calories burns calories.  One body fat pound == 3,000 does not mean eating 3,000 extra calories == a pound of body fat.</p>
<p>Body fat is also only about 87% fat.  Lard is solid fat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Birds are uricotelic (excreting nitrogen via uric acid), while crocodiles are ammono-uricotelic (excreting nitrogen via uric acid and ammonia). Most likely, dinosaurs would be in that same range, relying primarily on uric acid.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible there were variations in this between species. Just like it's been postulated that some birds can partially switch to ammonotely in situations where that's more efficient (making uric acid costs energy, so if you're calorie-restricted but ingesting lots of nitrogen and water, excreting ammonia would be preferable).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Evolution is just a few gene tweaks that can cause a Great Dane or a Chihuahua.  But the basic things that make every vertebrate function don't really change much across the millenia.<br />
Modern birds still have the tiny urinary bladder (originally evolved in fish) that doesn't really do a whole lot.  They need to lose weight to run fast and fly and carrying a bag of waste water is just slowing you down.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a person who has lived in both Alaska and south Texas, I have strong feelings about this. First, if you were to divide population centers into binary groupings of &quot;people who live in mostly warm/hot weather&quot; and &quot;people who live in mostly cold weather&quot; (i.e. People who live in places like Alaska versus places like the American south) you'd find a huge disparity in numbers toward warm weather. Are there some people who prefer colder weather? Sure. But, worldwide, it's a drop in the bucket compared to people who prefer and live near a warmer climate and simply endure winter months. </p>
<p>Humans can survive quite handily in very hot climates. The body can acclimate to hot weather in a few weeks without ever being in danger of dying from heat alone as long as you have a source of water. Crops grow more efficiently, travel is easier and, from an anthropological perspective, there is generally a more robust sense of community since far more activities are held outdoors. </p>
<p>Humans are quite fragile when it comes to cold weather. Once the temp dips below what a body can regulate on its own, hypothermia will set in and then death in a relatively short period. Your body needs lots of help to combat the cold. Animal skins, high-fat diets, substantial insulated shelter, etc. </p>
<p>It's a lot of work (mitigated dramatically by modern technologies) to stay warm in the winter. You can survive in the heat with virtually nothing. That's the difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>I'm a colder weather person (grew up in the South), but where did you get the idea that &quot;just as many&quot; people in general like colder vs warmer? Almost everyone I have ever met in my life (and I'm a lot older than the average redditor. Like, parent-age older) has always preferred warmer weather.</p>
<p>Forget all that nonsense about agriculture and freezing to death on the Russian steppes in our collective pasts - we don't have genetic memories dictating our moods &amp; opinions now. From moment we go off to school, we are conditioned to associate <em>summer</em> (i.e. when all that hot weather usually happens. Or did before climate change) with good times because of <strong>summer recess.</strong> If you go to both kindergarten and college, that's <strong>17 very influential years</strong> reinforcing this. </p>
<p>Plus, even once you're an adult, you continue to associate summer with far more outdoor activities and vacations. The circle is complete once you start having children and you need to time family vacations with their summer recesses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So people mentioned a few things but the 2 biggest factors are genetics and blood. For starters, bugs (mosquitos) are most attracted to people with O- blood types, likely due to the fact that they lack blood antibodys. A blood has anti B antibodies, B has anti A, AB has neither anti A or B, O has anti A and B. The Rh factor is the same, if you are - you ha e anti Rh, + you don't have anti Rh. Which is why O- can donate to anyone but only receive O-, and AB+ can receive blood from anyone. To sum that bit up, since people with O type blood have antibodies that are anti A and B, if you put A blood in them their immune system will attack it. Because of this it's easier to ingest and transfer without triggering an immunologic response in the host. </p>
<p>The other genetic part is how much you sweat and what it's made of. Sweat is probably the biggest go to for insects, as it's not only potent and easy to recognize, but offers surface nourishment and shows the animal/host is in good condition (alive things sweat, dead things dont). Depending on your genetics, you may sweat more or less, and your sweat can have different concentrations of various chemicals which may be more appealing. Also thus how some people barely sweat and they real, whereas other people sweat and don't smell at all. </p>
<p>(Note for smelling, the smell itself comes from surface bacteria breaking down the sweat which also plays a factor, but this is also dependant on sweat make up and locations again)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This includes a huge number of characteristics that certain bugs can sense (like exhaled CO2, sweat, skin temperature, general body odor, etc etc etc), and things they can't, or at least that we're not aware that they can. This is affected by genetics, diet, habits, and other factors. </p>
<p>Bottom line: It's normal, to a certain extent. :)</p>
<p>But if you really want to know the precise reasons, first become an entomologist, then get to know every difference between you and her that can be measured by modern science.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to intuitively picture the process but they are all imprecise. Basically, Hawking radiation is due to a combination of quantum effects with gravitation - the strongly curved space in a black hole. Quantum waves can tunnel through barriers, and this is what happens. The smaller the black hole, the thinner the barrier and the faster the tunneling until.. poof! Another way to look at is the quantum vacuum is everywhere and contains fluctuating fields - the strong gravity &quot;bends&quot; the vacuum and some particles become manifest. The way Hawking was led to postulate the radiation was from still another viewpoint - that the area of a black hole was its entropy. All such pictures are connected, but the basic thing is quantum + strong gravity. Since gravity is equivalent to acceleration, acceleration can also cause thermal radiation (Unruh effect).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>When the continental ice sheet melts, there will be some isostatic rebound, but that will happen over thousands upon thousands of years and will likely be in the millimeters per year range. The ice on the continent will take lifetimes to melt even during the worst case climate change scenario and will have little effect on the volcanoes underneath. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When glaciers are removed from the surface, decompression of the underlying mantle can induce melting and volcanism.

Fourier transforms are defined differently for random processes. Strictly speaking, they do not exist. But we can still get information about the spectral content of a random process through defining it's power spectral density, which for white noise is flat. Think of this as a sort of average case fourier transform. Try generating noise and take it's FT. It will be far from flat. But generate a new noise sequence, and average the 2 FT's together. Keep repeating and you will see that this averaged spectrum approaches a flat line. </p>
<p>The connection to the delta function comes from its autocorrelation function. There's a whole field of study of this field called random processes if you're interested in learning more and the math rigor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe someone can help me out with this because I have a question too. I have this one pretty irregular indent between my eyebrows. It's nothing noticeable unless you really looked at it, and it's not a discernible shape like a circle. But I was at a party the other week and saw a girl with the exact same mark in the exact same shape and location. It was cool, then I asked where she's from and we have the exact same background. Are we cousins or some shit?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
