		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has everything to do with kidney development and brain development. In infants, the process is not under conscious control. Infants also have an entirely liquid diet for the first 4-6 months. The bladder is small and the urine is very dilute, so these babies pee 10-14 times per day or more. As the kidneys develop over the years, the urine can become more concentrated. The bladder grows in size, and so does the brain! As the brain develops, the child can eventually gain conscious control of elimination. This typically happens in the second and third years of life. It takes practice, so the skill is not perfected until the fifth or sixth year. Some children may still have underdeveloped kidneys in their preschool and early school years--if the kidneys are not concentrating urine, they will be more prone to accidents and bed wetting. Don't punish your children for these accidents, have their kidney function tested.

When asleep your body secrets low anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) which slows the creation of urine by the kidneys. At what state of development this hormone starts to be secreted varies between people and is to some degree genetically regulated. Children who wet the bed are known to have lower ADH than their peers. Once the ADH levels increase the problem generally resolves itself.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You learned how to control the external sphincters that make you release yourself.
Others have also explained that hormones play a part in it as well.</p>
<p>Basically everything in your body has a sphincters, or valves, that allow it to move from one place to another.
From your esophagus to your stomach, stomach to small intestines, etc
Your veins have valves too, so that your retuning blood (headed towards the heart) doesn't backflow down from the direction it came from (or up if it's coming from above your heart).</p>
<p>Young children can't control it that well because the sphincters are too weak to control.
It also has to do with potty training &amp; forcing your brain to know when &amp; where to do your business.
Some adults might even wet the bed if their peeing dream is so strong that they unintentionally relieve themselves IRL.</p>
<p>As for adults who sometimes accidentally wet themselves &amp; it's not dream-based, that's due to medical issues or them just getting too old &amp; becoming weaker.
That's another topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answering from a British perspective, traditionally only the kitchen cold tap got water directly from the supply. The supply also fed a cold water storage cistern in the loft that then fed the bathroom cold taps and the hot water storage cylinder, which in turns feeds the hot water taps. Sometimes instead all the cold taps got a direct supply and the storage cistern was just for feeding the hot water cylinder. Now that storage cistern isn't sealed airtight, although it should have a lid. That means that dirt, insects, and so on (even a rat, in one reported case) can get into the cistern especially if the lid is missing and that means that any tap fed from it isn't properly safe to drink. It's <em>probably</em> fine, I drank from the bathroom taps all the time as a child and never got sick, but better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>If the kitchen cold tap is noticeably forceful, whereas all the other taps flow more gently, then your house probably has a system like this.</p>
<p>EDIT PS: I don't know exactly why that system became the most common, but an advantage is you probably have about 300 litres (80 US gallons) of water stored, useful if the mains supply is cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're referring to speed of heating, it's not scientifically correct. I don't have an in depth knowledge, but have read about it. And think about it logically. If you have a pot of water at 0° and a pot at 50° and heat them both, eventually the water that was 0° will rise to 50°. So how is that different than using water starting at 50°? </p>
<p>This is an excerpt from Scientific American Magazine:</p>
<p>Takamasa Takahashi, a physicist at St. Norbert College in De Pere, iWis., attempts a definitive answer:</p>
<p>&quot;Cold water does not boil faster than hot water. The rate of heating of a liquid depends on the magnitude of the temperature difference between the liquid and its surroundings (the flame on the stove, for instance). As a result, cold water will be absorbing heat faster while it is still cold; once it gets up to the temperature of hot water, the heating rate slows down and from there it takes just as long to bring it to a boil as the water that was hot to begin with. Because it takes cold water some time to reach the temperature of hot water, cold water clearly takes longer to boil than hot water does. There may be some psychological effect at play; cold water starts boiling sooner than one might expect because of the aforementioned greater heat absorption rate when water is colder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>The claim has the ring of a myth. But environmental scientists say it is real.</p>
<p>The reason is that hot water dissolves contaminants more quickly than cold water, and many pipes in homes contain lead that can leach into water. And lead can damage the brain and nervous system, especially in young children.</p>
<p>Lead is rarely found in source water, but can enter it through corroded plumbing. The Environmental Protection Agency says that older homes are more likely to have lead pipes and fixtures, but that even newer plumbing advertised as “lead-free” can still contain as much as 8 percent lead. A study published in The Journal of Environmental Health in 2002 found that tap water represented 14 to 20 percent of total lead exposure.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll attempt to sum up all the reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lead and other contaminants dissolve much more easily in hot water.  This can lead to unwanted tastes, and could possibly build up to harmful amounts of chemicals in the bloodstream if consumed routinely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hot water tank isn't necessarily a clean place.  A sludge made of minerals and bacteria can easily form.  Additionally, in Britain, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfHgUu_8KgA" target="_blank">the hot water from the tank isn't rated as potable water.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The old myth that cold water heats faster.</p>
</li>
<li>Water heaters are less efficient than heating water on the stove because of all the water that gets pulled out of the tank and just sits there cooling in the pipes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to make your water boil faster, boil some of it in an electric kettle or the microwave while letting the rest heat on the stove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In that time, both branches of the taxon have developed wildly differing tool cultures. Human language and chimpanzee language are tools.  There is no inherent genetic component.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, humans aren't even of one mind on smiling. <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/advising/american_culture/social_skills/nonverbal_communication/reading_exercise.htm" target="_blank">This article</a> from Rensselaer Politechnic has an interesting article on differing uses of the smile in non-verbal communication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A smile may show affection, convey politeness, or disguise true feelings. For example many people in Russia consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior. Yet many Americans smile freely at strangers in public places (although this is less common in big cities). Some Russians believe that Americans smile in the wrong places; some Americans believe that Russians don't smile enough. In Southeast Asian cultures, a smile is frequently used to cover emotional pain or embarrassment. Vietnamese people may tell the sad story of how they had to leave their country but end the story with a smile.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has some basis in body language development, I believe. For chimps or many animals, 'smiling' is baring the teeth, which is a defensive posture. It's a way of saying 'don't antagonize me'. It is like unsheathing a weapon, in part because they actually do use their teeth as weapons.</p>
<p>Humans, by contrast, do not use our teeth as weapons because they are poorly designed to be used as weapons. Human body language over thousands of years has developed to be concentrated on our highly mobile facial muscles. While we do take some body language cues, most of our expressions are in our faces. While smiles mean different things depending on culture, they are not viewed as a threat because they are not typically used as weapons except in the most dire circumstances </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The baring of teeth in chimpanzees is a not-so-subtle gesture that says &quot;if you try and hurt me, it'll cost you&quot;. It's not a threat of murder so much an appeal to a sense of self-preservation in the other. It's a common gesture, too. Nearly every species has a threat response, and a number of them involve the baring of teeth. </p>
<p>What does that have to do with human smiles? At some point in our history, the baring of teeth, combined with an upward curl of the mouth's corners began to mean &quot;I'm not so bad, we could be friends&quot;. We do, however, still retain the baring of teeth in expressions of anger, fear, disgust and joy. The baring of teeth seems to heighten the effect of the expression.</p>
<p>That might be the key to this question. If baring teeth in human expression is merely an enhancer of the underlying expression, then chimps may be baring their teeth as an enhanced version of an underlying appeasement gesture that has no exact analog in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Now, if your connection is not encrypted, anyone between you an the remote server (such as your ISP) can see the contents of your communications.

<p>Edit 4: Here are a couple links that led me to believe that the sightings had increased and were credible enough to be taken seriously by scientists.  (copy/pasted from a buried comment)
Here is a different <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/tech/extinct-creature-sightings-piling-australia-130041464.html" target="_blank">news source</a> which I read a couple days ago that prompted me to think that the number of sightings have increased recently. </p>
<p>In the article they mention several recent sightings and the fact that there is a team of scientists taking action to further investigate the claims.</p>
<p>More information on the scientists conducting the research can be found <a href="https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2017/march/fnq-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger" target="_blank">here</a> in a media release from James Cook University. Dr. Sandra Abell and professor Bill Laurence will be leading a team of scientists that will be placing 50 wildlife cameras out in strategic locations to try to catch a glimpse of the creature. This is part of an already existing study that they were conducting to monitor wildlife that had been modified to focus on the Tasmanian Tigers following the credible sighting reports. </p></div></div>

<p>&quot;What are the biological implications when a species that we thought was extinct, rebounds it's population? Is it just limited to things like focusing on changing what caused their extinction in the first place, like eradicating the rats in the 'tree lobster' article?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many potential side-effects of drastically decreasing population sizes to the point of near extinction, and none of them are very encouraging.  The most common/pertinent are the implications from a <strong>population bottleneck</strong> (genetic drift).  Essentially, when population sizes are reduced drastically, the genetic diversity that was found in the species before-hand is eliminated, leaving only a small fraction of what there was before.  This can lead to a bevy of mishaps, some of the more notable being increased species vulnerability to disease, and random deleterious mutations spreading through the population more easily.</p>
<p>Currently, cheetahs are exhibiting severe side-effects from repeated population bottlenecks; their genetic diversity is so low that skin grafts from one animal to a separate one are not rejected by the recipient.  You can find lots of interesting information about cheetah genetic diversity.  Also, there was a thread not too long ago in which a similar question was asked about the last remaining Wooly Mammoth populations on earth.  The link to that thread (in which I gave a similar answer) is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5xa3ly/dna_clues_to_why_woolly_mammoth_died_out_the_last/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>EDIT:</em>
Because I don't think I fully got to the heart of what OP was asking.  As far as management issues are concerned (I have also worked and continue to work in the field of conservation genetics) typically a particular species has an increased amount of funding allocated to studying its ecology and reproductive habits (if it's one of the lucky ones to receive funding).  From that point on, the species is listed as vulnerable/threatened in some way and active management is taken to ensure the survival of that species.  For example, if it's found out that a particular invasive competitor is very detrimental to the persistence of a species, we go out of our way to ensure that is less of a problem (if possible).  Once the species reaches what is deemed an acceptable and 'stable' population size (or if the money runs out), it is usually still monitored, albeit less frequently, for many years after to assess the success of the strategies employed.  Also I work mostly with plants in this area so it may be different for you animal people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to address your edit because no-one else has so far:</p>
<p>Firstly, most of these cases aren't the result of a species 'rebounding' so much as being rediscovered, either by chance or by extensive searching. The population is probably still tiny. The question then becomes how to help it to recover and prevent it actually becoming extinct. In that case, yes eliminating the original threats is a vital first step. Unfortunately that step is not always easy - for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory-billed_woodpecker" target="_blank">Ivory-billed woodpecker</a> is probably extinct, primarily due to habitat destruction. It's prefered habitat is old forest (as it depends on dead trees for food and nesting). As such, it is very difficult to simply recreate habitat - mature woodland takes literally hundreds of years to develop.</p>
<p>In many cases, we would want to carry out further interventions to help speed up the population's recovery, as well as insuring against disasters. This often means captive breeding programmes, as well as translocations to create new populations in other places. One good example of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius_kestrel" target="_blank">Mauritius kestrel</a> which was brought back from the brink of only 4 individuals in 1974. However, many other species have benefitted from similar programmes (e.g. <a href="https://www.zsl.org/conservation-initiatives/conservation-breeding" target="_blank">these</a> run by ZSL).</p>
<p>In terms of biological implications, the most obvious one is the risk posed by loss of genetic diversity, especially if a once large population rapidly dropped to a very low one and remained low for several generations. An example of this is the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229640-700-killing-with-kindness-conservations-cautionary-tale/" target="_blank">Chatham ISland Black Robin</a> (paywall - <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22704831/0" target="_blank">this</a> page has fewer details but is free) which has recovered from a single breeding pair. Unfortunately, there is strong evidence for genetic problems which resulted in eggs not successfully hatching due to poor parental behaviour. In this case, there's not much that can be done other than intensive care for the species and hope that evolution acts in time. In other cases, isolated populations with low genetic diversity can have their diversity boosted by introducing individuals from other, more diverse populations - an example of this is the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050818/full/news050815-7.html" target="_blank">Florida panther</a>.</p>
<p>There can also be more subtle effects. In particular, many species interact with the rest of their ecosystem. If a population becomes so small as to be functionally extinct (i.e. too few individuals to impact the ecosystem) then the ecosystem can change in such a way to become less suitable. A hypothetical example would be an insect that feeds on and pollinates a specific plant. If the insect population declines, then the plant no longer gets pollinated and also declines. Then, it becomes difficult for the insect to recover as it no longer has any food. There are many examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_engineer" target="_blank">ecosystem engineers</a> which this could apply to. A real example (albeit in a slightly different context) was the <a href="http://www.livescience.com/13957-giant-tortoises-ebony-trees-introduction-extinction.html" target="_blank">introduction of giant tortoises</a> to Ile aux Aigrettes to replace the native species of giant tortoise which had become extinct.</p>
<p>On a completely different vein, rediscovery of an extinct species can have important legal considerations. Many countries have legislation to protect rare and endangered species, but this doesn't apply to extinct species. If it is confirmed that a species is, in fact, not extinct, then suddenly all those laws become applicable. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/23/night-parrot-sighting-confirmed-in-western-australia-for-first-time-in-100-years" target="_blank">This recent rediscovery</a> of a night parrot mentions that mining development is likely to be restricted as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>
<p>Leonardo Da Vinci painted it. He is the foremost Renaissance artist. Artist's credibility adds to the paintings popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte hung the painting in his master bedroom in 1800. This - I think - was the first tipping point of making the painting one of the most popular paintings in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1804, Mona Lisa is hung in the Louvre - and others can now glimpse at the painting that Napoleon slept with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the real tipping point for the paintings popularity only hit in August of 1911 - when Mona Lisa is stolen. Stolen from heavily secured Louvre which experts said was impossible. No one knows who stole it or how. Conspiracy theories abound. The painting is talked about in every newspaper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 2 weeks of much fan fare, Police arrest Guillaume Apollinaire on suspicion of theft. He is the only person they have arrested. Apollinaire implicates Pablo Picasso. The rumor of Picasso stealing the Mona Lisa adds in a lot more fuel in making Mona Lisa very very popular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picasso is questioned and released. Guillaume Apollinaire himself is released after 5 days. Everyone is still clueless as to who stole the painting. But conspiracy theories abound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two years after the theft, the Mona Lisa is finally found when an employee working at Louvre tries to sell it to an art gallery in Florence for $100,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Mona Lisa is returned to the Louvre, it draws massive crowds. People visit the Louvre only to see this one painting.</p>
</li>
<li>And then it hit the Paris Hilton effect. Its popularity added to its popularity. So much so that most people don't know why it is popular in the first place.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Legitimate history and origins aside, the &quot;aura&quot; around the Mona Lisa reminds me of this excerpt from DeLillo's <em>White Noise</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several days later Murray asked me about a tourist attraction known as the most photographed barn in America.  We drove 22 miles into the country around Farmington.  There were meadows and apple orchards.  White fences trailed through the rolling fields.  Soon the sign started appearing.  THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED BARN IN AMERICA.  We counted five signs before we reached the site.  There were 40 cars and a tour bus in the makeshift lot.  We walked along a cowpath to the slightly elevated spot set aside for viewing and photographing.  All the people had cameras; some had tripods, telephoto lenses, filter kits.  A man in a booth sold postcards and slides -- pictures of the barn taken from the elevated spot.  We stood near a grove of trees and watched the photographers.  Murray maintained a prolonged silence, occasionally scrawling some notes in a little book. </p>
<p>&quot;No one sees the barn,&quot; he said finally. </p>
<p>A long silence followed. </p>
<p>&quot;Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn.&quot;</p>
<p>He fell silent once more.  People with cameras left the elevated site, replaced by others.</p>
<p>We're not here to capture an image, we're here to maintain one. Every photograph reinforces the aura.  Can you feel it, Jack? An accumulation of nameless energies.&quot; </p>
<p>There was an extended silence.  The man in the booth sold postcards and slides. </p>
<p>&quot;Being here is a kind of spiritual surrender.  We see only what the others see.  The thousands who were here in the past, those who will come in the future.  We've agreed to be part of a collective perception.  It literally colors our vision.  A religious experience in a way, like all tourism.&quot; </p>
<p>Another silence ensued. </p>
<p>&quot;They are taking pictures of taking pictures,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>He did not speak for a while.  We listened to the incessant clicking of shutter release buttons, the rustling crank of levers that advanced the film. </p>
<p>&quot;What was the barn like before it was photographed?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What did it look like, how was it different from the other barns, how was it similar to other barns?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;The 'Mona Lisa' wasn't even the most famous painting in its gallery, let alone in the Louvre,&quot; Zug says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was 28 hours, they say, until anyone even noticed the four bare hooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of a sudden, James Zug says, &quot;the 'Mona Lisa' becomes this incredibly famous painting — literally overnight.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the Louvre announced the theft, newspapers all over the world ran headlines about the missing masterpiece.</p>
</li>
<li>After a weeklong shutdown, the Louvre re-opened to mobs of people, Franz Kafka among them, all rushing to see the empty spot that had become a &quot;mark of shame&quot; for Parisians.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody talked about the Mona Lisa before 1911; it was not popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was stolen in 1911, but not noticed the entire day (28 hours). </p>
<p>Once the theft was reported all over the world (which shows what a big deal it was back then before the Internet or even television), overnight mobs of people became interested and wanted to see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The heist put it into the public consciousness in a very dramatic way, lifted it out of obscurity and became immediately famous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> One day nobody knows anything about the Mona Lisa, the next day it's <strong>stolen</strong> and everyone has to see it. Over a hundred years later it's the most famous painting in the world, but nobody remembers why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Leonardo's existing fame plus the painting's innovative brilliance made it instantly famous, but it wouldn't become the &quot;most famous painting in world history&quot; until the painting's own history made it legendary. The painting was stolen and nobody knows how or by who so the rumors and suspicions around it gave it more and more attention, and then when it was finally recovered people from all over flocked to see it at the Louvre to see what was so special about this painting they'd heard about. </p>
<p>Then people heard about massive crowds at the Louvre and decided they must see for themselves, so on and so forth.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orcas are fairly intelligent.</p>
<p>The various communities all have different hunting techniques.</p>
<p>Anyway, there was a case about an orca pod attacking a boy in Alaska, the boy was swimming and felt something touch him, he looked and saw an Orca.</p>
<p>Experts think the orca aborted the attack, thinking the boy was a seal as it was close to a harbour where seals are common.</p>
<p>My guess is the orca could have taken that boy without question.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are horror stories of orcas eating humans a few hundred years ago, before the rise of whaling. So I suspect orcas perhaps fear humans, if a human is killed by them then there would be retribution.</p>
<p>So yeah, whales are rarely ever aggressive to humans. Probably because they do not understand us, they are curious and do not see us as a prey item. </p>
<p>They are intelligent enough to know we would be an easy meal though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There are different groups of Killer whales, called 'ecotypes', which vary in size, colour and location. They also eat different things -some eat fish, some go for mammals. Whatever they usually eat, they can tell the difference between their normal food and a person with their echolocation. We don't look the same to them as a seal, or whatever else they might be eating. We are also not a very nutritious food, nor do we usually hang out where Killer whales do, so there hasn't been a need to adapt to make us part of their diet.</p>

<p>Animals have to adapt to survive negative consequences. We're humans but we're animals too and for us to have survived this long, we will have to have learned to remember what did not work for us. We remember what almost killed us or hurt our social status because we can't have happy, healthy, wealthy children if we are dead; nor if nobody likes us. So our brains are wired to keep us alive and in good standing with society.</p>
<p>In other words, we can't forget about the things that sucked in our lives because our genetics want us to learn from them so that we can have children that can learn from them too. Evolution!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A whole lot of bad info here.</p>
<p>Short version:  So Congresspeople can get reelected by their constituents.</p>
<p>Longer version:  The military-industrial complex employs a <em>lot</em> of people (citation needed).  Those numbers don't include just those in uniform, or even the civilians who took over the outsourced jobs that used to be rotational duty for service members (mainly in personnel and admin, but also maintenance contractors and subject matter experts).</p>
<p>It also includes those people who <em>make</em> all the equipment the military uses, both on a daily basis as well as for wartime use.  The cuts that the Pentagon proposes would severely impact the plants that manufacture those products.  It came up in the news <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/9/lawmakers-force-pentagon-to-buy-tanks-keep-ships-a/" target="_blank">in</a> <a href="http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/12/18/congress-again-buys-abrams-tanks-the-army-doesnt-want.html" target="_blank">recent</a> <a href="http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/01/28/pentagon-tells-congress-to-stop-buying-equipment-it-doesnt-need.html" target="_blank">years</a> after sequestration became a thing.</p>
<p>There is, technically, a reason to keep some of those plants running besides local economy.  The going theory is that if you ever get rid of, say, the Abrams tank plant, and a war happens, it's going to end up costing more to spool the plant back up, retool all the machinery, and re-teach brand new employees how to make the tank...which will add time and cost to producing the end product, and/ or may mean the first generation or two of new tanks may not be up to par.</p>
<p>This isn't that unreasonable a concept.  On a particular weapons system I worked on, the company stopped producing part of the control system.  A high-end, high fail-rate <em>must have</em> part simply did not exist, except for the same part that was being installed on newer versions of the same ship.  We resorted to stealing the parts from the ships being built, and then when those ended up dying through normal wear-and-tear, we were given two options.</p>
<p>A) Wait 30 months for a brand new part.  This included the time to restart the manufacturing, including training all new workers and remaking the machinery to make the part.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>B) Wait 9 months for the part to be refurbished.</p>
<p>Note that Option C (all of the above) was not listed as a possibility.  I know.  I asked.</p>
<p>Now, that's anecdotal, and certainly doesn't address the fact that thousands of extra tanks exist when they shouldn't, but it's not entirely a bullshit excuse either.</p>
<p>All that said, the bottom line really comes back to local jobs.  Voters reward those who bring jobs to or keep jobs in the area.  It's why the subject of BRACs is such a hot-button issue whenever it comes up, and why Congresspeople will fight tooth and nail to keep the plant in <em>their</em> district open, while not giving two fucks if the next district over loses theirs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit:  To answer more as to why the military would tell Congress point blank why they don't need as much money, sometimes it's not the <em>amount</em> of money so much as it is <em>how</em> that money's being spent.  There's whole herds of senior officers and bean counters, some pretty smart fucking people, who know roughly how much money is available for the military's use, and money's just another resource.  Same as beans, bullets, and bandages.  They have their own needs and wants, and know that if you get rid of money from Column A (outdated tanks or ships that need to be retired), you can then spend that money on Column B (R&amp;D on new weapons or armor, new ships, or maybe even more service members).</p>
<p>There's a very real frustration in that, in the military's eyes, they're being hamstrung over the long term for the benefit of those who hold their budget in their hands, and it's a bipartisan problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit 2:  There's a few questions involving the overall expenditure of money to the DoD as well as our global force.  We do spend a LOT of money on our DoD, true.  However, if you look at our spending on our military vs. our GDP (basically, how much of our budget as a percentage goes to military), we're actually in a pretty good spot.  <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?year_high_desc=true" target="_blank">As of 2015</a>, we were 20th in military spending vs. GDP, at 3.3%.  That's behind Russia's 5%, Israel's 5.4%, and Saudi Arabia's 13.5%.  </p>
<p>For spending 3.3% of our GDP on military, what do we get?  </p>
<p>A) Jobs.  These are actually pretty needed, in a very general sense.  There's much to be said for shifting those jobs to higher priorities, but the fact of the matter is that at a local level, if that happens, there are going to be people that lose their jobs, <em>even if</em> other people gain jobs.  I'm not stating this to defend it, just to put the info out there.  This is primarily what your average Congressperson is concerned with, because guess what?  It's what their constituents are concerned with.  Which, in the military's eyes, is actually a win.  Wait, why is this?  </p>
<p>Because when was the last time the entire nation banded together and really was a truly unified country?  When it faced a threat that had hit home soil, and had showed some capacity of bringing the fight here to our shores.  </p>
<p>As soon as Pearl Harbor happened, the patriotic instinct of &quot;we must protect this house!&quot; came into full bloom, and the entire nation bent its will towards doing everything in its power to make sure that no invasion of the US happened, by ensuring its enemies were destroyed far from its shores.  Which leads to...</p>
<p>B) Defense in Depth.  This is really what we're buying with our money.  The people who volunteer to serve, the equipment they train in and on, the tools to take the fight to the enemy, the massive support structure back at home, all of that exists for one purpose:  To keep the fight as far away from us as possible.</p>
<p>I'm going to go Navy on this for just a moment, because hey, that's what I know, but other forces also have similar strategies.</p>
<p>If you're an aircraft carrier, you have multiple layers of defense.  It's not just the force that the ship itself provides, because while that's good, it's just not enough, and there's holes.  Threats exist to which the carrier is not readily equipped, <em>on its own</em>, to deal with very well.  Subs can fire torpedoes.  ASCM (anti-ship cruise missiles) can be launched.  Swarms of attack craft can come on out and blow themselves up next to the ship.  The list goes on.</p>
<p>So what does a carrier do, accept those risks?  Oh hell no.  Instead, what they do is take a whole flotilla of ships with it.  Destroyers and cruisers keep an eye out above and below the surface of the water, ensuring that at the very least, any possible threat is identified and assessed, if not engaged.  A lone friendly sub may also be somewhere out there, likewise protecting the carrier as well as everyone else.  The carrier itself launches Combat Air Patrol to ensure that other nations' helos and fixed wing aircraft are warded off and engaged far away from the ship.</p>
<p>If, <em>somehow</em>, a threat worked its way through all of that to attack the carrier itself, the ship still has its own limited ability to fight it off.  Two different kinds of self-defense missiles as well as an extremely beefed up gatling gun protect the ship from any missiles, and can even be used against both air and surface targets.  Small arms crews can employ crew-served weapons against small craft.</p>
<p>Bottom line, to take out a carrier, you're going to have to be both lucky <em>and</em> good, and come in with a fairly sizeable force.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Note that this is simply one hypothetical, and is vastly simplified.  This is, after all, ELI5.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of that is just to say that the same concept is applied to our nation.  Envision the US as our carrier.  Sure, we have lots of guns at home, and a Coast Guard, but the further away our forces can meet the enemy and force a conflict elsewhere, the better our chances of never seeing an engagement on our own shores is.</p>
<p>Diplomacy and international aid are kind of like our long-range radars, in a way.  We can use those to detect the possible threat and veer ourselves (or the other country, really), out of our line of sight.  But should that fail, and it does for a wide variety of reasons, we have our own military to ensure that potential conflicts stay far away from us.</p>
<p>No other nation in the world projects force like we do, in part because most nations are far more concerned with their own backyard.  Even the old USSR at the height of the Cold War never really gave much of a shit about our land or resources, they just wanted to stop us from meddling in their plans for Asia and Europe.  China?  Wants to dominate SE Asia.  Hell, the Middle East?  Just wants us (and everyone else, really) to leave them alone, except to buy oil.</p>
<p>And this is why the very fact that Congresspeople are more concerned with jobs at the local level than with our ability to fight wars overseas is a win...because it <em>is</em> a comparison between those two, and not local jobs vs. an ability and a <em>need</em> to fight those same wars at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Even if we have law enforcement, criminologists, data scientists telling us year after year that the war on drugs has failed and is doing more harm than good, politicians will always run on a tough on crime, tough on drugs policy because the average voter won't be reading research papers on the drug war. Instead they are more susceptible to populist rhetoric about crime and drugs ruining their neighborhood. So as a result, regardless of party affiliation, if the politician is from a large, national party they will be &quot;tough&quot; on drugs and crime because otherwise, it allows their opponent a free means to accuse them of having a weak stance on the law and protecting your streets and families.</p>
<p>This applies to military spending. The average person for the most part is against war but they are not against the military/it's soldiers. If a politician takes an active stance of cutting military spending especially in a period of uncertainty, that politician leaves him/herself open for a free attack on being against the troops and against national security regardless of whether the attacking politician wants to start a war or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I served nearly 10 years in the military, Active Duty starting in 2006. I also was the equipment manager for four separate equipment accounts worth millions of dollars each. That means I ordered stuff, repaired stuff, or sent stuff to be repaired at the proper station, as well as kept accountability on all pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>Let me try to answer your question: Does the military need more money for new/better equipment?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes. The stuff we have is old and crappy. Not all of it, and different bases with different missions might have some pretty badass stuff - but my base didn't. Our stuff was 40+ years old a lot of time, and probably cost more to repair every year than it would to just buy a modern one (but it's hard to buy $50,000 pieces of equipment routinely, usually a squadron can only afford ordering a few things a year - spread over hundreds and hundreds of pieces of equipment).</p>
</li>
<li>We need less than you may think. Why? Because TONS of money is thrown away/wasted every year. I'm not going to say too much, but due to an inspection that was coming up I was given a (unlawful) order to literally throw away about a hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment that was found by a member of my unit in a storage bin which was undocumented and ordered by someone who left the base years and years ago (this was overseas, so people in and out all the time). The individual who told me to do this was a Master Sergeant and I was a Staff Sergeant. I'm not gonna say what happened, but I will say that we did well on the inspection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty stupid if you ask me but it's also something that happens a lot. </p>
<p>There are a lot of issues with our military, but it would take a lot of great men to fix them, and that's just a resource that we no longer have much of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the time, when politicians talk about the defence budget, they don't necessarily mean the military itself, but spending on defence contractors who employ citizens in their congressional districts and who contribute to their reelection campaigns and PACs. It doesn't even matter if the contractors deliver anything, the spending is the point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there some helicopter or ship a few years ago that the US military begged Congress not to fund? It didn't work; was expensive to maintain; and nobody felt it was needed. But Congress went ahead and funded it with billions of dollars (that's a 'b') so they could keep people employed making it. Honestly, it would make more sense to just give everyone a few years' salary and shut down the project.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
