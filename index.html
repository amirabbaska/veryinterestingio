		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A color changing LED isn't one LED in a package but three LEDs along with a small computer to drive them. The LED is made up of red, green and blue LEDs each of which can be controlled by a microcontroller. Since the two legs on the LED that supply the power are connected to the microcontroller and not the LED elements a current limit resistor is not required.</p>
<p>The microcontroller is able to turn each of the colors on or off, so if the red LED is turned on then the output from the color changing LED is red. When the blue LED is turned on it is blue, if both the blue and red LEDs are turned on then the color changing LED is a shade of purple (called magenta). Similarly combining red with green gives yellow and blue &amp; green gives cyan.</p>
<p>Although the color changing LED uses the six colors mentioned above, it slowly changes from one to another. This is still done using the three basic red, green &amp; blue elements. If the red LED is combined with the blue LED, but the blue LED is only driven at 50% of its normal brightness then a color half way between red and magenta is generated.</p>
<p>Whilst the red LED is left turned on, if the blue LED is slowly taken from 0% brightness to 100% brightness then the color will gradually change from red to magenta.</p>
<p>If a standard LED is turned on and off very quickly, say 100 times every second then as far as the human eye is concerned it looks like it is constantly on. If the amount of time the LED is on for is the same as the time it is off for then it will be on for 50% of the time and 50% of its full brightness.</p>
<p>This same method can be done with the three LED elements inside the color changing LED. This means it is possible to combine any amount of the red, green and blue to give the desired color. Looking once again at the change from red to magenta, if the blue LED starts mainly turned off, goes to being on and off in even amounts and then to mainly being on then the the color will change as required.</p>

You then light a specific one my applying power to the color you want. If you look at large LEDs that can do RGB, they have 4 prongs coming off. You then power the prong you want an bam! Color. One for ground, and then each color gets a prong. If you make a super small RGB LED and then combine a bunch into a massive array, you get a tv.</p>
<p>You can do it with a single light source, then apply a polarizing filter. The filter is controlled by a small current. This can produce colors as well and is the idea behind LCD displays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some other commenters have covered really well how it's still <em>transmitting</em>, so I'll cover a bit of how we're <em>receiving</em>. The signals Voyager transmits are really weak when they get here, and there's a lot of noise in the electromagnetic spectrum, so the signals are way weaker than the noise. &quot;But wait&quot; you might say, &quot;if the signals are weaker than the noise, how can we hear them?&quot; It's a challenge comparable to hearing your friend whispering from across a room full of people talking. We came up with a really clever way to hear them, though.</p>
<p>Basically, it's like this: we take two giant receiver antennas. We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off. Both receivers get all of the noise from that area of the sky, but only the first gets Voyager's signal as well. If you subtract the noise  signal from the noise + Voyager signal, what you've got left is just the Voyager signal. This methodology is combined with a lot of fancy error correction coding to eliminate reception errors, and the net effect is the pinnacle of communications technology: the ability to communicate with a tiny craft billions of miles away.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how radioactive stuff is supposed to be radioactive for a long time, and radiation &quot;cooks&quot; things?  It turns out that if you take something that's really radioactive and has a long half-life, you can use that &quot;cooking&quot; to generate electricity for half a century.  This is called an RTG (Radioisotope thermoelectric generator), and Voyager 1 was launched with one decades ago.  It's not perfect - the plutonium core has decayed enough to force NASA to shut down some instruments for lack of power - but it still works.  The same type of generator powers the Curiosity rover, and many other spacecraft.</p>
<p>As for radio, that's a little more straightforward:  we have really big receivers and powerful transmitters on Earth, as well as really smart error correction.  </p>
<p>EDIT: Here's a picture of a similar plutonium core - it actually glows red-hot:

<p>So, Voyager will continue running until its RTG stops making enough power, we give up on it, or it gets hit by a rock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/orchlon" target="_blank">orchlon</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say a website is using an SSL certificate. That certificate is just something that says something like &quot;I am reddit and nobody can impersonate me&quot;. Now obviously SSL certificates websites offer up can simply be copied, so to authenticate themselves, the certificate includes a public key, and they have their private key which isn't shared, and the keys are mathematically linked, but the one can't be derived from the other (feasibly) they can only be created together, and the odds of you randomly generating an already existing key is miniscule, and when something is encrypted with one key, the other can decrypt it, and vice versa.</p>
<p>So what's to stop websites from simpy generating their SSL certificates? Nothing, so to actually prove that the website you're connecting to is the real deal, they have their certificates signed by a higher authority, and you automatically trust that authority, even though you have no idea because it comes preloaded in your browser. It's like government issued IDs, if someone shows you their driver's license, you have reasonable cause to believe their age on that card is the truth. The certificate authority signs other people's certificates with their own private key, which is also not shared, but can be verified with their public key.</p>
<p>So how does signing work? It's basically hashing and encrypting put together. Hashing is a function where you take a block of data and trim it down to a unique result that it isn't feasible to find a different block of data that returns the same result, so hashing can't (generally) be broken. Then it works like this, websites have their certificate, the certificate authority hashes it, and then encrypts the hash with their private key, which in turn spits out the digital signature</p>
<p>Now when you connect to a website, they serve you their signed certificate, which includes their public key and their digital signature which was signed by the certificate authority's private key, and you have the certificate authority's public key already preloaded in your browser. You take their certificate, hash it yourself, and then you take their digital signature, decrypt it with the certificate authority's public key. If they both match, then they're legit. Now this only proves that the website you're connecting to has a certificate that's correctly signed by a certificate authority. To prove that it is actually them you're connecting to, they send a verifiable block of data signed with their own private key, which you test with their public key. </p>
<p>So at the end you have reasonable cause to believe that the website you're connecting to is who they say they are, and their story is confirmed by a higher authority at the same time. At this point you know you're actually connecting to the website you're trying to connect. So how is any further data you exchange protected?</p>
<p>You generate a key, this time a symmetric key that's used for both encryption and decryption. You encrypt it with the website's public key and send it, and the website decrypts it with their private key, which only they can. This key can't be compromised because you confirmed the website's certificate (which contains their public key), and only that website can decrypt anything you encrypt with their public key, so at the end both you and the website have a key that was encrypted during transmission and it's used to encrypt any data you exchange from this point on.</p>
<p>Which brings another question, after the certificate is verified why can't we just continue encrypting stuff with their public key? Why do we have to generate a symmetric key and send it to the server? Because while you'll be able to send data securely to the server, the server in turn can't because anything they encrypt with their public key will be readable by anyone, and also because the algorithm used for the public/private key encryption is very slow, so it's only used at the start, after a which a faster algorithm is used. What algorithm to use is decided during the initial phase by both the browser and server telling each other their capabilities.</p>
<p>For some real world example, let's take reddit. If you click on the top left green locked key sign, you should be able to see reddit's certificate, and that it's signed by DigiCert Inc. If you go into more detail and view it, you should be able to see reddit's public key, and their digital signature signed by DigiCert Inc.</p>
<p>Edit: Minor correction, thanks /u/a_2</p>
<p>Edit2: Added another reason for using symmetric keys for encryption, arguable the main reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like passing encrypted notes back and forth to a friend in class. You use a cipher so the teacher or other students cannot read the message. Except your 3rd friend who is really good at math, created the cipher and is the only one who can verify if the note that you received was actually sent from your friend.</p>
<p>It should be noted that you can trust this 3rd friend to verify the notes correctly because you guys have been best friends basically forever, and everyone else trusts him too because he is so trustworthy.  </p>
<p>Edit: As a follow-up to your other questions, SSL is technically crackable, it's just not feasible to do so because with modern SSL, each packet would take days or weeks to crack. So the more feasible thing to do is setup a proxy server that intercepts SSL traffic, decrypts it, records it, and re-encrypts it the same way so the receiver never knows it was intercepted in the first place. Businesses do this to spy on their employees encrypted traffic, and the NSA basically does this at major internet relay points so they can spy on everybody. </p>
<p>SSL just makes it so the average computer nerd can't spy on you, you have to have money to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may no longer be the case, but this style of encryption was explained to me like this.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a message and you want to send it to your mate.</p>
<p>You have a box with the message inside.  You add a padlock to the box and lock it, then send the box to your mate.</p>
<p>Your mate then adds his own padlock to the box and sends the box back to you, now with both locks locking it.</p>
<p>You remove your padlock from the box and send the box to your mate (now only with their padlock locking the box).</p>
<p>He removes his lock, opens the box and reads the message &quot;FU MFER!&quot;</p>
<p>So, you've exchanged a message, no one in between was able to intercept it, and neither of you had to give each other sensitive stuff like keys and passwords.</p>
<p>Replace the box with a packet of data (or a frame or whatever the term the network bods are using these days) and the padlocks with encryption and it's sort of the same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>SSL Offload is used to store the server's SSL private key and issue the server's public SSL certificate on a proxy device that is not the server itself.  There are multiple security and scaling reasons why a site may use a proxy to terminate SSL sessions.  For example, the proxy may be a load-balancer that is distributing traffic across multiple servers that share a common SSL certificate.  The proxy may also be a deep packet inspection device that needs to decrypt the SSL traffic and inspect it before it send it on to that actual server.  But with SSL Offload, the SSL certificate used belong to the intended server, even if it is stored on the proxy</p>
<p>SSL Intercept does a similar function, except the SSL certificate belongs to the proxy device and not the end server.  For example, your company may want to inspect outbound SSL traffic from your computer, to ensure you and not transmitting sensitive information.  With SSL Intercept, the proxy device terminates your SSL session using its own certificate, inspects the unencrypted traffic, then re-encrypts the traffic into an SSL session with the actual server you're communicating with.  It may be that you company requires you to install its own SSL Cert Server certificate used to generate and sign the proxy's SSL certificate, so that you don't get a bunch of nasty warning messages about an unverified SSL certificate.</p>
<p>Two other things to think about.  First, many Android/iOS apps use SSL to encrypt sessions, but rely on 'anonymous' SSL.  This is when neither the client nor the server verify the authenticity of the presented SSL certificate, they just do the encryption.  Unfortunately, anonymous SSL is a lot more common than people think, and is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks</p>
<p>Second, many sites are now making use of certificate pinning, where a session to a server will fail unless the SSL session is verified end-to-end.  With certificate pinning, methods like SSL Offload and SSL Intercept will fail</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most any legal proceeding, there are questions of <strong>fact</strong> and questions of <strong>law</strong>. My answer will focus primarily on criminal law. Let's look at an example of a man who was arrested for selling what he thought was cocaine, but lab tests later revealed that the substance was only baking powder. </p>
<p>Here we have a question of law. Does somebody commit the crime of intent to distribute cocaine if the substance they were selling wasn't cocaine, but they thought it was? Or must the charges be dismissed? The judge is the <strong>finder of law</strong>. His or her job is to answer the legal questions posed by the situation. </p>
<p>Let's say that the judge determined that thinking that what you have is cocaine is enough for the charge to stand. The case proceeds to trial, and a jury is selected. The jury is the <strong>finder of fact</strong>. Their job is to listen to the evidence, and decide if the government has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did intend to distribute cocaine. They don't deal with the legal issues. Their only job is to consider what actually <em>happened</em>.</p>
<p>Judges also maintain other roles. They maintain order in the courtroom, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and deal with everything that happens before and after the trial (taking guilty pleas, setting dates, hearing motions, considering sentencing). In some situations, the defendant will ask for the judge to decide the entire case, without a jury. In other situations, the defendant is not even entitled to a jury, and the judge is automatically the finder of both law and fact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a public defender (trial attorney) for 5 years, here's a short (I'll do my best but attorneys tend to talk a lot) version of what judges do.</p>
<p>First thing's first. There's A LOT that happens that aren't trials. Depending on where you live in the states 95-99% of criminal cases are resolved with plea deals and never have a trial, and therefore no jury is ever assigned. Judges in these situations typically just keep things moving (make sure the police files are getting sent over in time and that lawyers are doing what they need to do in a timely manner), make sure that the accused understands their rights and the plea they are taking or rejecting, and then sentencing. </p>
<p>Sentencing is a big part of the judge's job. Unlike television most states don't let people agree to a specific sentence in a plea, you have to have a range of sentencing (i.e. you don't sign a pea to four years in prison, you sign a plea to 3-5). Judges decide the sentence within that range and are required to give sentences &quot;specific&quot; to the circumstances. This typically means they read briefs from both attorneys on the facts and additionally have the accused submit to an interview regarding their life circumstances, which can be quite time consuming given that a judge is probably giving 5-20 sentences a day. </p>
<p>Trial actually doesn't have a ton of work for judges (I've had judges fall asleep in trial), their main responsibility there is to rule on objections. 90% of these are very straight forward and literally take seconds to resolve. The other 10% are supposed to be handled before trial (called motions in limine) and take maybe an hour, though I have seen the occasional one take an entire day. Other than that they don't do much in trial, it's pretty much the attorney's show (A lot of judges don't really like trials, they have a lot of work to do and don't really like just sitting around watching the trial).</p>
<p>Another redditor mentioned &quot;questions of law,&quot; and while they are technically correct it's worth pointing out that questions of law are generally handled by appellate judges not trial level judges. Trial level judges don't really have the authority to decide questions of law, instead attorney's brief them on the state of law and then the judge applies what appears to be the most relevant and recent law to the current situation. For example if you go to a judge and say 'the police searched me illegally' the judge doesn't say the police should or shouldn't have done what they did, they just find the most similar existing case-law and follow that decision. </p>
<p>Appellate courts at the highest level (Supreme Court of the U.S. and various states) will decide true questions of law. They are the only ones with the authority to change existing legal rulings and decide what the rule is in new unheard-of situations. This is all pretty simplified though.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Am lawyer, would guess 90% of what a judge does is sentencing and making sure cases move through the system quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Judges still make many decisions. They rule on motions, they can dismiss jurors, decide what juries can see or hear. Judges have to make sure that all of the procedures and rules are followed so that a guilty verdict will not be reversed on appeal.</p>

<p>We need judges since there are bench trials, no jury, the judge decides the verdict. </p>
<p>Although due to mandatory minimums and sentencing laws limit judges power, they still have some power in sentencing.</p>

The fan bit is the mesentery.</p>
<p>It anchors the small intestine (9m of tubing!) to a small area (about 15-30cm in length). It also conveys blood vessels to supply the small intestine along its course. </p>
<p>The fan structure is then pleated like a Scottish kilt to fold into the abdomen. Having played around with it in the dissection room, it's a very smooth structure which allows some sliding and makes it difficult to tie knots in the small intestine.</p>

If you think about the structure of your intestines, because they're so long they need bloody supply everywhere and you don't want them to get knotted up. The mesentery solves both these problems, its basically a massive sheet which is connected to the intestines everywhere to stop it folding it on itself and also providing a blood supply.</p>
<p>The only reason this 'news' is surfacing is because it has been rebranded from supporting tissue to organ. The definition of organ is: a part of an organism which is typically self-contained and has a specific vital function. So I suppose you can call it an organ now, its vital function being supporting tissue for the bowels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>What is the Big Bang?</h2>
<p>The origin of your confusion seems to be the very common misconception that the big bang originated from one point in space. That is not true. </p>
<p>But let's back up a little:The observable universe is the sum of all points in space that are causally connected to earth. That means, it is a sphere around earth encompassing all the space from which photons have had the time to reach earth since the big bang ~13 billion years ago. </p>
<p>This observable universe was indeed compressed into a tiny portion of space shortly after the big bang. However, the observable universe is by far not all there is. Current data shows, that the universe is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe" target="_blank">probably at least 3*10^(23) times bigger</a> than the observable universe. And many cosmologists believe that the universe is infinitely big. </p>
<p>Hence, the big bang did not occur at one point in space, but everywhere at one. Which is why the name big bang is horrible. Henry Reich from MinutePhysics argues that the Big Bang should be renamed into Everywhere Stretch in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3MWRvLndzs" target="_blank">this</a> video. (You should definitely check this video out, it does a good job explaining your very question.)</p>
<p>The Cosmic Background Radiation is the residual radiation from a time shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe cooled down enough to become transparent to photons. And the photons we detect on earth have traveled since that moment and are reaching us just now. </p>
<h2>Can we see Background Radiation from everywhere in the universe, or is earth somehow special?</h2>
<p>One of the most fundamental assumptions of cosmology is that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous - which is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">cosmological principle</a>. That means by and large the universe looks the same in all directions and at all points. This suggests, that earth is <em>not</em> special in being able to see Cosmic Background Radiation. Indeed, every observer, anywhere in the universe is in the center of their own observable universe and will receive CMB (cosmic microwave background) from the edge of <em>their</em> observable universe. Thus, the question what it looks like to stand at the edge of the observable universe cannot be answered in any meaningful way. An observer is <em>always</em> at the center of their own observable universe, so - by definition - there cannot be an observer at the edge of an observable universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So does this mean 14 billion light years away we can look at the big bang itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! Although, due to the expansion of spacetime it is actually more like 46.6 billion light years away, and what we can actually see is the time when the universe was full of a hot, glowing plasma. That plasma was opaque (can't see much through glowing clouds) so we can't actually observe even more into the past because light from then ran into the glowing clouds at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do we somehow see the same singularity everywhere in the edge of the observable universe in any direction? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite, but sort of in the sense that everywhere was the singularity at one point. What we see is the period where the universe was close and very hot, but not when it was a singularity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And this is visible anywhere in the universe for the boundary of the snapshot particular to that point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by this, but any other point in the universe would be able to see the same thing as we do relative to their location. Their visible universe would be centered on their location.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that a lot of sites store password hashes rather than actual plain text passwords. And when the user types in their password, the plain text is put through a hashing process (like MD5 or SHA-256) and then the output (the hash) of that process is actually used to authenticate the user. So when someone hacks a website they usually end up with hashed passwords rather than actual passwords.</p>
<p>I've always heard that it is impossible (or at least so difficult it is practically impossible) to reverse the hashing process (i.e. you can't take a hash and turn it into plain text) unless you just brute force a ton of plain text strings and compare the hashes. </p>
<p>So my question is, why can't hashing be reversed?</p>
<p>Related question - could machine learning be used to reverse hashing? If a computer using machine learning tried to find patterns between hashes and respective plain text, could it get there eventually?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hashing is destructive. To take an easy example that's easier to wrap your head around, we can make our own hashing algorithm. </p>
<p>For simplicity, imagine we have a password system where users have 4-digit pin codes as passwords.</p>
<p>So a real simple hash would be something like this: </p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a number between 1111 and 9999 (3456)</li>
<li>Multiply the number by itself (3456 * 3456 = 11 943 936)</li>
<li>Store the last three digits as the password (936)</li>
</ol>
<p>Turning 3456 into 936 was real simple - Turning 936 into 3456 is very hard. </p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a few not-to-rare caveats that occur, such as the need to use salts to prevent identical passwords from rendering identical hashes and avoid excessive truncation of both the input data and the stored hash. In our system above, for instance, any input that results in 936 will be a valid password, which means we have a high rate of collisions, which is bad. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So my question is, why can't hashing be reversed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because each calculation in hashing offers a single and straightforward option going forward; but multiple options in reverse.</p>
<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://fluidpowerjournal.com/2013/10/teslas-conduit/" target="_blank">Tesla's valvular conduit</a> &ndash; a valve without moving parts? A hash function is hard to reverse for similar reasons. Each step is more difficult in one direction than the other. When you chain enough steps together, the difficulty multiplies in a way that flow in the wrong direction is close to impossible.</p>
<p>Imagine you're at one of the source flows that join a large river. It's very straightforward to go downstream and end up where the river meets the ocean. Every turn is obvious - you always go downstream. However, if you're starting at the ocean, it's very difficult to go back to the place you started. Going up, you have to make countless decisions where the origin streams diverge, and it's highly unlikely you'll make all of them right unless you already know exactly where you're headed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say instead of your password, it's the city you live in that we are trying to verify. If I want to verify that you live in the place you lived before but I don't want to save your actual home city in a database for security reasons, I could calculate something based on your city instead.</p>
<p>One easy thing to do would be to store how many miles away your city is from a given spot, such as Chicago. When you tell me your city again, I can calculate the distance from your city to Chicago and check that against the distance stored in the database. This isn't a great hashing scheme though because you can easily figure out all cities that are X miles away from Chicago and guess what city the person is from. You can make this kind of check harder by making the distance calculation more complex. So instead of just straight line distance, maybe you map an actual travel route between the two cities, then maybe add 1 to your distance count for every mile traveled North, subtract one for every mile traveled West, etc. Now when someone sees &quot;42&quot; in the database, it's not clear if the city is 42 miles North, or 70 miles North and 28 miles West, etc. Ideally, the results for your calculation seems like a random number, so that if one city's code is 122, a city right next to it could just as easily be 25 as 429, there should be no correlation between similarities in the city geography and the code you generate. As long as it's just a set of simple math operations to calculate that distance number, the system can easily create a code for any city and then recalculate the same code later to verify.</p>
<p>There's still a problem though. Let's say New York's distance code is 149. Since this distance calculation itself isn't secret (if it works well it would be used for all kinds of websites and software), someone could just make a list of every major city and its corresponding distance code when compared to Chicago. So later if you find 149 in a leaked database, you know every user with that code is probably from New York. The solution is salting, which basically makes each calculation more unique. So instead of calculating distance from Chicago every time, you could calculate from a random city every time. Instead of user1:149, user2:149, user3:149, for three users from New York being stored in the database, it could be user1:149 from Chicago, user2:418 from Miami, user3:12 from San Francisco, so that now every user from New York has a different code stored. Now if someone wants to be able to know every user that lives in New York, they have to do the work of calculating the distance to New York from every other possible city that the system uses.</p>
<p>Edit: Said hash where I meant salt</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is missing from all of the answers so far is a statement of just how hard cracking is.  A hash function is a mathematical function, or algorithm, that takes some string as input, and produces a number as output.  It has the property that given the same input, it produces the same output.</p>
<p>A modern, cryptograhic hash function does this in a way that is hard to reverse.  That is, given the output if the hash function it is hard to find an input that, if run through the hash function, will produce that output.</p>
<p>How hard?  Hard enough that mathematicians believe there is no algorithm for reversing the hash function that is faster than trying all possible inputs until you find one that works.  (Note: belief is not the same as proof.  No hash function has been proven to be this strong, yet.)</p>
<p>The number of possible passwords is very, very large, so trying them all is not practical.  Nor will it ever be practical.</p>
<p>Passwords as a system are widely regarded as no longer secure, but not because people can reverse the hash algorithms.  People have gotten too good at coming up with plausible passwords you might have used, or at stealing your password.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons.</p>
<p>First, it is designed to be hard.  In mathematics, there are functions that get harder when you reverse them.  It is typically easier to multiply than divide, or to raise to a power rather than taking a root.  A well designed hash takes this to the extreme, and is a function that is computationally infeasible to reverse.</p>
<p>Second, hashes lose information.  They aren't encoding the information, they are taking its fingerprint.  The best you can to is find one of the infinite number of strings that created that hash.  Now if that string turned out to be &quot;Password123&quot; and not &quot;a67ab5ba895526eb3a7695c7b16bd910&quot;, you could be reasonably sure you had the password...just not completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Edit: I clarified my answer after many pointed out that it is misleading to say that the placebo effect <em>proves</em> wishful cures. Please also see other answers.)</p>
<p>There are a ton of reasons why a placebo might work:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a mind-body connection and psychosomatic therapies are valid</li>
<li>people pretend or believe themselves to be sick when they are not</li>
<li>people misreport disease symptoms and therapy effects</li>
<li>diseases can cure themselves given time</li>
<li>diet and environment cure diseases</li>
<li>statistical data and double-blind tests are the only valid medical evidence and drug development method</li>
</ul>
<p>New-age and alternative medicine play up the possibility of mind-body connection and that positive thinking, prayer, energy etc. cure diseases. This approach is unprovable and not scientific.</p>
<p>In addition to the various circumstantial and accidental factors, there is the pragmatic statistical approach that indirectly takes all factors and hypothesis into consideration. Thus, modern medicine focuses on validating (rather than explaining) drugs and therapies via placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has less to do with our minds being able to cure our ills, and more to do with changing our perception. Imagine a light is blinking steadily one second on, one second off. Now imagine that you are told every 3rd blink is slightly longer than the rest. You might then perceive this as so even though the light is blinking at a steady rate. What matters is that your perception of the event is altered. It is very difficult for us to make purely objective observations of things without measuring devices like a watch or instruments to measure things we want to observe. </p>
<p>Since we don't have instruments like this that tell you how much pain you are in, or how healthy you are, or how stressed you are, it is much more subjective to your perception and other factors can easily influence your experience. </p>
<p>Your body actually has 3 brains so to speak. There is your brain, your involuntary nervous system, and the enteric nervous system in your gut. Each has nerve communication with the other, but also each can operate independent of the others. So for instance if you feel threatened, you can force yourself to be calm, but you can't force your body not to produce adrenaline and prep you for fight or flight. That is an involuntary reaction you are powerless to control. </p>
<p>However you can practice breathing techniques to try to control your heart rate which can affect body temperature and relaxation. That is a far cry from the mind healing wounds or telling your liver to metabolize alcohol faster etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of misconceptions about the placebo effect. The placebo effect is only refers to any effect outside of the intended ones and is mostly a tool to analyze data during scientific research. This could include this mystical mind over body effect but it is mostly a mix of biases, from the patient and the scientist and external effects. For example, if I would conduct a research about a new pill for pain reduction and some of my patients take aspirin but don't report it, it will show up in my data set as positive even in my control group. It serves as a way to remove these factors if we assume they will effect all groups the same way. An example of researcher bias could be two doctors having slightly different idea of, let say, a cured tumor. Two different research on the same treatment will show different results but factoring the placebo effect with a control group should show the same results. This is also why, if you look at the control group of similar researches on the same treatment you will often see different effect, because they do not have the same way of looking at data. Then there is the problem of reported effect vs real effect. A patient can report positive effect of a placebo because, while they do not experience any physiological effect, they feel they must report it as working because, &quot;hey this must work right?&quot;. You will thus see very strange results if you compare reported data of let say, asthma attacks with a bio metric measurement, here, lung strength. The placebo affect is a great tool of analysis because most medical experiments is done on humans by humans in an open environment and we need a way factor for all the implicit biases and uncontrollable factor that are not cause by what we are observing but it is not a therapeutic method and was never meant to be. There might be an influence of the body in healing, but we should not jump at this conclusion before considering all the others, more plausible influences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI(Actually)5:</p>
<p>Let's use our imaginations and pretend that you and your best friend are playing outside on a sunny day, and you both fall down and get an owie (scientifically referred to as a boo-boo) in the exact same way. </p>
<p>Your mommy is outside watering the lawn and she sees you when you start to cry. She comes over and kisses your boo-boo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile your friend's mommy is in her house drinking Rosé and thinking about what a mistake it was to get married so young, so your best friend's has to settle for his weird aunt Placebo (you know she's weird because her name is Placebo and she has a weird mole on her face) kissing his boo-boo.</p>
<p>Now you obviously feel better because mommy kisses are a very effective scientifically proven cure for boo-boos. But everyone knows weird aunt kisses don't actually do a thing to help fix a boo-boo, and your friend has also stopped crying! So what happened? Why does Aunt Placebo have such a noticeable effect?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maybe both of your boo-boos would have felt better anyway after a few minutes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the act of kissing the boo-boo, even from a weird aunt, somehow distracts your friend and makes him think his boo-boo is better even if the underlying boo-boo is still there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe your friend stops crying because his aunt is a grown-up and he knows that grown-ups like to think that they helped (the word &quot;Placebo&quot; comes from a Latin word that means &quot;I shall please&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe in the process of your friend's aunt kissing his boo-boo, he (accidentally or on purpose) rubbed some dirt on it (another scientifically proven pain reliever almost as good as mommy kisses) and you didn't notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe your friend's brain has an (as-yet unidentified by science) secret magic store of mommy kisses that it releases after getting a kiss from someone other than his mommy.</p>
</li>
<li>Maybe more than one of these could be happening at the same time!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you had to put these possibilities in order from the highest to lowest chance of being right, where would you put the magic brain one? Is it more likely that the brain has a secret magic power that science hasn't found yet? Or that something else caused your friend's boo-boo to feel better? Probably the &quot;something else&quot; right?</p>
<p>It turns out that it's really hard to study boo-boo cures while getting rid of the things that are higher on the list, so there is a very good chance that something else besides the magic secret store of mommy kisses is going on. We should probably just assume that the Aunt Placebo effect is from one or more of those, before we jump to the conclusion that Aunt Placebo gives your brain magic powers.</p>
<p>Now let's get a band-aid on that boo-boo and get you back outside, eh sport?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are lighter stages of sleep where you take in more information and can be easily woken up. We cycle through many stages in a night of normal sleep, which means there will be several points during the night when sleep is light and you are more likely to be disturbed.</p>
<p>Your brain also doesn't remember much in REM/deep sleep, while you remember more in lighter stages of sleep. You literally forget that you hit deep sleep.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that mess up deep stages of sleep: alcohol, sedative-hypnotics like benzos and z-drugs, some mental illness, some sleep disorders, etc. If you aren't hitting dead-to-the-world deep sleep, of course you will be woken up more easily.</p>
<p>Problems like hypervigilance can disturb sleep because you are basically scanning for a reason to find a threat, and it's pretty hard to fall asleep with that sort of anxiety.</p>
<p>Thay said, research suggests that outside of major sleep disorders, the difference between good sleep and bad sleep is highly subjective. Many people who consider themselves light or poor sleepers are actually quite average.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about anxiety, hypervigilance, or anything else related to mental health, <em>please please please</em> think about reaching out for help. Doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors, social workers, mental health clinics, school counsellors, campus counsellors, online counselling resources, workplace employee assistance programs, mental health advocacy organizations, whatever is available in your area.

<p>The short answer is, it's not fully known why this occurs. Humans have a wide range of variability in our species (by the way, current top comment keeps referring to subspecies of humans sleeping different, that's some false terminology), and thus behave and interact with the environment in an equally wide range of ways. </p>
<p>Add to this situational events such as lack of recent sleep, stress, or even familiarity with the area you are sleeping in, and it is more understandable why this variation occurs. That's not to say there is or isn't one overarching reason, but mainly that many factors influence how a person sleeps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And like a fool, wonder if I have a superpower like Jack Reacher or something to tell time in my head. Even weirder that it has nothing to do with tiredness level, sometimes I play games till 5 and still jump up at 8, just because I told myself to do this before falling asleep. Telling yourself to wake up doesn't sound very convincing when you're dead tired, but for some reason, it works. For me at least. 90% of time or so.</p>
<p>There is antidote to this: cold room with super warm blankets. If that happens, and especially if room gets warmer in the morning, there's no sound or force in the world that can wake you up. My dad used to lit the stove in the early hours to warm the room up in our country house (military smarts, probably) and I remember those days as absolutely most luxurious sleep I've ever gotten. I woke up and felt like I've gained super health and energy.</p>
<p>I think It's how brain and conscious are wired. I think your ears don't really turn off while you sleep, but your mind wires what ears should consider important and what not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense for a communication-based species to have members that can be in constant &quot;guard mode&quot; in case of any overnight danger so that they can alert their whole tribe. But because most of the time there is no danger and the light sleepers will wake up because a cat meowed, you don't want everybody to be light sleepers, because fully rested members of the tribe are more efficient for the daily work.  </p>
<p>So basically what happens it that evolutionary speaking, a humanoid sub-species with only light sleepers will lose in combat or any less brutal competition to well rested enemies and, over generations, eventually go extinct. A humanoid sub-species with only deep sleepers will get regularly robbed from their resources overnight or even murdered in their sleep by predators/competitors; eventually going extinct. The subspecies with a mix of both, however, will thrive; and that's our ancestors.  </p>
<p>Like many evolutionary traits, sleeping variety is an artefact of a time it was more useful than in nowadays' society. But since it's not really detrimental to our survival, that characteristic is still around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are very social animals (i.e. social interactions are crucial to our survival), so we have lots of traits that exist only to act as signals in communication. As far as I know, we cry for the same reason we smile or raise our eyebrows - to signal our emotions to others.</p>
<p>I have also heard about there being pheromones in tears that can influence the behavior of other people exposed to them, but I don't know much about that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying is evolutionary beneficial. It shows that something is wrong. Most of the time we can simply make noise to show that something is wrong, but some times, when we are suffocating for example, we have no way to express that we are in danger. Here, crying can be the solution to let others know we need help.  </p>
<p>Now, crying or being extremely happy aren't 'normal' situations, so the body interprets this as 'wrong'. Even though being extremely happy isn't bad, it's still seen as abnormal by the body, and thus a potential danger to our survival. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crying, i've heard actually releases some of the anxiety producing hormones we make when we get upset out of our bodies within the production of tears. Accumulation of these hormones or chemicals caused by feelings of sadness or happiness can disrupt homeostasis, causing the body to find a way to regain balance in its chemistry. </p>
<p>There is also a heavy social reason as many have previously listed and explained. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we're extremely stressed or laughing hard our lung muscles tighten up. We cry because sometimes when under extreme emotion we can't communicate it with sound so our body communicates it from ejecting water from our eyes and making it really obvious, so everyone else knows something is up even if we can't communicate it. A huge part of human survival roots in compassion and empathy. If something is wrong, you <strong>have</strong> to communicate it to others.</p>
<p>Also, as some people have said, crying releases stress hormones through the tear duct so we can calm ourselves down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
