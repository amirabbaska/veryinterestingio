		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Potentially, for decades or even centuries.</p>
<p>The effects of a disappearing sun would hit us in about 8 minutes. After that everything goes dark except for stars and artificial light. It also gets quite cold. By a week, the global average surface temperature would drop under 0° F or -17° C. Since there is no photosynthesis, plants would die, herbivores die, and then carnivores. </p>
<p>We could still survive though. Plants can be grown with artificial light we gain from light-independant energy. The places that wil stay <em>warm</em> longest will be the oceans. Because the surface will freeze, the oceans will be insulated for a very long time, possibly millions of years. So big submarines or underwater complexes, powered by oil or better torrents could keep us alive for quite awhile. Though most humans would probably die first.</p>
<p>Another place would be Iceland. Iceland has a lot of geothermal energy sources which don't depend on the sun. That would also solve the heating problem. </p>
<p>You should just better start building your bunker soon. You won't get much done in the one week of total chaos while society breaks down.</p>
<p>Edit: This is if the Sun suddenly disappears without a trace. For the case that it explodes, dies, or flies away, /u/TheB3stEv3r has the correct user name.</p>
<p>Also, I was just referring to human life. For all life, /u/Redshift2k5 rightly said that some <del>micro</del>organisms deep in the oceans or the Earth's crust would most likely survive for millions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't an easy question because it would depend on what happened to the sun. Here are a few possible cases and explanations: </p>
<p>Case 1: Supernova.
About eight minutes. We would all be burnt to a crisp. And assuming we could survive the heat, the radiation from losing the ozone layer would kill everyone pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Case 2: The sun is somehow 'turned off' like a light.
We wouldnt notice anything for ablut 8 minutes when it would suddenly be dark. The earth would be able to retain enough heat to sustain life for a few days. Maybe some people could survive a few more by going to extreme lengths, but the temperature would soon be unhospitable to life. It might be possible for microorganisms nearest the core and deep near thermal vents in the deep ocean to survive this at least for a while.</p>
<p>Case 3: The sun is suddenly gone.
This is the most unpredictable case. The earth is moving extremely quickly around the sun, held there by gravity. Now if the sun vanished, so does that gravity keeping us from being slingshotted  into space. Assuming we didn't collide with another planet or sufficiently large asteroid which would rather immediately cause mass extinction, the results would be the same as Case 2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some good answers here regarding what happens on Earth as a result of no light or heat, but there's a much larger problem: gravity.</p>
<p>If the Sun suddenly disappears, Earth is no longer in its orbit. Not such a big deal: we cannot leave the Habitable Zone  where liquid water happens if said Zone no longer exists. The cold is still a problem. The real worry for me is what happens to the minor bodies: asteroids and comets. </p>
<p>For the most part, asteroids hang out in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. This is, however, a simplification. There's quite a few asteroids closer to the Sun. There's also a bunch in gravitationally stable points on Jupiter's orbit (they're called Greeks and Trojans) [A wildly simplified picture] (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/InnerSolarSystem-en.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/InnerSolarSystem-en.png</a>). There's also a bunch of comets that have no particularly defined region; they're just kind of all over the place. Asteroids are mostly in the same plane as the rest of the solar system (the ecliptic), but comets can be far above or below that plane at any given moment.</p>
<p>Gravity keeps all of these things in orbit around the Sub. Gravitational effects travel at the Speed of Light. If the Sun magically winks or of existence, none of these things are bound to their orbits anymore, and they'll start zipping off at a tangent to their orbit as soon as those effects reach them. This means Mercury starts wandering off in 3.2 minutes. Venus at 6. Earth at 8.3 and so on.</p>
<p>Here's something else: things close to the Sun move faster, because the gravity pulls them really hard. In the case of comets, they get super-quick and come around the other side with enough force to fling them billions of miles before they run out of steam and are pulled back again. So the things closest to the Sun are moving the fastest. And they're also the ones that will be affected by the Sun's disappearance first. </p>
<p>Space is big, and the Earth is relatively not big, so we're not a huge target. But we are suddenly talking about a bunch of stuff shooting all over the place at very high speeds. Things that were in stable orbits to never hit Earth are no longer in those orbits, and neither is Earth. And they're not easily predicted either, because any time they get close enough to another object, both paths will be altered slightly be gravity. </p>
<p>That's bad enough for the stuff near the Sun. Wait until it hits the Asteroid Belt. </p>
<p>Jupiter is 40 light minutes from the Sun. That means that in less than an hour, our neighborhood of space has become an utter chaos of ballistics. In less than 6 hours, the effects reach the Kuiper Belt, where there's a lot of stuff that's a lot bigger. </p>
<p>Now, none of the stuff in our neighborhood is huge, except the planets. In diameter, Ceres is a bit smaller than Texas, and that's by far the biggest asteroid. Many more are the size of a skyscraper or a few city blocks. But when these things are traveling at, usually, well over 40,000 miles per hour, they carry a big punch. </p>
<p>Destruction of the dinosaurs at Chicxulub? Asteroid the size of San Francisco. Something the size of comet 67P (downtown LA)? There goes North America. Stuff the size of your house? Goodbye most of a city. Ceres or Vesta? Repave the planet with a new crust.</p>
<p>If the Sun disappears, we're looking at a brief but intense bombardment that could destroy huge portions of this planet's surface. Or none of them could hit us, and we have exactly the same scenario as everyone else is saying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. It'd take 8 or so minutes before we knew about it. Up to that point we would still be orbiting the &quot;sun&quot; as usual. Once it ceases to exist, and assuming we wouldn't be on collision course with any of the other planets, then we'd just fly off in a straight line into space.</p>
<p>With no sun to keep us warm, we'd start to get cold. It's probably take about a week before the surface becomes uninhabitable, but a bit more time before anything like the oceans freezing over starts happening.</p>
<p>In theory, if someone had a bunker full of other power sources, a place to grow food and some supplies then they could survive for quite a while, but eventually they're run out of something they need and die. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You complex password isn't just for breaches. A couple of years back a ton of naked pictures of celebreties was stolen off of iCloud, this hack was done because of social engineering (figuring out their login) and weak passwords (using brute force to gain access).</p>
<p>If your password is a word or simple, it will take fewer guesses. If a hacker knows your login and wants to get <em>your</em> password, they will usually start with a dictionary attack (lists of common word and combinations); by requiring your password to be at least 8 characters with numbers, the amount of guesses needed goes way way up - if you have 4 characters and numbers it's 4^37, if you have 8 it's 8^37 (not counting symbols etc), that's hours vs. billions of years of computing. </p>
<p>Now when a breach happens, complex passwords are still your friend <em>if</em> the website did their homework. <em>A lot</em> of people use the same username and password on all their accounts; facebook, linkedin, twitter, pornhub etc. and this is where complexity starts to matter. They now have most of your credentials, they know what email you sign in with and they know the hash of your password for <em>this</em> website. Now most website worth their salt will have a custom way of salting their passwords, however the hacker just gained access to everything, which probably includes the source code for the login, they can now start to figure out your password, which probably gains login to everything. If your password is complex and the salt is correctly made, it will still take billions of years to brute force the hash.</p>
<p>So the reason why they require you to make it complex is for your own good. We <em>know</em> our websites are susceptible to attacks, it's simply impossible to make anything hacker proof, short of disconnecting it from the internet, turn it off and bury it in 10 ft. of concrete in the Mariana Trench. You <em>have</em> to assume that you have a data leak at some point, having good policies for password and other sensitive data will mitigate the fallout.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people hack sites for passwords, they usually get a list of the hashed passwords. That means when you put in your password, the site can check if it's the same password you signed up with but it doesn't know what the password is. It's like a one-way secret message.</p>
<p>The way hackers figure out passwords is they know common hashing techniques and they guess common passwords using those techniques. Since &quot;password123&quot; is a common password, they'll put that in the hash, see what comes out, and match that output to the stolen list of hashed passwords they got. If they can't guess your password to input, then they won't be able to know what it is.</p>
<p>Complex passwords make it harder to guess the hashed passwords once they're stolen. The biggest factors for making a password hard to guess are the total numbers of characters you can use and the length. So forcing you to have three special characters and two capitals and a number doesn't really help, but allowing you to use any character and requiring your password to be long does help. In other words, &quot;a%6L7&quot; looks like a more securepassword than&quot;!XthisismypasswordforthissiteX!&quot;, but the latter is actually more secure since it's longer and can possibly use just as many symbols. Longer passwords are harder to guess because the possible combinations of guesses increase quickly as you add additional characters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most account breaches come from guessing, you just never hear about them because they often go unnoticed. Think of a snoopy family member or &quot;friend&quot; trying to see what you've been up to. If you use an uncomplicated password, they can probably guess it, and they'll probably never tell you they logged into your account without permission.</p>
<p>Also, dictionary attacks on websites that don't have password restrictions can also fly under the radar unless the website publicly discloses that accounts were compromised. Which isn't likely; if they don't give a fuck about your password strength, they probably don't give a fuck about who is using your account.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many security reasons for password restrictions. Passwords are often stored as hashes which, if stolen, can be brute forced if the attacker knows how the hashes are generated. The more complicated the password, the longer it takes to brute force it. A good password with special characters can take a single computer upwards of billions of years to brute force, whereas bad passwords with only lower case letters can be forced in milliseconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I don't actually have figures, but the ingredients probably cost pennies, while the wages of the server, the cost of heating / cleaning / renting space for the outlet, the cost of running the fryer, the air conditioning / ventilation, insurance, etc all cost the same whether they sell you a box of 10 or a box of 20, and surely outweigh the cost of the ingredients.</p>
<p>The profit margin probably isn't anywhere near as different as you might imagine, given the odd prices.</p>
<p>That and all the other reasons people correctly pointed out :-P</p>
<p>I've heard (no source for this) that giving you a cup <em>for</em> soda costs them more than filling it <em>with</em> soda.

<p>The &quot;Anonymous&quot; part of AA doesn't necessarily refer to being anonymous within the meeting, it's about being anonymous outside.</p>
<p>Out and around you don't acknowledge people you see in meetings, unless you're already friends. In fact, there are code words to scope out if you're talking to someone that's in AA. Do you know Bill?</p>
<p><strong>It's about a secret understanding. For many people, they could lose their jobs, they could lose family, etc if people knew about their alcoholism. AA is about being a safe place that no one <em>else</em> will know about.</strong>      </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers below are correct, but I thought I would expand on it. At our meetings, the chair always begins with a few words about anonymity. It's usually the following:
anonymity
serves two different yet equally vital functions:
• At the personal level, anonymity provides protection
for all members from identification as
alcoholics, a safeguard often of special importance
to newcomers.
• At the public level of press, radio, TV, films
and other media technologies such as the
Internet, anonymity stresses the equality in the
Fellowship of all members by putting the brake
on those who might otherwise exploit their A.A.
affiliation to achieve recognition, power, or personal
gain. </p>
<p>It should be clear from all this that my first name is not actually Frank. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The anonymity refers to there being no &quot;face&quot; of AA aside from the founders Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob who are now dead as well as the protection you have from having your attendance at meetings revealed to the outside world. You'll hear people use their first and last names in meetings sometimes to acknowledge that they do not feel the need to hide their identity from their recovering alcoholic peers. The general code of behavior by honor system is that what is said in a meeting stays in that meeting, and AA does not share its members names with any outside organization.  Although these rules are still adhered to, the &quot;anonymous&quot; idea was much more important in the 1930s when alcoholism was heavily stigmatized and considered an issue of poor willpower or bad character. Hope that helps, feel free to ask any questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The rad is a unit of dose. It's just an amount of energy deposited into some material by some radiation per unit mass of the object.</p>
<p>The Sievert is a unit of dose equivalent. It's the same as above, except it's corrected for the fact that different kinds of radiation are more damaging than others, for a given energy.</p>
<p>The Roentgen is a unit of exposure. Since we're talking about ionizing radiation, it produces free charge when it interacts with matter. The amount of charge released per unit mass of the object is the exposure.</p>
<p>In nuclear physics, you'll see Bequerels (Curies are sort of dated) whenever there's radioactive decay. Safety regulations are usually quoted in terms of Sievert or REM (Roentgen equivalent man, another unit of dose equivalent).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of all the different aspects of radiation. For one there's the rate of radiation &quot;events&quot;. There's also the amount of energy released via radiation per unit time, which is related to the rate of radiation events but varies depending on the type of radiation and the specifics. But that's a sterile view of radiation, often what we want to know is how it impacts human beings and the potential health effects. So you want to know how much energy or impact that radiation has on a human body. You might consider something simplistic like the amount of energy deposited in a material, but that ignores that not all radiation has the same health effects, some is more damaging than others. So you could created another figure that tells you how serious a given radiation exposure is to a human body, adjusted based on the effective damage caused by different kinds of radiation. Meanwhile, you have to ask how you measure these values? So you have measurements that might be easy to do but might require a lot of work to translate into other figures.</p>
<p>And that's how we have so many different units of radiation.</p>
<p>Becquerels are units of <em>activity</em>, they tell you the rate of total disintegrations per second. Curies measure the same thing but in different units.</p>
<p>In terms of &quot;absorbed dose&quot; there's the rad, which is equal to 100 ergs/gram (an erg is a unit of energy), 100 rads = 1 Joule/kg which is also one &quot;Gray&quot;. Same thing, different sizes of units.</p>
<p>The roentgen is a measurement related to ionizing radiation, the amount of ionization of the air caused by radioactivity. It's one of those things that exists because it was easy to measure, and bore a close enough relation to other figures to be worthwhile. 1 roentgen is roughly equivalent to about 0.9 rad, depending on certain factors.</p>
<p>Then you have doses that take into account the different types of radiation, which is where the rem and sievert come in. For, say, beta radiation, 1 rem = 1 rad. And a sievert is simply 100 rem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

All My gf had to say about the reaction was that our dog was very playful with his brother and didn't get jealous when My gf went to pet the other dog. Usually when he sees other dogs he gets a little aggressive and assertive and he is also very jealous so I don't know perhaps, but then again it could also be that he just happened to like this dog which is about 1/25 dogs he walks by.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Fat cells derive embryologically from mesoderm (there are three basic embryologic tissues). Also, you may be interested to know that there are two types of fat (let's call it adipose)-- white adipose and brown adipose. White adipose is typically what you think of when you consider fat. It's the stuff that's under your skin, in your belly, thighs, around your heart, kidneys, and etc. Brown adipose on the other hand tends to be around only when you are an infant, and it actually actively burns carbs and fat to create heat. It's brown because they contain iron rich mitochondria, which are the cellular machinery for burning through chemical energy. People have tried to harness / reactivate this stuff over time, and it's a pretty interesting research field in itself.</p>
<p>If you're interested in some peer reviewed lit on the subject, see: doi:10.1038/nm.3361 &quot;Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential&quot;</p>
<p>As to your question about tissues not being strictly &quot;monogamous,&quot; there are tons of examples!-- blood, blood vessels, nerves, muscles all comprise important parts of various organs. Generally, various tissues compose an organ, and organs work together in organ systems to carry out a specific function. For example, renal tubules are a tissue but they work along side smooth muscle, blood vessels, neurons, and endocrine tissue in the kidneys (an organ), which are an important part of the renal or excretory system. The human body is a wonderful thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Just remember the heirarchy. multiple cells make up a tissue, multiple tissues make up an organ, multiple organs make up a system.  It also depends on what you mean when you say fat.  We have fat cells that make up our energy stores but we also have lipids that are made of fatty acids attached to a polar group, e.g. our cells have a outer membranes made up of a double layer of phospholipids.

It may be metabolically active, absorbing glucose and fatty acids from the blood stream and making TG as a calorie-dense storage. This activity is under endocrine control through membrane-bound receptors mostly. These cells do not divide but get larger and smaller as they store and release TG. In some cases fatty organs surround other organs for mechanical protection and are free of receptors and don't do much but sit there absorbing life's blow.

They say it so often that most people believe it, as witnessed by the quotes above. But when you read books written by economists (who in general know more about economics than newspaper reporters), they tell you that consumers are not the engine of economic growth. They are actually the caboose.</p>
<p>What is the engine of growth, then? It is the savers and investors. Only by sacrificing current consumption, can people put money into banks or share offerings, which end up in the hands of new and existing businesses who can then use that money to create new technology, factories, or human capital, allowing them to increase their productivity. Capital creates productivity, and productivity is the driver of our standard of living.&quot;</p>
<p>He has a lot more detail in the article, but that's the jist of it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of confusion in this thread - and not just here, you see it in a lot of &quot;economic&quot; journalism - between the drivers of short-term economic fluctuations (booms, busts, recessions) and the drivers of long-term growth. </p>
<p>The economy has a certain level of potential output: that is what would be produced if all workers were fully employed (except those who are temporarily out of a job because they're looking for work), all  factories produced at full capacity, all service businesses provided as much service as they can etc. This grows (we think) more or less steadily over time as workers enter the workforce, factories are constructed etc. </p>
<p>Sometimes the economy is below potential (as signified, for example, by a high rate of unemployment). Sometimes, more rarely, it's above (this can cause inflation). </p>
<p>If people suddenly stop spending as much, and save more, this will reduce GDP, because whatever they would have spent it on won't get made or sold. If spending falls enough, we might have a recession. But it shouldn't affect potential output. Eventually the economy should adjust (e.g. from a fall in prices) and we'll get back to potential, even at the higher level of savings.</p>
<p>And more savings should, eventually, lead to higher growth, because there will be more resources available for investment - new factories, new software, etc - which will support a higher level of potential output. </p>
<p>So the answer to your question is, yes, in the short term, there would be a recession, but if the overall level of savings increases this should support faster growth in the long term. </p>
<p>Of course this is a very simple model (it's the starting point for most economists, not the end point). In an open economy, you'd have to think about the impact on the exchange rate, capital flows, global demand. And a prolonged recession can hurt potential output as people lose skills, and the capital stock deteriorates. But distinguishing short-term fluctuations from long-term potential is a good way to start thinking about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You put savings for emergencies and retirements under the same category but they have massively different impact on the economy. When you save money for emergencies you put the money away in a safe savings account where they can be quickly retrieved when needed. This means that the wealth you have created will not be contributing to the economy very much as the bank need to keep the money on hand and not take any risks with them. But it is only recommended that you save about 2-6 months worth of expenses for emergencies which in the grand scheme of things is not that much.</p>
<p>Retirement on the other hand is quite different kind of savings. When you put money in a retirement fund you tell the bank to try to make them grow as much as possible as you do not need any of it until decades later. So the bank will make money the best way they can by investing the money. And since you do not need the money for a long time they can do pretty risky investments at that. This will give the economy a boost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If everyone were burying money in little caches out in the woods, yeah. If they were investing it or at least putting it in the bank, not necessarily because then the money would still end up moving around the economy when your bank loaned it out to someone or the sellers of the stocks your mutual fund bought turned around and bought cocaine wirh the money, or whatever the case my be. It would definitely have an effect on the economy because the money would end up being used differently if it ended up in the hands of banks vs retail companies, but I have no idea whether it would be good or bad on balance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_animal" target="_blank">social animals.</a></p>
<p>Tens of thousands of years ago our ancestors found there was a distinct survival advantage in working together in familial groups. As such, we gradually augmented our existing survival attributes with social behaviours that would cause us to stay together when under stress.</p>
<p>Facial expressions, grooming each others fur, crying, touching, vocalisations etc. All of these things help communicate individual feelings and establish social structures. When you are being hugged or touched, your brain is rewarding you for taking part in actions that will improve your overall survival chances by releasing Oxytocin to calm your nervous system.</p>
<p>Remember, you are a product of a very, VERY long and unbroken chain of surviving organisms, stretching back millions of years. The actions that kept you alive were rewarded with <em>pleasure</em> hormones (eating, drinking, bonding, fucking, hugging etc). The actions that reduced your chances are either not rewarded at all, or marked by an unpleasant sensation we call <em>pain</em>.</p>
<p>This is why most people get lonely when away from other people. You're reducing your survival chances and so your body is trying to compel you to return to your kind. And hugging feels so good because you're being rewarded for bonding with said kind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution. Hugs cause our brain to release a chemical called oxytocin, otherwise known as the &quot;cuddle chemical&quot; because of the way it makes us feel. There's no way for us to be <em>sure</em> of the reasons for this reaction (it'd be like asking: &quot;Why do we have ten toes?&quot;), but we have some pretty good guesses. The pleasure we get encouraged us (as early humans) to be social, which as SovietWomble says, likely boosted our chances for survival enough that the trait won out.</p>
<p>About a week ago scientists reported that dogs have the same chemical release when we pet them: our touch makes them feel good. Apparently, when they stare happily at us, they're trying to provoke that feeling within us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I guess I'm not sure exactly how to answer your question, but I can definitely confirm that it works.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolute speed would have to depend on absolute space and absolute time (since speed is a relationship of distance over time).</p>
<p>So, to have an absolute speed of zero, you would need to be stationary with respect to some absolute frame of reference, against all which is moving, moves. </p>
<p>Newton precedes you in the belief in such a system, however already in his own time, this belief was not universal, and has since been disproven. </p>
<p>General relativity tells us that there is no absolute frame of reference (actually, it tells us that all frames are relative, which is close but not the same as there is no absolute frame).</p>
<p>In fact, relativity tells us that in all of this there is actually only one thing which <em>is</em> absolute. The speed of light. </p>
<p>The closest we can come to 'zero speed' is by measuring our velocity against background radiation, in other words, relative to the average velocity of matter immediately after the big bang happened.</p>
<p>But the structure of physics precludes the existence of any 'absolute' or 'true' measure of space or time. Everything depends on the frame of reference from which you measure it. Everything, that is, except the speed of light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
