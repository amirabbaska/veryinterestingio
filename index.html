		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things going on here, both related to universal expansion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The universe may be infinite, but as it is expanding, the distance between us and anything further than 14bn ly away is getting bigger at greater than c, <del>so light from them can never reach us.</del> The <em>observable</em> universe - the stuff that we can see - is about 46bn ly in radius, so any galaxies beyond that are invisible.</p>
</li>
<li>Due to expansion, electromagnetic radiation is red-shifted as it travels (basically its wavelength increases by a factor of about 2 x 10^(-18) every second). So stuff that was emitted as visible light a long time ago will gradually become IR, then microwaves, then radio waves and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>That doesn't mean it isn't there, though. It just means we need radio telescopes rather than visible light telescopes to see it.</p>
<p>In practice, there <em>is</em> &quot;light&quot; all around us, which is shown by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png" target="_blank">this notable image</a>. That is a picture of the cosmic microwave background (based on years of data collection); basically it is a picture of the sky in all directions, showing the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation in the background (so stuff leftover from the very early days of the universe). This radiation has a frequency in the high GHz (so microwave radiation) and is good evidence for the universe being pretty much the same in all directions - on that picture the effective temperature of the radiation is about 2.7K, but the range of temperatures (brightest to darkest) is about Â± 0.2mK.</p>
<p>So in theory the night sky is bright - in that there's radiation in all directions. It's just very <del>high</del><em>low</em>-frequency (<em>large-wavelength</em>), and very cold, so we can't see it. </p>
<p>[<em>Edit: I'm getting a few common follow-up questions, so here are some rough answers:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8oopij/if_light_doesnt_dissipate_with_travel_distance/e05hckt/" target="_blank">But nothing can go faster than the speed of light, how can distant objects be moving away faster than c</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8oopij/if_light_doesnt_dissipate_with_travel_distance/e05qk8s/" target="_blank">What about the inverse square law; light spreads out - wouldn't that explain it</a>?</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8oopij/if_light_doesnt_dissipate_with_travel_distance/e05g7wh/" target="_blank">How is universal expansion changing; is the observable universe and what is in it getting bigger or smaller</a>?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is known as Olbers' paradox and if the universe was static, this would definitely be the case. The night sky not being bright is one of the contradictions between reality and models that assume that the universe is static and infinite and as such indirect evidence for cosmological models that make no such assumptions.</p>
<p>An easy explanation is that since the universe is finitely old and the speed of light is finite, our observable universe is not infinite and thus the night sky does not have to be bright.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How comes? Well the Universe is not static, it's expanding. All objects are moving away from us, and the further away they are the faster they run away.  The Doppler effects tell us then that light coming from distant objects will be &quot;redshifted&quot; : its wavelength will be longer. At some point, objects are so far (and so fast) that the wavelength becomes too large for our eyes to detect it. Light becomes infrared. And if we keep going, this distant light shifts all the way down to microwaves before reaching us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light does not dissipate, but it does decrease in intensity for several different reasons. First of course being the inverse square law, if you double the distance, the intensity is divided by 4. Secondly, and most importantly for large distances, the universe is expanding, which causes a doppler shift for light that travels a great distance. Because that light emanates from a source where the intensity of emission decreases with frequency (bluer colors of light are harder to make), which means there is a lot of red, then less green, a lot less blue, etc. After that doppler shift, the red becomes infra-red, the green -&gt; red, the blue -&gt; green. And if it is from the beginning of the universe almost all the light we would have seen in that era has shifted into the microwave portion of the spectrum, it is invisible and very, very dim.</p>
<p>Basically, there is a horizon to the universe, we can't see past a certain time, which is a certain distance away from us, and so even in an infinite universe, we cannot see past that horizon. On top of that, the universe is expanding, which unintuitively means that horizon is getting closer to us. Eventually that first light will no longer be visible, and then the furthest galaxies will disappear, and then the intermediate, and the close. Until the universe is so large that only our own galaxy will remain visible to us (though by that time the universe will have evolved past stars if memory serves, so it will look very different to begin with).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your best bet is to sit on the porcelain bus with a bucket on your lap. I got sick so many times that my body had completely emptied itself.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once had some bad chicken for dinner in India. We boarded an overnight train and in the middle of the night I woke up knowing something was wrong. Got down from my bunk and ran for the bathroom. But I wasn't going to make it, so I put my hand over my mouth. My stomach didn't care, and vomit rocketed out of my mouth between my fingers. I spewed on the carriage door, got into the bathroom and heaved some more.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was a tiny bathroom, so when it happened I could put my head in the sink and my ass on the toilet and let my body take care of the rest.</p>
<p>Ended up having to change my pants (yup), then had to walk the whole length of the train before I found a conductor, where I had to awkwardly explain that I had vomited up an absurd amount of chicken chow mein in a public area. Came back to find out some dude on the train drinking my bottled water. When I questioned him, he said &quot;Oh, I thought it was the conductor's.&quot; Dude, what? It's still not your water!</p>
<p>I spent the next two days sick as a dog. We got to Agra and our hotel room. My girlfriend (now wife, even after all this) is telling me I've got to pull it together because we're going to see the Taj Mahal, and this is our only chance because we're continuing on the next day. I patiently listened to her argument before kindly asking her to move so I could vomit into the toilet. She got to see the Taj Mahal, I stayed in bed. Win/win.</p>
<p>2/10 would not do again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

When a dryer duct hasn't been cleaned in awhile, it can become clogged, causing a back-pressure effect. When that happens, the lint is forced out of the duct it is supposed to be exiting, and gets sucked into the dryer's intake, which can cause the lint to coat the heating elements.

Cotton and Lycra will be somewhere in the middle. But mix them all together, and you've got something that will ignite quickly, gain temperature, and then burn hot for a while once the less flammable fibers start to burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running a puppy mill, by itself, isn't illegal in any state.  </p>
<p>Most counties have regulations that require dogs to be licensed or which restrict the amount of dogs that can be in any given area.  But the penalty for violating those regulations is usually limited to a small fine.  </p>
<p>Additionally, proving that those regulations are being violated is difficult.  Under normal circumstances it requires that the neighbors call animal control out to the house <em>and</em> that the dogs are visible from the street.  Its really only when one of the dogs actually bites someone else that animal control is able to take action because at that point they can seize the dogs.</p>
<p>In order to criminalize puppy mills, states would have to criminalize allowing dogs to breed, which isn't something that is practical or enforceable.  The closest you can realistically do is what California did - which is to outlaw pet stores from selling &quot;commercially raised animals,&quot; but even that doesn't do much since most pet stores have already stopped doing so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you are walking on a suspension bridge and it sways, you can feel that, its still vibration, just not audible. If the bridge vibrated hard enough and fast enough, you would hear it as it would push and pull the air fast enough to make it audible.</p>
<p>In terms of headphones, the effect of infrasound and sounds above 20khz are negligable. That's because the drivers (speakers) in your headphones are more than likely too small a diameter to accurately produce those frequencies to a sound pressure level (db) that you would be able to &quot;feel&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Just like you might want a car that can go 150 miles per hour just because it will go from 60 - 80 for passing much better than a car that can barely get up to the speed limit. An audio amplifier or speaker that is capable of playing much louder than you need and at frequencies much higher than you need will sound better at the levels and frequencies you actually listen to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>No, you cannot perceive frequencies higher than 20 kHz, either by hearing or by vibrotactile perception (feeling it). Depending on your age, you might not be able to hear above 15-16 kHz. </p>
<p>There are several reasons we can't hear above these frequencies. The primary one is because the physical organ of hearing doesn't resonate at these frequencies. The organ of hearing lies along a membrane which is narrow and stiff at one end, where it resonates more with high frequencies, and floppy and wide at the other end, where it resonates more with low frequencies. It's much like piano strings. It's a pretty basic physical system in that sense. Above around 20 kHz, you're not going to get a lot of sympathetic vibration along the membrane. Secondly, cells (and attached nerves) are arranged along this membrane which are activated basic on frequency, with cells and nerves at the short, stiff end coded for high frequencies, and cells at the other end coded for low frequencies. This &quot;tonotopic&quot; organization is preserved all the way to the auditory cortex. As we age, we lose cells and nerves coded for high frequencies first, which is why by out teen years we start to be unable to hear up to 20 kHz. </p>
<p>There is really no vibrotacile perception of high frequencies. It may be possible, but the level would have to be extreme, way above any potential output of an earphone.</p>
<p>The other thing to consider is that most sound files aren't going to have information in frequencies above around 20 kHz. The sampling rate of CDs is 44.1 kHz, making the Nyquist frequency (above which no information is coded), 22.05 kHz. This gets into signal processing stuff, but essentially the way the digital information is preserved is such that you aren't sampling fast enough to accurately encode frequencies above about 22 kHz. The sampling rate of CDs for example was chosen at 44.1 kHz because humans cannot hear above 20 kHz, so it didn't need to be any higher. There will also be a low-pass filter used which will further restrict frequency information above the Nyquist frequency in order to avoid something called aliasing. </p>
<p>The short of that is: even if we could hear above 20 kHz, and even if headphones can reliably produce these frequencies, even if drivers can pump fast enough to create these, there aren't frequencies that high present in most common audio formats.</p>
<p>Very low frequencies you can feel, sure - but most music doesn't contain frequencies below 20 Hz (most won't go below probably 50 Hz), so again, unlikely to matter if the headphones can go super low.</p>
<p>As with many audiophile things, the extended frequency range of most fancy headphones is just kind of a dick swinging contest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The response range of headphones is the point where response decreases by some amount, usually -3dB. That's a 50% reduction in sound pressure (but less than a 50% reduction in perceived loudness). </p>
<p>Now, &quot;theoretically&quot;, you wouldn't want performance to decrease at <em>all</em> throughout the entire audible range. If you produced speakers where that was the case, the point where response <em>did</em> decrease would be outside of the audible range. </p>
<p>In reality, headphones/speakers never perform perfectly flat within that range, nor are those extreme frequencies any more important than other aspects of their behavior. But they have practical designs which don't stop working at <em>exactly</em> 20hz or 20khz, sometimes a design that performs well in that range will also reach quite a bit higher. </p>
<p>So, showing off those ratings is partly a pissing contest, as others noted.</p>
<p>But one thing I will note is it suggests they <strong>actually measured</strong> the frequency response. If I see 20hz-20khz on a $20 pair of earbuds, I know they guessed (or lied) about that and who knows what else they guessed/lied about. Let's say they did have good frequency response, what are the chances of 20hz-20khz being the range instead of 21hz-19khz, or 18hz-21khz, both of which would be equally good? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very large pipe organs (think cathedral type installations) sometimes have a whole set of pedals which operate pipes with tones below 20hz.  There is interaction between these inaudible frequencies and those higher up that cause a change in the quality of the sound. The music sounds more full and carries out into large spaces better.</p>
<p>This works for a live performance or an analog recording. Digital recordings and playback are limited by their samples. In standard digital recording and playback, the sub-sonic sounds are not recorded and wont be properly played back. </p>
<p>For what its worth, most peoples hearing falls in the 30hz- 15khz range and not 20-20k. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've been reading about Dr. Herculano-Houzel's <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2014.00077/full" target="_blank">brain soup</a> method after following some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/magazine/to-unlock-the-brains-mysteries-puree-it.html" target="_blank">popular science articles</a>. It appears that in various brain structures, the mass-to-neuron ratio for primates deviates from other groups of mammals and presumably that is at least one factor which causes increased cognition (though I could be wrong, so please let me know if so!). Why should that be the case?</p>
<p>As a side question, have any studies been done on other mammals such as whales and dolphins? A quick google search didn't yield anything in that realm.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009/full</a></p>
<p>Basically, primates have more neuron-dense brains than other animals.  A cow and a chimp have similar sized brains, but the chimp has a heck of a lot more neurons.   Since neurons are the cells that do the actual computation in the brain, it makes sense that they'd be directly related to intelligence...so denser neurons may explain why primates are so smart.</p>
<p>This difference in neuron density is especially notable as brains get bigger, and while (as of the writing of the paper above) information wasn't available on whale and elephant brains, it's entirely possible that human brains actually have <em>more</em> neurons than they do, despite their much larger brains.  </p>
<p>Historically people have postulated all sorts of  reasons why some animals  (particularly humans) are more intelligent...looking at brain size, brain-to-body size, brain structure, size of particular brain structures, etc.  But these have all been imperfect measures.  It'd be interesting if it winds up that we can just put intelligence mostly down to &quot;number of neurons&quot; ...a factor that was previously obscured by the fact that the relationship between &quot;number of neurons&quot; and &quot;brain mass&quot; can differ quite a bit between groups.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One basic thing to consider is that when it comes to two critical features of what brains do - motor control and sensory processing (perception) - the brain (or number of neurons in it) must scale with the size of the body, or it's going to get worse at control/perception. Other things being equal, if you double the amount of musculature, you need to double the amount of neural hardware controlling that musculature (each muscle fiber is innervated by - on average - a single motor neuron axon); if you double the size of the retina (sensitive bit in the back of the eye), you need twice the number of neurons in the brain to process the doubled input (each optic nerve axon has a particular set of neurons it synapses on in the thalamus). Etc Etc.</p>
<p>Given that point, you would expect that if there's a simple linear(ish) relation between body size and brain size, then motor/perception performance are being kept constant. Assume everyone does that; then if you can add some more neurons, you can do.. more.. call it cognition, I guess. You'll also have a higher brain/body ratio, so you get that cognition/ratio correlation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>connectivity of the brain is critical. the frontal lobe receives and sends projections to/from the vast majority of the brain as well as subcortical structures. our (as humans and secondarily as primates) relatively massive PFC seems to enable a lot of our higher order cognition, partially because it is apparently quite plastic but also because of the diverse info it can receive, process and use for mental and motor output. obviously with higher numbers of neurons you have the potential for greater synapse numbers but its the structural complexity and streamlining of the connections you do have that probably matter more. in fact, in the PFC we see a decrease in gray matter with age into the 20s and 30s which is thought to represent synaptic pruning, or removal of redundant connections and fortification of efficient ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The recent news worthy eruptions (e.g. Hawaii and the recent one in Guatemala) are not connected. So the short answer it's just the coverage and/or the fact that these two eruptions are happening in populated places and that both are being filmed a lot by locals (mostly safely in the case of Hawaii and <strong>really</strong> unsafely in the case of the Guatemalan eruption, you should never be as close to a pyroclastic flow as some of the people shooting video are). As for the rates, couldn't find any particularly good plots, but you can check out <a href="http://volcano.si.edu/reports_weekly.cfm" target="_blank">the smithsonian</a> weekly eruption report to 1) get a sense that there are lots of eruptions going on that aren't making the news and 2) if you go back into the archives, which span ~18 years, you can get a somewhat qualitative sense that this number of currently erupting volcanoes isn't particularly odd. As a side note, this is not quite real time, so this is the summary for last week so it doesn't yet include the eruption in Guatemala.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is worth noting that the current eruptions at KÄ«lauea in Hawaii and Fuego in Guatemala are nothing new.  KÄ«lauea has been in a constant state of eruption since Jan. 1983.  More than 35 years. A few weeks ago a dike intruded further east into the Lower East Rift Zone, causing the fissure eruptions that have been so much in the news.  Itâs been a long time since KÄ«lauea burnt down any houses, but as soon as it does it suddenly gets media attention and a lot of people think itâs a new eruption when in fact itâs just another phase of the activity that started in 1983 - just at a new vent location. </p>
<p>Volcan Fuego too has been in a frequent state of eruption for years now, with frequent Strombolian activity and often sending lava flows down the various arroyos descending around the summit.  Only when it enters a more explosive phase, producing pyroclastic density currents that kill people, does it make the news.  Thus further adding to the general impression that there has been an increase in volcanic activity world-wide, when in fact this is not true. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I canât be specific; Iâm no expert; but I am treated for morning nausea and morning sneezing/allergies - they get very severe when I wake up.. for almost 10 years. Anyway, one doc explained that thereâs a cascade of chemical and hormones in the âwake upâ process and sometimes your body can, as a byproduct, release a lot of histamine in the morning </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hayfever, it allergies, can affect you while you sleep. Mine got to the point where I had one side of my sinuses that would completely clog at night. The pressure build up would get to the point that I would wake with the pain and have to roll over to relieve the pressure. I'd also frequently be woken with a period of.sneezing that could last up to 12 sneezes or so. If your Hayfever doesn't bother you at night maybe it just isn't severe enough. For clarity, I'm allergic to more than just pollen. I know this isn't an explanation so it will probably get deleted,  but just letting you know the thought behind your original question is not completely correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

People already mentioned your body itself shuts down the reaction to sleep, but also plants aren't putting as much energy into producing pollen at night, winds are generally calmer so it stays on the plant more, being inside rather than outside will filter some out, morning dew brings more down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
