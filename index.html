		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US military has done a lot of studies on human limits, attention spans, and sleep requirements in order to prevent tactical mistakes on long missions, especially for pilots who may run missions 20 hours in length. </p>
<p>What they discovered is that there is an optimum amount of sleep where too little is suboptimal, and too much is also suboptimal and this is in regardless of the sleep debt. When a person sleeps longer than about 9 - 10 hours they can become very groggy and feel ill when waking up. They call this sleep drunkeness or confusional arousal because the physical symptoms are similar to being hungover. It is still being studied so the exact mechanism is unknown. It is believed that excessive sleep causes the body to enter a lower energy consumption state and it slows breathing, respiration, and causes vasodilation. This could be very handy if you were injured as the excess sleep would keep you from moving and re-injuring yourself, while also allowing your body to rapidly repair the damage. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your internal rhythms are set by your circadian pacemaker, a group of cells clustered in the hypothalamus, a primitive little part of the brain that also controls hunger, thirst, and sweat. Primarily triggered by light signals from your eye, the pacemaker figures out when it’s morning and sends out chemical messages keeping the rest of the cells in your body on the same clock.</p>
<p>Scientists believe that the pacemaker evolved to tell the cells in our bodies how to regulate their energy on a daily basis. When you sleep too much, you’re throwing off that biological clock, and it starts telling the cells a different story than what they’re actually experiencing, inducing a sense of fatigue. You might be crawling out of bed at 11am, but your cells started using their energy cycle at seven.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main reasons.</p>
<p>One, the stages of your sleep happen in cycles. When you oversleep and go past that &quot;happy point&quot;, it may mean that you're entering another version of deep sleep. If you wake up during this, you're more groggy because you've interrupted a primary &quot;rehabilitation&quot; phase.</p>
<p>Two, the longer you sleep, the less time you're awake, which means less water and food/calories. The calories usually aren't a big deal since you burn little while sleeping, but the dehydration can really sting.</p>
<p>Way more to it than that, but that's a basic gist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Essentially the only sleep that &quot;counts&quot; is REM sleep (dreams) and if you're out of rhythm so are your dreams. </p>
<p>Another thing is that you've now slept too long and your body needs sustenance because although you've been asleep your body has still been performing other processes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens because of the way that cell phone signals are sent.</p>
<p>The radio channels used to communicate between the handsets and the cell tower are shared among a bunch of different handsets, so they need some way to make it so that all of them can cooperate to not get all the signals mixed up.  In some cell phone protocols, the channels are split up in time, so each handset gets a small chunk of time to transmit and then has to be silent until its turn comes around again.</p>
<p>In GSM, these time slices are 4.615 milliseconds long and come in groups of 8, which they transmit a little over 27 times per second.  When they transmit, they generate a little bit of current in any unshielded wires that are nearby, like speaker wire.  While the handset is transmitting, then, it's generating a current in the speaker wire a little over 27 times per second, which ends up making the speaker produce a 27Hz buzz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your cell phone is just &quot;listening&quot; to the cell network signals when it's in idle mode.</p>
<p>When someone will send you a text or calls you, the cellular network &quot;pages&quot; your phone, and your phone has to answer &quot;yup, I'm here, wassup?&quot; before the actual text is sent or call is established.</p>
<p>At this point, the phone transmits a radio signal back to the tower.</p>
<p>The first transmission is made with a relatively high power, because the system must be sure the phone signal can get to the tower. Once this first signal is received by the tower, the network measures how strong it is, and may tell the phone &quot;whoa! too loud, tone it down&quot;.</p>
<p>So it's generally at the first stage of the connection that you hear the interference; it's a higher power radio signal being tranmitted by your phone, which creates noise (not directly by the rf signal, but the switching on/off of the radio power which may happen several times a second, depending on the technology used - 2G/3G).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The noise is coming from your cell phone, rather than from the cell tower. Your phone maintains a link to the cell tower constantly but in a low power mode. When you receive a phone call or text, your mobile is polled by the tower which wakes it up to a higher power mode in order to receive and acknowledge the incoming data. It is this burst of transmission from your phone which is being picked up by speakers and other audio near the phone. </p>
<p>While the phone operates at a much higher frequency than the audio amplifier of your speakers, there are harmonics that extend far below and far above the carrier frequency, and the internal cabling in your speaker acts like an antenna and the lower frequency harmonics can become amplified, causing the chirping you hear. </p>
<p>There is enough radiative power around your cell phone to light up an LED much like Nikola Tesla's wireless power with a light bulb. If you take a diode and twist it's legs together with an LED you can hold it close to phones, microwave ovens, and wifi and the LED will light up as it acts like an antenna. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>every phone is basically a radio transmitter, and it transmits pulses of digital sound and data files to the base station (the tower) so that communication can occur. The wiring inside most speakers are not protected or shielded from this sort of frequency, and there is typically a non-linear circuit element (transistor) within a speaker that detects these high-pulse radio signals. The element in the speaker then rectifies (translates) those radio signals into audio signals, which are in turn heard in such an unpleasant way through the speaker, in addition to a lower level of the audio that had previously been playing through the speakers. For non-active speakers, this does not always occur, although there are certain types of phones that will activated unpowered speaker circuits </p>

More than likely it'd have been some kind of failure on one of the crafts but knowing it had crashed into something would be pretty difficult to figure out. Perhaps if part of a spaceship was hit and the trajectory changed or it went into some kind of tumble then we might be able to deduce that it was hit.</p>
<p>In the long term though, space is pretty empty of large things that it could crash into. Or rather, space is so large that the chances of hitting those few things are incredibly slim, which has been discussed in previous questions before. So could it crash into something in the distant future way out there? Sure, it could. However, shutdown of the instruments will be on the timescale of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#Future_of_the_probe" target="_blank">decade</a>, so we wouldn't be able to tell after that anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

While we have contact with the Voyager probes, you can ask the same about the Pioneer probes - launched 5 years earlier, a bit closer, and inactive now. We don't know if they are still on course, but the probability is something like &gt;99.999%.</p>
<p>All 5 probes that leave the solar system (2*Pioneer, 2*Voyager, New Horizons) will need hundreds of thousands of years to get close to other stars. Where &quot;close&quot; is something like a light year distance, or a few hundred times the current distance to the Voyager probes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You might picture some incredibly dense cluster of rocks floating through space like in star wars, but this couldn't be further from the truth (that description is more fitting to a planetary ring system like Saturn's). If you were to enter an asteroid belt, you would most likely never know it, and would probably never see an asteroid the whole time. Similarly, asteroids within the belt are unlikely to collide except on a very large time scale (every few millions of years). If that's what an asteroid belt is like, just picture what interstellar space is like.

<p>A lens can't focus light into a point hotter/brighter than the object generating the light.</p>
<p>There are a variety of interesting ways to prove that, but the one that makes the most intuitive sense IMO is that lenses aren't one-way magic, they work in <em>both</em> directions.  If you could focus the Sun (for example) in to a point hotter/brighter than the surface of the Sun, you would effectively be using your lens to heat up the Sun at that point instead of the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's worth noting that there is a limit to this process.  Conservation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue" target="_blank">étendue</a> means that when an optical system concentrates light into a smaller area it must also spread out over a larger angle.  As a result, no optical system, no matter how large and complex, can use the sun to heat something to a temperature hotter than the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Even with an infinite size laser beam (source) and infinitely strong lens (see other comments), and even with a infinitely weak source such that the electron-position-processes are not a problem (see other comments), then still you can not focus light into a focus smaller than the wavelength of the light.</p>
<p>This is a very real limiting factor for computer chip producers. Computer chips are 'written' with light. To make the 20 nm chip structures in your processor (or however small they are now), you need light with a wavelength shorter than 20 nm, i.e., extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Producing and processing (focusing and such) this EUV is very difficult, and is an important limiting factor for reducing computer chips.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Its the nature of their 'prey'. As soon as humans started preying on animals far larger than a meal there would have been a subsequent need to collate the food, process it, then eat it as a community. You cant snack on a mammoth and even a decent sized deer is gonna keep a lot of people fed for a while, but only after its brought back to the community, butchered and (at some stage in time) a cooking process was installed. Given the opportunistic nature of hunter gathering I think a large amount of snacking went on, but as humans became more sophisticated hunters of animals larger than their immediate appetites then central meals become more important. If we'd evolved from Zebras we'd just sit at work in the office all day munching on grass snacks and there would be no need for a lunch break.</p>

<p>Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced. Reingestion is most common within the burrow between 8 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock in the evening, being carried out intermittently within that period.</p>

Therefore it seems likely that a (or the) major cause of differentent amounts of doms are caused by how much someone emphasizes eccentric portions of lifts. This may also explain why leg day always causes the most soreness, as many of your major lower body muscles are placed under very high stress during the eccentric portion of the squat. </p>
<p>Other factors such as nutrition and hormonal levels, which influence how muscles are rebuilt, are probably other major factors as well, though afaik the specific mechanisms of doms and recovery are still unknown . </p>
<p>I also don't know why the delay varies from person to person, but it appears that continuing to do light exercise helps lessen soreness due to doms, so you may just be more sedentary when not st the gym </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is a weird thing.</p>
<p>But it only seems weird because we don't readily grasp everything that's going on at once. </p>
<p>DOMS is an interesting thing, because very rarely does our body <em>delay</em> feeling something. Adrenaline will delay certain senses for a short period of time (ie shock). A pregnant woman will delay releasing certain hormone doses (pictosin) until it's time to really push. Most everything else is processed as soon as it can.</p>
<p>First, we know that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alfred_Goldberg/publication/22014852_Effects_of_insulin_glucose_and_amino_acids_on_protein_turnover_in_rat_diaphragm/links/55b279ca08aed621ddfe0d38.pdf" target="_blank">insulin has a profound effect on muscle growth, preventing both degradation of already synthesized proteins and fueling further synthesis. Contrast this to just glucose, which will fuel synthesis but not help prevent degradation of current proteins</a>. Second, exercising <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henrik_Galbo/publication/20028956_Effect_of_physical_exercise_on_sensitivity_and_responsiveness_to_insulin_in_humans/links/560954fd08ae4d86bb11c60d.pdf" target="_blank">both makes insulin more effective, and can reduce insulin production by the pancreas for 48 hours</a>.</p>
<p>How does this fit with DOMS? Muscle Soreness is really just light pain - mild discomfort caused by disturbances in your nerves electro-chemical balance. We can readily expect that any type of tissue repair would produce such an effect, so the question then becomes 'why do certain exercises have different effect on people as to when their bodies enter a certain phase of tissue repair?'</p>
<p>I believe the answer lies in their insulin sensitivity. The more insulin sensitive the person, the quicker they hit DOMS because the effect of the new exercise both doesn't suppress their insulin production <em>as much</em> during the 48 hour period, nor do they become glucose starved in their bloodstream as a result of the insulin spike that happens immediately post exercise.</p>
<p>If you want to hit DOMS quicker, eat something that you know triggers an insulin response (and have carbs with it). If you want to push back DOMS, don't eat the things which trigger your insulin response. The difference in the length of delay is noticeable enough if you have a set schedule and keep good notes. You should also find that as you progress through your regimen, your time till soreness and period of soreness both decrease until they plateau at some steady state. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to the pressure and temperature of the substance.  Take a look at these phase diagrams:</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/700px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">Water</a></p>
<p><a href="https://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/co2_phase_diagram.gif" target="_blank">Carbon Dioxide</a></p>
<p>On the water diagram, look at the red line ~100kPa (1 atm).  This is the typical pressure we find on Earth.  Follow it along the x-axis (temperature) and you'll see the familiar solid until 0 C, liquid until 100 C.  Now if the pressure was slightly under 1 kPa, you'll see we hit a triple point, this is the temperature/pressure at which water will exist in all three phases at the same time.  Below that pressure, water sublimes, going directly from solid to gas.  You'll also notice water has a bunch of different solid forms, this is due to rearrangements in the crystalline structure of ice at different pressures/temperature.</p>
<p>On the CO2 diagram, you'll see at 1 atm, it sublimes from solid to gas.  We would need to put dry ice in a container pressurized  above 5.11 atm to get liquid CO2.</p>
<p>Phase diagrams are different for every single substance.  Pressure and temperature, along with intermolecular forces and such, will determine what phase a substance will be, and whether it is able to sublime or will pass through a liquid phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sublimation, and indeed any phase change, is determined by several intensive properties of the system, including temperature, pressure, and the molar density of the compound in each phase. The ultimate reason any phase change occurs is because the molecules can do work to move from one phase to another. This may seem like a somewhat cyclical definition, but in order to relate phase changes to thermodynamic quantities we need to start out simple.</p>
<p>The way we formally describe phase changes is through the quantity of chemical potential µ, AKA the amount of free energy per molecule. The formal definition of µ includes a term that is the &quot;standard&quot; free energy, a function of the temperature and pressure of the system, and a term that increases as density increases. </p>
<p>Now free energy is the amount of energy available to do work, i.e. the total energy minus the random thermal energy. We can think of a phase change as the phenomenon where molecules move from one phase with energy G to another phase of energy G', which takes an amount of G' – G work to accomplish. Phase changes occur spontaneously if the molecule can move to a lower, more stable state. G is just the macroscopic analogue of µ, so this is analogous to saying that molecules will move from a higher µ to a lower µ'. This is much like how gasses move from higher pressure to lower pressure, however µ is even more general since it accounts for pressure, temperature, and density. IIRC Josiah Gibbs (the guy who formalized all of this science) originally referred to µ is &quot;pressure of mass action&quot; or something like that, which I think is a good intuitive description.</p>
<p>So now I think the crux of your question is how can it be that you can skip liquid when sublimation occurs. Don't you have to step up through each phase of matter sequentially as you gain chemical potential? </p>
<p>The answer is no. If you have enough chemical potential then the matter will simply not be able to condense into liquid and will fly out straight into the gas phase. Note that pretty much every substance has a certain ranges of temperature and pressure at which it can sublimate. Even water. The important thing is that these occur at relatively lower <em>pressures</em> compared to your normal solid-liquid phase change. If pressure is low, then molecules have to do less work to change from solid to gas because they have fewer other gas molecules to push out of the way. If they don't have to do much work to make the phase change, then basically as soon as they have enough thermal energy to do the work, they will escape the solid phase. This is an entropically-driven process that is exactly the same as a going from liquid to gas or solid to liquid. Sublimation is a specific special case where it just so happens that so little work needs to be done by the solid phase molecules that when they do the work, its enough to shoot right past the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. </p>
<p>So thats the &quot;what causes&quot; part of your question. The &quot;why&quot; part of this answer is quite complex. The why depends specifically and critically on the chemical properties of the molecules themselves. These properties make their contribution to chemical potential in the &quot;standard&quot; term that I was talking about earlier. You can always increase µ by increasing density, but some compounds just intrinsically have lower µ than others. A good example is water vs. CO2. Water can engage in lots of H bonding interactions, which effectively hold the molecules together more strongly. This means they have lower overall chemical potential than say CO2 molecules, which cannot engage in H bonding and therefore can move around and do work more easily. So now if we think about solid CO2 and solid H2O at 1 atm and 30ºC, you would expect the CO2 to sublimate and the water to melt. The liquid water can grab other H2O molecules more easily with those sticky H bonds, but the CO2 is relatively weak, and so those molecules just shoot straight out into the gas phase.</p>
<p>Thats kind of a hand-wavey intuitive answer, but you could also solve for the boundary mathematically by assuming µ(solid) = µ(liquid) and µ(solid) = µ(gas). Chemical potentials are equal at phase boundaries, so solving these equations is how people figure out how to draw the lines on phase diagrams. You would find that at 1 atm, there are no human-scale thermodynamic solutions in which you could make µ(ice) = µ(liquid) for CO2. Solutions will only appear in excess of 5.1 atm, because at these higher pressures the gas molecules can't just fly off into the atmosphere. The atmosphere itself does enough work on the evaporating molecules to trap them in a condensed phase, i.e. liquid.</p>

<p>On the other hand, solids and liquids are much better thought of as 'bound' states, where each molecule is held in a network of forces by other molecules around it that 'bind' it to them. </p>
<p>When looked at this way, solids and liquids are very similar, with the only difference that solids are bound rigidly whereas liquids are bound and therfore can't escape the liquid body, but can move around internally. In fact, it is even more deeper... For instance, if you start heating a mtal rod, long before it gets to melting point, it will start becoming soft and flexible, almost to the extent of a wet noodle. So molecules there ARE indeed moving around internally, just with more difficulty. And indeed, if you think about it, even in cold hard solids, many are malleable that you can hammer them to change shapes etc. </p>
<p>Further, solids themselves often have various other phase transitions before the phase transition to liquid state which we call melting. So in fact, melting is NOT all that special from a solid's point of view. For instance, water ice itself has various phases that it transitions through in colder/denser environments before it gets to the liquid phase. And in all of these cases, the same fundamental phenomenon is happening internally, in that the molecules are reorgnizing into a configuration that is most energetically stable at that given temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>Now regarding the 'bound' and 'unbound' stages, any molecule in a bound state that momentarily attains high enough energy will escape from the bound state to be unbound, and 'vaporize' into what we call gaseous stage. When this happens from liquids, we call it evaporation. When it happns from solids we call it sublimation, but it is the same phenomenon! Meaning that, there is always some 'vapor pressure' from these bound stages, whether it be some phase of solid, or liquid. </p>
<p>So looked at this way, the question is only about WHEN exactly the vapor pressure of a 'bound' stage reaches higher than the ambient pressure in that environment. If it is high enough when it is in a solid stage, then it will directly sublimate before/during any possible phase transition to liquid stage. </p>
<p>For instance, regular water ice has some 17 different solid phases, and for most of them, the only transition they can make is from one solid stage to another, but some 5 of those phases can transition into liquid phase, and some two of them can transition directly to gas phase, in some temperature and pressure conditions.</p>
<p>Caveat : Finally, its worth noting that although we talked of 'gas' being in fully unbound stage, of course there is some small amount of inter-molecular attraction there too, and this will become more relevant as we pack more and more molecules in a confined space at high pressure. If you keep reducing the effective intermolecular distance more and more in this way, eventually the behavior will become similar to liquids because practially they are no longer 'unbound' and this state is what we'd call reaching a super-critical fluid, where liquids and gas behavior merges, and there is only 'bound' behavior left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One example of this is Ice losing it's mass to gas in the freezer over time.   Melting is a bulk phase change.   Liquids,  solids and gasses typically are related to the amount of energy of the substance.  When referring to a single molecule it's hard to say if it's liquid, solid or gas as easily.   If a single water molecule of an ice cube gains enough thermal energy to melt we wouldn't even notice it and would be very difficult to identify.  It would probably just re freeze by releasing that energy back into the cube or by some other process.  But we can see if a single molecule gains enough energy from the system to release itself from the cube.   It would then be a gas.  Effectively bypassing the &quot;liquid&quot;  phase. This of course brings up lots of technicalities like what is a gas or what is a liquid which I'm sure some people on here could elaborate on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that on average the poles do get less solar radiation than equatorial regions, but they still get quite a bit. </p>
<p>Wikipedia has a decently good description of the effect of the Earth's geometry on the variation in solar radiation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#Top_of_the_atmosphere" target="_blank">here</a>. The key result is summarized <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Insolation.png" target="_blank">in this diagram</a>. The top panel shows the total irradiance at the top of the atmosphere and the bottom shows how much light actually makes it to the surface. Now the top panel shows that the fact that the poles are always more angled away from the Earth-Sun axis, they get less power on average than the equatorial regions.</p>
<p>Still, to see if solar power is feasible in the arctic we should look at the bottom panel to get some real numbers. The second map shows that if on average you get about 200W/m^2 in say Brazil or the south US and about 100W/m^2 in some arctic regions. Now even 100W/m^2 is not <em>that</em> little. Moreover, these are yearly averages and as you point out in the case of the arctic, all of the radiation is concentrated during the summer. As a result, the actual numbers for the total irradiance during the summer would be even closer for say northern Canada and the the south US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, solar power is effective in the arctic summers. But the catch is that in the summers, northern latitudes don't need electricity. </p>
<p>Further south (but still above the equator,) solar power is golden. In the summer when it's hottest, you also get the most electricity for air conditioning and other daily demands. </p>
<p>But when you go further north, during the summers it might be between 60-80 degrees--the sort of day where you just open your door and use neither heat not cooling. </p>
<p>I live in southeast Alaska. I dearly want to install solar panels because my house is south-facing and gets blasted by sun. But I stop myself and do the math. </p>
<p>In the winters, I use $350/month in electricity to heat my home. But if I were to install solar panels on my roof (the half that gets sun at least) I would rake in $20-30 worth of solar power. Conversely, in the summer, my electric bills are ~$80, and solar power would generate $100+. So... When I don't NEED power, it's in abundance, and when I do need it, the sun provides less than 1/10th of what I use.</p>
<p>It just doesn't math out. Maybe in 10+ years the price of solar will come down enough to make this economical regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you keep it flat to the ground it won't get much power, but normally you make it face the sun. That said, the angle will mean it has more atmosphere to go through, so more light will be blocked. I'm not sure how big an effect that would make. In any case, the cost of building them in such a faraway place and sending the electricity so far will offset any gains. And it will be worthless in the Arctic winter, which is when you'd actually need power that far north.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly the universe is either finite or infinite, we don't know which.</p>
<p>If it's finite it either has borders or it doesn't, we don't know which.</p>
<p>You're assuming it has no borders. Meaning either it is infinite or it is finite but a closed loop. In other words the 3d shape of the universe curves through 4d space so that while the amount of space might be finite there is no edge.</p>
<p>If the universe is infinite then an object travelling forever in linear motion will just keep on getting further away.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite but unbounded then an object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but it depends on the topography. You might end up three feet to your initial left and draw out an infinite but never-repeating spiral. There are lots of ways <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/WhatIs/Infinity/Length-Area.shtml" target="_blank">to have an infinite curve on a finite plane</a></p>
<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded and topographically simple enough then yes object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but the object might not have enough time to do so. Even if the object is a photon it can only travel at the speed of light and the distance it has to travel is unknown but has to be at least many hundreds of billions of light years. And it is not guaranteed that the universe will last hundreds of billions of years.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded then the universe will probably end in a big crunch. How long this takes depends how big the universe is, but either way there probably isn't time to do a lap.</p>
<p>There's some theories that suggest that if there's enough dark energy in the universe then even if the universe is finite and unbounded the big crunch can still be avoided. So then we're racing against heat death. If the object is anything other than a photon it will decay within 10^100 years which might be enough time to do a lap of a small universe but nothing big, and even if its a photon it will decay (be annihilated) eventually.</p>
<p>Tl:dr depends how big and bendy your universe is but probably not.</p>
<p>Edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>thanks for gold</li>
<li>yes I meant topology, although I'm not 100% convinced that my usage of topography was totally wrong</li>
<li>I cheated/simplified a little by folding in the whole factor of if the universe is expanding and at what rate into the question of its infiniteness/shape but this doesn't make any substantive difference I can see to the answer to the question</li>
<li>Yes the universe probably is flat, and infinite/expanding so fast it is effectively infinite. But if that is the case then ops question becomes boring and trivial, so I'd rather explore some of the more interesting possibilities.</li>
<li>Thanks for all the comments, sorry I didn't reply to all of them but I tried to reply to most that weren't repeats. If I didn't reply to you it either means I missed you, I answered someone who was saying something similar, or your question had me so stumped I couldn't think of an answer.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a two-dimensional creature living in what it can only sense is a two-dimensional physical universe. What it cannot comprehend is that it actually lives on the surface of a massive three-dimensional sphere. It can never get to the center of its universe because the center is straight down, and up-and-down is a third physical dimension, one of which it is unable to comprehend because of its flat, two-dimensional nature. So, if it travels in a straight line (a great circle), it will return to the point of origin. And its universe is expanding, like a balloon blowing up. </p>
<p>I imagine the same is true of our universe, only with one extra dimension. We are three-dimensional beings living on the surface of a four+ dimensional universe (physicists posit that there are ten physical dimensions, but I have a hard time grokking it). So, if we travel in space in a single direction, we would also end up right back at Earth. And our universe is expanding with the center of expansion being along a dimension(s) of which we cannot conceive.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus mindfuck:</strong> As the two-dimensional creature's universe expands, the surface area of its universe increases. Each point on the sphere moves away from every other point on the sphere. New 2D space is created as the sphere expands. The same is true for our universe; as our three-dimensional universe expands, every point in space moves away from every other point, and new space is constantly being created.</p>
<p><strong>Super Bonus Mindfuck X-treme:</strong> &quot;Now&quot;...what you conceive of as the present moment...the center of your consciousness...is new time being created by the expansion of the universe in a similar way to how new space is being created.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If all we knew about the universe was that it has no boundaries, it would be impossible to answer your question. Maybe an object would return to its original starting place (if the universe is sufficiently small and doughnut or sphere like) or it would continue forever (if the universe is infinite).</p>
<p>But we do know more. Below I try to outline the logic best I can based on the evidence we have.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">We know, for example, that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.</a> So a star 90 billion lightyears away from us today will be further away in the future. </p>
<p>We also know the universe is a finite age: about 13.8 billion years. So a finite age, combined with a fixed speed of light means the universe <em>we can see</em> is definitely finite. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">It's the part of the universe from which light has had time to reach us in the last 13.8 billion years.</a> Since a point that was 13.8 billion lightyears away from us is now further away, due to expansion, the observable universe is wider than 13.8 billion lightyears. It's actually a sphere about 93 billion lightyears in diameter. </p>
<p>Finally, we know that, as best as we can measure, the curvature of space (as a <em>slice</em> of <em>spacetime</em>) is flat. Spacetime as a whole is curved, but a slice of space at a given time, on average over the whole universe that we can see is not. This tells us that the universe can have three shapes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Infinite and flat</li>
<li>The three-dimensional version of a doughnut, which can be flat (weirdly enough).</li>
<li>The three-dimensional version of a sphere, but <em>really</em> huge so that it looks flat to us. (Think about the surface of the Earth. From space it looks curved, but your bedroom looks flat.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of scenario 1, you travel forever. In the case of scenario 3, the universe is already too vast, a spaceship could not beat the expansion.</p>
<p>In the case of scenario 2, however, it might be possible for a spaceship going in a straight line to return to its original position. It would have to be traveling fast enough to beat the accelerating expansion of the universe, however. We know the radius of this torus must be larger than the observable universe because otherwise we'd see that stars on one side of the sky are the same as on  the other side of the sky. (Since tests of this have been done.) I don't have the numbers at the moment, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
