</blockquote>
<p>They are, essentially. Drinking water supplies contain a low concentration of chlorine bleach or another disinfectant to prevent germs growing.</p>
<p>Also the pipes are sealed, with valves and taps designed to prevent air containing germs being drawn in, and they're opaque so light algae need to grow doesn't get in.</p>
<p>EDIT: As many people have mentioned, not all places and countries leave the disinfectant in the water. Ensuring that it's clean when it enters the pipes - either with chemicals that are removed or with UV light - along with the pipes being airtight and dark and unfavourable to life is when done correctly enough to keep the water clean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Algea and such come from surface contamination, but well water left in pipes for a few weeks or more may get stagnant or have rust from old steel pipes. </p>
<p>Last summer I inadvertantly left my garden hose running all day and ran my well dry.  After it finally refilled in a day or two from the surrounding ground water, I had to &quot;reprime&quot; the system and let the water run to clear out large contaminants like minerals and rust. The water smelled funny and was brownish for a few days. </p>
<p>Even under normal circumstances, I probably ingest small amounts of of microscopic minerals, small celled organisms, rust,etc.
Not enough to be harmful, some of the minerals might even be good for me. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It greatly depends the country you're in. A lot of commenters here mention chlorine as main means of desinfection, combined with copper piping. That certainly is the case in the US and many other countries. In other countries, like the Netherlands where I live, chlorine desinfection isn't common practice. Only 20÷ of households in the Netherlands recieve chlorinated water and in that case chlorine isn't used as a primary desinfectant (as that's not allowed), so the chlorine concentrations are very low. Primary means of desinfection is UV or ozon treatment (at the treatment plant). Growth of biological contaminents in the (mostly PE or PVC) piping is prefented by making sure no contaminents are present in the water before it enters the system, combined with measures to prefent introducing contaminents during transport, such as desinfecting piping with silverperoxide before use and mandatory anti-backflush valves at house connections. Apart from the methods mentioned above, there are many more options that are used around the globe, with fluctuating results; in some countries tap meets drinking water standards, sometimes even of better quality than bottled water (like in the Netherlands), in some countries tap water isn't meant for consumption as drinking water but only for use. While the Dutch take great pride in their drinking water quality, something could also be said for not cleaning the water you use for your washer / dishwasher / shower up to drinking water standards. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the drinking water plant they add more chlorine to the water than is necessary to deal with any of the bugs that lived in it. This leaves extra floating about ready to deal with any other bugs it might possibly encounter in the pipes under the road or in your own house.</p>
<p>On top of that to make sure that there is always water with some of that extra chlorine in it operators will sometimes run taps at the dead ends of the underground pipes.  These constantly run water, and make sure that the older water gets pushed out of the dead end pipe by fresher water.</p>
<p>Also, operators like me (or people we pay) will routinely go around to fire hydrants and open them up full bore and spray a bunch of water all over the roads or into ditches or whatever.  This not only makes sure fresh water gets to all the pipes, it also makes the water run really fast through the pipes and it scours off any bugs, or buildup in which they could live, and spews them out of the hydrants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes in that in an idealized two-body system, you can have a photon orbit another body of sufficient mass (in this case, a black hole). A two-body system is required, in an <em>idealized universe</em>, otherwise the orbits would be incredibly chaotic and decay instantly. Idealized in that you also cannot have sporadic particle generation (such as that which results in Hawking Radiation) as the force of even those particles would be sufficient to disrupt the photon's orbit.</p>
<p>No in that, as said, their orbits are far too chaotic to exist in the real universe in any situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is always getting information from the environment around you: what you hear people say, the color of the walls, what you see people do, the feeling of your clothes against your skin, what cards you have in your hand when playing a card game, and so on. Not all of that information is  important. When you're playing a card game with friends, knowing what cards you have and hearing when your friend says it's your turn is useful, but the fact that the wall is white isn't useful information. Luckily, there is a part of your brain that decides what information is important, and filters out the extra info so you can concentrate. </p>
<p>In patients with dementia, that part of the brain has been damaged- it's not completely useless, but it's much weaker than it would be in a healthy person. Basically, these patients are overwhelmed with information, but they have trouble figuring out what information is important and what that information means. They may see white walls and think it means they are in their mother's house, or they may see the cards and realize they need to lay down an ace to win. </p>
<p>There's no way to know for sure when they will pick up on the right information, but scientists do have some ideas of what causes them to be more aware. How aware (lucid) a person is can vary based on tiredness, mood, changes in physical health, what drugs/hormones are in their body, the environment around them, how other people are acting, etc.</p>
<p>For example, let's say Ruby is in the middle stages of dementia and normally isn't aware of where she is. Her in-home caregiver decides to take her on a car ride one morning and accidentally begins to back up too close to the edge of a drop off, and Ruby suddenly shouts, &quot;If you don't pull forward we're gonna die!&quot; This is likely because 1) it is morning and Ruby is not yet tired, meaning the part of her brain that is damaged is not yet worn out from a busy day of trying to make sense of things, and 2) this situation is especially dangerous, meaning that other parts of Ruby's brain would recognize that this is a threat and send out hormones that improves how well the damaged part of her brain works. </p>
<p>In the same vein, being very tired or in a dull environment could cause a person to be less aware. </p>
<p>Many experts believe that a lucid day (good day) happens when the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of these factors occur. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I was corrected with surgery to I believe 5 or 10 degrees curvature. However I also have a severe pectus caranatum (chest deformity) as well as my stomach being quite high in my chest cavity.

<p>My scoliosis before surgery was quite painful and I had severe back pain and neck pain. 3 years after surgery I'm much stiffer, but no more pain unless I do a bit of lifting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rehab doctor here.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of people with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis, there's no appreciable damage to internal organs. The organs are well able to adapt to curvatures of the spine without serious compromise. For this patient population, the major sequelae of their scoliosis if untreated is that it may progress, lead to deformity, poor cosmesis, and back pain.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to people with what's called Neuromuscular Scoliosis. This occurs in patients with weakness -- such as patients with Muscular Dystrophy or SMA(Spinal Muscular Atrophy). In these populations, the scoliosis will invariable continue to progress, and if untreated can lead to organ damage -- most notably impaired lung function(due to difficulty with air movement), and neurological damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Cartilages begin to ossify including the cricoiarytenoid joint (responsible for bringing the vocal folds together). So the vocal folds will not be able to come together as much as they used to, this may make the voice sound more breathy since air is escaping during speech.</p>
<p>The thyroarytenoid is the muscle that makes up our vocal folds. It begins to atrophy, so the vocal folds get thinner and decrease in elasticity. Women experience vocal fold swelling, and the larger the vocal folds, the lower the frequency. That is why women's voices lower with age. </p>
<p>Because of atrophy and losing muscle mass, men tend to have higher voices as they age. A lot of this is hormonal factors coming into play. For women, it has to do with less estrogen, for men, less testosterone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For nearly all of our evolutionary history, the overwhelming goal was to consume and store enough food energy to survive long enough to reproduce and raise children. Expending energy for no reason was a waste of hard-earned calories. And who needs extra motivation to get moving when you've got hunger?</p>

<p>Exercise that used to happen due to necessity doesn't happen anymore. Survival is one hell-of-a-motivator. Your day-to-day survival is not in question (I assume) due to health reasons. But, ever notice someone who got a &quot;health scare&quot; like a heart diagnosis? They may be a lot more motivated to go exercise. </p>
<p>We must also realize that food used to be extremely scarce and difficult to get. Who knows when'd you eat. In some countries, still, famine is a regular occurrence. In this case it makes sense to conserve energy. So not only is setting out to exercise at a gym seen as a disadvantage, the mind may see it as downright detrimental! Adding more fuel to the fire...</p>
<p>In my personal experience, consistent exercise only became possible when I truly understood the logical benefits of a physically fit body. In addition, sexual attraction is one heck of a motivator! This may be why many couples tend to gain weight - attracting a mate may have been their main goal in exercising. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Another good piece of evidence is the relative ratios of primordial elements. We know roughly how much of each stuff was in the universe, 75% H 24%He and some lithium. We know how long the universe was at a certain temperature and we know fusion rates and decay rates of unstable isotopes so we should be able to predict this ratio.

It can't be affected by any electromagnetic force or nuclear force because it isn't an atom and doesn't have electrons or protons. Gravity is the only force that can effect it and the only objects that can slow down light in such a significant manner as to redshift them are black holes, which we could detect due to light curving around them. Dark energy wouldn't do anything to the particle/wave itself ,because space only expands within itself, but makes the gap between galaxy clusters grow larger over time. This gives the galaxy it came from a momentum in the opposite direction as the light which causes the light to redshift.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you need to be careful with phrases like &quot;a small amount&quot;. </p>
<p>Mars is around 225 million km away at <del>closest approach</del> average distance.  Lets say you have a 1W flashlight and aim it at Mars, the intensity very far away from this flashlight will drop off as the distance squared (also a little extra from absorption and scattering in the atmosphere).  Without doing any exact calculations, if we assume scattering is negligible we can say the intensity that hits Mars will be larger than</p>
<p>I &gt; 1W / (2 pi * (225 million km)^2) ~ 3 × 10^-24 W /m^2</p>
<p>Mars has a surface area of 144.8 million km², so the power hitting Mars will be around</p>
<p>I * A/4 ~ 2.3 × 10^-10 W</p>
<p>This isn't a lot of power, but a single photon at optical wavelengths has an energy of around 3 × 10^-19 J, so this is still billions of photons a second hitting Mars.  </p>
<p>Edit: Lots of people are pointing out the beam divergence and scattering I ignored. Scattering I still don't think is very significant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">about a fraction 10^−5 of the light will be scattered for every meter of travel</a>, most of earths atmosphere is within 20 km of the surface so the intensity is reduced by a factor of around</p>
<p>I/I_0 = exp(-20000*10^-5) ~ 0.8</p>
<p>which is a 20% loss and thus not significant.  If you aimed the beam through more atmosphere or if you had a blue flashlight this gets worse, but never significant.</p>
<p>The beam divergence depends heavily on how wide a flashlight you have to start with, if you had something which is quite compact the divergence is worse than something with a large output.  Most of the power is actually in a spherical segment which is, say, 30 degrees in size, where as my calculation assumed this was closer to 90 degrees.  To compensate the intensity on Mars would be bigger by a factor of  (90/30)^2 = 9 ~ 10.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a clear night and a perfect aim, over time, yes, some of the photons your flashlight sends will be on the perfect vector and will impact its surface. The longer you hold it on target, and the more accurate your flashlight is, the greater the number of individual photons will collide with it.</p>
<p>But that VERY VERY small amount of the light that will be scattered widely over its surface and you wouldn't really be able to measure it.</p>
<p>If you reverse the situation and look at what light Mars is sending us, when we see it in the night sky it's a fairly small dot, not too bright. That light is reflected sunlight coming from the <em>entire surface</em> of the planet - about 21,300 square kilometers or 8200 square miles if you look at Mars as a flat plate.</p>
<p>Compare that to a somewhat brighter almost-point-source from someone standing on its surface and aiming a flashlight (maybe 10 square inches or 44 square centimeters) in your direction. It might be brighter but it's 3 <em>trillion</em> times smaller in area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question. A bunch of people want to communicate at the same time. Since other people make a lot of noise, you have to speak louder. Everyone else speaks louder too and eventually you are shouting as hard as you can and nobody can hear you since everyone is shouting. To make this work, you need a system.</p>
<p>First comes FDMA (Frequency division multiple access) which is basically giving everyone their own frequency. This is analogous to putting everyone in different rooms so they do not have to shout due to lack of interference. We quickly ran out of rooms to use once we got more users so we abandoned the idea.</p>
<p>Then comes TDMA (Time division multiple access) which is basically giving everyone a short time slot to transmit their message. This is analogous to giving people turns to speak so they won't interfere with each other. This is how GSM network works.</p>
<p>CDMA (Code division multiple access) is when you encode your data into the white noise and then run the decoding algorithm to get it back. This is analogous to everyone speaking at the same time but in different languages. This helps to separate different people speaking, but when there are a lot of users, the speech still becomes impossible to differentiate from the noise. This is how 3G works.</p>
<p>OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) is what LTE uses and is quite more complicated but is basically separating users by time AND frequency thus increasing capacity by a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell towers do in fact transmit the same information to every cellphone in range. However, the data is encrypted, so that only the correct phone can understand the information meant for that particular phone. </p>
<p>Each phone gets a time slot where the data sent is for that phone, and each phone gets a time slot where it can send data back. The data the phone sends back can also be heard by other phones in range, but again, the data is encrypted so that only the cell tower understands it.</p>
<p>Wi-fi routers work the same way, and this is one of the reasons the speeds decrease the more people on a tower/router, even if the signal strength seems fine. Every device needs to take its turn to send and receive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all modern systems work by sending all the data out at the same frequency and getting the phone to only see the part of the data that is meant for it. Encryption means that you can't (maliciously or accidentally) overhear someone else's data.</p>
<p>The fundamental way this works is by having the phone and tower agree on some scheme by which the data will be split up or mixed. In 2G technology, the phone and tower agree to only listen/transmit at certain times. In 3G, the phone listens all the time, but it uses a pseudo-random sequence to filter the signal it receives. The tower is using the same sequence to perform the opposite filter on the data to turn it into the signal. You can think of this as similar to the 2G technology; the tower switches extremely fast between transmitting different phones' data - faster than it takes to transmit a single bit of data. It's a little more complicated than that, but it ends up with all the data being transmitted at once, and each phone extracts the data that is meant for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are good explanations here to people with high technical understanding.</p>
<p>I am going to shoot for the 5.</p>
<p>Antennas emit radiation that we can't see, light is radiation we can see.</p>
<p>There are different patterns that exist in light and radiation. For example, the different colors you see are different patternS of  radiation.</p>
<p>to take this further, you can visualize these patterns as waves in the ocean. Some are longer, some are taller. Some have waves on top of waves.</p>
<p>Multiplexing is like having multiple waves on the same wave. We have mastered the abilitiy to Make tierred waves and constantly get better at it.</p>
<p>Understanding that. You can explore the other answers that give detail about the various forms of mutliplexing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
