<p>For humans the difference can be dramatic. The classic example is a traumatic experience appears to be in &quot;slow-motion&quot;, this is because as a novel experience while extremely physiologically arroused, we are creating more memory per second. More information crammed into the seconds make them appear longer, so they go by &quot;slower&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Even humans don't all perceive time at the same rate. For one thing we perceive time as going faster as we age. Even more interesting is the lexical hypothesis, which states that anything meaningful in our cognition will be encoded in our language. We have discovered tribes of people deep within the rain forest that don't have words for past, present, future or even time. When asked questions about time, the tribe members didn't even understand the questions.  So the answer to your question is undoubtedly no. Different organisms do not all perceive the passage of time at the same rate, because even organisms of the same species perceive time differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While you and I might perceive time differently, most organisms are unaware of the passage of time.  They simply exist in the moment.</p>
<p>The more complex the brain, the better awareness of time.  Insects, which are the most common organisms on this planet, have no perception of time.  I would argue a fish has no perception of time but a dog had has minimal perception of time.</p>
<p>Take an example of a pet dog.  While they can be trained and show emotions they cannot tell if you have been away for 1 day or 10. (At least mine cannot).  Humans will have an exact perception of how much time has passed yet your pet will have difficulty.  The dog will know the difference between 1 day and 10 years simply by how memories are stored but the dog will not understand the difference.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Such an effect exists, it is called nocebo. Many experiments have been conducted to demonstrate this effect. For example:</p>
<p>People were randomly splited into two groups. For participants from the first group were shown a film that wireless WiFi networks are dangerous to health. For participants from the second group showed a film about the fact that there is no proven danger of wireless networks with WiFi. After that, participants were subjected to 15 minutes of fake irradiation (that is, they were told that they were irradiated with WiFi, but in fact there was no radiation). From non-existent exposure to some participants, it became so bad that they asked for an interruption of the experiment. Most participants noted the symptoms that they associated with non-existent WiFi irradiation and among those who watched the film about the dangers of WiFi, there was a greater proportion of participants who indicated the presence of symptoms caused by irradiation. Thus, the media reports about the horrors of the phenomena faced by the inhabitants can have a negative impact on the state of health of the audience of these materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The great thing about real medicine is that it will always inherently do what it's really supposed to do, no matter what you believe.  However what you're asking about is just a form of the placebo effect.</p>
<p>As people are also mentioning the nocebo effect, let's define the 2 terms:  placebo effect is when you believe you're taking an action that will create an effect, and that effect manifests itself, even though the action has no inherent link to the effect .  Nocebo effect is when you know you're taking a fake action that will create an effect, and that effect manifests itself.  So placebo you don't know that the pill is a sugarpill and it works anyway, and nocebo you know it's a sugarpill and it works anyway.</p>
<p>Why do I say &quot;action&quot; and not &quot;take a pill&quot;?  Because this can be any action you deem helpful, pill-taking has become synominous with something healthy, but seeing a &quot;doctor&quot; can also be viewed medicinally, or doing any action and I mean <em>any</em> action that either has an association or with which you create an association, like walking, or putting on cream, or going to a masseuse.</p>
<p>What you're describing is taking a real drug and then because of belief you suppress the effect the drug has on your body, this is within the placebo parameters, and belief really is that strong.  There is a study that was made where people were given pills and told that they would make them hyper and really stressed.  The pills were a relaxant, which meant people could really feel a real effect coming over them, they associated it with what they were told and became hyper and stressed although the opposite should have occurred.</p>
<p>So your expectations about what is going to happen are as important as what is really happening.  And all the studies regarding nocebo effect should tell you to create small inexpensive healthy habits and associate positivity and healthfulness to them as much as you can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Stress can cause it, when someone is under stress their body produces specific hormones that can make them sensitive to pain and muscle tension which could lead to intense, sharp pains. I've also heard that vitamin D or iron deficiencies can cause it too. </p>
<p>I always thought of it like someone has a voodoo doll of me and is clearly fucking with me. I know it's not the case but it's fun to think about.</p>
<p>Edit- For the people <del>whining</del> concerned about my choice of word, when I say &quot;jittered&quot; (an actual word) I mean when the pain receptors are activated and send the signal to the brain via nerve fibers, sometimes that signal gets fucked up. More times than not, that's the source of a sharp pain that doesn't last long, but it can also happen from stress/tension in the muscles or vitamin/mineral deficiencies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically any problem in the body can be caused by a problem with one, or a combination of the following: (too much or too little of...)
Mechanical (compression, vibration, movement, etc. Eg. Sitting on your foot and it goes numb),
Thermal (obviously, heat or cold),
Chemical (inside the body or outside, eg. Deprivation of oxygen or nutrients via blood),
Or Electrical (nerve conduction, eg. Overstimulation)</p>
<p>It doesnt necessarily mean you should be concerned, for example hiccups are sometimes caused by an overstimulation of your phrenic nerve, which innervates your diaphragm and causes it to spasm and makes you hiccup! </p>
<p>However, pain shows up when your body has run out of ways to hide or mask the problem. If you have re-occuring sharp pains in the same place or pain is persistent - go get checked out. Persistant pain isn't normal and your body is trying to tell you something.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be a variety of possibilities. Pain is such a general symptom that its hard to pin it to one specific cause without more detail or past information.</p>
<p>In order for pain to be an indicator of a pre-existing condition, the pain has to be localized to an area with a history of occurances.</p>
<p>What it sounds like is periphery nerve stimulation. PNS is often attributed to a &quot;twitch&quot; sensation but at times can be acute pain if a pain receptor is stimulated. PNS can be caused by lots of factors ranging from electric stimulation, imbalances in salts, to strong shifting magnetic fields (in the case of MRIs). It's nothing to worry about. </p>
<p>However, consult a doctor, specifically a neurologist if you are getting these painfull occurances multiple times a day if there is no likely cause (exercise for example) you can attribute the pain to. Usually if there is a neurological issue, there will be other symptoms like motor deficits such as uncontrollable shaking, loss of strength, or seizing.  </p>
<p>Edit: forgot to add that its quite possible that your sitting position/lying down is pinching a nerve and when you shift positions it can cause pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>ELI5 answer: They don't die instantly but they do usually lose consciousness when conditions are correct. Death follows shortly after.</p>
<p>Technical answer: When the bullet strikes body you have several things happen in a very short amount of time. The first is the force of the bullet transfers into the target's flesh tearing and ripping tissues apart. all of this results in a very large hole formed by the force of the bullet being transferred to the body's tissue. Then this cavity mostly collapses and thus is known as the Temporary Wound Cavity. Most muscle and fascia tissues recover their shape from this shock, the two tissues that do not are the kidneys and liver. They shred. Blood vessels also do poorly.</p>
<p>The cavity that still exists after the bullet shock subsides is known as the Permanent Wound Cavity and is usually filled with bits and pieces of the tissues surrounding it and blood. </p>
<p>The bullet continues into the body, passing through bone, muscle, blood vessel, nerves and organs. When the round has hit what is known as the &quot;T-slot&quot; death is usually instantaneous or close enough that it doesn't matter. The &quot;T-slot&quot; is the shape formed by the intersection of the eyes and nose. When aiming at the &quot;T-slot&quot; from straight on the lower part of the brain and brainstem are directly behind this reference point. While aiming from the diagonal or side, adjustments must be made. When the brainstem is severed, all activity stops. </p>
<p>The other way that we can achieve instant incapacitation of the target body is to achieve hydrostatic shock. The body is made mostly of water and for our purposes it transmits energy pretty well. Two very large blood vessels run up and down the spine and the heart and lungs are centrally located or, at &quot;center mass&quot; of the torso. By placing one or more shots to center mass in under 1.5 seconds we drastically increase the amount of damage that occurs in the body from shock waves traveling through the bodies fluids. Usually when hydrostatic (or hydraulic) shock occurs there is an instant loss of consciousness followed by tearing damage throughout the cardiovascular system. There have been autopsies that have shown blood vessels in the brain suffer damage from chest shots. From my understanding, this change in fluid pressure shuts the brain off, either permanently or temporarily. This might be what you are referring to. </p>
<p>If you have any further questions about my very specific area of knowledge I would be happy to oblige.</p>

<p>The Aorta is the largest artery in the human body, which runs from the left ventricle of the heart down to you pelvis and then splits off.</p>
<p><strong>Gunshot trauma to the aorta is in almost all cases invariably fatal from sudden cessation of all blood pressure</strong></p>
<p>Just going to cite this here as an edit with an attached quote for context: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8614076" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8614076</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The overall mortality was 80.6% (87.5% for gunshot injuries, 64.7 % for knife injuries).</p>
<p>Victims with injury to the thoracic aorta were more likely to have an unrecordable blood pressure on admission than patients with abdominal aortic injuries (73% vs 28.4%),</p>
<p>The introduction of a dedicated trauma program, which resulted in significant reduction of mortality in other types of severe trauma, had no effect on the outcome in aortic injuries.</p>

<p>There is a fairly small line of impact in the chest which would instantly put a human down. A heart shot will - depending on a variety of factors - stop the circulation of blood to the brain, which can make a person unconscious within seconds. Extremely prompt and effective medical care could save a life at this point. A gunshot into the torso which severs the spinal cord will paralyze an individual, although not necessarily kill them. </p>
<p>Even a gunshot which does impact the brain is not necessarily fatal, unless it destroys the brain stem. If the brain stem is damaged, death immediately follows. </p>
<p>Famous case examples: at least one of the suspects in the 1986 Miami FBI shootout was shot multiple times in the chest, including lung shots, and shots which bruised the heart and spinal cord. The fight continued for over four minutes. </p>
<p>U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords was shot in the head (brain) in January 2009 suffering brain damage however is still alive. </p>
<p>Note: I am not a medical professional, however I am a police officer and Afghanistan combat veteran. The human body is remarkably resilient, and gunshots are not often fatal. Shots to the chest are remarkably survivable <em>in general</em> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Normal radio frequencies are around 100MHz which equals to a wavelength of 3m. With higher frequencies you need smaller meshes in your cage to stop the waves from passing the cage.
Just like the black grid in your microwave does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

First stack has all russian words that begin with &quot;A&quot;, second stack all words that begin with &quot;Б&quot; (russian B), etc.</p>
<p>Now lets say someone tells you the russian word &quot;магазин&quot;. You know it starts on M, so your brain checks the M stack until it finds the word, and translates it to &quot;Shop&quot;.</p>
<p>But imagine you are shown a picture of a dog, and asked to translate it to russian. You still have all these sorted stacks in front of you, but that doesn't help you in any way. You could translate a word if it was given to you, but you can't just &quot;find&quot; the word you need to speak it.</p>
<p>Also, when you're &quot;understanding&quot; the language, you're usually understanding the meaning, not the word-to-word translation. So if someone tells you &quot;XXXXXX CLEAN ROOM XXX XXXXX NOW XXXXXX ANGRY&quot;, you can figure out that they want you to clean up your room asap. But when you try to say it yourself, you can;'t just &quot;make up&quot; the words or grammatic structures that you don't know, and thus you struggle to speak in that language.</p>
<p>This is obviously a gross oversimplification, but if gives you the right idea. Its much easier to recall a word to translate it than to remember what the word is for what you're trying to say - so if you dont use a language actively, you will struggle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Can you draw a map of the USA? Probably not accurately.</p>

<p>This is just my take on it. I speak 4 languages and two of them I understand fine, but cannot reply to at the same level.</p>
<p>EDIT - Bonus comment:</p>
<p>When learning a new language, the opposite often occurs for a short while where you can speak more than you understand. This is because when you learn a word or phrase, you learn it phonetically or grammatically and you overpronounce it compared to native speakers. So the way you say a word sounds different to how it's said naturally or in native accents...meaning you often don't recognize the same word being used by other people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel prize winning psychologist and economist, discovered the brain has two &quot;modes&quot;, which he calls system 1 and system 2.  System 1 is fast, instinctive and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, more logical, and requires concentration to use. </p>
<p>We have both systems because each is fit for a different purpose. When the lion jumps out of the bush, you don't want to sit down and puzzle out a 13-point action plan.</p>
<p><del>These systems can be manually activated</del> You can help activate these systems by smiling and frowning. Smiling activates system 1, and this is thought to be evolutionary selection to help us get along socially -- quick banter, jokes, being in the moment, and paying attention to multiple things. Frowning activates system 2, and this is thought to be evolutionary selection for rumination -- when something is wrong in your life you need to stop and figure out what needs to change.</p>
<p>Actually it would be more accurate to say that (like many things in physiology) they're activated in a feedback loop. Using system 1 makes you smile which reinforces system 1 which makes you smile which reinforces system 1, and so on. Similarly, using system 2 makes you frown which reinforces system 2. We stay in system 1 most of the time because it requires very little mental energy compared to system 2, which becomes exhausted quickly. Our body is always trying to put us back into system 1; or more accurately, system 1 tends to automatically answer questions before system 2 ever gets a chance, and it takes deliberate effort to ignore your first instinct in favor of puzzling something out.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr We frown while concentrating because it helps us maintain our concentration. More specifically, it's a biological feedback mechanism for activating system 2.</strong></p>
<p>Kahneman wrote about the two systems in his best-selling book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, wherein he also goes into detail on the cognitive biases each system is susceptible to. It's a really good book that can help us catch ourselves in the act, and I'd highly recommend it. You can read a brief summary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/13/thinking-fast-slow-daniel-kahneman" target="_blank">here</a>, or a more in-depth one on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: /u/lansaman also posted <a href="https://youtu.be/UBVV8pch1dM" target="_blank">a great video</a> on the subject below.</p>
<p>EDIT2: NYT also did a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html?mcubz=1" target="_blank">great summary of the work</a>, and even gets into some of system 1's cognitive biases, as well as other conclusions from the book on the nature of happiness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>A prevailing theory regarding the evolution of language implicates a gestural stage prior to the emergence of speech. In support of a transition of human language from a gestural to a vocal system, articulation of the hands and the tongue are underpinned by overlapping left hemisphere dominant neural regions. Behavioral studies demonstrate that human adults perform sympathetic mouth actions in imitative synchrony with manual actions.</p>

It's a bit - but only vaguely - like riding a motorbike around a wall of death - you keep the wheels straight, but your path - observed from outside - is circular.</p>
<p>Just as there are many straight lines through a single point depending on your direction, there are many geodesics through a single point depending on your speed. So while a satellite passing through a point near a star at a certain angle will find itself following a tight geodesic, a beam of light is not bent (as observed from outside) so much, even though it too is also following a geodesic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The quick answer is it can sprout, just typically when the fruit begins to over ripen and or rot, the seeds are in a state of dormancy that are activated via different mechanisms, sometimes it's heat from season changes, or water, sometimes the outer layers are hard or and don't allow the seed to sprout inside. It isn't uncommon to see in tomatoes for example, I believe due to the high moisture surrounding the seeds and sometimes apples seeds that are already sprouting in the fruit. as the fruit itself degrades it provides nutrients to the seeds giving them a better chance to grow and survive. Generally however as long as they are in a fruit that isn't rotting or allowing water direct contact to the seeds they aren't likely to exit their dormant phase.</p>
<p>Of course this varies wildly from plant to plant. But it's fun to suspend avocado seeds over water and watch them come alive :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Seeds are remarkably diverse in their ability to germinate, dormancy requirements, and other factors. Seeds can have any or a combination of physical dormancy, embryo dormancy, or even symbiotic dormancy (in a sense). A good general and easy to read source on dormancy and conditions to 'break' the dormancy (i.e., what signals the seed to grow under certain conditions) can be found in this article.</p>
<p>The short version. Some seeds have physical dormancy based on seed coat thickness, type, etc. These seeds typically germinate when they imbibe enough water (oftentimes in the fall or winter when rains come to a particular region). Sometimes they need physical agitation to 'scar' the seed coat and allow water imbibition (various desert grasses, including notably Oryzopsis hymenoides, or Indian Ricegrass). Some have various forms of 'embryo dormancy,' in which embryos only develop slowly, based on the accumulation of growth hormones or the decomposition of chemical inhibitors (peaches, some perennial grasses, etc.). Sometimes these plants can be tricked by scientist (or home gardeners) into germinating by using chemicals such as gibberllic acid (GA) which are naturally occurring growth promoters.</p>
<p>In the case of some orchids (including famous, vanishingly rare American varieties), the seeds are so tiny that they require the action of mutualistic fungi in order to germinate and grow successfully. It is hypothesized that some of the orchid-fungal symbioses are strictly host-specific: one species of orchid requires a species of mychorrhizal fungus that can't interact with any other plant in order to germinate.</p>
<p>In addition to all of those possible routes for seed dormancy, breaking dormancy, and germination, seeds of various plants also have requirements for ripening, after-ripening, etc. This means that some grass seeds (I use grasses because I study them) can mature on the plant, but can't germinate when they fall to the ground during 'seed-shatter.' They need time in dry, warm conditions (makes sense if seeds fall in the summer or late summer in arid environments) before they can be 'triggered' by fall or winter rains. Some grass seeds need a month, some more or less time.</p>
<p>tl;dr: It's really complicated, but a fascinating topic! Plants have evolved a bewildering number of 'seedbank strategies' to ensure long-term viability in their environments, many of which affect the germinability and dormancy conditions of their seeds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
