		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things that go into why a material can have a mirror finish.  First, is whether light that hits it reflects straight back or gets scattered in many different directions.  Smooth surfaces scatter less of the reflected light, and will be shinier than rough surfaces.</p>
<p>Any material can be polished.*  Polishing is just making the surface smoother.  Generally, the smoother a surface, the shinier it looks.  </p>
<p>So the real question is, why are smooth metal surfaces extremely shiny and other materials not so shiny?</p>
<p>The second part of the story is that light is reflected any time it encounters a boundary between two materials with different indexes of refraction.  The bigger the difference in the index of refraction, the more light gets reflected.</p>
<p>For visible light, metals have very large indices of refraction.  The huge difference in the index of refraction between the metal and air can result easily in over 90% of light being reflected.</p>
<p>Explaining why metals have such high indices of refraction for light is a little more complicated.   Metals have lots of free electrons that can move around inside them (that's why they conduct electricity).   All these electrons interact strongly with the electric field of light.</p>
<p>Things like wood and plastic do not have many free electrons so they don't interact nearly as strongly with light.  For example, when travels through air and hits a glass surface, only about 4% of the light will be reflected.</p>
<ul>
<li>It turns out that it's a lot easier to polish a metal than it is to polish wood.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is one of the properties that metallic elements have. Shine, the capability of being polished, being ductile (capable of being drawn out into threads or wires), being a heat and electricity conductor are all part of the same characteristic: metallic character.</p>
<p>This is dictated by the way a metal's electrons behave, among some other factors.</p>
<p>When a bunch of atoms of the same metal react they form what it is known as a Sea of Electrons. Something like <a href="http://chemistry-batz.wikispaces.com/file/view/metal.e-structure.JPG/473394092/metal.e-structure.JPG" target="_blank">this</a>. Electrons tend to be delocalized in this situation, meaning that instead of orbiting their respective atoms they are &quot;loose&quot; between the metal's atoms, like water drops in the sea, forming a sea of electrons. This is what gives metals their characteristics. Light can't penetrate the surface because of the &quot;sea&quot;, so it is reflected thus metals are shiny. This also makes them good conductors of electricty as electrons move freely unlike in wood, for example.</p>
<p>Now, why isn't wood or plastic shiny? It's because of the way their atoms react to each other, too. Those two are or come from organic matter, that is usually made up from nonmetals like Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nytrogen and others. They can have metals on their structure but not in a way that their atoms form a &quot;Sea of electrons&quot; or anything of that kind. The structures formed by these elements are very big compared to simpler molecules (like H2O) and are highly complex too. Basically, light is absorbed by these compounds instead of reflecting it. One of the main reasons is their electrons are not &quot;freely moving between atoms&quot; but have more specific arrangements and positions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lack of internal structure. The metalic bond in metals and the &quot;amorphic solid&quot; nature of glass are ideal for polishing because of what polishing actually is...</p>
<p>A scientist (who's name I don't remember) realized from his work as a lens grinder that &quot;polishing&quot; is just making finer and finer scratches, closer and closer together until you basically overwhelm the materials ability to &quot;record&quot; the individual scratches (well enough to matter).</p>
<p>So metals, things engaged in &quot;metallic bonds&quot;, largely consist of free-floating atoms awash in a sea of the electrons they've given up to the whole mass. So something that is all metalic bonds can be easily reshaped by the very focused pressures of a series of finer and finer &quot;grit&quot;, first of a rasp, then a &quot;sand paper&quot; and then a &quot;polishing compound&quot;. Basically, at the finest levels, individual atoms are getting pushed around (or, well, maybe clusters, where the clusters deform into individual motion). So metals can be polished very, very well.</p>
<p>Second only to metals is glass. Its lack of fixed internal structure means that, while whole (covalently bonded) molecules have to be shoved around or peeled off, the resulting &quot;minimum deformity&quot; is the size of any one of those molecules and/or the spaces into which it can be forced.</p>
<p>Plastic is much more difficult to polish because it has larger polymer molecules which leave much bigger pits behind when they are displaced. It's possible, and even every-day common, to polish &quot;the right kind of plastic&quot;, such as acrylics. That's what most &quot;eye glasses&quot; are made of these days. Real glass is heavy, fragile, and expensive for something that's become as disposable as plastic over the last thirty years. (But when I was a child in the seventies, virtually all glasses were glass because plastics was still a pretty primitive era.)</p>
<p>When we get to something hugely structural, like wood, all bets are off. The difference between the cellulose inter-cellular matrix and the soft liquid cell centers... and the arrangements of grain and the differing growth segments and all that relatively huge stuff means that as you sand and polish you reach a point where the abrasive starts breaking the structure instead of scratching it. You are gouging out whole cell structures or even groups of cells. The different moisture contents, hardnesses, and connective tissues just aren't consistent enough to get that smooth.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong. There are some impressively well polished wood structures. They've often been impregnated with oil or wax, and they are usually made from very dense and hard woods (not to be confused with &quot;hardwoods&quot;... balsa wood is a &quot;hardwood&quot; but it isn't a hard wood) to begin with.</p>
<p>(ASIDE: Hardwoods versus Softwoods is about the seeds of the trees not the flesh of the wood.)</p>
<p>Now something with an internal structure isn't always bad. Diamonds, and most other crystals, can be polished quite nicely despite their internal structure. That's because their internal structure is very regular. A skilled craftsman knows the &quot;grain&quot; of the structures of such materials and knows how to work variously with and against the grains to create the desired effects.</p>
<p>So basically, things with internal structural detail which <em>varies</em> throughout the material is difficult or impossible to polish beyond a particular point.</p>
<p>Finally the &quot;mirror&quot; part. We make mirrors by precision crafting a glass surface and then putting metal on that surface and then viewing it from the other side (through the glass) because we want <em>flat</em> and we want <em>reflective</em>, and the seal between the flat glass and the flat metal lets the flat glass <em>protect</em> the integrity of the flat and <em>reflective</em> metal, while helping prevent oxidation and pitting of that metal. The &quot;flat side&quot; of the glass is often achieved (or was, back in the day) by pouring the molten glass onto a sea of mercury. Basically it was easier to <em>create</em> the smooth glass than it was to <em>polish</em> the glass smooth after the fact. The crappy (and less-important) upper surface of that glass mirror could then be polished, but it didn't take the same amount of care to still get a nice mirror.</p>
<p>So metals make a better mirror because they respond to the electromatnetic disruptions of a large range of frequencies quite readily, largely because of that &quot;sea of electrons&quot; thing (if memory served). (read up on &quot;the types of chemical bonds&quot; and the difference between metallic and covalent bonds in particular. Fascinating stuff.)</p>
<p>But now we are into details of conductivity and the electromagnetic field in which photons spend their reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To polish a material to a mirror finish you have to create a very uniform surface, so that all the light is reflected in the same way and not scattered into different directions. The higher the density of a material, the closer you can get to this even surface because the atoms are &quot;closer together&quot;.<br />
Imagine bouncing a ball against a box full of pebbles (resembling light bouncing against a low density surface): no matter how hard you try to arrange the pebbles as evenly as possible, you can't create a surface that will bounce the ball in the same direction every time.    </p>
<p>EDIT: seems like I only got half of the story. Like /u/jjs2424 explained, the index of refraction is the other half. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cells in the meat you eat are not alive, so it doesn't matter if they are damaged when they freeze. They're already damaged beyond repair from lack of oxygen. That does however not mean that they've lost their nutritional value. Even if you crush an egg, all the nutritients are still there, right? Assuming you don't spill something onto the floor.</p>
<p>Your frozen meat is however not as fine when thawed as it was when it was fresh. You'll notice this if you freeze and thaw something several times. The meat's texture changes, and generally becomes less appetizing. Freezing it just once, and gently thawing it doesn't damage it all that much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The poster Above me is correct though. Since no process is perfect, even through quick freezing, some large crystals form, damage will accumulate, and you will ruin the meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We'd have to run out first or at least get to a point where the per-joule price point for oil is higher than something else. It's debatable how long that will take.</p>
<p>The green-minded people say it's already happened and the price is kept artificially low by countries (such as Saudi Arabia) selling below cost to undercut competitors to the point of bankruptcy, after which time they'll stop selling below cost.</p>
<p>Those in favor of oil (such as the oil industry spokespeople) say that, essentially, there's so much oil that we'll effectively never run out.</p>
<p>The reality is that there is a finite surplus on Earth and there is a finite production rate. If the human race is using oil faster than it is produced, the surplus will be exhausted.</p>
<p>As the surplus reaches exhaustion, supply does down bring the price up. This is when technologies such as wind, solar, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_depolymerization" target="_blank">thermal depolymerization</a> can become more feasible.</p>
<p>I've talked about thermal depolymerization before but there doesn't seem to be the level of interest in it that I thought there would be. To summarize, this process can convert just about anything with carbon and hydrogen into oil, natural gas, and &quot;carbon solids&quot; (probably elemental carbon or graphite, etc). Imagine a water treatment plant that converts raw sewage, garbage, used motor oil, and plastics into drinking water, natural gas, #2 light crude, and graphite.</p>
<p>Anyway, we'll never actually be away from oil completely. Oil is useful as a dielectric for large transformers, liquid cooling of computer equipment, wire EDM and EDM sinker machining processes, and all sorts of other things.</p>
<p>There's always going to be diesel and gas turbine backup generators, those are simply too reliable to decommission.</p>
<p>You're always going to need to lubricate something as well. Teflon is great, but sometimes you need the mechanical properties of metal on metal without the teflon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lets call these things HC's. When a well is drilled things then are taken from the earth. Things like Gas and Oil, but also things like Ethane and Propane. These are used for Transportation fuel, Plastics manufacturing, electricity generation (for things like heating and lights) as well as a plethora of other significant needs. </p>
<p>But the big concern in your question here is the Oil and Gas specifically. </p>
<p>In places like USA and Western Europe, you don't really think about it much (beyond that its the stuff you put in your car). </p>
<p>But in places like China and India, it is a huge concern! The 2 largest countries in the world STILL mostly use coal! <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/to-curb-climate-change-china-slows-coal-to-gas/" target="_blank">In fact, China is desperate to get away from coal and move to other energy sources.</a> Oil and Gas is one of those. </p>
<p>They want to get away from coal for a few reasons. </p>
<p>To the men in suits they will say it is more efficient and beneficial economically for the growth of not only the economy but the standard of living. This is very true. </p>
<p>To the concerned citizens and the world they will say it will be better for the environment and their quality of life. This is also true!</p>
<p>You are too young to remember but there was a time that Coal was King in many places in North America. Things like Acid Rain and heavy smog in smaller population centres was common. This is something China faces today!</p>
<p>So, in the near future, No!. Oils demand continues to grow! </p>
<p>In the very long run, who knows.  When your explaining to your great grandchildren when they are 5, you will have a better answer.</p>
<p>Remember, Oil has not began to be phased out. And Coal was being phased out a century ago and is still in use.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you go far enough north, this isn't always true.  In places where it's warm enough for the snow to turn to rain, snowstorms are more likely to happen at night simply because it's colder.</p>
<p>Also, night is longer in the winter, especially as you go further north.  In much of southern Canada, for example, in December it's night 16 hours or more of the day, so snow is more likely at night simply because it's more likely to be night.</p>
<p>Really bad snow storms last long enough that they persist day and night.  We just had a 36-hour blizzard here this week.  It started around lunchtime on Monday and ended overnight Tuesday night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Others here have answered your question: nights are longer than day during winter, plus it's cooler at night, so more likely to snow vs. changing to rain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You and your friends gather around a table. You eat food, you drink drinks, and pretend to be characters in a fantasy world. Your very smartest friend is the &quot;DM&quot; because he or she wrote down some ideas for a story that you can all act out together. Your DM starts at the beginning of the story, and lets everyone at the table improvise the middle and end. Solving problems and fighting monsters a big part of moving the story along, but at this table you roll dice to decide if your character will be awesome or fail. Winning takes some lucky dice rolls, but if you play to your character's strengths, you'll get through it no problem. At the end of the story your character gets experience points and levels up. If you and your friends get to a higher level, you can solve more interesting problems and fight way bigger monsters. </p>
<p>Just like any other improv or board game, if everyone at the table WANTS TO have a good time, it's going to be a great time. Also you have to worship the devil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's imagine two characters; Bob the Barbarian and Will the Wizard. Bob is very strong and very tough, but not a very smart or sociable guy. Will is very smart and can do cool magic things, but is a frail fellow. You get to come up with a fun story for Bob and/or Will about why they're an adventurer/how they got to be so cool.</p>
<p>From there....you make up things as you go along a story, which is controlled by your DM, aka your &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;. Let's say his/her story has you confronting a troll who demands payment for you to cross his bridge.</p>
<p>Bob could try and fight the troll. He's good at fighting. His stats are great for fighting. Bob can also certainly try and write up a treaty between the nearby town and the troll to arrange free passage in a diplomatic trade agreement. Bob's not so good at that, but he's definitely able to try if he'd like, and Bob gets to be a hero either way.</p>
<p>Will might try using magic on the troll to pass by undetected, or he can use his clever wits to trick the troll in to letting them pass for free. Will can also attempt to arm wrestle the troll to let them pass; it may not work, but that's totally Will's call, and if he wins he still beat the bad guy.</p>
<p>That's D&amp;D in a nutshell. You come up with a character, create a fun backstory, and then just make up things based on what the DM is narrating to you. The DM is the world your characters live in. They're the narrator describing events as they unfold. They're the familiar tavern keeper welcoming you back in from the cold. They're the bad guy cursing you with his dying breath. You are active members in the story they create. You can literally do (almost) anything, as long as the dice go your way. There's a chance of success or failure in almost everything you do, only limited by your own creativity. Depending on what you wanna do, you add a certain modifier to your dice roll. The better you are at a certain skill, the higher the modifier, meaning the more likely it is that something using that modifier will succeed. </p>
<p>Depending on how you make your character, certain stats are more likely to succeed than others, so obviously you'll probably play it safe most of the time. </p>
<p>...But no one remembers that time the cleric THOUGHT about punching the troll in the dick so that she could intimidate it to let her friends pass, and then decided to pray to their god to make the troll go away. They remember the time Christina the Cleric kicked a troll so hard in the nads it passed out from the pain. </p>
<p>Moments like that are what make D&amp;D amazing, and I hope you and your friend have a great time playing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apologies in advance I am on mobile:</p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game. </p>
<p>The game is structured by rulebooks that describe mechanics, detailing how to decide if a particular action has the desired result or not (&quot;I want to jump over this big pit! For example). </p>
<p>Because these actions are usually more complicated than simple success or failure (continuing our our example: you may fall short of the other side of the pit but just barely manage to catch the ledge, hanging on for dear life!) there exists the role of The Dungeon Master (DM). The DMs influence and control of the game can vary from person to person. The typical experienced DM will act as the arbitrator, will keep the flow of the story going, will act and play as all the characters aside from the players (shopkeepers, monsters, quest givers), and will also act as the environment (traps, dungeons, weather, dues ex machina). A DM may write their own story and monsters and dungeons, or use premade material.    </p>
<p>Edit:
The core mechanic of DnD is as follows:
For any action with a chance of failure roll a twenty sided die (called a d20). The DM instructs the player to add the relevant numbers from the players character sheet. Compare the result against a pre-determined 'dice check' number (called a DC). </p>
<p>Putting it all together: </p>
<p>DM: you are in a dark cave. The door to the treasure is on the far side of the room, illuminated dimly by light seepung through the cracks in the frame. A large pit, 15ft across, blocks your path</p>
<p>Player character (PC): I get a good running start and leap across the pit!</p>
<p>DM: ok roll an Athletics Check. Remember, that's d20 plus your strength and also plus any training you may have in athletics. (The DM knows from the rulebook the DC for this check is DC 15)</p>
<p>PC: ok! I rolled a 7, plus my 3 strength bonus and 4 from my training. I got 14!</p>
<p>DM: You dash towards tje pit and make a mighty leap! Soaring through the near total darkness you realize you aren't going to make it! If you are quick and lucky you may be able to grab on to the ledge and avoid a fall. Roll a dexterity saving throw. that's a d20 plus dexterity plus training.</p>
<p>PC: I got a 19!</p>
<p>DM: you barely manage to grab the ledge and haul yourself over the side. Lucky save!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>D&amp;D is a game, and First and foremost it should be fun. It is also a game with a lot of rules. How many of them you choose to follow depends on who's running the game, and at it's core the game is very flexible. There are a common set of generally agreed upon rules you'll find at every table, how much damage weapons do, how movement works, how casting spells work. You want to learn the rules for whatever flavor of D&amp;D you choose.</p>
<p>Pathfinder is free and available online and the getting started section applied to most D&amp;D type games: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html" target="_blank">http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html</a></p>
<p>D&amp;D version 5e can be googled: d&amp;d 5e player's handbook pdf you can view the basic rules for free (TIL): <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules" target="_blank">http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules</a></p>
<p>Reading the first few section of either handbook will get you acquainted with the general way the game works. After that there are lots and lots of details. Pathfinder has a nice beginners box which simplies a LOT of the rules, but lets you get a good feel for how the game plays. If you choose to teach yourself and your friend, and you won't be joining an experienced table I highly recommend you start with this: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox" target="_blank">http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox</a></p>
<p>It will primarily allow you to PLAY the game instead of spending hours learning rules.</p>
<p>Once you have the general stuff like &quot;how do I hit things&quot; and &quot;how do I move around&quot; you'll want to decide what &quot;game&quot; you want to play. do you want to create your own world? author your own story? If so, the world is your oyster. You can craft a fantastical story and have your friend play through it with you. This is a very traditional approach, but it puts a lot of burden on the Game Master to create a story. If that's not your style there are TONS of already written Adventures for both D&amp;D 5e and pathfinder. You basically get to play through an RPG story. This is great if nobody you know is a good author, and will make some of the stuff easier to understand since monster stat blocks and things will be easier to understand.</p>
<p>After you get a feel for the rules and how it generally works, there are tons and tons of digital tabletop ways to play with people online. And lots of local game-stores host their own game nights, pathfinder has the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety" target="_blank">Pathfinder Society</a> which is a way to very much play Pathfinder like an RPG. I found it to be a great place to try different characters without having to commit to a full campaign. At the time when I played PFS I played a &quot;home game&quot; with friends with a long running story, and I would play a couple PFS games every month to try out different character classes etc. It was really fun. If you're looking to play D&amp;D like a MMO or RPG, PFS will give you a similar experience. If you are looking to play a huge fantastical story of your own creation, you probably want to read the rules and craft your own world. If you want something in between, checkout the pathfinder adventure paths or campaign settings.</p>
<p>I have only played d&amp;d 2, 3.5, and pathfinder. I have friends who've played 5e and claim it's simplier and easier to approach, but I don't know all the resources to dive into 5e. There are subreddits for each of these games though, with lots of info.</p>
<p>e: added link to basic rules for 5e</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My real advice would be to see if there's a group or club near you who would be happy to play with some newbies. There should be some people who are happy to run a game for you, or let you join a campaign. Look on facebook for groups in your nearest reasonably sized town.</p>
<p>However, the basic explanation:</p>
<p>You have a Dungeon Master (DM for short) who sets up a basic setting for a story. Some locations, characters, monsters and so on, and find some way to give the players a quest. This can be simple, for example, a major local figure has recruited you to go to a specific place and find a magic gem, or something. </p>
<p>The players create characters, with certain skills and abilities. The players say what they want to do. The DM decides whether to just let them do it, or whether they need to roll dice for it. The skills and abilities tend to add a number to the roll. </p>
<p>An important thing to understand is that the DM is running the game. He is not trying to defeat the players (that would be easy - rocks fall, everyone dies) but to create an interesting challenge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elementary particles are pointlike, as far as we can tell. But there are subatomic particles which are not elementary particles, for example atomic nuclei.</p>
<p>Nuclei come in various shapes and sizes. Of course they are quantum-mechanical objects so you have to be careful about how you define their &quot;shape&quot; and their &quot;size&quot;. But the details of doing that are not that important.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons inside a nucleus live in discrete orbitals, just like atomic electrons do. And just like there are &quot;special&quot; numbers where the electron shells fill up (noble gases), there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(physics\)" target="_blank">magic number</a> of nucleons which lead to enhanced nuclear stability.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you consider the structure of <em>doubly</em>-magic nuclei (both proton and neutron numbers are magic) like oxygen-16 and lead-208, they must be shaped like perfect spheres, and their sizes are small compared to other nuclei with similar mass numbers.</p>
<p>In the opposite extreme, you can have nuclei where the shell model orbitals are distorted or rearranged due to nuclear correlations far away from magic numbers. You can have cases where the outermost nucleons have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_nucleus" target="_blank">huge orbitals</a>.</p>
<p>A famous example of the first case is lead-208, and a famous example of the second case is lithium-11. These two nuclei, despite having hugely different mass numbers, have about the <strong>same size</strong>. It's because lead-208 is doubly-magic and lithium-11 is a halo nucleus.</p>
<p>Imagine nucleons as if they're inflated beach balls. How would you feel if I told you that I could arrange 11 beach balls and 208 beach balls such that they have the same size? It's very hard to picture this with classical objects like beach balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the particles are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles" target="_blank">identical particles</a> then they are indistinguishable even in principle.  This means that all of their features must be the same---they have the same charge, the same spin, the same mass, etc.  This <em>sounds</em> like somewhat of a trivial statement---of course if you can't tell them apart, they're indistinguishable!  The point is that <em>there are</em> indistinguishable particles.  That didn't have to be!  The world could have been made out of infinitely many fundamental ingredients, for example.  Or there could be many varieties of protons---protons that are striped (I don't mean literally visually striped), protons that are spotted, zig-zag protons, flannel protons, etc.  No.  We just see protons, and you can't &quot;tag&quot; a proton like you might tag a wild animal, so that when it goes out of sight and you encounter another one later you can be sure it's the same proton.  You cannot: protons are indistinguishable.</p>
<p>If you put a proton in a magnetic field, then its shape will distort.  But, <em>every proton distorts the same way</em>.  We believe fundamental particles like electrons and quarks to be point-like.  But if they ultimately have a finite size or are made of vibrating strings or whatever, each electron will be the same as every other electron, each up quark the same as every other up quark, each down quark the same as every other down quark, etc.</p>
<p>edit:  But it need not be the case that if we discover quarks have finite size that up quarks must have the same size as down quarks (for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This depends on how you define size. If you want to be analogous to the macroscopic world then yes, as others have answered, all particles appear point like, I.e. You can get as close to them as you like given enough energy. However, if you define size by how much energy it takes to approach, then size depends on the field created by the particle. For example, if you were probing a proton and a neutron with another proton, it would be a lot easier to get close to the neutron than the proton because of the equal charges of the proton. (This is a simplification because you obviously get particles that 'attract' each other I.e. With opposite charges and so you may be wondering if size is a quantity that depends on what you want to probe with) This leads to a definition of size that can be defined by the modulus of the field emitted by the particle. With this in mind, there are differences in sizes between different subatomic particles. An obvious example would be between the charge neutral neutron and a positively charged proton, but there are more exotic baryons with a quark composition such that they have a charge of 2 such as the double plus Delta (composed of 3 up quarks). This definition of size is not rigorous however; it is easier to consider particles as point like structures that emit properties.</p>
<p>You asked about some protons being larger than others, and while all protons are the same at ground level, when you give a particle more energy, it's wavefunction tends to get spread out. Think about how you were taught that atoms 'vibrate' more the more energy they were given (again this is a simplification, the real reason has to do with the uncertainty principle). This means that particularly energetic particles can be considered spatially 'larger' than lower energy equivalents, although this effect is very small for reasonable energies. </p>
<p>This being said, when you take combinations of particles, you can define a size much more easily. A good example of this comes when looking at the radius of an atom. If you go with a definition of radius based on a distance from the centre of the nucleus required to bring another atom such that both atoms interact, you can define an atomic radius based on the orbital distance of the furthest bound electron to the nucleus. If you remember your high school chemistry, orbiting electrons come in groups known as shells. A simplification of this leads to the conclusion that the larger the number of shells a particle has, the larger the radius of the furthest orbiting electron. However, this is a huge simplification as it does not take into account the fact that the larger the nuclear charge, the tighter electrons are 'pulled' towards the nucleus and so the smaller each electron shell radius is. </p>
<p>Hope this answers your question, at least partially. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a beautiful question because it really highlights the limits of science and what science really does. What science really does is come up with models of reality and then test them to see if they have predictive value. Electrons are defined as having zero volume. Clearly that doesn't make any sense. If something has zero volume, how can it have mass? How is it even a physical object? Great questions. But it doesn't matter in a sense, because the model works, and that's the goal. One can legitimately ask if there even are any electrons at all, objectively speaking, or whether there is anything in reality that corresponds to the particular idea of an electron you have in your head. </p>
<p>So are all these little particles the same? The truthful answer is nobody really knows. They're defined in the models as all being the same, because there's no need to define them differently. But are they really all the same? Are there even such discrete objects as electrons out there in nature, or are they just useful fictions in models? The reality may be much stranger than we imagine, despite the success of our models. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>As one increases salt content, the temperature of maximum density lowers, and <a href="http://sam.ucsd.edu/sio210/gifimages/rho_lows.gif" target="_blank">at salinity 24.7 PSU the temperature of maximum density equals the freezing point.</a>.</p>
<p>The water at the bottom of the ocean is cold, often below 4C.  This is mainly due to the fact the the ocean is cooled from the surface.  When ice begins to form it excludes the salt, so the surrounding water becomes more dense, sinks, and stops cooling.  This is one way deep ocean water forms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is essentially our memory of an event that allows us to form a perception of its duration. We subconsciously infer the duration of an event from our memory of how far in the past something occurred, of how long ago the beginning and end of the event occurred. </p>
<p>If an event or day is particularly novel, it will be encoded more strongly and be more present in the mind than an event or day where very few novel memories are formed (i.e. when you do the same things you always do repetitively), and so the perception of how long it took will be altered based on the extent and size of those novel memories.</p>
<p>This is true for remembering a day last week, or remembering just a few hours ago, or a few minutes.
All of that, including the feeling of slowness or fastness of time, is based on your awareness of the memories, and the attention you paid when you encoded them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you first drive to an unfamiliar location it always seems very long to get there but after driving the route for a while it feels shorter.  I believe it is your brain paying attention to everything the first time and storing that information which gets translated to your perception of time.  After driving it for a while your brain selects only the landmarks to pay attention to and so your perception of time becomes compressed.  While it does probably take less time after a while the difference is not as great as we perceive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Their RAM almost certainly is of the ECC variety, which is basically the same type of RAM technology as used in normal PCs, except they have an additional chip on them that calculates checksums, to ensure that no memory corruption goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>They usually use special motherboards that can hold 4 or more CPUs each, and often several hundred gigabytes of RAM. The CPUs they have often has a lot more cores than consumer models too. Intel's high-end server CPUs can have 18 cores each. However, if you really wanted to, you could still get one of these 18-core CPUs, put them on a motherboard with one single CPU socket, install windows and play counterstrike on it, if have more money than you have sense.</p>
<p>Several motherboards with several CPUs each are then connected together with an extremely high-speed network link.</p>
<p>In general, supercomputers operate in the same way as regular computers, but they're just hundreds, or thousands of semi-independent computers that are linked together into a cluster, and software written in a way that divides up the computing tasks into segments, and feeds a number of segments into each cluster node.</p>
<p>When it comes to storage, supercomputers don't typically require an enormous amount of actual storage. The actual data sets aren't necessarily extremely big in size, they just require extremely complex calculations to be performed on them.</p>
<p>If you have enormous computers that are mainly used to store enormous amounts of data, such as facebook storing every single picture and video anyone has uploaded, the term for these things are datacenters, not supercomputers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Super computers today consist of compute nodes, which are mostly like individual computers. Each node has a number of processors, with a number of cores, and their own RAM, and a couple network cards. There are nodes dedicated to the networking, essentially a switch or router, to ferry work and data to each compute node. The thing with the compute nodes is they're not stand alone, they're not each running their own operating system. The compute nodes have no need for video cards (though there may be some sort of primitive console access for diagnostics) or necessarily for hard drives (though there may be one as a cache).</p>
<p>So you can take your notion of ram and processors, and just multiply it by the number of nodes.</p>
<p>There are other characteristics, and that has to do with topology. This is an issue with your computer, too, about where CPU cache is, the memory controller, the north and south bridge, and other aspects. For a super computer, the complexity of connecting all these nodes becomes a significant factor. The technology may not exist to have a central dispatch to some 40,000 processors totaling some 10 million cores as exists in the current world's largest super computer. So there tends to be a number of hops and different routes so data can get from any processor to any processor as fast as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most of them use a cluster of individual nodes (~2x CPUs up to 32, ~minimum of 256 GB RAM, fabric interconnect, management/login networking) or build them into a monolithic, singly addressable pool of CPUs and RAM . So you would log in to some systems (I think SGI?) and you'd be presented with a couple hundred cores and terabytes of RAM. The separated nodes use a message passing interface or remotely and directly address the memory when the compiler and application running the processing is configured. This allows all the nodes to know every part of the workload and can communicate as one. The multiple interconnects are usually Infiniband, a custom interconnect (used by Cray and some others) or the faster ethernet (think 100 gigabit or higher) and require all of those connections are bonded together in order for that one node to not slow down the nodes in the current workload.</p>
<p>I hope I broke it down and kind of explained the reason for the RAM separation at least.</p>
<p>For HDD, they're usually hosted on large storage area networks which are an entire system dedicated to providing ones and zeros to the supercomputer cluster as fast as it can. These are usually whole server cabinets of drives or increasingly solid state storage. They then connect to the interconnect directly (or through filesystem servers (usually a dedicated supercomputer node) that manage the clustered storage  and have petabytes available in a high performance capacity directly through the nodes' interconnects.</p>
<p>I've touched on a couple implementations, as there are other ways and locations for storage to be accessed or physically stored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Supercomputers are mostly made of consumer parts.</p>
<p>A typical supercomputer is, in essence, a number of regular computers connected via a network. These are called nodes. Each node will have the usual processor speed, number of cores, ram. However, they usually use top of the line setup (ie 4x24 core setup, up to terrabytes of ram), but the specific setup depends on if it's set up for data heavy, memory heavy or CPU heavy tasks. The HDD is usually on a network and shared among these nodes, and is usually huge and set up for hugely parallel reads and writes, so files might take longer to open initially, but can have data firehosed into them.</p>
<p>The important extra parameter is the network. The speed and latency of the network is very important, as is the shape of the setup. Nodes that are close together, in some sense, might be directly connected, so messages sent between them are sent quickly. Nodes that are far apart might be indirectly connected, so messages need to make several &quot;hops&quot; to go from one to the other, meaning they're sent more slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
