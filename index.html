		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are not sterile people. You have many living communities of fungus and bacteria all over and inside of your body. We don't get sick because our immune systems prevent them from spreading out of control and forming an infection. Trust me, there are many bacteria and fungal spores growing in your mouth. </p>
<p>As long as you are healthy this isn't usually a problem. lets say you took antibiotics for a week though. It kills off the bacteria in your mouth, which kept the fungus in check, and you wake up one morning with a thick carpet of thrush growing on your tongue. It's yucky, but in that case the combination of killing the only competition the fungus had, and usually taking steroids like methylprednisone (which suppress your bodies immune response) results in the fungus being able to gain a foot hold in your mouth that's not normally present. </p>
<p>So the simple answer to your question is the bacteria on your tooth brush usually pale in comparison to the active colonies already in your mouth. The different bacteria and fungus in and around your mouth are in constant battle with each other, and with your immune system, and it's a stalemate with none of them gaining a foot hold. So long as you don't get weak, or upset the balance with drugs.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Bacteria on the toothbrush are adapted to living in the mouth so won't thrive on the toothbrush because it usually dries out and doesn't have much food on it (unless you never rinse it after use which would be kind of gross). This means the toothbrush won't grow enough bacteria to make you ill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, no.</p>
<p>First of all, there are many things that happen after fertilization that can cause or prevent a birth defect.</p>
<p>Second, for many congenital disorders, it's neither sperm alone nor the egg alone that determines whether the disorder will occur; you have to know both the sperm and the egg to know whether a disorder will occur.</p>
<p>Finally, you don't know which sperm will fertilize an egg, so anything that occurs in a small fraction of sperm can't easily be detected.</p>
<p>That said, there are some cases in which we can conclude from genetics of the parents that the fetus would almost certainly have a genetic disorder. </p>
<p>And there are some other cases where we can conclude from genetics of the parents that the fetus would probably have a genetic disorder, and in some of those cases we can test a fertilized egg to see if it has the disorder. In those cases, we can fertilize multiple eggs in the lab, pick one that doesn't have the disorder, and implant it in the uterus to produce a fetus without the disorder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>MAJOR problem is that each of these items is made up of a single cell and would be destroyed in the process of trying to read its genetic code.</p>
<p>This is why testing for genetic disorders are done after fetus has had a chance to grow and develop. There's more cells.</p>
<p>The other thing is I'm pretty sure we need more than one cell to pull out and map a whole genome anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some are present when one single marker is present.
Some need two.
Some need a specific combination of markers.</p>
<p>Some happen during development.</p>
<p>Some genes can be tested for by testing the parents.
Tay-Sachs is a disease that is fatal, and genetic. </p>
<p>It is passed through one mutation in one gene, the HEXA gene. If you have the mutation, and your partner has the mutation, there is a 25% chance the child will have Tay-Sachs. </p>

<p>Basically, unlike sperm cells, in which meiosis results in 4 sperm haploids cells, oogenesis results in one egg cell containing 2 polar bodies that are basically the residual genetic material from the remaining 3/4 of the original.</p>
<p>People can extract the polar body and sequence that to determine things about the egg's own nuclei without damaging the egg cell, and for now, is sometimes used to detect abnormal genetic copy-numbers. The technique is not entirely reliable, but it might be more related to OP's question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the PNW we very rarely use the seated back roll entry technique unless entering the water from a boat like a zodiac or similar. Usually we use a giant stride entry when entering from boats or docks. But the reason for the seated back roll is because when you're diving you have a lot of heavy and loose gear, and you want to be in control of it all and yourself the whole time. The seated back roll (SBR from now on) is really good for wrangling your hoses and accessories in front of you where it can all be held onto while at the same time holding the clasp of your weight belt. It also allows you to lead with the hardest heaviest and least fragile part of your body and gear: the tank. If say, a log floated up next to the boat while you were managing all your gear and getting ready to take a dip, and you didn't see it, when you roll backwards, your tank shields you from the blow of hitting the log from a small height with sometimes nearly 100 lbs of gear on top of you. It also serves to propeller you away from the boat quickly and with little effort. This way, you clear the boat, which may be bobbing up and down on rough seas, as well as allow someone else to enter behind you. It also serves to, usually, orient you facing the boat when you surface so you can signal the boat that you're OK and do not need assistance. Also, if the seas are you specially rough, your tank breaks the water for you so you don't get smacked in the face with an upswell right as the boat breaks the crest of the previous wave and you fall face first into it (no fun). </p>
<p>Tl;Dr - it's easier and safer than the alternatives sometimes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If they don't go back first, they go feet first. Both for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Out of the water, the tank is <strong>heavy</strong>. Imagine doing a belly flop while wearing a backpack full of cinder blocks. You hit the water, then the pack hits you. Ouch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hitting the water face first means you get the mask smacked into your face. Ouch again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some kinds of SCUBA gear will have bits extending behind your head. Going face first means you have a good chance of smacking the back of your head on them. Not fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you hit the water, you are less concerned about landing on the guy that is already in the water than you are about the next guy in line landing on <em>you</em>. Going back first means you can see what's going on above you and move if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>Lastly, sometimes shit happens and you need to quickly ditch your gear. If you are face down, you have to get out from under the stuff after you undo the buckles, risking getting something getting caught in a stray loop. Face up means everything is below you, thus much less risk of getting snagged.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One method is to take a step off the boat into the water - this works well when your boat has a platform that you can step straight off of into the water. If you're trying to enter the water over a gunwale going forwards, your flippers will get in the way, making it difficult to smoothly enter the water. Instead, divers sit on the gunwale, which allows them to smoothly lean back into the water, rather than making an awkward forward step over the gunwale.</p>
<p>Sitting on the gunwhale also helps ensure you won't hit your tank or head against anything as you enter the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. The perception is that tenure among jobs is much lower these days tends to come because people are comparing different age groups.</p>
<p>If you compare the same age group (say 25-34) from the 50's to now, it's basically flat. Basically, younger workers switch jobs more often than older workers, which is easy to misinterpret.</p>
<p>*
One big disclaimer, however, is that the BLS (the agency that collects this data), did change how they asked the question in 1983, and again in 1996.So you do need to be a bit careful about comparing them directly. However it's basically the only source that goes back that far.</p>
<p>There may be other issues as well. For example, women entering the workforce, and people being much less likely to move around than in the past, likely influence things.</p>
<p>sources:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebri.org/pdf/notespdf/ebri_notes_12-dec10.tenure-cehcs.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ebri.org/pdf/notespdf/ebri_notes_12-dec10.tenure-cehcs.pdf</a></p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/enough-already-about-the-job-hopping-millennials/" target="_blank">https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/enough-already-about-the-job-hopping-millennials/</a></p>
<p>As the 538 article mentions, there have been a lot of publications that make the mistake of comparing different age groups, which tends to create the impression. It's also common wisdom that less pensions give more incentive for workers to switch jobs (and it's known that switching jobs more often correlates to higher salary)</p>
<p>Also, LinkedIn did a survey and found that millenials are changing jobs more often than older workers did when younger, but I would consider the older survey data far more trustworthy than the recollection of people interviewed by LinkedIn so much later.</p>
<p><strong>tldr: It doesn't look like it, although there aren't buckets of old data.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just white collar, but blue collar employees as well.</p>
<p>My perception may be (ok probably is) skewed due my personal anecdotal observations. I dunno if it's fair to say &quot;the majority&quot; stayed at their &quot;first employer&quot; but there was definitely by my observation a time when many workers tended to settle down with one employer and expect to work there for life.</p>
<p>My father, as one example, was a WWII vet, who retired from the Navy after 20 years in 1962. He then had 3-4 different jobs in as many years before landing solid work in a steel mill. He expected to work there for the rest of his life. In reality, not quite -- around 1981 the mill shut down, which was the only thing that forced him to move to another employer.</p>
<p>My best friend's father as a kid worked at a local stone quarry. I can remember how proud he was ~ 1985 when he showed us his 25 year gift from his employer -- a gold Rolex President watch. He was not a white collar worker, he was a stone cutter. And they gave him a solid gold Rolex after 25 years.</p>
<p>As another example, an uncle of mine worked for Boeing -- I guess you'd say he was white collar, he was an engineer there. Like my father, he had served in WWII and Korea, but left the military in the 50s to get a college education (thank you GI Bill!) and find work in the private sector. He also had a few jobs before settling in at Boeing, but once there, he was basically a &quot;lifer.&quot; So much so that both of his sons went to work for Boeing and both also expected to be lifers there. Although they were not -- both of them had less than 10 years at Boeing before they were (separately) laid off in the 90s.</p>
<p>It seems to me that today neither employees nor employers see one another as long-term commitments.</p>

<p>First, I doubt that most pets <strong>always</strong> look up, they usually move their heads around all the time. Also dogs and cats can look up without moving their heads, since their eyes are on top of the head.</p>
<p>Second, most animals have stronger, more versatile necks than humans, since they (or their ancestors) need to catch quick/small animals in order to survive. Just play catch with a dog and a ball and see what kind of stunts they pull off with their necks. Just look at <a href="https://cloud.graphicleftovers.com/17807/1259255/dachshund-dog-look-up.jpg" target="_blank">this neck</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I've also personally had a beagke/dachshund mix with spinsl problems that ended their life. Her vet described it as relatively common due to the small stature vs the size of steps and other  or all human-sized objects. So it's not unreasonable to think arthritis and similar issues have a correlation to the size of our pets vs their environment. </p>
<p>Otherwise, I would have to think the answer to this is yes, if indeed they spend a majority of their time looking up at you - which they probably don't. You don't find people out of sorts for looking at the sky, which happens all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most animals are moving around or laying on their back when they look at us, very rarely do you see a dog craning its neck to get a good look at something. Yeah they can strain muscles but most animals are not dumb like people. A person will lean over the edge of something while trying to screw in a light and end up wrenching a half dozen muscles. People will hurt themselves to get something done because they can weigh the consequences. If a dog is bending at some funny angle and it starts to hurt, the dog stops. Animals won't knowingly endanger themselves unlike us. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, cosmic particles pass through the LHC all the time. They're not accelerated around the loop, since the configuration of the magnets has been finetuned specifically for the path taken by the particles inserted into the LHC by the experiment itself. Cosmic particles come in from a completely different direction and while they can be affected by the magnetic fields in the ring, this will only change their direction, it won't &quot;catch&quot; them into a circular path.</p>
<p>Cosmic particles may also interact with one of the detectors placed along the LHC ring. When this happens and the detector is turned on, the particle is registered very much in the same way that particles are registered during normal operation. </p>
<p>But there are important differences. Only part of the cosmic particles actually make it 100m into the ground to reach the detector. Part of the particle types are absorbed by the Earth before they can reach far enough into the ground. The next difference is due to the design of the detectors. They're designed to envelop the LHC beam and the most sensitive equipment is located very close to the beam. But cosmic particles come in from above and have to cross through the outer layers of the detector first.</p>
<p>So the impact of a cosmic particle on an active detector is quite different from a normal detection event. However, cosmic particles (or &quot;cosmics&quot; in short) have been very useful in helping scientists to benchmark and finetune the detector before normal operation.</p>
<p>Read more about this in the newspost from the CMS experiment (one of the large LHC detectors) from 2 years ago (when the LHC was on an extended break from normal operations):

<ol>
<li>There is no really good candidates for president at all in Russia. There are 4-5 people in opposition, that tries to become a president from 1991, I think :) but their political view is blurry or outdated. There is no another really strong leader, only Putin. I think USA have the same problem - no good candidates at all. Or I am wrong?</li>
<li>Putin have a higher legal education and 40 years of working experience in government. I think it matters. Very seriously. I don't want oligarch, doctor or football player to rule my country.</li>
<li>He never said anything I am not supporting (as I can remember), I share his vision on solving country problems.</li>
<li>Maybe it's strange, but for me and for many other people he is a part of every family. Why? Because we know him for many years :)</li>
<li>My life is good, really good. Though, I am invalid (Haemophilia A). I receive all needed medicines for free every month (in pharmacy they costs 8000 dollars every month). I have my own apartments, small business and lovely family. In February I will become a father :) Why I should want to change my president? Government supports me, not preventing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, we have problems, but every country has them and I don't know anybody better, who can solve it. Only Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich :)</p>
<p>Maybe it is hard to understand, until you become living here in Russia, but it is so. No authoritarianism, real support of president.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Separation of church and state is a shorthand phrase that we use. There's no law about it on the book. The law we do have is the First Amendment, which states that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&quot; Let's unpack that text. </p>
<p>First, the idea of establishment. In the 18th Century, establishment refers to the idea of the creation and promotion of a single church backed by the state and given special privileges. Most European countries had established churches (Catholicism in many of the continental countries, the Church of England in the British Isles, etc.). Most of the colonies had their own established churches as well and either supported them legally and financially or restricted other religious activity or both. Only a handful of the middle colonies (most prominently Pennsylvania) practiced religious freedom and disestablishment. </p>
<p>The First Amendment prohibited <em>Congress</em> from making laws about establishment to prevent the Federal government from establishing a single national religion at the expense of the religions practiced in the several states. Although they may seem to be mostly the same to us today, in contemporary practice, there were huge theological differences between the Anglicans in the South, the Catholics of Maryland, the Quakers of Pennsylvania, the Congregationalists and Puritans of New England and so on. The Amendment was designed to protect the rights of the several states to practice and support their own chosen religions. On the state level, there was no separation of church and state and there was never intended to be any. </p>
<p>Second, we have the issue of &quot;prohibiting the free exercise thereof&quot;. This accomplishes a similar task to the first part of the amendment, and basically prevents Congress from outlawing or restricting the religious practices of certain groups or sects. It applies more to individuals than the things I talked about above and prevents Congress doing an end run around the states and abolishing certain practices of individual sects.</p>
<p>That's the Constitutional side of it, but that's not the whole issue. </p>
<p>As you can see, there prohibitions on government action are actually quite narrow. There's no prohibition on what government officers can say or do regarding religion in a private capacity. There's no restriction on how religious beliefs and practices can influence government policy except insofar as there is a prohibition on explicitly backing a single religious sect's practices and giving them the backing of the national government. For all of American history, religious beliefs have informed the creation of laws on both the national and the state level and most of the time most people have been generally okay with it.</p>
<p>America has always been a generally religious place and our traditions reflect that. You're asking about the use of the Bible and other religious symbols in the Presidential inauguration ceremony. There's no hard and fast rule — we do it because its tradition. In this case the tradition was established by George Washington. He swore the oath of office on a Bible because it was (and still is) common practice to swear oaths with one's hand on a Bible as a show of ones sincerity. It demonstrates that you believe that your promise will not only be enforced by the other people who witness it, but by God himself.</p>
<p>There's no reason why a President couldn't swear the oath without a Bible. In fact, several presidents have not. For instance, John Quincy Adams and Franklin Pierce both swore on a book of laws, symbolizing their allegiance to the Constitution above all else. </p>
<p>I'll stop there, since this is detailed enough. If you want, though, I can go into detail about the &quot;American Civil Religion&quot; — the historical and sociological idea that throughout American history we have been united by a quasi-religious faith in destiny of the United States and our place as God's chosen people. Hidden throughout American political rhetoric, writing, art, and history you can find glimpses of this civil faith — which coexists with and feeds off of sectarian faiths. For instance, every time you hear a President say &quot;And may God bless the United States of America&quot; they aren't making an appeal to a single sectarian God, but rather to the divine figure who serves as protector and guide of the United States in the ACR. The inauguration itself is a civil religious ceremony, with prayers, hymns, and other vestiges of a church service. It's all very fascinating, whether or not you believe in it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since the thread is locked for some reason, I'll answer you here /u/Hawke666. </p>
<p>I'm not clear on the particulars, but you are correct that since the founding, the establishment clause as well as other parts of the First Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the states as well as the federal government. Formal establishment of religion was done away with in the states by the mid-19th Century when the last states did away with the practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's clear up some misconceptions. This answer only applies to USA, and my source is that I'm a judicial clerk who has formally been sworn-in to serve the Constitution. I watch people get sworn in every day.</p>
<p>No one in any courtroom or public swearing-in must &quot;swear&quot; on a bible. </p>
<p>How oaths must be administered are usually codified in the revised code of each state (check yours if you're shockingly bored!). Nearly every oath-administration statute specifically holds that one may say &quot;I do affirm&quot; instead of &quot;I do swear&quot; and that you can substitute &quot;this you do as you shall answer under the pains and penalties of perjury&quot; instead of &quot;so help you God.&quot; Rarely is there any requirement to swear on anything at all, and never only a bible.</p>
<p>This is codified by law, and gives jurors/witnesses/public officials the choice.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, I've never seen a judge use a bible for swearing in. My judge, who is a religious man, doesn't even ask &quot;so help you God&quot; and asks if they &quot;swear or affirm&quot; by default. Also, nearly every judge takes a simple &quot;I do&quot; instead of the formal &quot;I do affirm.&quot; No one swears or affirms on anything - they just raise their right hands.</p>
<p>As far as presidential inagurations are concerned - again there's the choice to do so. George Washington set the tradition by swearing on a bible (and the origin for the legality of a public official doing this is rooted in &quot;tradition&quot;). John Q. Adams, on the other hand, swore on a book of law (as did I). </p>
<p>The more direct and controversial question is: why do we even allow the choice of swearing-in on religious objects or with religious undertones? The Constitutional answer is likely that it's a harmless tradition dating back hundreds of years into our British ancestry and that a neutral option must be provided by law. It's understood that public servants must serve the public (duh), but they don't magically have their religion removed from their bodies when they become a government official. They swear, specifically, to serve the public and swearing on their religious text doesn't change the words of the oath but intensifies the meaning of the oath by staking THEIR IMMORTAL SOUL on serving the public. But really it's just window-dressing formality with enough tradition behind it to sneak under the Constitutional rigors of the Establishment Clause. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As one of the other respondents mentioned, almost all of the original colonies were religious states.  The New England colonies were Congregationalist/Puritan, the Southern colonies were Anglican, Maryland was Catholic.  You could be exiled or jailed for having dissenting religious views.  Only Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Rhode Island (off the top of my head) had anything close to what we consider religious freedom, and they were all founded by <em>people like the</em> Quakers who have a strong doctrine of people being free to follow &quot;the light within&quot; and Baptist who have strong thoughts about only having believers in church.  </p>
<p>Separation of church and state in the federal government was pushed through by the leading cultural elites like Thomas Jefferson, who were deists or otherwise non-conforming religiously, and the evangelical revivalists, like the Baptist and the Methodists, who wanted to be able to proselytize in other colonies without fear of being imprisoned for it.  </p>
<p>Even though that was accepted, <em>all of the colonies with religious laws kept those laws</em>.  Depending on how you want to count things, the last state to disestablish religion was either Massachusetts (people required to attend parish churches until 1834), North Carolina (only Christians can hold office until 1876), or Utah (admitted to the union as a state in 1896 on the condition of not being a theocracy anymore).  </p>
<p>Source:  am American religions prof.</p>
<p>Further info:  the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/view/" target="_blank">PBS documentary &quot;God in America&quot;</a> does a great job of explaining this and streams free online.</p>
<p>ETA:  some folks are complaining that this still doesn't answer the question.  Let me flesh this out a bit more.  You have a society based on British culture with an established religion in the early America.  The Brits swear on the Bible, so we do too.  With established religion and the super-traditionalism of the courts, there's NO way that's going to change.  And state-established religion lasted a lot longer then most people think it did.  In the super-traditional world of the courts (where you can still get kicked out for not wearing a suit and such), that's not very long ago at all.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  Yes, I fucked up by saying the Middle colonies were mostly Quaker.  I haven't had my second cup of coffee yet, thank you for notifying me.  I fixed it.</p>
<p>Edit 3:  GOLD?  Wow!  Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Separation of Church and State means that the government cannot prohibit the religious activity of a person, or require it. But it does not mean that religious actions cannot be involved. We require people to swear an oath, and for most people that is a religious action. As such they have the right to swear upon any religious text. They also have the right to swear upon any book of US law, a copy of the constitution, or any other document they find significant enough to give weight to their oath. </p>
<p>Edit: I left out the option to Affirm Intent which the non-religious can use as well. This is the same legal binding of an Oath with none of the religious overtones. I added this further in the thread chain but many keep reminding me here so I am putting in the edit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a tradition, not a requirement to swear on the bible. It's just symbolic of your sincerity to swear upon a symbol of something you truly care about. As an example, Rep. Keith Ellison swore in on on the Quran, his book of faith.</p>
<p>We're basically taking you at face value that you are so dedicated to your word that you would swear to it while holding your most prized possession.</p>
<p>The important thing actually isn't the book. Even if books were of no importance to you, you must still swear to uphold yourself within the confines of the constitution. Should you go out of bounds of your duty, you can be impeached, regardless of what you swore on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's one estimate. Ever notice how people turn down the volume of music in their car when they're driving to a new area or looking for a location? I've read that this can be described as an intentional reduction of stimulus used in order to improve focus. In fact, I turned down my music half way through writing that sentence. Perhaps in the same way when you're trying to think of something, you look off to the side to try and ignore whatever is in your visual field while you focus on searching for that info within your brain!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We do this to reduce stimulus so we can focus better. When your eyes look left or right you are making your field of view smaller thus reducing the amount of stimulus you receive from your visual field. This allows for more processing power to be used in whatever mental task you're attempting like remembering something or calculating a math problem. We will also look in different directions depending on the type of mental task because many mental tasks majorly occupy either the right or left half of our brain and our visual fields are mostly split in the same way. </p>
<p>Example: for most people language is majorly located on the left half of your brain. If you're struggling to remember a word you might look to your left. This decreases the amount of light that can enter your right visual field. Everything in your right visual field is usually sent to your left brain (confusing I know) so by reducing the amount of stimulus received in the right visual field you send less signals to the left brain allowing for more processing power and better focus on remembering the word. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The human brain has an amazing capacity of distinguishing between faces, but it comes at a cost of a lot of attention and focus required when looking at that person.The brain is almost captivated by their face. </p>
<p>Looking away breaks this captivation and makes it much easier to remember by focusing more on the story rather than the person's face that you're talking to. Turning the head would to the side would focus on the face even less helping you focus even better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
