		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen them both ways. </p>
<p>In general, doors that open to hallways are put in so they don't swing into the hallway. It's a safety issue; you don't want to hit someone. </p>
<p>Having the entrance a push makes it easier for you to enter the bathroom without contaminating the door if you are going in to wash something off of them. </p>
<p>Push doors have the hinges and lock on the inside, so you can't be locked in.</p>
<p>Many public bathrooms also tend to have drinking fountains, closets, or other utilities near them; having the door open outward makes the wall there dead space. This is more important in a corridor, less so in a bathroom section which is likely just a corner anyway. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh! I can answer this! </p>
<p>I recently started a job in HVAC engineering (kids, avoid this industry if you have a mechanical engineering degree). Typically the air that's pumped into rooms (supply air) gets there via diffusers. Once the air is there it needs to get out of the room so it can either reheat or cool down again. That's where returns come in. Returns are typically just an opening in the tile ceiling, or in the case or a restaurant just an opening on the back of the HVAC unit.</p>
<p>A tenant space is designed to have neutral or slightly positive pressure. That way opening/closing doors isn't a hassle, among other reasons. If it's slightly positive it'll keep cold air from getting in during the winter months when an outside door is opened.</p>
<p>Bathrooms are a bit different since that air is smelly and gross and no one wants that air getting into their space. An exhaust fan that vents to the roof is put in the bathrooms. The return air in the bathroom does not even mix with the other return air. The exhaust fan's cfm (cubic feet per minute, the unit of measurement used to describe the volume of air put into the space in a certain amount of time) is typically 50-100 depending on the size of the bathroom. The supply cfm to the bathroom is typically 35-80. This puts the bathroom at a negative pressure, which keeps the nasty are inside the bathroom. </p>
<p>What does this have to do with doors? Well when you enter the bathroom and you push the door IN that pulls the clean air into the bathroom while pushing the dirty air into the bathroom. When you leave and you pull the door, same effect. It's all about keeping the dirty air within the bathroom.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why don't all restaurant bathroom doors have that foot handle where you can pull it open with your foot. Makes it so much easier.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not 100% correct, as expected. It actually has to do with the egress of the door swings and other accessibility concerns. Neat!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s how to use the bathroom in the most sanitary manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do not use the urinal to pee. Urine splashes back on you.  So stand as far back from the urinals as possible and just let loose like a fire hose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The better option for maximum sanitariness is to use the stall.  Kick open the door.  Seat down?  Don’t touch it.  Stand as far away as possible again.Pee all over it.  Then kick the flush.  Or don’t flush. Don’t worry about breaking anything because fuck everyone.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands for 2 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>Dry your hands with the paper towels, use towel to open door, throw your filthy towel on the ground.  </li>
</ol>
<p>You are now the cleanest most sanitary person in the world.  Enjoy your day touching knobs and money and hand rails that are all perfectly germ free.  Not like that gross bathroom with piss everywhere and dirty towels on the floor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitions vary according to context.  The definitions that I use are:</p>
<p>An 'antibiotic' is a naturally-produced compound that specifically kills microorganisms, usually bacteria.  Examples would be penicillin, tetracycline, etc.</p>
<p>An 'antibacterial' is a synthetic compound that specifically kills bacteria (an 'antimicrobial' would kill microorganisms).  Examples would be ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, etc.</p>
<p>An 'antiseptic' is a compound that kills all living cells.  Examples would be bleach (hypochlorous acid), ammonia, alcohol, etc.</p>
<p>That is, the specificity is important.  Antiseptics kill more than just bacteria, so they often are as useful as a medical treatment.  That is, you can take penicillin for an ear infection and it won't hurt your cells... but you can't drink a bottle of bleach for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Other people use different definitions.  I've heard people claim that an antibiotic is specifically a medicine.  So, for example, triclosan (the most common 'antibacterial' in antibacterial soap) is not an antibiotic because it is not used as a medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The previous commenters have done a nice job of explaining why your phone is laggy, but I wanted to really address the question of whether temperature can slow down electricity. </p>
<p>The short answer is yes, and electricity will generally be &quot;faster&quot; at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>To understand this, think about DC electricity like bumper cars. You're an electron, in a bumper car, trying to move from point A to point B. But there are other bumper cars, representing the atoms of the material you're traveling in (like copper) not traveling from A to B, but instead staying in one area, moving back and forth. The temperature of a material essentially represents how fast these other cars are moving. You are experiencing a constant acceleration in one direction (coming from the voltage), but you might bounce around off of these cars.</p>
<p>If you are trying to get to point B as fast as possible, you want to bump as few cars as possible. This will be easiest when the cars are moving slowly, so you are less likely to hit them. If you don't hit any cars, that's fastest you can go under that voltage. This is called &quot;ballistic transport&quot; because you are moving like a projectile instead of bouncing around. Thus, at lower temperatures, you get closer to ballistic transport. Additionally, as you increase the voltage, the electrons will travel faster, until you reach the saturation velocity for the material. You can think of speed in terms of the resistance of the material when considering only one electron.</p>
<p>Now, if you get hot enough to form a plasma, the rules change, but that's neither here nor there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The speed of propagation of a electromagnetic wave (which electrical signals are) in a medium is given by the formula 1 / sqrt (mu * epsilon), where mu is the magnetic permeability and epsilon is the electric permittivity. Each of those constants have nonzero values in a vacuum, and if you plug in the values of those constants in a vacuum you'll get the speed of light (it's actually super easy and incredibly insightful to do so)!</p>
<p>Since we have nonzero vacuum values of those constants, we will usually define the permeability and permittivity of a medium relatively, e.g. as a fraction of the vacuum value of its respective constant. For copper, the relative permeability is 1. The relative permittivity of the copper itself is actually mostly irrelevant for the calculation, and instead we must consider the permittivity of the surrounding medium, which is the plastic sheathing. That's about 2.5 on average, which means our average relative speed of propagation is 2/3c (in other words, when you flip on a light switch, the lightbulb will begin to turn on after the amount of time it would take for that wave, traveling two thirds the speed of light, to travel along the wire from the switch to the bulb).</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we can answer your question. Relative permeability of copper is probably not going to vary significantly with temperature. There are materials that exhibit extreme changes to their permeability at super low temperatures (look into superconductors), but those are an edge case. Relative permittivity can actually vary quite a bit with temperature,  but only in materials with permanent dipoles, of which rubber is not. </p>
<p>So, we can say that changing temperature will probably not significantly affect the speed of propagation of an electrical signal. If your signal is propagating in an unusual material, it might, but for electricity moving through a wire, 2/3c is generally a safe bet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not quite sure about the actual &quot;speed&quot; of the electrons, if that is what is meant by &quot;speed of electricity&quot;, but from a materials perspective, the resistivity (the quantity &quot;slowing down&quot; the electricity) of a conductor is temperature dependent. Generally, for metals, resistivity increases with increasing temperature. Thus, increasing temperature will make it harder for electricity to flow and vice versa, so you would get a lower current for the same applied voltage. However, this also means that when your phone is &quot;laggy&quot; in the cold, the electrical resistance should be decreased and thus have the possibility of a higher electrical flow, so it is unlikely that the cold slowing down the electricity is the cause of the laggy speeds. It is worth noting that general ambient temperature range where you would be using an electronic device is relatively small and probably only going to have a very small effect on the resistivity of the conductors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Salt and sugar does the same thing - draw water away, or make the water too salty/sugary for bacteria to live in it.</p>
<p>Things that change the acidity kind of does the same thing - they make the water inhospitable, so the bacteria can't live in it.</p>
<p>You can also make a mix of the two, using a bit of vinegar and a bit of sugar.</p>
<p>Drying something also takes away the water.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is what is done with jellies and jam and fruit preserve and a lot of other things - olives too.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing that's different from all of these only works on things that are sterile - you can cover the outside in something that's toxic.</p>
<p>The toxic thing can be a mold, strangely enough - because the mold makes toxins to protect itself, so other bacteria and molds can't survive. But it means you have to cut the outside away when you want to use it, and then you can't leave it, because you've opened a door for bacteria and different molds to &quot;enter&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camembert is like this - the outer layer is a living mold that kills everything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>The toxic thing can also be residue from smoke  because the thin outer layer is toxic, the bacteria can't enter. We can take a big bite of it, though, because the layer is very thin, so there's not enough toxin to affect us.</p>

<p>Another very common preservative what I don't see mentioned is acid.  Low pH also prevents microbes from growing - particularly dangerous ones.  This is one reason why you will see anything from baby food to beverages to mayonnaise with acid added especially citric, phosphoric, vinegar, lemon juice, and a favorite ascorbic (aka vitamin C). PH is also a primary reason that beer and wine cannot harbor pathogens although alcohol helps a lot with that too. </p>
<p>Speaking of which alcohol is a great preservative and is primarily reason homemade (highly alcoholic) eggnog won't kill you even if it's kept in a bottle for weeks or months. </p>
<p>The preservatives you may be asking about are chemicals like potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate which prevent microbes from growing via chemical means. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since there are no comments yet I'll add one (bioanthropology BSc, skeletal biology courses in my undergrad, but not my current focus).</p>
<p>I'm just going to throw out that it probably depends a lot on diet. People who file their teeth and eat a lot of sugar will be a lot more vulnerable to acid-producing bacteria than people who don't eat a lot of sugar. For example, in Inuit cultures (IIRC) women would strip leather straps with their incisors and that lead to characteristic wearing down in the front teeth. However, high Arctic diets have traditionally been low in refined grains and sugars and moreso comprised of animal and marine protein sources. In that kind of context it's easy to see that while the vulnerability of the teeth may have been increased by wear, sugar-eating bacteria that we traditionally associate with tooth damage and dental disease are probably less likely to have as much as an impact in that population compared to other populations. </p>
<p>Dental wear varies by culture because (moreso in the past) people used their teeth as tools in different ways (perhaps not intentional filing, but using teeth as tools is usually how characteristic wear patterns occur in different cultures). However, as far as I know the greatest increases in dental disease came with the rise of agriculture and the transition from hunting-gathering to grain-based diets (due both to increased carbohydrate consumption and likely also malnutrition due to reduced dietary complexity and poorer immune reaponses as a result). Dietary disease is still very present in the world today and periodontitis has actually increased in prevalence in the modern era due to smoking, the use of birth control, and high-sugar diets despite other advances in dental technology. People nowadays eat a TON of refined sugars compared to people in the past (though I believe the addition of flouride to drinking water has helped tremendously). So it's kind of relative; people who file their teeth and expose the dentine make their teeth more vulnerable to erosion and bacterial attack but they may have low rates compared to a smoker who eats a high sugar diet and lives in a place without flouride added to the water. I think it depends, but technically scraping enamel away should make a person's teeth more vulnerable to the agents of disease (understanding how those agents of disease interact with a person will determine who has &quot;greater&quot; rates of disease moreso than the state of their teeth, because worn teeth does not automatically equate to pathology).</p>

<p>One requires more muscle mass. More muscle mass can generate more force. When you lift a weight you can slowly activate more muscles fibres contraction generating more and more force until it is enough to start lifting the object.</p>
<p>Running on the other hand is a very complex movement. You constantly change multiple different muscles between contraction and relaxation. And there is an upper limit how fast you can do this, as this requires actual chemical processes (besides the bio-electrical processes from neurons firing signals) within the muscles to achieve the contraction and relaxation processes in constant exchange. </p>
<p>There are different muscles that can do those processes faster, and you can also train them to a certain degree on a bio-electrical and chemical level to do those actions faster, but at some point you reach the chemical limit for the muscles to do that action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are no Olympic weightlifters that squat 1200lbs. There have been only a handful of powerlifters who have ever squatted over 1200, wearing multi-ply lifting suits. Olympic weightlifting does not compete the squat. Olympic lifters routinely squat 2-3.5x their bodyweight in training, with the heaviest in common knowledge at almost 800lbs.</p>
<p>Smaller lifters have a proportionately higher ceiling on their strength. The world record squat for a 123lb lifter is more than 5x, but the 308lb class record is just under 3x. This trend is mirrored in relative speed among different size animals, as well. The fastest animal on Earth is the Tiger Beetle, running almost 125 body lengths per second. They’re so fast they go functionally blind while in motion. I guess that opens a whole new list of interesting questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The best cyclists can sprint at 70kmh and they require around 2,000 watts of power to travel at that speed. An average untrained person should probably be able to do at least half that speed, 35kmh but at that speed they only need 250 watts.</p>
<p>That's about 8 times the power required to travel at twice the speed.</p>
<p>On a bicycle at least, doubling the power of the rider will usually lead to an increase in speed of only around 30%.</p>
<p>In the case of Usain Bolt, while he may be running twice as fast as an untrained runner he would be producing far more than twice the amount of power with most of that power going towards overcoming air resistance.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A well fed fish is less likely to eat other fish. However, this isn't always the case and many predator type fish will in fact go after anything they can fit in their mouth. When stocking predator aquariums you do have to be careful to stock compatible tank mates, otherwise, you risk other fish/shrimp becoming a meal. Lionfish, eels, groupers are examples of saltwater fish where this applies and I've seen cichlids in freshwater eat tank mates as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A CPU can only work on stuff in its cache and the RAM of the device (be it PC / Mac / console / mobile / etc). However, such memory is volatile, and loses all its data if it is not powered. To solve this problem, secondary storage exists: hard disk drives, DVD drives, USB disks, flash memory, etc. They hold persistent data that is then transferred to the RAM as and when needed, to be worked on by the CPU. </p>
<p>Now, when a computer boots up, a lot of its core processes and functions are pre loaded into RAM and kept there permanently, for regular usage. (The first of this stuff that loads is known as the <em>kernel</em>.) They are also heavily dependent on each other; eg, the input manager talks to the process scheduler and the graphics and memory controllers when you press a button. Because these are so interconnected, shutting one down to update it is not usually possible without breaking the rest of the OS' functionality*.</p>
<p>So how do we update them? By replacing the files <em>on disk</em>, not touching anything already in memory, and then rebooting, so that the computer uses the new, updated files from the start. </p>
<p>*In fact, Linux's OS architecture and process handling tackles this modularity so well that it can largely update without a restart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only correct answer is that it is simply easier to treat the code as immutable, and restart the program whenever you want to change the code. It is more than possible to design systems, even operating systems or other low level programs which don't need to be rebooted in order to update(this concept is called 'hot swapping'), but it is harder to design those systems and sometimes also harder to reason about their correctness. Imagine it this way: Rebooting to update software is like putting a car into a garage and upgrading the engine. Doing a live update is like upgrading your engine while you are going down the highway at 65mph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That entirely depends on the system, and what is being updated.</p>
<p>Linux can largely be updated with no restarting required, but that's because it can disable individual sections of the system, update them, then turn them back on.</p>
<p>Windows can't do this, so it needs rebooting for system updates because it can't change files that are in use (typically anyway).</p>
<p>As far as consoles, I'm not sure, since the PS3/4 have a <del>Linux</del> FreeBSD backend so they <strong><em>can't</em></strong> hot patch, while the Xbox and Nintendo systems I've got no experience with so I can't really say.</p>
<p>I'm sure someone will give a vastly more in depth reason though.</p>
<p>[Edit] Updated as /u/blue_collie pointed out PS3/4 are FreeBSD not Linux backends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Windows places locks on files in use.  The reasoning is you don't want to open a file, make changes but not save, and then have something else make changes to the file and save them.  Because when you do save the file, you'll overwrite the changes made by the other process.  So when your computer is on, a lot of system files are locked.  If windows needs to make changes to one in a patch, it'll set a flag and upon reboot, make the change since the file will no longer be in use at that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work on Windows, so I can speak a bit as to why the xbox needs this.</p>
<p>Windows requires rebooting because of a few key OS processes that cannot be simply replaced and restarted. For instance, lsass.exe, which is responsible for logging you in and taking care of lots of security &quot;stuff&quot;, cannot be shut down and replaced at runtime. This could, possibly, be fixed. However, untangling the dependencies and sorting things out safely would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>There were so many things on Windows that would be a lot easier if back-compat wasn't so important. However, we always had to be sure the last 20+ years of applications would run after any changes. This makes things a bit tricky at times, to say the least :)</p>
<p>The reboot pain is understood, and that's why new features have been added over time to help make things easier. &quot;Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart.&quot; is one such baby step.</p>
<p>edit 1: Sorry if it wasn't obvious, but I'm talking about Windows because xbox runs Windows.</p>
<p>edit 2: Also, if the hypervisor is being patched, a reboot is almost always needed. Reliably hot patching the hypervisor is possible, but it's much simpler to reboot when applying hypervisor updates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
