		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Upper management at most large corporations typically get their compensation in 3 different ways. Compensation packages will often include all three, with additional variations on some.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Salary. This is self explanatory. Believe it or not, most C-level executives have salaries that are not outrageous. $1 million in salary is not unexpected for even a fortune 100 company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance bonuses. The board will set annual performance goals for the company based on projections, market trends, expectations, wishful thinking, etc... In order to incentivize performance, managers will often share a fraction of performance above the goal. For example, if the board sets a target for $1 billion in pre-tax earnings, they may offer 10% of anything beyond that as an incentive. If the company posts $1.1 billion in pre-tax earnings, the company exceeded shareholder expectations by $100 million; of this, the executives would split $10 million in bonuses.</p>
</li>
<li>Stock options. Stock options give the option owner the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a predetermined number of stocks from a specific seller at a predetermined price. A stock option may also give the option owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a predetermined number of stocks to a specific buyer at a predetermined price.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stock options often account for the bulk of executive compensation, especially during periods of economic growth. For example, On January 1st 2015 I am given the option to purchase from my employer to purchase on January 1st 2017, 100 shares at $10 each. If the value of a share on the open market is more than $10 on January 1st 2017, the stock option is valuable and should be executed. If the value of a share on the open market is less than $10 on January 1st 2017, the stock option is worthless. Once exercised, the stocks can be sold on the open market, or kept for voting rights and dividends.</p>
<p>During &quot;bad times&quot;, executives will draw their salaries, but the bulk of their compensation will be derived from performance bonuses. These performance bonuses will be geared towards keeping the company afloat, such as keeping losses below a certain threshold, or minimising capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Just for clarity, when management is substantially responsible for a company's poor economic performance, the management will usually be tossed in short order. New management will often be brought in to right the ship, weather the storm, or simply wind down operations in an orderly fashion. New management cannot be expected to work for free, especially when it's not clear that they will have future job prospects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For many of them it's because they don't make their money via their salary, instead it's via bonus, their salary represents their minimum pay. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-who-take-1-dollar-salary-or-less-2015-8/" target="_blank">Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg all make $1</a>, Elon Musk makes miniumn wage at Tesla but refuses it. Obviously they are paid well, but with a $1 salary they will typically get a bonus based on the performance of the company. Elon Musk has a contract that says he gets a $1.4bn bonus when the company <a href="http://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-tesla-targets-milestones-set-by-board/" target="_blank">meets 10 goals they set</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a small example, but the point is most CEOs have a relativity low salary for various reasons, including taxes. They then take their pay as stock or bonuses contingent on performance, if they screw up it automatically cuts their pay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, due to tax laws, most of a CEO's compensation comes in the form of a &quot;bonus&quot;, that is really much closer to pay expected for doing the job than what most people would call a bonus.  To qualify as a taxable expense any pay over $1 million must be tied to performance.</p>
<p>So while the salary rarely changes, the bonus pay (which must be tied to some performance metric to qualify as a taxable expense) can vary widely.  For example, Jamie Dimon is the CEO of a very large bank (JP Morgan), whose <a href="http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5345ac8169bedd9e218f0d75-731-332/screen%20shot%202014-04-09%20at%204.23.37%20pm.png" target="_blank">pay rose and fell</a> pretty dramatically between 2008 and 2013.  </p>
<p>His salary is the lightest blue bar, and didn't change, but his compensation changed dramatically.  It's not uncommon to see similar swings in total compensation as a result of incentive pay changes for many US CEOs, but because their salary is a tiny portion of their compensation it rarely changes.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I should point out that cutting a CEO's salary usually has a negligent impact on company finances. As others have mentioned, bonuses make up a large proportion of their compensation (which is also true overseas), although even those are generally orders of magnitude smaller than profit or loss.</p>
<p>A cynical man would say that cutting the salary of a CEO who is presumably already pretty wealthy is nothing but a publicity stunt and he may be right but there are other reasons as well. Cultural factors may make shared losses more expected  (I believe this to be the case in Japan), or falling revenues may be considered the fault of the CEO and losing his salary is a form of self-imposed punishment. </p>
<p>At any rate, we oughtn't get too caught up in how much or how little CEOs get paid during hard times, it's not going to make much of a difference in the end. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We really don't know, and some people can not. Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">Aphantasia</a>, which generally concerns the inability to &quot;visualize&quot; things, but extends, in some cases, to having no &quot;inner monologue&quot;.</p>
<p>ASIDE: I didn't realize I couldn't do the mind picture thing until the one time, as an adult when I suddenly could for a few seconds. For whatever reason I suddenly could see a camshaft in my mind... and I'm not even a gear head. Now, of late I've discovered that CBD oil in a fairly large dose will let me turn on this feature of my brain somewhat.</p>
<p>There is also the inextricable question of &quot;what is consciousness&quot;, which strongly seems to include this inner voice, but according to that whole aphantasia thing doesn't require the voice completely...</p>
<p>When I read the literature as a lay person (and something of a librarian, and an accomplished computer scientist) it seems to me that the whole mechanism of consciousness and inner monologue is something of an error correction protocol.</p>
<p>We seem to have a vested interest in being able to monitor our own thoughts. The primary role feels like a &quot;bullshit detector&quot;, where we can try ideas to see if they fit, or if they are worth admitting despite their ill-fit, with our &quot;story of the universe&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically we need to be able to &quot;try on&quot; what we just heard or thought, and so what we are about to say.</p>
<p>In terms of pure mechanism, most of the brain is an electrical/neurological dead end. All the signaling enters and leaves through the brain stem or other &quot;primitive&quot; structures, but all of our &quot;higher thinking&quot; happens in the newer structures that don't directly touch the outside world.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that &quot;the outputs are tied back to the inputs&quot; in a feedback loop.</p>
<p>We hear sounds. Those sounds go through a decoder to convert them into information. The information goes pretty much everywhere in the &quot;neocortex&quot; systems of your brain. Those cortex operations formulate a response. As that response heads back it gets looped through the decoder. We get a chance to decide if that output is worth it. (Should I <em>really</em> say that or is it just going to lead to violence or embarrassment?) If it gets a pass then that's what we say (or do) in response.</p>
<p>So people who <em>couldn't</em> &quot;Try on their words before speaking&quot; might be a lot more likely to say something that would get them in trouble. It also lets us choose between phrasing; &quot;I is happy&quot; and &quot;I am happy&quot;; to decide which one makes us sound less stupid or whatever.</p>
<p>Once you understand that you experience yourself at sort of the mid-level of abstraction, that you &quot;hear words&quot; <em>despite</em> the input just being a bunch of individual sound waves, then the model makes more sense.</p>
<p>Try repeating a word, any word - I recommend &quot;door&quot; - aloud, again and again. You'll soon find yourself asking yourself if its a real word. The sound will literally begin to lose its meaning. We think this happens because when its repeated for no reason the parts of the brain that are so conceptual that we don't feel them running concludes that the repetition of the word is &quot;just a sound&quot; instead of being a meaningful act of speech.</p>
<p>So a lot of inclusive and frankly subjective thought tell us that the part of us we think of as being us is just a slab of middleware. It's the system that monitors the flow from the physical to the conceptual and back. And the system works because it can block the noise and the &quot;bad ideas&quot; from making it all the way through by saying &quot;nah, that can't be right&quot;.</p>
<p>But since it's the same singular system it all &quot;sounds the same&quot; whether the signal is coming from the outside or the inside. But not exactly the same. Most people assign their own voice to their inner monologue. They can tell someone else's words from their own.</p>
<p>And, of course, when that identity operation starts to fall apart, people start &quot;hearing other voices in their head&quot; instead of just their own.</p>
<p>This means the system is important but a little bit fragile.</p>
<p>And none of this is &quot;fixed and solid scientific doctrine&quot; as there is no identified and absolutely distinct part of the brain where this all happens. There's no one spot we could laser out to &quot;pull the plug&quot; to turn off this feature. So it is extremely difficult to quantify.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a big question in the realm of psychology which has been thought about since the inception of that particular science. Actually this is a question that many philosophers addressed since before &quot;psychology&quot; was &quot;psychology&quot;, and we can take two different approaches towards this.</p>
<p>The most simple and most suited to most modern day people is the neurological approach. Essentially, &quot;what is happening in your brain when you hear your own inner voice?&quot;.</p>
<p>Science has noted that when someone is engaged in inner-speech that the part of their brain that is active during normal audible speech is also active. So, basically the part of your brain that is responsible for making words is also working to create your own inner dialogue. In fact, it has been noted that even though you are making no audible sound there are minor fluctuations in your larynx (throat) that are also happening despite that the throat isn't producing sound.</p>
<p>The other approach to this is a bit more esoteric, and it basically has to do with the idea that your brain, or your intellectual function is not really <em>YOU</em>. It is just a portion of you that performs a job, and this job is to think. So that part of you that is actually &quot;awareness&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot; is observing the portion of you that thinks from a third-person perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I have a follow-up question that's been touched on but perhaps not fully answered to my liking elsewhere in this thread:</p>
<p>I do not hear a &quot;voice&quot; when I think things through in my head, unless I'm actually thinking about how something would sound when spoken. I can generate and &quot;hear&quot; my own voice or voices of others if I want to/need to for a thought. I can visualize images, colors, etc., I can hear music, and I think through processes, ideas, memories, etc. very easily, but when I'm just considering things, there's no &quot;inner monologue&quot; (or at least nothing I'd characterize as such). I kind of &quot;feel&quot; the thought or run through &quot;experiencing&quot; an action or idea, rather than hearing anything.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes a huge amount of mechanical pressure to kill bacteria. There is a food preservation process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascalization" target="_blank">Pascalization</a> that uses pressure to kill molds and spores. It is used as an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization" target="_blank">Pasteurization</a>, which uses heat. The pressures involved a pretty huge -- 50,000 PSI. That's giant hydraulic press kind pressure. </p>
<p>Pascalization is not as effective as Pasteurization. I've only ever seen it used for very acidic products, like grapefruit juice. Strong acidity excludes many of the most dangerous food-borne pathogens, and so pascalization is more to prevent spoilage than to protect humans. It does not render food completely sterile, but it does extend shelf life.</p>
<p>When you step on something as small as a bacterial cell, you are also stepping on the goop the bacteria is living in (microbiologists call it a &quot;matrix,&quot; but I think &quot;goop&quot; is more illustrative). There is pretty much always goop, or the bacteria wouldn't be able to survive. Some bacteria do swim some of the time, but most of the time, they rely on diffusion to move compounds around their immediate vicinity. If you shrank yourself down to this scale, water would be like damp concrete or hard packed earth that is being vibrated (not a perfect analogy, but close). You can push things through it, but it takes a lot of work. Swimming is very, very hard work, and you'd want to avoid it if you can. Water with other stuff in it -- i.e., goop -- would be even stiffer. The cells are buried in that. Even if the layer of goop is completely invisible, from a cell's point of view, it could still be like sitting at the bottom of a lake.</p>
<p>When you step on the goop, what will happen is the goop will squirt around the hard structures to which it is attached. This probably won't bother any cells that aren't already ruptured or breached. They have to be tough to move through the goop, and the kind of violent disturbance you would cause by stepping on the goop is probably not very different from other disturbances that the bacteria rely on for long-distance travel.</p>
<p>As your foot comes down on the floor, some of the goop will get trapped in small cavities, and in those places the local pressure could get quite high. Probably not 50,000 PSI, though, and so I doubt many cells would be physically harmed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf4YyXVoWeA" target="_blank">Unless you are the girl in the Paul Simon song, maybe.</a></p>
<p>What will happen, though, is that some bacteria will be separated from the nutrient environment they were growing in, and that probably will kill them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

On average, a bacterium is about 1/10,000th of a centimeter, which is smaller than the human eye can see (by about 1,000 times in magnitude). A surface may appear to be smooth to the naked eye, but that same surface under a 1,000x power microscope will have hundreds upon hundreds of grooves and dips that bacteria can chill in if you were to step on them. </p>
<p>Of course, bacteria <em>can</em> be crushed. They're soft little organic dudes. Maybe you could crush a really big colony of bacteria with a perfectly smooth surface against another perfectly smooth surface. But in every day life, you're not killing bacteria by walking around (you can't sanitize your floor by stomping around). It's more likely that you're just spreading them around. And since viruses are usually about half the size of bacteria or less, the same goes for them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you injure yourself, pain signals travel from the site of injury to your brain. </p>
<p>When you do something else to that part of the body, for example rubbing it with your hand, this also sends signals to your brain. </p>
<p>However, because both signals are coming from the same part of the body, only one signal can &quot;enter&quot; your brain at a time. And this can be thought of as a gate. The <strong>gate only allows one signal at a time</strong>. And it just so happens that other stimuli such as pressure, vibrations, touch, etc. have priority over the incoming pain signal.</p>
<p>You feel less pain because you are interpreting other signals form the injured body part, instead of the pain</p>
<p>Hope that helps.

Remember when you were a child and sometimes fell to the ground and hurt yourself, while playing tag or rollerskating in the street. You would start crying because of the pain and your mom or dad picked you up and started comforting you by stroking your hair, blowing on the wound, saying &quot;there, there nothing to worry about&quot;. You immediately felt better and the pain from the wound faded a bit, and you stopped crying as you moments later would be back on the street playing and having fun as if nothing happened. What happened in your body was the pain stimuli being send from the wound to the brain got some competition from the sensory stimuli your parents did by comforting you. This is called gate control theory, and meaning your brain can only receive so much stimuli (touch, hearing etc.) before it closes the gate for say pain stimuli and the feeling of pain subsides. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is as if a teacher asks a classroom a question and only calls on students with their hands up.  If a student gets their neighbors to not raise their hands, they are more likely to be called on.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a neuron fires it can release inhibitory signaling molecules to its neighbors getting them to put their hands down.  </p>
<p>This is useful because it sharpens the image (literally in the case of neurons used for vision) but cutting down the amount of noise.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is your body's attempt at regulating internal heat and avoiding hyperthermia (heat stroke).  Lethargic, slow, and confused behavior is an important sign of heat stroke, so be careful when you feel this way.</p>
<p>The more active you are, the more oxygen your cells burn and you generate more internal heat.  This heat MUST be radiated away from your body or you will die.
Normally it is not a problem, but when it is very hot the air cannot draw heat from you fast enough.  Also high humidity can make sweating useless.  Sweating cools you via evaporation, and if it is very humid your sweat cannot evaporate to cool you.  The mere act of producing sweat also requires yet more energy that adds to the fatigue.</p>
<p>By forcing you to &quot;chill&quot; out and relax, your body drastically cuts down on the amount of heat it produces, giving extra time for heat to radiate away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your body is like a little motor, but if it gets too hot it can get damaged (like that one time your sister sally's birthday balloons went over the top of her birthday cake candles and popped! they got too hot and KaPOOF!)</p>
<p>So your body has to work hard to keep itself cool...it will sweat and get all drippy wet. And it takes a lot of energy to do that. The energy you COULD be using to run around and play fetch with Scooter...(because he is the HECKIN best doggo...)...but instead you have to use that energy to stay cool so your heart and brains and stuff still work. </p>
<p>That's why. So next time just help your body by cooling off yourself and chilling, and you'll be fine. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly, the human body can only tolerate a narrow range of internal temperatures (~35-40C). And physiological behaviors associated with higher/lower end of that temperature is incredibly predictable. On the lower end, people shiver in an attempt to get muscular activity that will produce more heat. On the higher end of the temperature, people sweat, more blood is distributed to the skin (to help heat escape), and they generally fatigue in an attempt to reduce further heat production via musculoskeletal movement. Of course, reality is much much more complicated. But long story short, I'd imagine its an evolutionary adaptation for preventing hyperthermia by reducing production of more heat. </p>
<p>As a scientist, I used to make people play jump-rope around 35.5 and 39.5C line for a whole host of reasons. I've put myself through those temperatures as well. Feel free to ask more probing questions/PM me if you're interested. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This corrosion increases circuit resistance - making it harder for charge to flow from battery to device. Basically more resistance lower voltage, and every electronic device has a minimum operating voltage.</p>
<p>By wacking the controller, you are repositioning the contacts ever so slightly and may get a better contact between power source(battery) and the controller. This better contact lowers resistance, allowing a slightly higher voltage to flow in to the controller, letting it work a little longer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For a VCR, it's probably a gear or a ribbon that's gotten caught. For a vending machine, it's probably a coin or snack that's become jammed. For a computer, it's probably a connection somewhere that's gotten dusty or misaligned. Haphazardly hitting/jostling the device can sometimes correct whatever has gotten out of wack. </p>
<p>In the case of the very simplistic remote control, it's likely a cruddy or misaligned battery connection that needs to be shifted back into place. It could also be another very small connection (to the IR emitter, for example) that needs to be moved a bit. That's the best part about Percussive Maintenance, you'll never know and you'll never care!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an alkaline battery like the one explained in the energizer datasheet below, the battery works by having a chunk of oxygen pop off a manganese plate, cross through a goo, and and stick to a zinc plate. It's sort of like starting with a clean dish and a dirty dish in a washpan and ending up with two dirty dishes in that at the atomic level there are chunks of oxygen that need to break off of or stick to chunks of metal. Shaking/shock can help release microscopic particles of manganese and zinc and expose enough new metal surfaces to get another sip of power.</p>
<p>It really is, however, more likely that you are just pulverizing the corrosion off of connections.</p>
<p>It is even more likely that it's luck. Remotes are slow. Sometimes the rubber buttons don't feel smashed down until almost a quarter of a second after the electrical connection has happened, then the infrared signal getting received is a lucky-shot thing. You tried something, then it worked, but it might have been intermittent all along.</p>

<p>also yes ants don't have eyes i know that now. i just meant something small that does have eyes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in terms of optics and photoreceptor density, which are the principal factors in a creature's visual resolution (&quot;details per degree of visual angle&quot;), there probably isn't much real difference between the <em>angular</em> visual resolution of e.g. a jumping spider and a house cat - both can see, at best, about ~10 details per degree. so if you shrank a cat down to spider size (or vice versa), they'd both have similar limits to the smallest things they could see.</p>
<p>but since they're different sizes, the sizes of the things they can see will also scale; since the eye is getting smaller, its <del><em>near point</em></del> (i think i meant 'depth of field' here) is getting proportionally shorter. so if a jumping spider's eye is a thousand times smaller than a cat's eye, it can potentially resolve details that are a thousand times smaller than what a cat's can resolve. a cat can never get optically close enough to a grain of sand to make it a degree wide, so that it could see 'ten details' on its surface, while this optical distance is easily available to the spider.</p>
<p>the caveat to this general scalability of vision is in the &quot;noisiness&quot; of light, i.e. factors like diffraction (limitation in how small of a point can be focused) or chromatic aberration (the difference in focal distance for different light wavelengths) - for a big eye with a big pupil, this noisiness is insignificant, but for a spider's eye it is getting significant, since all of us are looking at more-or-less the same light bandwidth. jumping spiders, for example, deal with this by having retinas at different focal depths to try to account for chromatic aberration.</p>
<p>but this stuff gets complicated, especially considering that the range in optical quality and photoreceptor density across species washes out most of these limitations. i think you could safely suppose that, in the range of terrestrial creature sizes, vision basically scales with size.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> the important thing is that things scale, but my concepts are confused re &quot;near point&quot; etc, see /u/craigdubyah for better/more detailed info---</p>
<p><em>edit edit</em> sorry i didn't keep up with this, was busy all day; but let me excuse the rough edges of my answer by saying it was a lot of well-informed hand waving and of course i didn't try to go into detail about diffraction and lens power and etc etc; i just wanted to get the basic gist across that vision should more-or-less scale with the size of the eye, receptor sampling being equal (as in the cat/spider comparison). field of view, pupil sizes, etc, all very important but another time and place, ok?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really.</p>
<p>Eyes are very complex, and you can only make them so small. If we reduce vision to it's basics, we get rods and cones that are light-sensitive and are relaying that information (I see light!) to the brain. You can only pack so many of these in on an atomic scale.</p>
<p>It's kinda like how cameras kept getting higher and higher megapixel counts. Eventually the individual sensors get so small that you can't fit any more of them in, so you need to put them on a larger sensor area, which makes the lens bigger, which makes the camera bigger. </p>
<p>Eventually scale will always get you.</p>
<p>Now, the flip side: how do we see very small things? Either we use lenses to make them appear larger (spread the light out over a larger area, so that our relatively-widely spaced sensors can see the difference between 2 areas), or we cram a ton of sensors into a smaller area.</p>
<p>Again, lenses are the limitation. Which is why bugs have big eyes. </p>
<p>Another interesting side of the lens equation is light quantity! Smaller lenses don't allow as much light through, so you have to do more with what little you get. More <em>sensitivity</em> to light becomes more important with smaller-scale lenses, at the cost of less resolution. </p>
<p>And another thing to consider: Multiple images. If you take 10 pictures of an area and merge them all together, you get higher detail, which allows you to see the details better.</p>
<p>Bugs have lots of eyes. ;)</p>
<p>That all being said, no they don't see microscopically well. Small things are still small things, and small eyes won't see them without some kick-ass glasses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so in terms of physical optics, and not taking into account the limits of biology, a smaller aperture means less resolution. There are simply not as many photons coming in to tell you about the world, and there are limits to how far a given aperture size can zoom in before diffraction starts to make things blurry.</p>
<p>Optically speaking, an ant would have lower limits on its visual acuity than an elephant.</p>
<p>Biologically speaking, since we can't focus at arbitrarily close distances, ants would be able to see small things better, and elephants could probably only see ants in small groups, the same way we can see groups of blood cells, but not individual ones.</p>
<p>The pinhole effect mentioned elsewhere is only relevant to the lens of the eye, it's the aperture that determines maximum angular resolution, and the retina that determines how much of that resolution a creature can make use of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

So bug vision and human vision are apples and oranges. Visual sharpness is a function of focus and resolution. Resolution is limited by a) the number of receptor cells used to draw an image and b) the color of light/radiation being perceived.</p>
<p>There's a physical limit to how small a microscopic thing that can be drawn with the 390-700nm visible light range, so it's not like tiny eyeballs could see viruses. Ants clearly see antennae and hairs on their nearby sisters, but it's not clear that ants can see our eyeballs at distance or a Paramecium in a water drop.</p>
<p>The sharpest visual acuity in human-like eyes is found in eagles and other raptor birds, as sharp as 20/5 or 20/4 as we can measure it. Eagles don't have large eyeballs, even for birds, but they have exceptionally dense receptor cells. It's estimate they could resolve ants from atop a 10-story building. I would see a palm-sized tile in the sidewalk; eagles would see tiny dots painted on it, and that some of them were moving.</p>
<p>I've read anecdotally that elephants aren't &quot;afraid of mice&quot;, but that they probably see mice as blurry, unfamiliar movement near their feet. If cantaloupes are clear and mice are blurry, then ants are probably &quot;microscopic&quot; to elephants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leaving out actual biological examples and speaking strictly in terms of the physics of what would happen if you shrunk or grew a human eye, kind of. </p>
<p>If you took a normal human eye and shrunk it down, the iris would shrink with it. This is equivalent to having a camera with a tiny aperture. If you have glasses, try taking them off, making a really tiny hole with your fingers and looking through it - you'll see clearer. This is also why squinting helps you see - you're looking through the tiny holes in your eyelashes. This makes both near <em>and</em> far clearer - what photographers call &quot;increased depth of field&quot;. The tradeoff is brightness - make the hole too small and not enough light gets in. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you grew an eye, the iris would get larger, eventually it would be a gaping hole and the eye wouldn't be very functional at all. With a quarter sized iris I would guess you could still tell things like the direction of the sun and such, but not much more. </p>
<p>The size of the lense, on the other hand, makes no difference. It's the shape of the lense that determines whether the eye sees near or far, not the size. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the first thing to understand is the instruction set in your DNA is called your genotype. The way you actually look and are is called your phenotype. Most of genetics study is about understanding the relationship between the genotype and phenotype.</p>
<p>Now some aspects of your phenotype are easily mapped to a single gene in your genotype. This is the easy part. But some characteristics of your phenotype are determined by not one but the combined action of multiple genes. And some aspects of your phenotype are not determined directly by the genotype at all.</p>
<p>For example, there is no gene for 'height'. There are multiple genes that together determine things like how large your bones are, how fast they can grow, how sensitive your body is to growth hormones, how efficiently you can use the food you eat etc. And then there is a final factor which is the environment - how much food and of what quality was available to you when your were growing.</p>
<p>Your height is the net effect of all these things. That is why, you can talk about people being <em>genetically predisposed</em> to being taller or shorter, but there is no way to predict exactly what height will be. Even if you had extremely detailed information about a person's genotype and exactly how the hundreds of involved genes will contribute in miniscule ways to affect height, the environmental factor still remains a variable.</p>
<p>PS: Eye color is also determined by multiple genes and is not as simple as you might think <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some good responses here. Just thought I'd add a few types of genes that make genetics more complex than a simple Punnett Square:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genes that code for proteins that help the cell replicate and perform its basic function (proteins involved in building bone, muscle, connective tissue, etc. that creates an increase in height)</li>
<li>Genes that code for proteins that regulate the activity or expression of other proteins (proteins that speed up or slow down the proteins creating muscle, bone, connective tissue, etc.)</li>
<li>Genes that code for proteins that regulate gene expression itself (proteins that attach to the DNA and speed up, slow down, or prevent DNA transcription of &quot;height&quot; genes entirely)</li>
<li>There are also segments of DNA, such as introns, which were once thought to be useless but now are believed to play an important role in gene expression and the shape of the DNA molecule itself (a slightly modified intron size near a &quot;height&quot; gene might make it more/less accessible and therefore more/less frequently expressed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for something as seemingly simple as eye color, there can be dozens if not hundreds of genes somehow involved in the production or regulation of eye pigments, and some of these genes may affect other processes as well. So instead of imagining a simple line of causality that connects a gene to a phenotype, imagine it as a web of interconnected genes that combine to form multiple phenotypes and affect each other in ways that aren't always easy to predict. It's not A --&gt; 1 but rather ABCDEFG --&gt; 123456789, with no way (yet) of knowing which one is causing what.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In the simplest case, each gene acts independently of the others, which produces a nice bell curve like the first graph in that article. But it's also possible for genes to interact with each other, so two genes together might have more impact than the sum of the same two genes separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't over simplify eye color either, saying the colors one eyes can be are hazel, green, blue and brown would be like saying the height one can be is short, average and tall. </p>
<p>Eye color and height both are determined by a good number of genes that we have already identified, but also likely very many others that we have not. The human genome has not been completely unraveled, but we are learning more as we continue to research.</p>
<p>To answer your question, we understand the variables that go into human height potential about as well as we understand those for eye color. They seem easy to understand at the macroscopic level because two parents with brown eyes quite often have brown eyed children, creating a kind of pattern we can recognize, but it is important to understand that these patterns are what we use to predict eye color, not some understanding of activated genes. But for the very reason you stated, there being a much more apparent lack of predictability with height, you would be had pressed to find a reputable geneticist willing to predict a patients height potential within a margin of less that maybe 6 inches.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add one thing to all of these fantastic responses: height isn't one thing, it is made up of the lengths of things. Usually, torso length stays about the same because organs need room and that can't vary a lot. Mostly height comes from the leg length as well as a tiny but from the torso. So height would come from femur length, tibia length, and fibula length as well as neck length, skull length and organ size (smaller organs will result in a smaller torso). That's one of the reasons why it's so difficult to predict height.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The amount of heat you can transfer is limited by the volume of water in question, and the temperature of the water vs your body temperature.  </p>
<p>Since you can flow a whole lot more water over your hand than you can have in your mouth, there is a lot more capacity to move heat.  Also, the rate at which heat transfers partially depends on convection, and the faster the water moves past your hand the more convection you can have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
