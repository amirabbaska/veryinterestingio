<p>Even room-temperature objects are emitting light. It just isn't <em>much</em> light and the wavelength is way too long to see (it is low-energy).</p>
<p>The more an object heats up, then more energy it emits. It also starts to emit more energy of higher frequencies (higher energy levels). So if it gets hot enough, some of that light is now going to be in the visible spectrum, since it will be energetic enough to produce red light (but not much of a higher wavelength like green or blue light).</p>
<p>If you keep heating it, it will get yellower and yellower as more yellow light gets emitted (relative to the other energy it is emitting).</p>
<p>Eventually it does reach a point where it emitting enough higher energy light that it has a considerable amount of green or blue light being emitted. However, at this point, so much light is being emitted (and a lot of it is still red light) that the object will just appear white to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called black body radiation. Objects that aren't at absolute zero have thermal energy. The electrons present are constantly gaining and losing energy - which is emitted as light, one photon at a time. The color/wavelength of a photon is determined by how much energy it has. An electron will emit basically any energy it gets, almost immediately. At higher temperatures, more of the electrons can occasionally attain higher levels of energy and therefore emit &quot;hotter&quot; colors, but more electrons are gaining and losing the lesser quanta also.</p>
<p>We can only see a tiny range of light energy - from red (lower energy) to blue and violet (higher energy). Infrared, microwaves, and radio are examples of low energy light, below our threshold, while ultraviolet and x-rays are &quot;high energy&quot; colors of light. Anyways, even cold objects emit this thermal radiation, and continue to emit it in addition to that red glow. When you see red-hot metal, it's infringing into the visible spectrum, but there's far more light being emitted that we can't see - red is just the edge of the spectrum of light being produced by that hot knife. As it becomes even hotter, the spectrum shifts, we see even more red light in addition to the higher energy colors.</p>
<p>Because of the way human vision works, we don't see these colors separately. Instead, colors add up to appear more white. Ever see an RGB projector?</p>
<p>On a side note, that blue sky you see is actually mostly violet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Every object in a room emits light at not just one wavelength, but across a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Changing the object's temperature will shift the <em>predominant</em> wavelength being emitted, but the other wavelengths continue to be emitted as well. That's why you get a transition from red to orange to white to blue, rather than a full cycle through the rainbow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When something is heated the atoms or molecules respond by moving more and in different ways. Air doesn't glow a color until it gets really really hot because it can move in 3d space, vibrate, bend (such as in water vapor), or rotate (but not about an axis of symmetry such as along the bonds between oxygen or nitrogen in the diatomic molecules of oxygen or nitrogen).</p>
<p>But metals (such as steel in a knife) are bound together in a lattice, they cannot move the way air can, so most of that heat energy goes to exciting electrons or vibration. Every atom or molecule has different energy states that electrons can occupy. When the energetic electrons go back to their less energetic ground state they release the energy as a photon that often is in the red spectrum. </p>
<p>However some metals can produce other colors and any impurities would cause different colors as well. Because each of these elements or atoms can have  different energy levels available to their electrons that may or may not be available to those in iron or carbon. And a lot of energy can cause a lot of different energy levels being accessible causing a white light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other reasons, it's not easy to donate eggs, it is a long and painful process with many doctor appointments. Psychological tests, blood work, ultrasounds, multiple medications, self-injections over a period of days, and egg &quot;retrieval&quot; which  requires IV sedation and a real big needle. The donor and recipient have to carefully align their cycles and the donor has to make sure they take the medications correctly and on time and give themselves shots without fail at the same time everyday within 15 minutes of the set time. Often times the hormones will affect a woman's mood. You can't just take an egg like you can take sperm, you have to chemically alter how your body works for months. A lot of work, time, and dedication goes into it. The recipients want their money's worth and don't want to waste their time with a mentally/physically unprepared donor who quits half way through. Some of the restrictions are a bit too much I think, but I guess if you're gonna spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on an egg with no guarantee it work, you'd want the &quot;best&quot; you can get. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additionally to the other answers about quality, the cost of the procedure is also a huge factor.</p>
<p>Egg donors get paid large amounts (£8000 isn't uncommon), and the process is very expensive for company who are paying for it- unlike sperm, it isn't a single trip to a clinic, it's weeks of hormone injections and then an invasive procedure done under a general anaesthetic to surgically remove the matured eggs.<br />
Therefore, it is much cheaper and better for everyone involved to screen out anyone who has any potential to have low quality eggs as early into the process as possible by having very high standards.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the conceptual models that adequately explains a fair few things about our brains' behaviours is the linked data model.</p>
<p>Each piece of data is linked to other pieces of data, like sights, or smells, or people you were with, or things you were also thinking about when you learned that thing, or previous times thinking about the thing.</p>
<p>And links degrade and become overwritten with time. More like a half-life thing than a 'in precisely 3 years and 47 seconds I will forget this thing'. </p>
<p>If <em>every</em> piece of data can form links like that, then so can meta-thoughts. Like, &quot;the plot of this movie is linked to the title of this movie&quot;. And perhaps, at one point, it was. You know a link was there. You know that if you hear the title, it'll feel right in an inexplicable way. But damnit <em>what was the name of it</em>?</p>
<p>Conceptually, this model also explains why we can sometimes remember stuff like this by looking for more related information. Lead actors names? Director? Where you first saw it? All things that also might have links to the movie title, and the links might still exist. </p>
<p>Some people express that they remember looking at the book cover, or title screen, or cd case or whatever, but not being able to remember what it said. </p>
<p>But that's just a conceptual model, and was not constructed with any physical properties of the brain in mind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So when you eat or have sex, your brain produces lots and lots of Feelgood dust, which makes you feel awesome. But then the Feelgood dust leaves through the drain and you feel normal again.</p>
<p>Now, there's this poison, nicotine, that clogs the drain, and that means that the Feelgood Dust stays in your head for longer. Isn't that wonderful?</p>
<p>The problem is that the drain is very delicate. If the Smoke Poison clogs it too many times in too short a time, it breaks and it becomes wider. And then the feelgood dust disappears immediately and you don't feel good ever. So you need to get more and more of the Smoke Poison just to feel normal. That's called Addiction.</p>
<p>But don't worry, just stop getting smoke poison and eventually the drain will repair itself and become regular sized again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Cohesion is a fancy word for sticking to each other. So water molecules want to stick next to other water molecules, and air wants to stick to air.</p>
<p>Adhesion is a fancy word for sticking to each other. So air molecules also want to stick next to water molecules.</p>
<p>The strongest force by far is water wanting to stick next to water, though, so big bubbles tend to split up. If you think of a big bubble and then cut it in half, you've added lots of space where water can hang out next to water. It's called surface tension. Bugs can also walk on water and upside down on the ceiling due to similar forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember my dreams and my wife says I thrash around almost every night. The last dream I do remember having was a few years ago.</p>
<p>We live near Seattle, WA but this dream took place somewhere like New York city, big front steps leading to the buildings front door. It was only my 5 year old daughter and myself.  We are getting out of the car, maybe a cab and I don't recognize any of this but my daughter does and she's excited to see who/what we are visiting. She starts running down the sidewalk and to one of the stairs, she's running freely and laughing, so excited. I'm trying to run after her but I can't run, it's like I'm in water I just can't move very fast.</p>
<p>She runs up the stairs and I'm in slow motion right behind her, she runs into the home and the door slams shut. This is where I have a hard time repeating it.</p>
<p>Her laughs turn into screams. She's calling for me, she needs me. I can hear dogs, maybe wolves growling. She's scared, I can't open the door. Whatever was behind that door starts to rip my daughter apart. I can hear everything. I'm starting to cry right now just thinking about it. Her screams turn into agony and then silent and all I can hear is whatever is chewing on my daughter. </p>
<p>Her screams haunt me. I couldn't help her. I'm glad I don't remember my dreams. I suffer from ptsd. I was in an accident when I was 17 and I killed a student at my school when she was Jay walking. I've never really received proper help. I've always rejected it because it's too painful to deal with what happened. I'm 35 now.</p>
<p>I wish I could control my dreams. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The diffraction limit describes the absolute maximum angular resolution for optics. To resolve very fine details, you need a large aperture.

If you have a pulsed laser directly incident on the pinhole stopped down so only &lt;&lt;1 photon passes through the aperture per pulse, you'll form the appropriate diffraction pattern on the other side - that is, a single photon can interfere with itself to form a diffraction pattern.

<p>In general, film (and CCD sensors) have all sort of what are called reciprocity failures--where development isn't proportional to photon intensity--at very high and low exposure times and very high and low illuminances.</p>

There are 4 phases of the ISM that are in pressure equilibrium with each other: molecular,  cold neutral medium, warm neutral medium, and the warm ionized medium. As the names suggest, the biggest difference is the typical state of hydrogen atoms in that phase, going from bonded in H2 molecules to neutral atoms to isolated protons. Because they are in pressure equilibrium, hotter regions are less dense and vice versa. Stars form in the coldest, densest regions, but as soon as they turn on they start heating their surroundings and will blow away the molecular cloud they formed from. They biggest, hottest stars will emit a significant fraction of their light with energies high enough to ionize hydrogen (&gt; 13.6 eV) so hot young stars will blow these ionized bubbles within colder surroundings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's been a decent amount of confusion so I thought I'd help bring together ideas having done work on the interstellar medium. In general the answer should be it is denser.</p>
<p>Around new stars, /u/pecamesh gave a great <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5k8zyn/if_the_vacuum_of_space_is_really_a_very_thin/dbmi6zp/" target="_blank">answer</a> about what happens between different phases of the interstellar medium. However, a more useful picture of the phases of the ISM might be one that looks more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium#Interstellar_matter" target="_blank">this</a>. HII regions (ionized hydrogen, not molecular hydrogen H2) where stars are ionizing material are typically denser than the ambient cold or warm neutral phase media, partially because they are in between the cold molecular cloud level of density and the ambient medium level of density. So the ionized bubbles are definitely less dense than molecular cloud but you shouldn't think of them as making a hole in the ISM with a much lower density than everywhere else, just lower than the molecular clouds.</p>
<p>Around main sequence and significantly-evolved stars, /u/Das_Mime gave a great <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5k8zyn/if_the_vacuum_of_space_is_really_a_very_thin/dbmo6cf/?context=1" target="_blank">answer</a> about the solar wind and the equivalent winds around other stars. The density for the Sun is still larger than the typical neutral phase medium (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_medium#Composition_and_physical_characteristics" target="_blank">wiki</a>).</p>
<p>Around &quot;other gravity wells&quot; the question becomes a lot more complex because it's not just a matter of gravity as a number of people have wrongfully brought up. Gravity is a major component for the formation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk" target="_blank">accretion disks</a>, which are going to be much more dense than the neutral ISM (otherwise you don't have much of a disk). However, accretion disks need not form. For example, the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole is not accreting much though has undergone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*#Discovery_of_G2_gas_cloud_on_an_accretion_course" target="_blank">accretion events</a>. The first gravitational wave events from stellar mass black hole mergers are thought to have very little gas around them otherwise we might have seen an electromagnetic counterpart; this &quot;lack&quot; could simply be an observational difficulty though. Pulsars can show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar_wind_nebula" target="_blank">pulsar wind nebulae</a> surrounding them but again like normal stars, that's not a matter of an increase in local gravity. The take away point is that you will typically get more dense gas/dust regions around objects of interest because there are a lot of dynamic processes going on around those objects and not simply an increase in gravity.</p>
<p>EDIT: One note on the intergalactic medium; it is thought to be less dense than the interstellar medium and really the ISM within individual galaxies but we don't know too much about it. That's much more of a consequence of gravity but really the gravity of an entire galaxy holding the reservoir of stars and gas and all of those other dynamical processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real-world example:  I work for Company ABC.  I need to buy a superwidget, like right now, but there's only one company that sells the specific superwidget I need, and I don't have an account with them.  Now, I can go ahead and set up and account, which might take a few days, and I have to send paperwork and credit references and the owner's social security number and a DNA sample and a pint of urine and such and so forth, but I REALLY need that superwidget, like right now, and I don't want to wait on all that.  So instead, I call up Company XYZ, a consultant/contractor who's done work for me in the past and who is already set up in my accounting system and I'm already set up in theirs.  I say &quot;hey I need a superwidget right now, like yesterday, I know you have an account with Super Duper Superwidget Company, so can you buy it and send it here, and then send me the bill?&quot;  They say &quot;hellz yeah brah,&quot; buy it, send it to me, and then when Super Duper Superwidget Company sends Company XYZ the invoice, XYZ sends it to me at Company ABC.  I pay XYZ, then they pay SDSWCo.  This would be a pass-through transaction, it's a procurement method that simplifies a lot of purchasing especially on an emergency basis, or when you're trying to hide a purchase from your accounting folks (&quot;hey let's go for a round of golf, if you cover the green fees you can bill me for it as a pass-through.&quot;) if you know they don't inspect the invoices too closely.</p>
<p>Another way to do it is as a markup transaction, which works exactly the same way, but when I get the invoice from XYZ I see that they've increased the price 5% or 10% above what SDSWCo charged them.  This is a common practice as well in paying XYZ for the time and effort they took to do you a solid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Say a property company owns several complexes. Instead of paying property taxes out of the money received from the renters &quot;after the fact&quot;, most will include a &quot;pass through addendum&quot; to the rental agreement. This outlines to the renter that they are responsible for x% of the overall property tax and that it will be &quot;passed through&quot; to them as part of their overall rent along with whatever other items are included such as utilities, pool, maintenance, etc 'perks' that come with the apartment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned by another poster, they're not subgroups of Catholicism in the sense of denominations if that is what you were thinking. Rather, there are different types of religious &quot;orders&quot;. As the previous poster also mentioned, each order has a different way of serving and worshipping God. It's not to say that they believe any particular way is &quot;more correct&quot; than another way, but that it is simply the way they feel is best for <em>themselves</em> to glorify God. Some find that through prayer, others through education, others through prayer and reflection. Now, the origin of each of these orders comes from various groups of monastic priests (monks/brothers), and the rituals they would follow under their leader (an abbot). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whoever founded the order would have several monastic priests under him, and would often form several monasteries in his lifetime. It's not always founded under one specific leader, but to keep the explanation simple we'll treat it that way. Especially when the founder of an order passed away, others would often form new monasteries teaching in the same principles. This is why they are often named after a specific individual. There exist two main &quot;divisions&quot; when it comes to these orders: active and contemplative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Active would be those such as the Franciscans (St. Francis of Assisi), the Jesuits (St. Francis Xavier, after whom Pope Francis took his Papal name), and the Dominicans (St. Dominic). These &quot;active&quot; orders are the ones often going out and preaching, serving the poor, etc. Unless you visit a monastery, these are the ones you would be more likely to run into somewhere. The &quot;contemplative&quot; are more of the typical image of what a monk/brother is, living in the monastery with other monks, spending most of the day in prayer, reading Scripture, etc. As their name would imply, these are the ones spending most of their time in solitude, dedicating their lives to God in this manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like an overview of the most-popular orders, <a href="http://www.religious-vocation.com/differences_religious_orders.html#.WGAVineZMy4" target="_blank">this webpage</a> does a good job of explaining what each one specifically dedicates themselves too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR - All these different groups were founded in the Middle Ages to be a place to throw your 'extra' kid, to do different kinds of work for the Church.</p>
<p>In the middle ages in Europe, life was hard. If you and your wife were commoners, it was very likely that more than half of any kids you brought into the world would die before giving you grandchildren. But what happens when you're 'lucky' and have five sons survive to adulthood, and the family farm can only support one or two of them? One path was apprenticeship, essentially selling the kid into indentured servitude in exchange for them having a paying trade at the end. </p>
<p>Okay, that gets rid of one or two of them. But now you have Fred over here who has no talent in farming or a trade. You've spent a bunch of money to get him to breeding age and you're not going to get anything back from this. If you were a noble or something, you could send your kid into religious 'officer's school' to be a priest or bishop or something, but that option isn't open for poor Fred, either. </p>
<p>Enter: monasticism. Basically, you can sell your kid to the Catholic Church, not for money, but for Heaven Credits (tm). We send useless Fred off to go be a monk at a monastery somewhere where he can earn money for the Church by toiling in some way or another (or providing some sort of administrative role) and spend the rest of the time praying for you and your wife's immortal soul. He doesn't get the prestige of being a priest who gets up in front of people and runs church, but there is at least a little status bump for having a kid be a monk, and you don't have to look at all those pox scars on his face all the time to remind you of all the food you could have saved if you had drowned him in the bathtub. </p>
<p>But not all monasteries could sit off in the mountains and make beer for the Church to sell, or the bottom would just fall out of the market. So they diversified into doing shit that Church leaders really didn't want to do themselves.</p>
<p>Some became those guys you can pay to sit in line for you on Black Friday,  like the Carmelites squatting in what's now Israel so all those other filthy groups who wanted Israel couldn't live there. But it's kind of sandy and boring there, so nobody else wanted that job.</p>
<p>Some became actual soldiers for god, like the Dominicans, who were brought together because the Cathars were Catholic'ing wrong and needed to have their heads rearranged by sharp bits of metal.</p>
<p>Some went on biohazard duty, like the Franciscans tending to lepers. I mean sure, Jesus mentioned being nice to lepers, but those fuckers had communicable diseases!</p>
<p>Some went out to be salespeople of Catholicism to the heathens like the Jesuits, because who really wants to go to foreign lands where they don't even have half-decent liquor and convince all these idiots to give your church their allegiance?</p>
<p>That's not to say that's what all these groups do today. Today, the vast majority of religious orders do some great work for mankind. But you'd be surprised how many of them started with some priestly noble fuck not wanting to learn Native American languages or leave behind his comfy life in his family castle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The different groups you're thinking of are different religious institutes. A religious institute is basically a society where members take public vows and live as brothers and sisters in common. There are a lot of different institutes and they all function a bit differently. </p>
<p>In general, though, each institute focuses on a particular area or areas of church life. Some are contemplative, some serve in parishes, some have schools, some are separated from the world, some are active in the world, etc. In addition, each institute usually follows a specific set of rules about communal life. The Benedictines, for example, are monks who follow the rule of St. Benedict. The Franciscans are mendicants (meaning they live off alms, travel, serve the poor, etc.), who follow the teachings and practices of St. Francis. The Jesuits are clerics regular (a kind of broad category for priests) who work in all sorts of fields including parish life, education, scientific research, cultural pursuits, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
