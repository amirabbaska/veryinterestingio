<p>Airplanes load in the way that is the most financial advantageous to the airline (and this will vary between airlines). They give the best (first) loading to the customers they are making the most money from as an incentive to buy tickets like that and as a benefit of such.</p>
<p>They have done endless, endless research on this, and in the end, its all about the money, thats how they load. Thats how they should load. They are a business, they act in their best business interest and for airlines, its all about maximizing profit on each passenger</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Our body is controlled by a circadian rhythm, which is like a clock we have it in our brains to control when it's time to wake up and when it's time to sleep. </p>
<p>Our eyes can capture how illuminated the environment around us is and send signals to our brain. The brain, with this information, not only &quot;calculates&quot; how long the day lasts, but also tries to organize your activities (bodily functions, sleep time, awaken time etc) accordingly to the time of the day. This &quot;time organizer&quot; is called the pineal gland.</p>
<p>The pineal gland secretes melatonin, which is the hormone that makes us fall asleep. Eyes see it's dark outside, the brain notices that and the pineal gland releases melatonin. Its secretion peaks at night, when it's time for us to rest. You feel sleepy and your body temperature falls.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the sun goes up, the brain sends to your body a message to raise your temperature and your adrenal glands start to produce another hormone called cortisol. It's when your body realizes it's time to wake up. </p>
<p>That's why using your computer at night makes you stay awake all night long, for example. The blue spectrum of light that comes from your computer screen deceives your brain, making it think it's still sunny outside. That way, your pineal gland doesn't release melatonin and you stay awake. </p>
<p>ETA - If you find it difficult to wake up, try to leave the window curtains open before you go to bed. That way, when the sun goes up it will illuminate your bedroom, making it easier for you to wake up and feel awaken. Another good tip is, right after waking up, opening the window and looking at the sunshine, to give your brain the message that it's daytime. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: When it's sunny outside, your brain releases cortisol, that keeps you awake. When it's dark outside, your brain releases melatonin, that makes you feel sleepy.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Postural distortion expert here.</p>
<p>In reflexive reaction to negative emotions of any kind, our nervous system reflexively tightens the front of the body. It's a withdrawal response, a self protective contraction with survival value. In its full expression, it's the same contraction pattern as the startle reflex.    </p>
<p>It hunches us forward, depresses the chest, rounds the shoulders, and leans the head forward.
It makes us small, trying to say &quot;don't notice me&quot;. In its extreme, it stops our breathing.</p>
<p>Stretching  out of it doesn't really work because it stretching doesn't get the brain to turn off the contraction very well.  </p>
<p>Try pandiculating, doing a little more of what the body is already doing and relax out of it voluntarily.</p>
<p>There is a modality that teaches this called Clinical Somatics that teaches ways to regain control of these tightenings. Here is a friend of mine teaching the exact pandiculations to escape from this tightness. <a href="https://youtu.be/umWj6axd04g" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/umWj6axd04g</a>   A movement called The Flower. Do it very carefully with low effort. It really works.</p>
<p>Edit: Adding: This habituated reflexive contraction is the posture of depression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical doctor here. I will talk about the &quot;Heart Break Syndrome&quot;, which gives a kind of chest pain similar to that felt by depressed patients.</p>
<p>This kind of pain happens thanks to our inherent survival instinct. Many evolutionary psychologists believed that as human civilizations evolved, our bodies made our social and pain/reward systems in the brain connected, as a way to force us to socialize. Which means that if you fall in love or like someone, dopamine levels will rise in your brain and you'll feel happy and excited, if you feel sad or heartbroken, it will activate the pain pathway in your brain.</p>
<p>The whole physiology of this kind of pain - alas, how we become aware of this kind of pain is not exactly very known. But it is indeed known that bad emotions - just like any other emotion we feel - activate many areas of our brains. One of them is an area of the brain called anterior cingulate cortex, which stimulates the vagal nerve. The vagal nerve is a nerve that, among many other body parts, innervates your heart and your stomach region. By stimulating your vagal nerve, your brain will make you feel chest pain or nausea. That's why some people throw up after traumatic situations, for example. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Any bad emotion may stimulate an area of the brain called anterior cingulate cortex, which stimulates the vagal nerve, which causes chest pain and nausea, among other symptoms.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're stressed and/or anxious your body has a physical response. This is called the fight or flight response. It is a way for the body to prepare itself for a treat, which we call stress. The muscles in our body tighten up, which also happens in the chest area. Normally your body recovers easily from this response. But when this response is frequent, the body has not enough time to recover, which results in a tightened chest. This can cause pain or can have effect on your breathing, which maybe explains the feeling you've described.</p>

<p>I got to thinking that the design with the most air movement would find it's way as the defacto fan blade design standard and would be used in every application. Yet even in some applications as trivial as CPU/GPU coolers in computers we find fans with varying curvatures, angles, and gimmicks.  </p>
<p>Am I wrong for thinking that the most optimal design would/could/should be used everywhere with the only difference being speed to control the airflow (CFM)?</p>
<p>Has it already been made and is it being held up by a patent somewhere?</p>
<p>Sorry in advance, This has just been my shower thought for a few weeks and I haven't found any sufficient Google answers for it.</p></div></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, your thinking is wrong here.</p>
<p>First up is, how do you define &quot;optimal&quot;? Any real world problem has multiple variables at play and there is no one &quot;optimal&quot; solution. You brushed up on a couple aspects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>air flow per speed and efficiency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fan A might have more air flow, but fan B has better power efficiency. Which is &quot;optimal&quot;? Fan C might be better than both, but costs more to manufacture. Fan D might be better than all 3 in efficiency, flow rate, and cost, but is horribly loud. This is the basis of optimization: you first have to define what &quot;optimal&quot; means for your particular use case, and there's generally a lot of competing factors. They're often barely related by any physics, which is the basis of &quot;multi-disciplinary design optimization&quot;, or MDO.</p>
<p>This is even separate from physics, where how fluids behave change dramatically based on scale and what you're trying to do. There's no reason why a 50 meter diameter wind turbine built to extract power from oncoming flow should look anything like an 80mm computer case fan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a short addition to the other great answers:
Apple once made it a distinctive feature of their new MacBooks to have asymmetrical fan blades in order to make the noise of the fans less monotonous and therefore less irritating to hear (I am explaining this poorly, but basically they seem more quiet than they actually are, at least that was the claim)
These fans prioritized noise over absolute efficiency or performance, so they should be great in specifically the desired use case but for example less relevant in industrial cooling facilities or car engines etc.
Just  goes to show that it's all a matter of priorities, basically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is fans have a lot of parameters that they need to optimize for. A brief example list includes efficiency, airflow (CFM), variable speed operation (one fan may perform better across a range despite a lower peak efficiency, noise (sound is usually sacrificed for static or airflow) , and static pressure (force behind the air flow) . No single fan is the best at all of the conditions. </p>
<p>I work in HVAC and we use many different types of fans for various applications. Off the bat, there are probably 4 or 5 different arrangements I use on a weekly basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once wrote a sociology paper related to this topic. Music is often used by businesses to invite certain people and exclude others. Certain people feel more comfortable and relaxed when surrounded by unobtrusive classical music, perhaps played inside a high-end bistro. Others feel at home in a shop blaring EDM.</p>
<p>So it falls to the consumer to self-select. If a coffee shop consistently plays '60s folk music, a certain clientele will end up frequenting the place, further cementing the coffee shop's identity. But other potential customers may never return to that same coffee shop because they find that music uninteresting or off-putting. </p>
<p>This form of musical manipulation is used a lot in shopping malls--think of all the stores like Pac Sun that play skater punk or whatever else allegedly caters to their desired customers. Banana Republic does the same with adult contemporary. You can hear the shop before you even see it, and think &quot;This place is for me/is not for me.&quot; If your grandparent were walking right next to you when you passed one of these shops, they'd probably hear the music and immediately recognize that the shop has nothing to offer them, whether in terms of merchandise or social atmosphere. </p>

<p>Music is like audible emotions.  It can move your mood in a certain direction.  This is really important for social settings because it joins our moods and makes us feel in unison.  Those that are not willing or able to feel the mood of the music will likely move away from the party; which further separates everyone into those that are emotionally connected and those who are not. </p>
<p>This is probably one of the main reasons music has been useful for humans through our evolution.  It's an extension of our emotional/social selves and helps us to join together, bond, and unify our emotions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel qualified to answer this as I work at startups during that early growth phase and helped build one of the ones you mentioned, though not at the zero user phase.</p>
<p>Initially after the demo is written the idea is to gather friends, former coworkers, etc to use the service. You see lots of these demo class services around Silicon Valley and San Fransisco because the people in the area are very experimental and love the next hot tech startup. Paid services will often offer the service for free to users that join during this era. The idea is to start to gain &quot;traction&quot; at this phase to show that you are a viable long term product.</p>
<p>Once that is done, you raise a bunch of money to fund your product and start working with partners to promote your service. Typically this would be a paid person to either use your service, or talk about it, all while being on a major channel. Nobody joins Twitter after seeing a 30 second commercial, but seeing stars starting to slowly join, or bands, etc. If you can get this wide distribution going then people will join and put up with a bit of a ghost town feeling because that star/personality they like is on it. The unspoken truth is that the person might only be on the service because they are being paid. :)</p>
<p>Next, once you have these outside people coming in you have to retain them by showing them more than just the paid star or personality. Once they get hooked you can stop paying for power users to promote your product. Scaling back will show you if your growth can beat out your retention losses and then its just a game of keeping growth high while losing as few people as possible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This post pertains primarily to the rise of Reddit more so than the others.</p>
<p>Back when I was a teenager, sites like Break.com, CollegeHumor, and eBaum's World were the places to go for funny stuff. Usually comments on posts and things there would link to other sites, so a word-of-mouth type thing. One of the popular sites in those days was Digg. Digg was a lot like reddit, with user submitted content and up and down votes to determine exposure (IIRC anyway, obviously been a while). Digg was a fantastically popular website in its heyday, and generated tons of traffic. However, they went the way of Icarus and flew too close to the sun. They weren't content with their advertising revenue, and started curating sponsored posts in exchange for money. This led to Digg deleting posts, changing content, and hiding submissions, since the companies paying didn't want their brand associated with anything controversial. It turned very much into a &quot;walled garden,&quot; and word about the new fangled Reddit quickly spread through comment sections and internet forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this seems to be a natural life cycle. The last few years have seen Reddit adopt a similar business model (just google &quot;Online Reputation Management&quot; and see how many companies are in this business now). A few examples from just the last 12 months would be the Rick &amp; Morty viral marketing campaign, the McDonald's Szechuan sauce campaign, tons of The_Donald, and lots of the Resist/Left Wing/Bernie stuff everywhere. The entire Tiny Trumps sub is the best example. Go back and look at some of the original posts on the sub, the user accounts are usually several years old, but only began posting in 2016, and all political. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2016/12/14/how-we-bought-reddit-for-200/#46cf0f4d44a8" target="_blank">This Forbes article</a> goes into greater detail about it. Political astroturfing is nothing new, and both sides are guilty of it. Unfortunately their tug of war over Reddit has a great chance of eventually collapsing the platform.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is basically websites featuring user driven content are cool. People like and use them. Companies that specialize in &quot;online reputation management&quot; create thousands of accounts and leave them dormant for months. When the site reaches a certain level of popularity, these reputation management companies are hired for viral advertising. This becomes standard practice until the bigger content creators no longer use the platform. Disaffected users eventually find each other through forums and comment sections, and the next big website is born. It develops through its infancy, and is eventually sucked back into the web of viral astroturfing. The platform is destroyed, users flee, and the Phoenix is reborn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is also how 4chan took off initially. SomethingAwful had a huge banwave and many users flocked to 4chan. Then years later Attack of the Show did a special on 4chan in 2008 and the site <del>went to crap</del> got even worse with new popularity.</p>
<p>I want to say Facebook benefitted from MySpace being cluttered with music, promotions, and overly decorated personal pages (with auto-playing music), but Facebook also had a slow growth in popularity due to exclusivity. I joined during the university only era, and it felt good to have no one advertising to me or parents on it. Facebook also only overcame MySpace in 2008 when smart phones were fairly new. So I imagine their mobile site helped, though I didn't use it at the time.</p>
<p>As you can see, Facebook had many factors in its growth.</p>
<p>Tinder is self-promoting. &quot;I hooked up with this person Tinder.&quot; <em>Hmmm... maybe I should look into that.</em> I believe the gay versions were popular and came first, but I could be wrong. My roommate used them a lot.</p>

<p>If we ate bacon for the first time, we'd get blown away by the taste no matter how it was cooked or where it's from - it's unique, delicious and memorable. After eating it every day for a month, we might develop a preference for how it's cooked (less crispy etc). After eating it for a year, we might start to prefer specific cuts of bacon or bacon from specific farms etc.</p>
<p>Movie effects that are 'groundbreaking' at the time won't hold up later because we'll have seen it over and over again in other movies since and we will notice the flaws that couldn't be noticed before.</p>
<p>Also, if you watched that effect originally as a kid, you've experienced a lot more life in general and you're more likely to scrutitise what you see in any context.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this.</p>
<p>There are some old games whose graphics at the time were &quot;amazingly realistic&quot; are now so &quot;bad and old&quot; that they are painful to look at.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some other games from the same time period are just fine to watch.</p>
<p>An example is Goldeneye 64 vs Super Mario 64, both great games from around the same time. Goldeneye is still generally fine, but the looks of the characters is pretty painful. Super Mario 64, you wouldn't even really notice much of an issue.</p>
<p>This is because Goldeneye was trying to have as realistic a look as it could at the time, meanwhile Super Mario was designed to have an art style. Neither of these is a bad choice, it's just that what counts as 'realistic' is always getting better and better (meaning that what used to count as realistic looks worse and worse), meanwhile an art style is always just an art style. It is today what it was back then.</p>
<p>Sure, if you remade Super Mario 64 in the modern age, you could make it look astounding and put the old version to shame...but since nobody really does that (HD release exceptions notwithstanding), the ongoing advancement of graphics quality is not as stark for them.</p>
<p>Movies are much the same with their effects. In this case, things can be drawn to 'the little details'. As our technology gets better, the special effects EITHER get cleaner (less random tiny details) or they get more complex (specifically chosen tiny details) but that complexity is designed to help focus you on the correct part of the screen. In either case, this draws attention to the tiny details of older effects that detract from that cleanliness or perfect chaos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What other people said about seeing it when you're young and not having better effects to compare them to both explain a lot.</p>
<p>But also, directors are not dumb. They know when some effects work and when they don't and can distract you from a bad effect when you watch it for the first time, especially when you're caught up in the story and characters. When you watch it again you already know what's going to happen and your eyes might tend to wander from the main action, and you start to notice things.</p>
<p>Look at this scene from Citizen Kane, which is like 70 years old. Watch is then read the rest of my comment:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/uNaDrnxp3L0?t=2m30s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/uNaDrnxp3L0?t=2m30s</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My understanding was that this scene was not shot in a giant arena, and indeed on closer inspection it looks like the background seating is a painting or something, and the perspective of the stage curtains looks a little wrong. But if you saw this in a theater it would just work, because your attention is on the guy in the foreground and the people moving around onstage are just convincing enough to make you believe you're actually looking at a stage in a big arena.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Audience expectations.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, though, that movies are really intended to be seen once: the idea of having your own personal copy and watching it several times is relatively new, and not what movies were designed for. You wouldn't necessarily notice the imperfections, especially if you were distracted by the novelty of the effect.</p>
<p>If you were alive 100 years ago and watching a silent comedy in which bizarre things happen, you'd be too surprised by the bizarre things to notice much else. A man suddenly explodes, leaving nothing but a pile of clothes: you're too busy thinking, &quot;Wait -- what just happened?&quot; to notice the jump cut. But for us these days, that's pretty mundane: if you're used to watching all the various <em>Star Trek</em> series, movies and spin-offs, the idea of people suddenly disappearing is quite normal. Watch that old black-and-white movie now, and the effect is so unsurprising that you're more likely to notice the flaws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some movie vfx look dated because of the way they were converted to consumer viewing formats.</p>
<p>The fx of movies filmed on 35mm film or even high resolution digital would still look amazing and real - if you watched them at the movie theater.</p>
<p>But when converting to consumer HD (up to 1080) digital media - the &quot;fake&quot; parts respond differently to the encoding process - producing a ghosting artifact around the cgi parts - making for a slightly different result between the &quot;real&quot; shot and the added fx. Enough to make the effects noticeably stand out of their surroundings.</p>
<p>The newer 4k digital format changes this - i've only seen a few movies in both 4k and older formats - but it looks like the problem is much reduced or even goes away entirely.</p>
<p>There are other reasons of course - but this in my experience is the major one. If you could find a 4k version of the 10 years old movie you were watching - most likely the vfx would look much closer to the theater experience (i.e. - realistic).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>How much do different levels of drinking harm different age groups? (A few drinks every weekend vs once a month vs heavy regular binge drinking). I feel like there are a lot of biased answers on this topic so I'd love to see your sources!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heavy drinking during those ages seems to have a serious deleterious effect on some very important brain regions:</p>
<p><em>The frontal lobe is associated with higher-order executive functioning, emotional regulation, integration of novel stimuli, and cognitive flexibility. In adults, heavy alcohol use is associated with smaller prefrontal regions (Pfefferbaum et al., 1997). Initial findings in adolescent populations have found that the prefrontal cortex may be more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol than other brain regions, because this area of the brain continues to develop throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Significantly smaller gray- and white-matter volume has been reported in the prefrontal cortex in adolescents with comorbid alcohol use and psychiatric disorders when compared with demographically matched controls (De Bellis et al., 2005). These findings were replicated in a study examining adolescents who did not meet criteria for comorbid mood or attention disorders (Medina et al., 2008).</em></p>
