		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here are focusing on the US, citing US-specific reasons as if this is a US-specific phenomenon when it isn't. Things are exactly the same here in the UK and Europe in general, so whilst I'm sure the reasons cited are contributing factors I think they omit to mention a major factor that is common to the entire developed world: the reduced value of labour. This is long so I'll make a TL;DR at the end.</p>
<p>Pre-ww1 as you have observed, for most families the husband worked for money whilst the wife was primarily concerned with keeping the house in order and caring for their children. The wife may help out with garden or farmwork in some capacity and she may even have some paid employment as a cook or a cleaner on some limited basis if there were older children at home who could care for their siblings but <em>in general</em> the vast majority of the family income was provided by the husband such that the wife didn't <em>have</em> to work. Lots of women did work of course, particularly in areas like service, but not <em>married</em> women. For most the choice was marriage <em>or</em> employment, not both.</p>
<p>This began to change in the interwar years since it had become acceptable for women to enter many professions. Nursing and teaching are perhaps the best examples of this; the reason we consider these as 'female' professions today is because they were among the first where women really came into the foreground and were allowed to do so because it fit with the gender role of caring and childrearing. Women still didn't <em>have</em> to work however, the war and the push for universal suffrage had simply made it both more necessary (due to the reduced workforce) and acceptable (due to changing attitudes) for them to do so. Ultimately however many women did just go back to being housewives for their husbands and that remained economically feasible since few women really had a 'career' still, more an occupation that could be engaged in if they were single or needed less at home due to having no children to care for.</p>
<p>WW2 brought another profound shift for all the same reasons: even further reductions to the workforce of a world which had still not recovered from the previous 'war to end all wars' (bear in mind some poor bastards fought in both) and a realisation of the fact that women actually <em>could</em> do all the same jobs as men saw them really enter the workforce proper for the first time. When the men came home, it was no longer simply a case of them going back to their old lives since many did not wish to, and even if they did the economics of the time made that challenging as decreased supply of goods (Europe continued rationing well into the 1950s) increased their value and thus more work was required to maintain standard of living.</p>
<p>Rather than adjusting back to the old economy which was calibrated for only 50% of the population working though, things were recalibrated to assume everyone was. Thus, once populations recovered in the 1960s you suddenly had 2 people for every job there had been initially. GDP was increased of course and more jobs were created but fundamentally the value of labour had been reduced - all of which was excellent for business but (as others have explained in their criticism of Raeganomics on this point) not so good for the population at large. This effect was only exacerbated then from the 1960s onwards with the push for gender equality, since for the first time women really started to have careers rather than just jobs and began to equal or even overtake men in many fields - so it wasn't even safe for men in highly technical fields anymore where previously they had largely escaped this effect and had continued to be able to act as sole provider as a result of women being unable to enter their sectors of the workforce. By the 1980s the effect was largely complete, with women not only <em>able</em> to have a career but actually <em>expected</em> and all but <em>required</em> to do so - the societal values had shifted but also the economics.</p>
<p>Over the same time period, we also had a massive increase in automation. Whereas you once needed hundreds of men to work a field, you could suddenly buy a machine to do their work for you. The wars brought huge technological advances on top of those of the late 1800s leading up to 1914, further reducing the value of labour before you even consider the effective doubling in supply. Everything is only worth what its purchaser is willing to pay, and this includes labour - it stands to reason if the value of a mans work is reduced because he must compete with a machine <em>and</em> suddenly twice as many other people are available to do the job instead of him then he will be forced to accept lower pay whilst his employer reaps the benefits of both a mechanised workforce <em>and</em> cheap human labour. This effect of automation is only likely to increase, as computers and AI continue to encroach on jobs which people currently occupy today - driving wages down and profits for companies up.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Machines and women entering the workforce increased the supply of labour and thus reduced its value, reducing wages and requiring everyone to work in order to maintain standard of living at pace with technological advancement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Got out of the Navy in Wash. D.C. in 1971 after 7 years as an electronics tech. Did a couple temp jobs in the Wash. DC area for a year and then went to San Jose (now called Silicon Valley) with a wife and a kid. No problem getting a decent high paid technician job paying $14K in 1973. Used the GI bill to buy a house for $28K with a mortgage less than rent on an apartment. Wife never worked (but is extremely frugal). I changed jobs whenever I heard about something more interesting that also paid more and we always seemed to have enough money even to buy a new car and motorcycle every few years. In 1985, sold the first house for $120K and bought new house for $150K keeping the same monthly payment making my cost of housing much lower than renters or first time buyers. Later I cashed in some stock options and bought a rental house with a small negative cashflow, sold it three years later for a profit and bought another house that had a positive cashflow. Finished college getting an EE using the GI bill. Career advanced, taking the most interesting and best paying job. I even took months off between jobs traveling in Asia. Eventually I aged out of the market and sold everything and retired living on social security and investments. </p>
<p>Nothing like that could happen today. I lived in the golden age of employment in technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WARNING: long historical analysis in broad strokes, that will rile people up with reactionary emotional responses and down-votes follows...</p>
<p>Wages and costs were once in parity. The line on the graphs for worst, median, and best salary were basically the same shape as the line for cost to buy a home, cost to buy a car, cost to raise a kid, and so on.</p>
<p>Then a particular and peculiar force took over the economy. People who'd read Ayn Rand (and similar nonsense) in the sixties became the makers of policy in the eighties. This brought us &quot;trickle down economics&quot; and corporate raiding and some other stuff. (Continued after aside...)</p>
<p>{deleted}</p>
<p>So the other key thing that happened is that the racists switched from the Democratic party to the Republican party in the sixties and seventies.</p>
<p>See &quot;Democrat&quot; used to to be the party of &quot;institutions&quot;, so business etc. these &quot;institutions&quot; included big business and racism was institutional before the Civil Rights Movement. This was an accident. If your government and business and your churches are all racist and you are in support of government and church and business, you got racist indoctrination as an underlayment.</p>
<p>The &quot;Republican&quot; was the party of &quot;individuals&quot; which <em>included</em> the Unions and Workers Rights and the Civil Rights Movement itself.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that business interests and workers rights were on opposite sides. </p>
<p>But then the Civil Rights Act passed. Institutions, particularly government and business <em>banished</em> racism.</p>
<p>So what's a racist to do? Well they switched sides.</p>
<p>So racism, my right to tell a ***** to (whatever) became an &quot;individual rights issue&quot;. People switched parties in droves. The fine &quot;Democrat&quot; institution of the KKK etc, wanted to continue on, so the message of the Republican party sounded like what they wanted.</p>
<p>The thing is that a lot of business and social (church) power was carried across the divide because those people <em>owned</em> those institutions and interests.</p>
<p>You have to look at the now-dead politicians of the age, the last to leave office or die being Strom Thurmond, who did the former by doing the latter. The pattern of defection from Democrat to Republican is historically obvious.</p>
<p>Even today, some GOP partisans point out that the KKK was a Democrat institution, but they lack the sense of history to understand why they should be suspicious that the KKK is now on their side.</p>
<p>See the Civil Rights Movement was revolutionary instead of evolutionary, so the structures of power didn't properly realign properly. Basically a lot of people moved &quot;right&quot; all at once, while nobody was moving left.</p>
<p>With the business owners and the unions now in the same party one had to lose status. Businesses had the money. A union couldn't shut down a business without losing the union, but a business could shut down a union and benefit.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that a lot of people just plain old <em>didn't</em> <em>notice</em> that the sides had switched up. The less educated you were, the less likely you were to read the papers, the easier it was to miss the fact that you might now be voting for the wrong side.</p>
<p>Unionists had just <em>nobody</em> to vote for because they &quot;knew&quot; &quot;Democrats were bad for unions&quot;, and largely they <em>were</em>, having had no reason to change their tune. They still had a lot of business interest and whatnot, with no worker base.</p>
<p>So with the individual rights people, the unions, and the businesses all in the same pile the Republicans started dismantling what they'd built for the individuals. Their social support agenda, their actual pro-worker mandate, and their successful Social Security and Welfare programs were not in the interests of their new business buddies.</p>
<p>So the eighties were an orgasm of deregulation and &quot;corporate raiding&quot;.</p>
<p>See the Objectivists came of age but landed in charge of the side that is supposed to protect workers interests. So they just let go of their side of the rope and started pushing it towards the right, and the Democrats were pulling to the right out of habit.</p>
<p>Basically the Republicans leapfrogged over the Democrats so that the entire political spectrum was just slewing to the side we now call &quot;right&quot;.</p>
<p>The democrats eventually realized that someone needed to be on the left, but by then the damage had been done.</p>
<p>At this point, with nobody protecting individual incomes of the working middle class, and even the working upper class, the wage growth lines basically flatten out for everybody who isn't a business <em>owner</em>.</p>
<p>The Objectivists and the business men dismantle regulation.</p>
<p>The Savings and Loan system collapses, and the barriers between the three types of banks (commercial, investment, and <del>housing</del> consumer) disappear. Now banks that are supposed to anchor commercial and individual (worker) interest are free to gamble, which creates a series of bubbles and bursts that the workers and government interests have to support because the firewall around risky investment is <em>gone</em> and investment banks can no longer be allowed to fail because they'll take business and personal interests down in the blast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, medical care has become for profit. Kaiser-Perminante (if memory serves) was the first non not-for-profit hospital, but once that barrier was pierced the HMOs and the for-profit hospitals took over in a tide.</p>
<p>The private institution of higher education has always been a thing, but with deregulation of student loans and the really broad application of the GI bill - and with the lack of political champions for education - tuition became a gold mine for schools. This happened right as the lust-for-advancement of the fifties was dying off. The dream of the twenties, thirties, and forties that science was going to solve everything died during a duck-and-cover exercise somewhere along the way.</p>
<p>Another regulation limited how many media companies any one business interest could control. With the death of that just a few businesses, a few <em>huge</em> businesses, can now &quot;set the message&quot;. &quot;Greed is good&quot;, &quot;they're poor because they are lazy&quot;, &quot;more deregulation will solve the problems of deregulation&quot;, &quot;free markets now&quot; (which is great for business but hell on workers). An endless series of messages that somehow just never understand that working people create value.</p>
<p>Democrats are slowly taking up the interests of the individual workers, the unions, the environment, and all the things that the Republicans dropped.</p>
<p>But terrific damage has been done. The economy and deregulation have left the vast majority of people far, far away from where they are supposed to be.</p>
<p>Meanwhile lots of people are one issue voters, voting for gun rights and electing people who want to remove every other law in their favor as a consequence.</p>
<p>Further still, there are people who've just got a formula for god-and-country or all-democrats-are-thieves (a leftover from when all democrats were businessmen).</p>
<p>And still further the &quot;big government is bad&quot; meme and the &quot;tax and spend&quot; meme that sits like a turd, ignoring the fact that the alternative is &quot;borrow and spend&quot;.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is that someone &quot;scrambled the teams&quot; and orphaned the interests of the moderate worker who just wants a <em>fair</em> wage for <em>everybody</em>. Poor people vote republican because they think of Democrats as &quot;elitists&quot; because in the forties they <em>were</em>; that vote being totally blind to electing people who literally own elite country clubs. Rich people vote republican because it's good for their bank accounts. But then the republicans vote to dismantle <em>their</em> <em>own</em> prior policies that made our workforce so amazing and egalitarian. Meanwhile the Democrats are in a three-decades-long shell-shock identity crisis and our economy is slowly deflating as the money pours into the pockets of the ultra-rich.</p>

<p>Yes, this is USA-Centric. That's where I grew up. But if you look at our history of treaties and our role in the cold war, which was contemporary with this whole thing, and our control of two of the big-four world stock markets, it's pretty easy to see how we <em>exported</em> our worst ideas to the rest of &quot;the western world&quot;. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was alive for lots of this. I was born in 1964. I remember desegregation. I was initially republican. I am democrat now, but for lack of choice. As long as the U.S. has &quot;simple majority rule&quot;, as in you need 50% plus one guy to win, the math just gives any three-way split to the dominant party in the House, so we can't have nice things like a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I didn't &quot;forget about women entering the workforce&quot;, nor the &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;... nor automation. The continuous boogey-man of new workers is a role that has gone to Blacks, Irishmen, Scottsmen, Chinamen, and every other racist label you can think of. By always having some people forced to take slave-labor wages you can drive down the labor market artificially. Whenever fair labor laws change this for the current out-group we've seen economic booms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Kaiser Permanente&quot; is not-for-profit, but &quot;Kaiser Perminante Medical Group&quot; is a wholly owned for-profit entity. These sorts of distinctions are important. Sorry for confusing you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I am not a &quot;Communist&quot;, if you think everybody who references &quot;workers&quot; is a communist then you need to study the history of labor over the last 3 thousand years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, this is &quot;biased&quot;. Facts tend to be biased for having only one actual, factual condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, I didn't include <em>your</em> pet theory, write your own post.</p>

<p>The US was untouched, and had a massive manufacturing base.  This was a time when an unskilled guy could go out into his community, stand next to a conveyor belt, and make a sold middle class salary.  The coal mines, auto plants and factories were all up and running.</p>
<p>Then things changed.  Other countries started to catch up.  Business owners realized they could ship jobs to other countries and slash payroll in half.  Now that there's less jobs, wages are being driven down because workers are getting desperate.</p>
<p>So that's kind of where we're at now.  An economy with fewer jobs at lower wages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My husband had about $2,000 in student loans left and I didn't go to college so we knocked that out ASAP. The plan was a house before pets or kids and we bought one 2 years after we married, in 1984. for $99k with 10% down. Very small (1000sq ft) but cute. That house nearly doubled in value in 8 years and because my husband started and finished his MBA during that time he got promotions and raises and a company car, while I quit to stay home with the kids. Sold that place and bought another smallish place (1350sq ft) with a second bath in a better community for for $235k.</p>
<p>We rode the SF Bay Area real estate boom after that and added a family room but never moved again.

You will see memorials dedicated to the victims of the Nazi regime, though, and the soldiers are seen as victims as much as anyone else. The emphasis is less on honouring brave souls who fought and died for their country, but on comemmorating those who died at the hands of a dictatorial regime.</p>

<p>In Germany there are a lot of roads and buildings referring to people that fought wars BEFORE world war one, mostly the 30 years war and the wars against France.</p>
<p>But finding anything honorable for the soldiers that fought in WW2 is very hard. As many others in this topic posted before, you can find small monuments on almost every graveyard in Germany, where the fallen soldiers are being remembered. </p>
<p>BUT overall in Germany there is nothing like Vets day in the US as we are all learn about the war crimes and the holocaust in school. Even 'innocent' generals like Guderian and Rommel are not remembered anywhere at all. If a German openly stated that he is a fan of Erwin Rommel, he would get weird looks from everyone around him (if he doesn't life in a far-right environment at least). This is a major difference between Germany and the US where you can easily say that you are a fan of Eisenhower or Bernard Montogomery.</p>
<p>The only Germans from WW2 that are really honored in our community are the ones who fought against the Third Reich while it still laste, e.g. Stauffenberg, Sophie and Hans Scholl, Georg Elser.</p>
<p>As for the vets in Germany, mostly everyone (including myself) has or had a gradfather who fought in the second world war. But in contrast to US-vets who probably are proud of their years in service, German vets are mostly ashamed of their time (or some are also still brainwashed by Nazi propaganda and will tell you stories about how amazing Nazi Germany was). My grandfather NEVER told me anything about his time in the Wehrmacht. The only things I remember is that he was able to tell me to close the door in French and Russian. But I first got the hint where he learned these languages after his death in 2004.</p>
<p>Some years ago I found a letter he wrote about his time in service, it is in German, but if anyone is interested, it would be a pleasure for me to translate ist.</p>
<p>EDIT: I made a (very rough, sorry!) translation of the letter, which can be found here: <a href="https://goo.gl/pE1K3u" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/pE1K3u</a>.
EDIT2: German original of the letter (with some gaps from where I was not able to read his hand writing): <a href="https://goo.gl/fWSOcJ" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/fWSOcJ</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most big, official memorials in Germany (including the Memorial Day on November 11th) are dedicated to &quot;all victims of war&quot; or something like that. You'll very rarely find anything honoring soldiers explicitly. If you do, it's probably pretty old and has been left there for historical significance (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Victory_Column" target="_blank">Berlin Victory Column</a> that was built in the mid 19th century but upgraded with references to later wars, including WW2 while the war was still going on... and it very nearly got demolished multiple times for that, which would've been a shame because it's really one of the most important landmarks in the city).</p>
<p>In general most German's don't honor soldiers actively, neither past nor current. We don't do &quot;thank you for your service&quot; or special veteran's privileges or anything like that. People probably care privately about their family members, and the armed forces probably hold small services for people that die in e.g. Afghanistan, but there's no great parades or giant flags over a coffin like you would know in America. We don't really see it as anything more than other people doing a dangerous job that they get appropriately compensated for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My bachelor's thesis and some masters level research related to this topic. Some people have hit different aspects of this quite well already. There is little to no outright, direct memorialization (akin to something like the US WWII memorial in Washington D.C.). The few still-living veterans of the war rarely talk about their memories with anyone who didn't also experience them, so this has made research difficult. Even though it can generally be assumed that every man born between roughly between 1900 and 1945 served in some capacity, such men do not publicly &quot;wear&quot; their time in service. The few de facto WWII veterans associations are small, very private, and often can't be recognized as such by their name alone. Memorials specifically for the German soldiers in WWII don't exist, but that doesn't mean the siblings, children, grandchildren, friends, etc. of that troubled generation don't seek to honor and respect them despite the stain they all bore. As was correctly pointed out, WWI and Franco-Prussian War monuments often serve as proxy memorials. As for the victim memorials, it very much depends who you ask as to whether they think the soldiers should/are included in that category; regardless covert memorialization happens their far less frequently. In addition to this general societal discomfort with publicly affiliating with the quagmire of WWII, yes the issue of Neo-Nazi appropriation is also always a concern. The German government generally seeks to give them as little to affiliate with as possible. </p>
<p>Sidenote: I suppose it's not suprising the 'clean Wehrmacht' issue was brought up. The scholarly evidence is overwhelming that the Wehrmacht was complicit, instrumental even, in the crimes of the Nazis <em>as an organization</em> but no it does not mean every individual was an evil, Jew-hating Nazi. Funnily enough German academia and I think society came to terms with the dirty Wehrmacht earlier and easier than a lot of Americans did ( some American military scholars and history buffs often have a peculiar erection for the German Army). The fact that the word cuck was thrown around shows you that this issue inevitably draws in less savory extreme-right sorts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>What tends to be more of a problem are things like water consumption, nutrients pulled from the soil, the amount of fertilizer (and thus the amount of energy you need to use to make said fertilizer), pesticides used, and any biproducts the plant might make.  But those aren't necessarily linked to calorie count.</p>
<p>Edit: Should have differentiated between energy costs in terms of the energy the plant consumes and stores vs the energy cost to make things like fertilizers.  However the later part isn't linked to the actual amount of calories that the plant can store.   I kind of wrote things quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Some foods like beef and palm oil contribute to habitat destruction that imperils many plant an animal species, on top of producing large amounts of CO2. Tropical fruits like bananas tend to have a big environmental impact both because they grow in sensitive habitats like rain forests, plus they have to be transported great distances to reach consumers.

<p>For protein from beef cattle, <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/660S/T2.expansion.html" target="_blank">the ratio of energy input to protein output is 40:1</a>. </p>
<p>&quot;This energy input is <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/660S.full" target="_blank">more than 11 times greater than that for grain protein production</a>, which is about 2.2 kcal of fossil energy input per 1 kcal of plant protein produced. This is for corn and assumes 9% protein in the corn.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously not everyone gets protein from corn, but &quot;Soybeans derive about 35 to 38 percent of their calories from protein compared to approximately 20 to 30 percent in other legumes&quot; <a href="http://www.soyconnection.com/soy-foods/nutritional-composition" target="_blank">Source</a>. </p>
<p>&quot;Grain-fed beef production takes 100,000 liters of water for every kilogram of food. Raising broiler chickens takes 3,500 liters of water to make a kilogram of meat.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, an ingredient being high in calories doesn't in itself make it environmentally costly.  Calories from plants are pretty much manifested from sunlight and atmospheric gasses, which are free, and fertilizer, which is not too expensive.  You need 1500 or 2000 calories per day no matter what anyways.  </p>
<p>To understand the costs of a food you really need to consider each ingredient as the product of its own unique circumstances.  There is no perfect grand unifying rule-- it depends on what it is, how it's grown, and where it comes from.  </p>
<p>Just some examples:  A calorie of beef emits as much greenhouse gasses as 5 calories of potatoes.  A calorie of wheat costs more land than a calorie of corn, but corn grows on more productive land, might displace more biota and certainly costs more water.  Lamb emits more greenhouse gases than pork, but pigs suffer more.  A calorie of almond oil costs a bunch of California water and a calorie of palm oil costs rain forest.  In December, asparagus in Peru is tremendously less costly than asparagus in the USA.  Chicken emits less methane than grass-fed beef, but costs 10 times its calories in grains that could be used otherwise.</p>
<p>In general, meat is more costly than vegetables, which are more costly than pulses and grains.  Foods grown locally and nonperishables are less costly than food coming from afar and foods that need refrigeration.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be intimidating to research your staples.  Most of us don't really eat that many things as major food sources and there's lots of information out there.  Or just try to eat peasant fare-- hearty grains, pulses, and local vegetables for bulk calories with vegetables and meats thrown in more sparingly for pleasure and nutrition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You still need ~2000 calories a day. Whether that comes from a bucket of broccoli or from sticks of butter, it's 2000 calories. Based on our original assumption, 1 cup of butter would cause way more damage than 1 cup of broccoli, due to the differences in calorie content, but the total damage would be the same.</p>
<p>But as I said, that's wrong, and it's actually really complicated. In general, you want local food and plant-based food. These two articles delve into the details:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because light is straight and bullets follow an arc (it's where the term ballistics or ballistic flight come from).  The <a href="http://bestar15scopes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bullet_drop.png" target="_blank">barrel is aimed upwards</a> so it &quot;tosses&quot; the bullet up to or through the light path of the scope at one or two distances.  The shooter chooses the distances, in advance, when setting aim, then either adjusts his scope for any other distances, or makes an adjustment to the sight picture to vary the range.   In the language of shooting, the near distance chosen is the range at which the gun is &quot;sighted&quot; &quot;zeroed&quot; or &quot;sighted in&quot; and the cross hairs mark the intended point of impact.  </p>
<p>That's why accurately estimating distances have long been a part of the skill set required to be a good shot (so the proper distance adjustment to the sights could be made).  </p>
<p>On older guns (using slow, heavy bullets that need to arc more at long distances), the <a href="http://www.imfdb.org/images/a/aa/QuigleySharps3.jpg" target="_blank">rear sight</a> was designed to rise significantly above the barrel, so the gun's angle would rise pretty considerably.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For instance the front sight may be raised above the barrel, but so is the rear, making the sight picture straight. By raising the rear sight you have to angle the weapon up more, which help compensate for bullet drop caused by gravity. At medium and long range the sight is aiming far above the target and it is gravity pulling the bullet towards the ground that puts it on a ballistic trajectory that puts the bullet on target. </p>
<p>You can either pre-sight the weapon for a particular range, or use sights with delimiting lines pre-set for different ranges. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is called parallax, and it is accounted for by either the sight or the shooter.</p>
<p>The center line of any rifle sight will not be quite parallel to the barrel, and will be pointed slightly down from parallel so that the line of the sight intersects with the line of the path of the bullet at some range.</p>
<p>This range can be variable based on the specific sight and the desires of the shooter.</p>
<p>As line of the sight is straight, but the path of the bullet is a curved parabola, there will frequently be 2 ranges where the Point of Impact (POI) and Point of Aim (POA) are zeroed. </p>
<p>Before the first zero range, the POI is below the POA, as the bullet hasn't started falling much as is pretty close to the straight line of the barrel.</p>
<p>After the first zero range, but before the second zero range, the POI is above the POA. Somewhere in here is he maximum hight over POA.</p>
<p>After the second zero range, the POI has fallen to below the POA again, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The shooter will need to either adjust the sight so that the POA is zeroed with the POI at the range of the desired shot or offset their reticle (&quot;crosshair&quot;) so that they know where the POI is in their scope. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An important thing to remember is that when we say &quot;the speed of light&quot; we mean &quot;the speed of light in a vacuum&quot;. Gravitational waves always travel at the same speed, as far as we know.</p>
<p>In order for there to be an index of refraction for gravitational waves, it helps to understand why there is an index of refraction for electromagnetic waves. From a wave phenomenon perspective, as the oscillating field enters the material, it interacts with atoms, causing them to oscillate in response, which in turn allows them to radiate light with the same frequency. This interaction slows down the propagation of the wave. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiHN0ZWE5bk" target="_blank">great explanation with more detail here</a>).</p>
<p>In order for the same thing to happen for a gravitational wave, it would have to enter a region where its oscillation drives masses to oscillate in a way that re-radiates a gravitational wave. However, because gravity is so weak compared to electromagnetism, anything light enough to be oscillated is not going to generate a strong wave, and anything massive enough to generate a strong wave is not going to be very responsive. This means that there's not really anything (that we know of, at any rate) which can really affect the propagation of the gravitational wave. There are some other issues as well which have to do with the fact that gravitational waves actually change the shape of space-time, rather than propagate through it like electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>All of these things means there isn't really anything which will actually absorb gravitational waves, and related to that, there isn't really anything which can slow them down.</p>
<p>That's my understanding - I don't work with gravitational waves but about half of my department does, so I might have some details off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational waves follow the rule that they travel at the speed of causality. The whole idea behind the speed of light is a terrible idea in every way because light doesn't determine the speed which we actually call 'the speed of light' instead light obeys a 'speed limit' that is set by the an entirely different effect that has nothing to do with light, and light just happens to travel at that speed in a vacuume, in other mediums light travels at a different speed so 'the speed of light' is like saying &quot;The speed of the Bell X-1&quot; instead of saying &quot;Mach 1&quot;, the Bell X-1 moved at speeds other than Mach 1 in many cases yet we could use it's top speed as a replacement for Mach number, but it would be inaccurate because it isn't true except for certain cases. Likewise the speed of light is a stupid term that compares the speed of causality to the speed at which light travels in one specific case, there are many cases where the speed of light is not equal to the speed of causality, and we should really start using a different term to avoid this kind of confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the above comments have stated, there are ways to distinguish the signals you are not looking for (noise) from those you are indeed looking for. Using general relativity and physical models, physicists were able to predict exactly what the signal(s) of passing gravitational waves emitted by two merging black holes was going to look like. This is why two detectors were constructed hundreds of miles apart from each other. Signals that show up on one detector (noise generated from a passing car for example) but do not show up on the other detector, unless extreme coincidence is at play, are treated as noise because any passing gravitational waves will influence both detectors in a similar fashion, at almost the exact same time, depending on which direction the gravitational waves propagate from. </p>
<p>Combine the methods of discriminating against noise and actually having algorithms that know what a black hole &quot;blip&quot; is supposed to look like makes mundane things such as passing cars a non-issue when it comes to false-positives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jaysis. Lots of comments on here from people who don't know WTF they are talking about. </p>
<p>MD here. Long and short of it: we <strong>do not</strong> know. Saying something is &quot;good for you&quot; or &quot;bad for you&quot; is very challenging, given the huge variability from person to person. You know those commercials that say &quot;consult with your doctor before trying this exercise program&quot;? That's why. Reddit skews young and healthy, but the people I see are old, overweight, and sick. </p>
<p>There are numerous studies showing that consuming large volumes of caffeinated coffee increases longevity and improves quality of life. Is that because of caffeine? Antioxidants? Social effects? Some confounding variable like a good job or exciting hobby that causes people who would be happier anyway to consume more coffee?</p>
<p>We know that stress leads to increased levels of hormones like epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol. These hormones have wide-ranging effects beyond their immediate effects on the heart. Likewise, we know that exercise has a huge range of effects, from promoting the development of new neurons to promoting lower weight and better cholesterol levels that reduce the risk of atherosclerosis (one of the major forms of disease worldwide). </p>
<p>In a young person like yourself, drinking caffeine in large amounts will drive your heartrate up. Probably not a big deal. But in general, young people get their caffeine from drinks that have tons of sugar or fat (soft drinks or Starbucks-style abominations), so docs tend to make broad statements like &quot;drink less caffeine.&quot; Does that mean we know shit? No. Does that mean it's actually bad for you? Who knows. </p>
<p>Exercise is <em>probably</em> good for you, but if you're a marathoner with a massively hypertrophied heart and a resting heartrate in the 40s, does that make you much healthier than someone who just exercises a moderate amount, doesn't have bad cholesterol, or generally takes care of their health? I don't know. In fact, it may put you at a disadvantage. Given that most of the health problems in the US revolve around obesity and its consequences, though, docs are very likely to recommend exercise. </p>
<p>Could all of this change? It sure could! Could some forms of chemical stress on the heart be good for it? Probably! But in the meantime, I'll tell you the same things I tell everyone: get some exercise and avoid stress. Life just feels better when you do that stuff. </p>
<p>And everyone here who pulls out a study showing one finding or another: I can probably find a study showing the opposite.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you exercise, your body is responding to external stress, and raises its metabolic response appropriately. Not only does your heart rate increase, but your peripheral arteries dilate (allowing blood to flow to your muscles), while your other unconscious processes (such as digestion) are put on hold and receive less blood. (This is why you can get stomach cramps if you exercise too soon after a large, heavy meal, and why coffee can make you need to poop even if you haven't eaten anything in a while.) Additionally, certain chemicals are released and energy is converted from storage to active use and then utilized to exercise.</p>
<p>When your rate is chemically increased, none of these responses occur. Your body may be forced to enter &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode, but the energy being produced isn't <em>going</em> anywhere, and is typically converted to visceral fat (no matter where it came from) if it's not used. It's exactly the same reason a high-stress environment combined with a sedentary lifestyle can result in abdominal obesity.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/661psu/slug/dgeybme" target="_blank">another comment</a> mentioned vasoconstriction, which is the constriction of blood vessels to increase blood pressure. Caffeine is both a diuretic (makes your body excrete more water) and vasoconstrictor (makes your blood vessels narrow). While it is true that a diminished blood volume can offset the effects on blood pressure that vasoconstriction has, the increased heart rate raises BP further. Your heart is pushing harder against a tighter space. This damages the arteries.</p>
<p><strong>Edit^(2):</strong> I'm talking about straight caffeine. I can't recall the dosages off the top of my head, but 1-2 cups of coffee a day aren't really going to push your BP up very high unless you have a caffeine sensitivity (like me). Ten coffees over the course of a day? Yeah, you're probably seeing some shit. <em>Note that everyone's physiology is slightly different</em>, and caffeine resistance is definitely a thing you can develop. If you're concerned, pick up a home BP cuff (most drugstores sell an automatic cuff; it might be a little pricey but if you're worried it can be worth it) or talk to your PCP.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Exercise, by definition, is the use of external physical stimuli to increase performance. Using chemicals (caffeine, atropine, epinephrine, etc.) to induce the exercise response without actually exercising doesn't produce any results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the increased heart rate that's the benefit, it's all the other things that's happening along with it when you're exercising that together creates the net benefit. Going by heart rate is because it's the easiest metric to tell if you're getting a sufficient amount of exercise.</p>
<p>When you're exercising, your body needs to deliver more oxygen (and thus blood) to your muscle tissue. This results in the blood vessels opening up and the heart rate increasing to push that blood along. In general, your blood pressure doesn't increase by much, if at all. Your heart is working faster, but it's not working harder per squeeze.</p>
<p>Things like stress or certain drugs increase your heart rate, but they don't result in a corresponding opening of the blood vessels. In fact, in the case of some drugs, the opposite will occur and your blood vessels will constrict. With your heart pushing faster through blood vessel or same or smaller diameter, this results in an increase in blood pressure. It's that chronic exposure to the increased blood pressure that can cause problems - it stresses the muscles in the heart and the blood vessel linings. And this is all because the heart is having to squeeze harder than before due to this increased pressure.</p>
<p>So in short, exercise good cause heart rate is matched by opening blood vessels. Other sources don't open blood vessels, so your blood pressure rises, which is bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Most of us will be familiar with the experience of silently talking to ourselves in our head. Perhaps you’re at the supermarket and realise that you’ve forgotten to pick up something you needed. “Milk!” you might say to yourself. Or maybe you’ve got an important meeting with your boss later in the day, and you’re simulating – silently in your head – how you think the conversation might go, possibly hearing both your own voice and your boss’s voice responding.</p>
<p>This is the phenomenon that psychologists call “inner speech”, and they’ve been trying to study it pretty much since the dawn of psychology as a scientific discipline. In the 1930s, the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky argued that inner speech developed through the internalisation of “external”, out-loud speech. If this is true, does inner speech use the same mechanisms in the brain as when we speak out loud?</p>
<p>We have known for about a century that inner speech is accompanied by tiny muscular movements in the larynx, detectable by a technique known as electromyography. In the 1990s, neuroscientists used functional neuroimaging to demonstrate that areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area), which are active when we speak out loud, are also active during inner speech. Furthermore, disrupting the activity of this region using brain stimulation techniques can interrupt both “outer” and inner speech.</p>
<p>So the evidence that inner speech and speaking out loud share similar brain mechanisms seems pretty convincing. One worry, though, is whether the inner speech we get people to do in experiments is the same as our everyday experience of inner speech. As you might imagine, it’s quite hard to study inner speech in a controlled, scientific manner, because it is an inherently private act.</p>
<p>Typically, studies have required participants to repeat sentences to themselves in their heads, or, sometimes, count the syllables in words presented on a computer screen. These lack both the spontaneity of typical inner experiences and the conversational quality (think of the conversation with your boss) and motivational purposes (“Milk!”) of inner speech. Although the experience is undoubtedly different for everyone (not everyone reports having “conversations” in their head, for example), what does seem clear is that inner speech is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.</p>
<p>Why does it matter whether we have an accurate understanding of what’s going on in our brains when we use inner speech?</p>
<p>One reason is that understanding typical inner experience may be the key to understanding more unusual inner experiences. For example, psychologists have argued that hearing voices (“auditory verbal hallucinations”) might simply be a form of inner speech that has not been recognised as self-produced (although there are also important competing theories). Neuroscientists have found some evidence in favour of this theory. When they scanned the brains of people who reported hearing voices, they discovered that many of the same areas of the brain are active during both auditory hallucinations and inner speech. Broca’s area, for example, is often active in people when they’re hearing voices.</p>
<p>But if we really want to know what the difference between what happens in the brain during inner speech and voice hearing – and how inner speech might become hearing voices – then first we need to understand what our internal talk is usually like. A recent study by researchers in Finland attempted to address flaws in previous brain-imaging studies of inner speech. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they studied the difference between activity in the brain when participants experienced an auditory verbal hallucination, and when they deliberately imagined hearing the same voice. In this way, they controlled for aspects of the experience such as the sound and the content of the voice.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>They found the main difference between the two conditions was the level of activation in a cortical region known as the supplementary motor area (SMA), which contributes to the control of movement. When participants heard voices, there was significantly less activation in the SMA, which fits with previous hypotheses suggesting that recognising actions as one’s own might rely on signals from motor cortical areas reaching sensory areas of the brain.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is to say that understanding what happens in the brain is the only, or the most important, aspect of research into hearing voices. We also need to understand what the experience is like, how we can help people who are distressed by it, and when there’s a need for psychiatric care. But to do any of this, we first need to know what typical inner speech is like, and the underlying neuroscience is part of that understanding.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm only a first year studying educational psychology, but I'm pretty sure this relates to Lev Vygotsky's ideas about language. Language is one of the most important mental tools, as it plays a major role in socialisation as well as cognition. We use it to regulate our thoughts and structure our intellectual activity. When you use the voice in your head to narrate a thought process, it's called private/ internalised speech. This can be observed in young children, who often talk to themselves aloud to help them work out a problem. This is gradually internalised as a child develops, but even as an adult sometimes reading something out loud can help you understand it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other things which do have that transition zone of &quot;syrupy&quot; (e.g. syrup) are much more complex substances than water.  Inside them, there are many different types of molecules - hydrocarbons, sugars, fats, actual cells, etc. - which contribute to a gradually changing viscosity.  Water, however, is (for our purposes) just one, uniform molecule, so we see it melt and freeze at a specific temperature.</p>
<p>In chemistry, those other things which have a gradual viscosity change would be called something different - a solution, a suspension, or probably a combination with all the many different actual substances that make up that syrup, honey, molasses, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There actually is, it's given the term &quot;slush&quot; and refers to a bunch of small ice crystals that are 'suspended' in near-freezing temperature water in the same way mud can be suspended in water and make it soupy. These can flow downhill in a much-slower-than-normal-water flow, although they're not sticky and they can't pull or stretch out like, say, molasses can.</p>
<p>But the answer as to why water doesn't get sluggish <em>all by itself</em> is because of its chemistry. The molecules in water are one of a gas (water vapour, not relevant here), liquid (standard room temperature) or solid, and the transition between those last two is an either-or sort of yes-no thing. </p>
<p><strong>Either</strong> a molecule of water is in liquid form and behaves among other similar molecules like a liquid that can easily slide and flow and move around, <strong>or</strong> it's locked into a solid crystal like a needle of ice or a bit of snow.</p>
<p>Other chemical compounds such as many oils behave differently when they experience temperature change, or have a mix of chemicals in them that contribute to such a behaviour change (maple syrup's an example), but water keeps to this simple one-sort-of-state model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water's bulk properties are determined almost entirely by the hydrogen bonding and, due to the simplicity of the molecule, all of the hydrogen bonds have a similar potential.</p>
<p>This results in very abrupt phase transitions because when the average kinetic energy is high enough to break the H-bonds then any particular molecule has the same potential to constantly break and reform them (i.e. be in a liquid state), but once it drops below, suddenly any molecule has the same potential to be H-bonded to an adjacent molecule (i.e., be in a solid state).</p>
<p>If you look at something like various simple alcohols, they also have a hydrocarbon tail, which gives more ways for the molecules to interact with each other.   So when it's cold enough for <em>this</em> particular interaction to be stable, there's still <em>that</em> other one that's going to keep everything moving.   Thus an increase in viscocity.  And then length of the chain matters.  If you have both methanol and isopropanol in a dry ice bath, the iso will be visibly syrupy while the methanol is pretty much the same as room temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is why pouring hot water into a mug sounds subtly different than pouring cold water into a mug.</p>
<p>That said, the difference in viscosity is rather slight compared to substances generally thought of as &quot;syrupy&quot;.  (See other answers for explanation of crystals, and pure vs suspended substances)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else said that it's because &quot;syrupy&quot; liquids are still liquids - they fill their container like a liquid.  There's also there's no temperature point where water goes from liquid to syrupy. it's not like a continum like gas to liquid to solid is. it just depends on the make up.</p>
<p>Just a fun fact - some people can't drink liquid water due to medical reasons such as a poorly working neck muscles so they have classifications of liquids. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thin liquids - Basic water and coffee, juice, milk,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nectar thick - the level of OF thickness is similar to hot syrup since if you stick a spoon it in and take it out the liquid will just run off the spoon but the liquid doesn't splash like water when you pour it. It just is thicker </p>
</li>
<li>Honey-like - so it's like honey. If you dip in a spoon and the liquid doesn't come all the way off and coats the spoon, its honey-like level thick </li>
</ol>
<p>If you get to like a pudding consistency it's no longer a liquid </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
