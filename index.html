		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This has been proven in animal models and strongly suggested by human studies (it's difficult to find volunteers to deliberately get infected for study). From the Business Insider article <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cold-medicine-can-make-a-cold-or-the-flu-worse-2015-1" target="_blank">Your Cold Medicine Could Be Making Things Worse</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one study of people with the common cold, researchers found that those who took fever reducers shed more of the virus than people who didn't. And a recent study of people with one strain of the flu found that the more doses of fever-reducing medicine someone received, the longer they stayed sick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A confounding factor is that rest is really important for recovery. If symptoms keep you from sleeping well, taking symptom suppressors before bed will speed recovery because of the better sleep. Or, taking symptom suppressors during the day and then NOT resting because you feel OK enough to be active will slow down recovery because you are not resting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The reality of it is that the cold is a very minor sickness and actually, all the symptoms we experience are a great overreaction by our immune system.  The science community is not sure why the body reacts so strongly to colds, but suspect it's kind of a &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; approach from our bodies (though there are some people that are asymptomatic when it comes to colds).  </p>
<p>Cold medicines don't shorten colds, but, as you mentioned, only reduce the severity of the reactions.  It doesn't really &quot;hinder&quot; anything concerning recovery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Actually, healthy human lungs are extremely efficient, you’re just looking at the process from the wrong end.</p>
<p>You are correct that when we breathe in, the air contains roughly 21% O2, and when we breathe out, the O2 concentration is down to about 16%. But, look at what is happening to your blood - when it comes into the lung, it still holds about 75% of the total amount of oxygen that can be carried (either by hemoglobin or dissolved within the water component of blood)*; when it leaves the lung, it is 98–100% saturated. Laws of chemistry and physics prevent you from being able to absorb any more oxygen.</p>
<p>Think of it like going to the grocery store to restock your pantry - you don’t buy out the whole grocery store just because the food is there, you just buy what you can effectively store and use.</p>
<p>*Venous blood still holds 75% of the total oxygen it can carry, which shows that our other tissues can only extract about 25% of the oxygen drawn in as we breathe. We don’t use most of the oxygen that we breath in.</p>

CO2 in our system makes our blood serum acidic, and it needs to stay with in a strict pH range. That's why in extreme diabetic episodes people tend to hyperventilate. The body is burning fat which makes the blood more acidic than it would be burning glucose (ketoacidosis), and hyperventaaltion is necessary to compensate.

<p>I remember the 98-100% saturated thing from lectures. My question is, what are athletes doing on the sidelines with the mask that they're breathing through? If it's 98-100% oxygenation with 21% o2, I can't imagine a mask giving even 100% o2 makes a difference. So are they just increasing their oxygen reservoir of the lungs?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The particle itself was never of any particular relevance, except for potential weeding out potential grand-unified theories.  The importance of the discovery of the boson was that it confirmed that the Higgs FIELD was there, which was the important thing.  For about the last 50 years, particle physics has constructed itself upon the un-verified assumption that there must be a Higgs field.  However, you can't experimentally probe an empty field, so to prove it exists you must give it a sufficiently powerful &quot;smack&quot; to create an excitation of it (a particle).  </p>
<p>So the boson itself was pretty meaningless (after all, it was at a pretty stupid high energy). But it confirmed the existance of the Higgs field and thus provided a &quot;sanity check&quot; for 50 years of un-verified assumption.</p>
<p>Which for particle physicists was something of a bittersweet sigh of relief.  Bitter because it's written into the very mathematical fabric of the Standard Model that it must fail at SOME energy, and having the Higgs boson discovery falling nicely WITHIN the Standard Model means that they haven't seemingly learned anything new about that high energy limit. Sweet because, well, they've been out on an un-verified limb for a while and verification is nice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The greatest significance of finding the Higgs, is that now we can stop looking for it.  Although most physicists were certain that it existed, there was always an outside chance that maybe it <em>didn't</em> exist.  That would have upended the cart, and the longer it took to find, the more nervous people got that maybe the reason we couldn't find it is because it wasn't there.  </p>
<p>This would not have been the first time something like this happened.  Michelson and Morley went looking for the aether (or rather, the speed of Earth moving through it).  Their failure to find it eventually led to Einstein's Relativity Theories that along with QM completely changed how we view the universe.  </p>
<p>So the significance is that we are not facing a revolution in science because the Higgs was missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Consider the brain. Natural selection has determined we need to process things very quickly to react to them. In this way, the brain abstracts an output of senses into a &quot;symbol&quot; that it can process readily.</p>
<p>When observing children's pictures of houses, you will notice that after five years old or so, they will nearly <em>always</em> put a door knob on a door. Even if it's more of a handle or something else, they will put the thing there that their mind associates with &quot;mechanism for opening doors&quot;.</p>
<p>This makes drawing difficult because you need to see the world without abstraction in order to replicate it. One exercise to do so is to draw the &quot;vase or two faces&quot; picture while saying the part of the face you are drawing until you can do both sides without messing up. It forces you to remove the association of the words with the image you are making. As you get into this mental state, you will begin to lose the symbolic association your mind makes with the items in the world and see them for the shapes and colors they are.</p>
<p>This is like a grander scale of losing track of the meaning of a word. It's losing track of the meaning of everything you see while simultaneously really seeing it for the first time.</p>
<p>If you're interested in more, the book &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot; is a great read. Sure, left/right brain stuff is scientifically inaccurate, but as a metaphor for linear vs abstract thought, it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The human mind has an amazing ability to take a single word and understand a complete concept.
Take the word &quot;chair&quot; for example. We all just know what a chair is. Size, color, shape and many other features may be in the background but your mind instantly has the idea &quot;chair&quot;. This is the default position in your mind as it is most likely what you need.
However if you start repeating the word &quot;chair&quot; your mind refocuses on the actual word. The sound, the intonation, the break down of the parts of of the word.
This feature of the human mind, the ability to move from a lager abstract concept of a single word to a specific breakdown of the same word is very interesting to anyone trying to create computers that actually &quot;think&quot; like humans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you hear a word, your brain isn't really paying attention to the sounds, it is translating those sounds into an idea, and is primed to put it together with other words to form a more complex idea.</p>
<p>When you repeat a word over and over, your brain stops recognizing it as a word, and it breaks down into sounds that really have nothing to do with what the word means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The receptors in your eyes start to get too used to the stimulus and send less new information to the brain. That is why eyes move around a lot when looking at anything such as when reading and looking at television. Sounds will be similar because it would be the receptors receiving the same exact stimulus over and over again so your brain begins to focus less on the whole words and the meaning becomes fuzzy much like an image becomes less focused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's a way of making sure they use &amp; exercise their musculoskeletal system, which requires it for nerve pathing, muscle memory, etc. Any simple stimulus is enough to trigger a desire for a movement. Fear, happiness, boredom, etc. They need to learn their bodies and grow them. Constant movement is helpful for that. </p>
<p>When you're older you don't have this energy. Presumably you need it to accomplish your work or tasks of the day. Dancing and singing as an adult is also disruptive and obstructive to most eating areas and activities of daily living. Flailing arms and jumping around when you're 6 ft tall is pretty hazardous.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can be explained using basic principles from the science of behavior analysis. If you want to know more, google avoidance and escape learning. I hold a BS and MS in behavior analysis and have studied it for 7 years.</p>
<p>Assuming the sound your alarm makes is aversive, one of two things will happen.
1) You will wake up when it goes off and shut it off immediately (such is the case for me). You respond to remove the aversive stimulus while it is present, i.e., escape it.
2) You wake up prior to the alarm and turn it off, thereby avoiding the aversive stimulus. Your response would be considered avoidance because you acted prior to the presentation of the aversive stimulus and your response prevented its occurrence.</p>
<p>Now you might be asking yourself, &quot;How does my body know to wake up before the alarm?&quot;</p>
<p>When you set an alarm time you have never been exposed to, your body will not wake up prior to the alarm. What happens is that waking up and turning it off will reinforce that response (a classic example of negative reinforcement). Your body will gradually come under the control of the reinforcement contingency. Sometimes you wake up after the alarm sounds 3 times, sometimes twice, sometimes 4 etc. This is a natural variation in responding. One day you will wake up before the alarm due to that variability. When you turn it off prior to the alarm ringing, you avoid the aversive stimulus, and reinforce waking up before the alarm. Soon enough you'll regularly wake up before it.</p>
<p>Now the reason you can wake up before the alarm on different days, despite different times, is because you have been exposed to each of the various times repeatedly and have come under the control of the overall contingency of reinforcement. You do not need to be consciously aware of a contingency to come under its control. You are completely unaware of the vast majority of contingencies that control your behavior, this one is not any different.</p>
<p>P.S.
People who sleep through their alarm obviously do not find the alarm aversive, and therefore do not act to remove or avoid it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Waking up just before the alarm is a striking coincidence and therefore much more memorable than waking up well before the alarm. It's natural to then overestimate how often that happens, and conclude that it's more frequent than it would be by chance.</p>
<p>Edit: In response to some comments - I'm not saying the memory bias explains all cases, just that it's something to take into account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ll give this a go because the answers seem to be lacking.  How the brain understands and perceives time is poorly understood but there is evidence for some parts of the big picture. There are regions of the brain associated with time, the striatum and hippocampus. Of these, the striatum monitors the passing of time while  hippocampus is primarily responsible for memory and the transfer from short-term memories into long-term. The question that Op is asking is how the brain can anticipate some event in the future.  The answer is that there are “timekeeping” neurons in the striatum that “tick away”, depolarizing at regular intervals. Other parts of the brain “pay attention” to these neurons and contribute to our perception of time passing. </p>
<p>Together, the memories related to when you have to wake up on a given day are connected to the ones watching the seconds go by. Thus we have a mechanism where your brain “knows” and can anticipate when to wake up. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some alarm clocks make a very faint <em>click</em> sound shortly before sounding the alarm. You won't normally hear it unless it's very quiet, but it's loud enough to condition you to wake just before the annoying alarm sound.</p>
<p>This won't be the case with every alarm clock, but I noticed it myself some time ago after getting a new alarm clock. Shortly after getting the new clock, I started waking up right before the alarm sounded. Stranger still, it would even happen on the mornings after daylight savings adjustments, so I couldn't think how my internal circadian rhythm knew it was time to wake up. Also, when my alarm was off, I wouldn't wake up right before the normal alarm time.  </p>
<p>Then, one morning when I was already half-awake and just waiting silently for my alarm, I heard it.  A faint <em>click</em> two or three seconds before the alarm sounded, and when I heard it, I felt my body wake up.  It was an ah-ha moment.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It seems like I'm not the only one who has noticed this effect:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as science goes, your guess is a good as anyone else's.   Most astrobiologists believe that there are many ways to form life, with many varying modes of transmitting genetic information or for maintaining disequilibrium with the environment; however, whether or not it is likely for life to form based entirely off of non-carbon chain molecules? - that is a huge point of contention.   The most likely element (after carbon) life could be based on would be silicon; however, silicon bonds are weaker than those of carbon, so the range of possible stable molecules that silicon can make are thought to be much less than that of carbon.</p>
<p>Personally (completely conjecture here) I do think it is possible to have life based on other elements somewhere in the universe.  However, I expect the overwhelming majority of cases to be based off of carbon.  The way I see it, it is a probabilities game...and carbon is just such a versatile element, it allows for an immensely larger number of ways and environments in which it could initiate life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You will get better answers if you specify what you mean by life. Very simple microorganisms could be made from almost anything. Large, complex life similar to us is a much different question. Our bodies require encoding a large amount of information. This means either very large molecules like DNA,  or some extremely complex way of combining many small molecules into a stable structure and orchestrating them, which is unlikely. Carbon is the only element which can make giant, stable molecules which can also easily be modified to suit different roles, like proteins. This is because it's on the first row of the periodic table, and thus has no inner electron shells, allowing strong covalent bonds of several different kinds.  You can't build a large foldable protein out of anything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They were able to have the amoeba create ATP using the arsenic instead of phosphorous. They still used carbon, but it was a pretty big breakthrough at the time showing how an element we thought was required for life, wasn't really necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

A much thinner lens can bend the light the required number of degrees because the light hasn't spread out to an aviator's eyeglasses sized area before the lens has to capture it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lens for near vision has the shape of a slice taken off a sphere, like the blue part in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Spherical_cap_diagram.tiff/lossless-page1-1011px-Spherical_cap_diagram.tiff.png" target="_blank">this</a> image. The size of the sphere depends on how good your eyes are: The worse your sight, the smaller the sphere needs to be. But whether you wear eyeglasses or contacts, you need lenses made from the same sphere. The thickness of the slice however will increase if you need a larger lens.</p>
<p>Of course, lenses aren't really made out of a whole glass sphere, even though their pricetag might suggest that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real reason is that the &quot;Coke bottle&quot; lens are either thick on the edges for nearsightedness, or thick in the middle for those people who are farsighted is because of the size of the lens. Either way, its because an eyeglass lenses is much much larger than a contact that makes the eyeglass lens thick. The prescription strength comes from the difference between the front curve and the back curve of the lens, whether its a contact or eyeglass lens.  In the center of the lenses you can make the lens as thin as you want, although Federal regulations say 2.2 mm for safety reasons. (or a minimum 1.8 mm on the edge for farsighted people.) For example, a nearsighted person has a much sharper curve on the back of the lens than the front. So the further away from the center you get, the thicker the lens becomes. Far sighted people the opposite occurs, but then the optician will try to get the minimum edge thickness to as close to 1.8 mm as possible. Any thinner and you risk the lens chipping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had a magnifying glass, to get the light condensed enough to start a fire you have to be pretty close to the object. If you had a magnifying glass twice as big you could be twice as far, however this only explains the reason glasses are wider than contacts, not thicker.</p>
<p>Glasses technically can be as thin as contacts, but there are two reasons why they are commonly not. First of all, imagine if your glasses were almost as thin as a hair, and they were still as wide as your current glasses. They would be very fragile. Secondly, Thinner glass would absorb much less light. There are actually many types of glass used for glasses, sometimes even plastic. Higher quality glasses can be much thinner in the lens and manage to capture the same amount of light, while others are much more durable.</p>
<p>In short, the worst your vision, the more light you need focused into your eyes. The only two ways to increase the light your eyes receive is by making the glasses thicker, wider, or increasing the quality of the glass your glasses use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glasses lenses are farther from your eye and the prescription for them describe the strength of the lens needed to correct your vision while located away from your eyes. Contact lens prescriptions describe a corrective strength and also the size and shape of the lens. Because it doesnt sit in front of your eye, but on top of it, it doesnt need to be as thick. Lenses do get thicker as a prescription increases but not as noticibly as glasses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
