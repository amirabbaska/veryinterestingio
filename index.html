		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical Engineer here. Basically gonna repeat what's in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw" target="_blank">this fantastic video</a> by The Engineer Guy:</p>
<p>Gases &amp; Liquids want to change their &quot;parent container&quot; into a spherical shape. This is the most ideal for them. (Think of when you blow up a balloon). The problem with this is that spheres are not easy to transport (in fact, they're literally the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528834-500-only-in-3d-are-spheres-the-worst-packers/" target="_blank">least-space-efficient shape in 3D</a>). Like you said, rectangles (or cubes) would be the best.</p>
<p>But cubes have corners and edges like some people have pointed out. These create weak points for pressure. A container of this shape would fail at much lower stress than a sphere.</p>
<p>So we look at cylinders next - cylinders are much better: they're <em>relatively</em> easy to pack, but they also have fewer &quot;weak points&quot; (edges and corners). So we make one more compromise: we take the sphere that the gas/liquid wants to make naturally, split it in half, and put those on the end. Now we have created the best compromise between what will hold the gas/liquid the best and what is the easiest to pack/transport: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_vessel" target="_blank">pressure vessel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In the specific instance of transporting on a truck:</strong> Packing isn't really as important here. But a cylinder is still good for two reasons:  you can easily just make a longer cylinder to fit a longer truck and, as /u/IgnoringHisAge mentioned, a liquid will easily funnel down to the bottom of the tank (especially if you set it up <a href="https://www.fueloyal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/10-Interesting-Facts-About-A-Tanker-Truck-11.png" target="_blank">like this</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, it's all about pressure. A liquid pushes out perpendicular to the wall of the container, to simplify it. So when you have the corner of a rectangle there is equal pressure pushing down, against side 1 and against side 2 creating enormous pressure on that seam. On a cylinder it is equally distributed because perpendicular to the side is an arc, like how an arch Is so strong. Then you have a welded seam on a rectangle which can be a weak points whereas a cylinder is mostly just 1 piece rolled into a tank. There is probably a better way of phrasing all this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to be a simple explanation, but probably not for a 5-year-old.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that math is about numbers and computing things.  Like, solve this equation, multiply these numbers, find the value of that side, etc.  But that's not right.  Really, math is about <em>understanding</em> things.  Math is about <em>how</em> things work and <em>why</em> they work.  Different branches of math are about how and why different types of things work.  For example, arithmetic is about how operations with numbers work.  Algebra is about how solving basic equations works.  Geometry is about how shapes work.  Etc.  Well, calculus is about how really tiny things relate to one another and how they come together to make normal-sized things.</p>
<p>When I was really little, I knew how to count and add and such.  I liked to play with Legos, and my dad taught me how to multiply with Legos.  So a 4x4 piece had 16 dots -- I could see the 4 rows of 4 dots each, and I could count the 16.  So that's how you multiply.  And that's also how to get the area of a rectangle.  I understood those before I was 5; it was pretty easy!  So it's clearly not so far-fetched for a 5-year-old to understand a little arithmetic and geometry, right?  So why not a little calculus?</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand a little calculus is to sit in the middle seat and look at the speedometer in the car.  What speed does it say?  Maybe it says 31 miles per hour.  This means that, if you keep traveling at this speed, you'll go 31 miles in an hour.  Any kid can understand that (even if the kid doesn't really know how far a mile is).  But then your dad slows down and stops at a red light.  The speed is 0 miles per hour now.  Did you actually go 31 miles in an hour?  No; 31 miles per hour was your speed only at that instant in time.  Now the speed is different.  The idea that it even makes sense to <em>have</em> a speed at an instant in time is... calculus!  You calculate speed by seeing how far you go and dividing by how long it took you to get there, but that only gives you <em>average</em> speed.  For the speed <em>right now</em>, you have to see how far you go in a very, very, very tiny amount of time.  You only go a very, very, very tiny distance.  And you divide by that very, very, very tiny amount of time to get a speed in numbers that you understand.  Calculus is when you make that amount of time tinier and tinier and tinier, and that makes the distance tinier and tinier and tinier too, so that, at that moment, the tiny distance divided by the tiny time is 31 miles per hour, but a second later it might be 30 mph or 32 mph or something else.</p>
<p>You generally use calculus to talk about how fast things change -- in the case of the car, it's how fast your position changes, but lots of things can change.  How fast something is changing <em>right now</em> is called the <em>derivative</em>.  Sometimes you know how the rate of change for something is related to other things.  For example, if you have a weight on a spring, you can write how fast the <em>speed</em> of the weight is changing based on its position on the spring, and you can write an equation called a differential equation.</p>
<p>(I'll show you an example that's way above ELI5, so you can skip it if you want: Hooke's Law says that the force F = –kx, where k is some number and x is the position away from the spring's equilibrium.  Newton's Second Law says that F = ma, where m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration.  Acceleration is how fast the speed -- well, actually, velocity, but let's not get confusing -- changes over time, and speed is how fast the position changes over time.  So the speed v = x', where ' indicates a derivative with respect to time, and a = v', so a = x'', called a second derivative.  Since F = ma and F = –kx, we get mx'' = –kx, and we want to solve for x as a function of time.  This is a differential equation.  The solution is x(t) = Acos(wt) + Bsin(wt), where A and B can be any numbers, and w = sqrt(k/m).  In order to figure out A and B, you need to know how the weigh starts out.  If the weight starts at the equilibrium position and it's not moving, then it's not going to start moving, right?  A = B = 0.  That's boring!  But if the weight starts at x = 5 at rest, then A = 5 and B = 0.  There are lots of possibilities.  How did I solve this?  Calculus!  Not going to get into it here.)</p>
<p>You can also use calculus to talk about how lots of little things can add up to a big thing.  For example, let's say you have an object, and you want to know how much it weighs.  You can break it up into tiny little pieces, figure out the density for each piece, figure out how much each little piece weighs, and add them all together.  That's calculus!  (Or you can just put it on a scale -- that's physics.)</p>
<p>The calculus of how fast things change is called <em>differential calculus</em>, and the calculus of adding up lots of little things is called <em>integral calculus</em>.  In differential calculus, you take a tiny little number and divide by another tiny little number to get a regular-sized number.  In integral calculus, you add together a very, very, very <em>large</em> number of tiny little numbers to get a regular-sized number.</p>
<p>Now, actually <em>doing</em> calculus is much more advanced, but it's not actually <em>hard</em>.  You basically just memorize a bunch of formulas.  For example, the derivative with respect to x of x^n is n·x^(n – 1).  When you need to take a derivative, most of the time you can just use that rule and similar rules.  There are a bunch of them, but they're not hard to learn.  There are rules about taking the derivative of stuff multiplied together or added together or divided one by the other, and even when you have a function of a function.  It's actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it!  Integrals, it turns out, are the inverse of derivatives, so you have a different set of rules but they're just the opposite of the rules for derivatives (for example, ∫x^(n)dx = x^(n + 1)/(n + 1) + C; it's just the opposite of the derivative rule -- never mind the C for now).  But the rules for multiplication and such are much more difficult, so a lot of the time you just <em>can't</em> take a nice-looking integral, not because you don't know how but because it's actually not possible without inventing new math (for example, people couldn't figure out how to do ∫dx/ln(x), so they just made up a new function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_integral_function" target="_blank">li(x)</a> to be the answer).  There are quite a lot of rules for taking integrals, but in the end, it's not really very difficult.  You just have to learn how to do it, that's all!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of people here talking about finding slopes and rates, and all of this is correct. There's also people mentioning the area or space under a curve/surface, which is also calculus.</p>
<p>All of this is true, but I want to add something that gets at the beauty of calculus a bit more, and doesn't even require notion of functions!</p>
<p>At its heart, calculus is the relationship between change (ie. rates, slopes, differentials) and content (ie. volume, area, distance, etc). It's a field that connects how big something is to how much it grows when small changes are made or, conversely, how knowing the rate that something is changing can tell you how much &quot;stuff&quot; you've accumulated.</p>
<p>For example, pretend you're in a vehicle where you can't see out the window. The only thing you can see in the car is the speedometer. As the car drives, you can keep track of the speedometer at every point in time and you'll know how much distance the car has traveled without being able to measure the distance of the car's path.</p>
<p>I think it's beautiful that calculus connects two seemingly unrelated: change and content. This is what math is in general though - it is the study of taking seemingly disparate things in the world and showing that they are fundamentally connected.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic principle behind calculus is fairly easy to understand.  Imagine painting the walls around a round ship window.  It's got that neat brass stuff, and you don't want to paint that so you have masking tape. </p>
<p>So how do use straight masking tape on a round window?  You use some small strips.   You can start with some big ones like the yellow in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vnS2jMb.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.  Well, that doesn't look right at all.  You didn't paint close to the circle, and nobody likes it.  Boss man gives you a second chance.  OK, you use smaller strips and your outline is more like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pEJWT6H.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. Much better!  </p>
<p>Now using the smaller straight strips were much better approximation to the actual window, but they were not perfect.  To be perfect we need super tiny strips, and once they are absolutely tiny, they are perfectly accurate. </p>
<p>Calculus breaks things down into those tiny strips to accurately measure curvey things.  It works for straight things too, but kinda overkill.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calculus one (differential calculus) primarily deals with finding how quickly something is changing at any given time. E.g. Given a position of an object for some time interval, we can find how fast it was moving during any moment in that interval. We do this by finding derivatives of functions.</p>
<p>Calculus two (integral calculus) deals with finding area/volume. E.g. given the velocity of an object over some time interval, we can find how far it has traveled by finding the area underneath its velocity vs time curve. We do this by finding integrals of functions.</p>
<p>Calculus three (multivariate) deals with calculus in three dimensions. Finding the path that water might travel down a complicated hill, the volume of a three dimensional object, the circulation of fluid along a curve, or the flux of a liquid across a surface are a number of applications. It's ultimately the most useful in complicated engineering problems since the real world is three dimensions.</p>
<p>Some related fields are analysis and differential equations. The former is more about establishing the theory that allows us to perform basic calculus, and the latter deals with equations involving the relation of certain quantities and their derivatives (big in physics).</p>
<p>Edit: a taste of how calc 1 and 2 are done:</p>
<p>Calc 1: So imagine you use a microscope to zoom in on a curve. The more you zoom the more the curve looks like a line. Theoretically, if you zoom in infinitely you see a line. The slope of that line is equal to the rate of change of the curve. So if you plot the graph of an objects position (given by our curve) and zoom in on that curve a lot, it looks linear. The slope of that line is the object's velocity at that position. That is calc 1</p>
<p>Calc 2: The idea is to subdivide some closed region (think like an amoeba) into rectangles and use the formula for area of rectangles to find area under/inside a curve. We use two processes. The first is called limits (to make the rectangle width approach 0, which causes the error in our approximation to approach 0. Think about approximating a circle as a square. When we divide the circle up into more squares, our shape becomes closer to a circle and our error in approximation approaches 0. Let these squares approach infinitely small size.) Then we sum their areas using our rectangle area formula through a second process, which is called summation. This is Calc 2</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In algebra you learned to calculate the slope of a straight line.</p>
<p>What's the slope of a curved line?  Well, it's not just one number.  It changes - it's higher when the curved line is steeper and lower when the curved line is flatter.  You can actually graph this out and get a second line, the graph of the slope of the first line.  Calculus is the set of mathematical tools that allow you to relate the first line to the second line: how to calculate one given the other, and so on.</p>
<p>It's quite handy for stuff like physics.  For example, you may have an equation for your velocity and need to know your acceleration.  Acceleration is the slope of velocity, so you use calculus to find that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally a question I can answer. I was at the optometrist 3 days ago and I asked him why my right eye had a blue-sih, cooler tint than my left eye; most notably in bright sunlight conditions.</p>
<p>He chuckled, said he gets this question once every 10 years, and explained that it due to protiens in the lens of each eye. The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye's focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.</p>
<p>The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it. But as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. You might recognize that this is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it harder to see. </p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.04436.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Over the course of life, UV in sunlight, chemicals, trauma or radiation experienced by each individual start to denature the proteins in lens. Denaturing means that the nature of the proteins change and gradually the lens loses its transparency thus starting to scatter light.&quot;</a></p>
<p>As for me, one of my eyes is more sensitive to light than they other (thanks mom), and standing in sunlight causes my right eye to close almost involuntarily. I would think that the greater exposure to UV radiation in my left eye than my right eye caused different amounts of denaturization in each lens. </p>
<p>However your experience could also be explained by cone cells sensitivity or eye dominance. </p>
<p><strong>I am not an optometrist, please consult with a professional optometrist and get your eyes checked annually. This could also be caused by a myriad of other factors, including pressure on the optic nerve and lead poisoning</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The cones come in 3 different types and they each pick up a different wavelength of light.  If you have more of one type than another in one eye compared to the other eye, that could account for a slight difference in the tone or saturation of color that you are seeing.  I have this too - one eye sees color as warmer than the other.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sometimes it's because the red or green cone cells are missing, but usually it's because <a href="http://www.colour.org.uk/fig3.gif" target="_blank">they respond to almost the same color light</a> (vs <a href="http://www.colour.org.uk/fig1.gif" target="_blank">normal vision</a>)</p>
<p>How the glasses work is by blocking <a href="http://enchroma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/enchromacx.png.pagespeed.ce.9wjKP4OmOd.png" target="_blank">colors between red and green where there is the most overlap</a> it allows the faulty red and green cones to see enough difference to distinguish red from green.</p>
<p>Now if you wanted to change how you see colors with glasses you'd never be able to create exactly what a colorblind person sees (that would require &quot;creating&quot; light), but if you wore glasses that were strongly tinted green then technically you would be seeing in monochrome (black and green of course, not black and white).

<p>What happens if &quot;normal&quot; people wearing them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that Enchroma glasses work by utilizing a notch filter design. The glasses contain rare-earth metals that block out specific wavelength regions that strongly overlap in people who are red-green colorblind. As a result, red and green become easier to distinguish. A person with normal color vision would see a more salient difference between red and green. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrEyOkNRzGI" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> explains it fairly well.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Could the glasses be modified to do so?</p>

<p><del>Yes, it should be possible with appropriate filters in place.</del> Edit: As someone pointed out, it would be difficult to modify them for black-and-white vision. However, some filters could be used that would severely limit the range of color vision (e.g., giving everything a greenish tint).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you might thing colourblind people see in black and white, but they usually don't. Normally they see in colour but have difficulty telling colours apart because red and green look more similar to one another. Here are some examples: <a href="http://www.improveeyesighthq.com/images/xcolorblind-view.jpg.pagespeed.ic.OGwZRSW79O.jpg" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="http://wearecolorblind.com/wp-content/uploads/general-example-2-types2.jpg" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/images/ColorBlind/112-1259_IMG.jpg" target="_blank">3</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of colourblindness, &quot;red-green colourblindness&quot; is sometimes called colour deficiency to make it clearer that people still see colours.</p>
<p>There is a condition called achromatopsia which means you see in black and white, but the Enchroma glasses that you're referring to don't work for those people.</p>
<p>So anyway, normal colourblindness that can be corrected by glasses occurs because the sensitivity of a colourblind person's colour-sensitive cells is wrong, and the red and green cells both respond most strongly to very similar-coloured light. This means that, for a protanomalous person, something that looks vibrant green to you will look more like orange to them, and something that looks strongly red to you will still look red, but much darker and might be confused with brown or black.</p>
<p>The glasses work, as other people have explained, by filtering out the wavelengths of light that lie in the strongly-overlapping portion between red and green. So if something is vibrant green, the reddish-green wavelengths that it reflects won't hit your eyes, only the green wavelengths. The red cells will still be stimulated, but less, so you see it as greener.</p>
<p>If a normal person wears them, well of course those wavelengths are still filtered out but it doesn't have much of an impact because they weren't that confusing to begin with. However, a normal person will still see the colours as a bit more vibrant (according to a colleague who has them and who is not colourblind).</p>
<p>Short of mysterious quantum technology or glasses that are really cameras and screens like VR headsets, there are strict limits on what glasses can do with colour. They can basically only reduce the amount of a certain colour that gets passed by a certain fraction. They can't add more colour - i.e. light - because that would require them to consume energy. They also can't reduce the amount of a colour according to how much of <em>another</em> colour there is, because that's not how optical filters work.</p>
<p>Hence there's no way to design ordinary glasses which make a person see in black and white, because this would require all colours to be equally strong or weak after passing through the filter; that requires their strengths to change relative to one another which a filter cannot do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends one what level of belief you mean. If we are just talking about a simple belief like trivia, our resistance to accepting that we're wrong is likely due to reputation. That is, if we are shown to be wrong about something, the implication is that we are not reliable.</p>
<p>Think of it in evolutionary terms. Much of our pre-history involves developing trust between people. An untrustworthy person could steal from you, kill you, or otherwise use you for their gain and turn on you when convenient. Earning and demonstrating trustworthiness as a reputation would have been important to survival. Those who proved untrustworthy, such as liars, could be punished, killed, expelled from the tribe, or even just ostracized and not selected as a mate. All these mean they were less likely to survive and reproduce. Those predisposed to fearing being judges as unreliable, and who instinctively acted to protect their reputation, would have reproduced more to pass on their genes.</p>
<p>This is why &quot;saving face&quot; is so important to both individuals and cultures, especially historically. People would kill others who questioned their honesty and integrity: duels, honor killings, and so forth. Even the parts of culture where challenging somebody's claims or confronting people is considered impolite is built on this notion of protecting reputation. </p>
<p>So changing belief is an admission that you were wrong and that your claims are unreliable. Sometimes that instinct can be far too strong in some people, unwilling to admit to any mistakes. It may depend on whether you are alone in the belief and everyone is against you, in which case maintaining your position risks lowering your status in the group, or if you have a &quot;tribe&quot; of believers backing you up and defending the belief <em>raises</em> your status with them.</p>
<p>If we're talking about a fundamental belief like a god, political basis, or the nature of how things work, and a whole collection of other beliefs derive from it, all of the above is still true but there is a complicating factor. Now accepting that you are wrong means much of your world view is all wrong and needs to be re-built from scratch. That can actually be very disorienting to deal with. We often call this effect, &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; when we realize our beliefs are inconsistent and feel disoriented and confused about it.</p>
<p>You can think about belief systems as a &quot;locally&quot; consistent collection of beliefs. Like if you have. A religious belief in a god and you understand how people, society, behaviours, history, nature, and so on all derive from that. If you then challenge that this god exists, none of your other beliefs make sense. You now don't understand anything you thought you did. Your have to re-learn why people act the way they do, how the world works, how you should behave, etc.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to just dismiss minor challenges to core beliefs, and use your larger understanding as protection against challenging it. You also have a whole social network that believes the same things so you feel comfortable maintaining the belief. Challenging it just does you no good in any practical social terms, and causes great cognitive and social harms to you. You won't <em>want</em> to challenge it, and even be scared of that. </p>
<p>But, we all have these inner thoughts and may lead you to question core beliefs, perhaps driven by outside information or because you want to come up with good answers to fight back against a challenger and discover there are no good answers. You then have problems to deal with, like all derivative beliefs and what to do about your life being tied up into this belief system: friends, family, job, culture, etc. Clergy who lose faith have a real life decision to make as they have to start life over, including job skills.</p>
<p>Political parties can act like religions too. They start to take on collections of dogma, and challenging those beliefs makes you a traitor to the tribe, and your social circle and position in it will suffer, especially if you are a politician who has a similar dilemma as clergy.</p>
<p>Sometimes life is much, much easier to refuse challenging your beliefs. The exception is, of course, when you have a social culture where challenging beliefs is rewarded and praised, like science. That is hard to instill in people though, largely because it goes against our tribalist instincts. It's a lot of hard work to have social value in a culture where challenging beliefs is rewarded, as that takes a lot of education, thought, and intellectual prowess. A culture of defending beliefs is easier because all you have to do is repeat them and become aggressive or violent against challengers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, something I'm semi-qualified to answer!  This is right in my field of research at the moment.  There's a HUGE number of explanations for this so I'll just list the biggest reasons that immediately come to mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Confirmation bias: people have a tendency not only to seek out, but to better remember information that is in line with their beliefs.  It feels good being proven right, and so more often than not when debating an issue, we search up evidence that will support our point, rather than actively seeking to disprove ourselves.  Even when we come across information that goes against our beliefs, we better remember information that supports our beliefs after the fact.  E.g. for someone who doesn't believe in the human-caused climate change theory, they will much more easily and readily recall the studies and things they found online that disconfirm climate change, than the studies that support.  In this regard, to many people your ELI5 alludes to, the things that you would suggest disprove their beliefs must seem few and far between compared to evidence supporting their beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naive realism: is an effect whose three tenets state (1) we believe we see the world objectively (2) we expect others to come to the same conclusion so long as they're rational and exposed to the same information (3) we assume that anyone who does not come to the same conclusion my be either biased, ignorant, or irrational.  Basically, we take the huge assumption that the world is objectively how we see it (it'd be pretty hard to live life otherwise, always doubting your own perceptions of everything from temperature, to social etiquette, to valid science.)  E.g. it's alot easier for someone who doesn't believe in the human-caused climate change theory who already takes in selective media through the websites they visit, and news they watch (as affected by the confirmation bias), to think that people who present a different point of view are ignorant or irrational, than to adopt a new belief.</p>
</li>
<li>Rather than taking someone else's viewpoint as a distinct viewpoint, in discussion settings, individuals with differing beliefs tend to view the other side as attacking their beliefs, while they believe they are objectively presenting their beliefs.  Both sides think this, and as a result discussions like this often don't get anywhere.  This also ties in with what's referred to as the conflict spiral.  Since both people feel attacked, in a debate/discussion with differing beliefs, people tend to present their opinion more certainly and more strongly than what they actually believe.  E.g. if someone who doesn't believe in the human-caused climate change theory is feeling attacked and backed into a corner in a debate, it wouldn't make much sense for them to express the mixed messages and merits of both sides of the issue, even if they believe there is a few good arguments on the other side and even if they're only like 85% certain of their view.  They want to &quot;win&quot; this argument so they portray themselves as being absolutely without doubt, and the climate change believers and having no merit in their argument whatsoever.  Both sides engage in this, and rather than conversing to understand each other's view, they try to convince each other with increasing argument extremity, and get increasingly frustrated when this doesn't work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Source: I'm a final year undergraduate honours psychology student conducting research in political psychology attempting to reduce falsely perceived adversary viewpoint extremity (known as the false polarization effect) through perceiving the adversary as an intelligent friend.</p>
<p>If anyone's interested I could post some relevant studies, but I'm too busy to look them up at the immediate moment.  Confirmation Bias, and Naive Realism should be pretty easy to look up online.  The conflict Spiral and study on people's perceptions of others in debates is more recent research and could be a little harder to find.  Hope this helps explain!</p>
<p>edit 1: changed some unintentionally biased wording (changed &quot;denier&quot; to &quot;someone who doesn't believe in human-caused climate change theory&quot; (we all fall prey to biases!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/" target="_blank">The Backfire Effect</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Misconception:</strong> When your beliefs are challenged with facts, you alter your opinions and incorporate the new information into your thinking.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> When your deepest convictions are challenged by contradictory evidence, your beliefs get stronger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best paragraph from that which summarizes the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once something is added to your collection of beliefs, you protect it from harm. You do it instinctively and unconsciously when confronted with attitude-inconsistent information. Just as confirmation bias shields you when you actively seek information, the backfire effect defends you when the information seeks you, when it blindsides you. Coming or going, you stick to your beliefs instead of questioning them. When someone tries to correct you, tries to dilute your misconceptions, it backfires and strengthens them instead. Over time, the backfire effect helps make you less skeptical of those things which allow you to continue seeing your beliefs and attitudes as true and proper.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shortest, explain-like-you-are-5 answer is <em>emotions.</em></p>
<p>For many people, their feelings are in bad shape, just like when you don't exercise your body and you lose strength and have a hard time doing strenuous activities, if you don't exercise your emotions they become very fragile and as a result people tend to hide from things that make them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This kind of hiding usually means believing in something that makes them feel better about themselves or their decisions, and if someone questions that belief, they start to feel that discomfort rise and they hide even deeper in that belief. This is why logic and facts don't change them.</p>
<p>So how do you change them? You can't. You can only give them the facts and the chance to change themselves and go through that discomfort on their own, at their own pace. Be happier with your life and <em>show</em> a better way to live instead of trying to force others to bend to your own beliefs, or you will end up pushing them further away.</p>
<p>How do you keep your emotions healthy enough that you don't end up hiding also? You exercise them by facing uncomfortable things, by listening to people who have different ideas and trying to understand them, by doing something hard like being empathetic to strangers, to loved ones, to the less fortunate. By examining your own weaknesses and mistakes and learning to stop feeling bad about your embarrassing or distressing thoughts, and learn to forgive yourself and learn positive lessons. By letting yourself feel bad about things, by letting yourself cry when you need to and laugh whenever you can. Feelings of fear and anger are instinctual feelings to fight discomfort, and need to be broken down and understood so they become something positive.</p>
<p>Your emotions are like muscles, and like developing muscles, it hurts at times. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually did a paper on this a few years ago. In the US, lethal injection is used (partially) because they want it to be less mentally damaging to the spectators. There are sedatives that are less painful, but they cause the body to convulse and therefore it can be disturbing to the people who come to watch. Same idea with gunshots, it is hard to watch. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, spectators usually include the families of the victims so they try to keep the mental trauma down as much as possible. Not saying this is the right or wrong method, but it is one of the reasons we use it in the US</p>
<p>Also good to note is firing squad and even hanging are still options for executions in a few states. If I remember correctly one even still allows the electric chair. </p>
<p>Edit 1:Spelling</p>
<p>Edit 2: I wanted to further explain that the paper was an assignment specifically for lethal injection vs less painful drugs (such as overdosing on sleep aids) so there was no &quot;I don't believe in lethal injection&quot; out for the paper. Gas was not an option, but my guess would be (and this is 100% a guess so don't look too much into it) is in the US it is remeniscent of Hitler and the Nazis. Again, just a guess and not intended to offend anyone who asked about it. That's isn't a bad question. There is also a mentality in some areas of &quot;this death is your penalty, why should it be pleasant or easy for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Also this paper simply focused on method, not whether the execution is right (I personally think it should only be used in extreme cases), whether spectators should be present (which I don't think they should be but I get why they would), or the morality of actions up to the execution(such as last meal). The only topic breeched about anything other than this method vs that method is that it is generally more expensive to execute someone via lethal injection than it is (generally) to incarcerate them for life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably just considered more respectful. But mostly I think it's because people simply don't want to acknowledge what they're actually doing. Also, for a shot to the head to be 99+% effective you want a larger gun than normal. Which means you'd basically decimate the skull. It would be messy. But for almost all purposes I believe it's the most painless and most tolerable. Many rounds are supersonic, so you be dead before you even knew the gun was fired. Any time Ive put an animal down, as hard as it is, that's the proper method. There is no fear or pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To solve all of the concern over what may be to disturbing or messy for the viewers or painful/inhumane to the inmate, I believe if we are going to continue to use capital punishment, it should be done via inert gas asphyxiation (replacing oxygen with an inert gas like helium or nitrogen).</p>
<p>In 2015, Oklahoma's governor signed a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an option for execution.</p>
<p>There is no pain, only a euphoric feeling. There is no mess. There are no drug companies refusing to sell a particular drug. There are no botched injections, electrocutions, hangings or shootings. There is nothing disturbing to watch. No person on death row would be able to claim that inert gas asphyxiation is inhumane (Mitchell Rupe's death sentence was overturned after he argued that he was too heavy to hang and he would be decapitated. Hanging was the default method at the time).</p>
<p>I understand there are politics involved. And ignorance. Some people want the inmate to suffer. Others feel that current methods are tradition. Some people will liken it to the gas chambers of WWII. Like many other problems we have here in the USA, people need to grow up and stop making everything so difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What I  recently found with his mixed dentition is a deep anterior bite, and heavy heavy occlusal wear resulting in short flat adult and baby teeth. And after some thought, I concluded he can't chew quietly because his flat teeth are literally clanking together instead of moving in a circular chewing motion. Also, his only teeth available to contact are his front teeth (which are technically tearing teeth) and his first molars. So most food is not being grinded between teeth to absorb some of the sound.

Misophonia and hyperacusis are conditions whose definitions seem to overlap somewhat. For people with these, various sounds can be intolerable; eating sounds being a major problem for many. Frequency/pitch seems to play a part in how noticeable (or specifically, irritating) a sound is, so different eaters could be producing different quality sounds that are more or less noticeable than others.</p>
<p>I, for one, can be <em>incredibly</em> irritated by noisy eaters, to the extent that it's a real struggle to remain civil to the eater. Thankfully, through sheer bloody mindedness and effort, the issue is not as bad as it once was, though there are still times when I could cheerfully choke someone with the remains of whatever it is they're shovelling into their gaping maw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Had you asked &quot;do animals get autism&quot; there would be no way to answer because an autism diagnosis must be based on human frame of reference. That seems obvious, but it's key to recognize there can never be an autistic animal. As soon as the symptoms leave human context, it's not really autism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are many biological steps between genes and behavioral outputs; moreover, the social and environmental contexts that shaped human behavior compared with that of rodents have been highly divergent over the course of evolutionary time. Thus, behaviors resulting from mutations introduced into the mouse genome might best be construed as no more than potentially useful readouts of underlying neural processes. Drugs act on molecular targets, not directly on behaviors or other symptoms. Thus, predictive validity for therapies requires good conservation of the molecular mechanism by which activation or inhibition of a molecular target affects a well-chosen readout that correlates strongly with a human symptom</p>

<p>The hallmarks of autism are 1) social disorder and 2) stereotyped behavior. Obviously this super broad and you could fit just about any average user into the autism box with this diagnosis. It's up to the doctor to make the call about whether the behavior is pathological. </p>
<p>It's even more difficult with animals in nature because we can't really monitor their social interactions the same way as with people. Sure, with monkeys we can measure eye contact or watch for things like over-grooming, but we could never know if these are because of &quot;autism&quot; or he/she just doesn't like the perfume you're wearing and it makes him/her itchy. </p>
<p>Studying autism in research is a different story. We can make animals with a genetic mutation that copies a mutation found in human autistic patients. If we see a sudden change in animal behavior because if this mutation, we can be pretty sure there is some overlapping biology being screwed up common between the patient and the animal. </p>
<p>TLDR: Yes</p>

<p>It's kind of like this:</p>
<p>Do you see a difference between me swinging a bat in your general direction, in a threatening manner, and me swinging a bat to hit your body?  Sure you do.  And on average, the reaction to the first example is liable to be more measured and proportionate, compared to the second.</p>
<p>Declaring war is a very serious move, and one would hope world leaders would try to exhaust all avenues of remedy before taking that step.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If it turns hot, it's not going to end well.   So everyone except North Korea is reluctant to hit back with more than economic sanctions.    North Korea is taking the opportunity to see how far it can push the boundary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
