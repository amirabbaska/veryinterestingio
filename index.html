So caterpillars can totally live a long, full life of caterpillary wholesomeness, but they can’t have descendants until they transform into a butterfly or moth.  </p>
<p>Realistically speaking, in most species the vast majority of larvae get eaten by something bigger long before they reach adulthood, and those who make it are the rare exception. So in a way, many caterpillars actually do live their whole life in the larva stage, never growing up... but probably not in the way you imagined. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

However, that individual would then never have the opportunity to reproduce and pass on their genes to a new generation. The caterpillars that quickly progress to metamorphosis and successfully reproduce are those that make up the new generation and majority of the population, and so shape the behaviors of future caterpillars. There is a pressure from natural selection for caterpillars to eat as much as they can and quickly get through metamorphosis before they are eaten as vulnerable larvae.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerodynamic factors of vortices can be avoided by flying in proper formation (either with step up or step down, depending on the situation (step up being vertical separation from cockpit to cockpit)). Military aircraft (including helicopters) fly tight formation to decently sized aircraft (C-130s, KC-10s, etc) all the time during in flight refueling and that's generally not too problematic (as long as it isn't too turbulent).</p>
<p>Legally, it's because the FAA requires something like... I think at least <del>1</del> 3 miles laterally and 1000 feet in altitude (I should know this) between each aircraft on an instrument clearance (which pretty much all commercial flights have). Military aircraft can declare MARSA which is &quot;Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft.&quot; This relieves ATC of the 1 mile/1000 feet separation requirement and so the military pilots are now flying formation off the lead aircraft.</p>
<p>Edit: After some google-fu, it looks like lateral separation is 3 miles in a terminal environment and 5 miles en route, with (generally) 1000 feet of vertical separation. Source: FAA order 7110.65, 4-5-1 and 5-5-4.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normal aircraft separation under Instrument Flight Rules is defined in FAA Order 7110.65. Either 1000 feet vertical or 3 miles lateral separation (more if dealing with Heavy aircraft and aircraft on final approach if different weight classes). You can have less than this if flying under Visual Flight Rules (see and avoid).  Military aircraft flying in formation use a rule called MARSA - Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft - in which they fly under one flight plan as essentially one aircraft for purposes of ATC. Military planes doing exercises in restricted airspace are flying under VFR, and are responsible for their own separation.</p>

<p>EDIT: pointed out by another user that MARSA is Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft. I accidentally a word. Been out of the aviation industry for about 7 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, fun question! I teach low-level programming and would love to tackle this!</p>
<p>Let me take it in reverse order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to hand type a program using 1s and 0s? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, absolutely! However, we don't do this anymore. Back in the early days of computing, this is how all computers were programmed. There were a series of &quot;punch cards&quot; where you would punch out the 1's and leave the 0's (or vice-versa) on big grid patterns. This was the data for the computer. You then took all your physical punch cards and would load them into the computer. So you were physically loading the computer with your punched-out series of code</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if I hand type all these digits into a storage and run it on a computer, would it open the file or start the game?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, absolutely! Each processor has its own language they understand. This language is called &quot;machine code&quot;. For instance, my phone's processor and my computer's processor have different architectures and therefore their own languages. These languages are series of 1,0's called &quot;Opcodes.&quot; For instance 011001 may represent the ADD operation. These days there are usually a small number of opcodes (&lt; 50) per chip. Since its cumbersume to hand code these opcodes, we use Mnemonics to remember them. For instance 011001 00001000 00011  could be a code for &quot;Add the value 8 to the value in memory location 7 and store it there.&quot; So instead we type &quot;ADD.W #8, &amp;7&quot; meaning the same thing. This is assembly programming. The assembly instructions directly translate to machine instructions.</p>
<p>Yes, people still write in assembly today. It can be used to hand optimize code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also to see the contrast, approximately how many digits are in a massive video game like gta V?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahh, this is tricky now. You have the actual machine language programs. (Anything you write in any other programming language: C, python, basic --- will get turned into machine code that your computer can execute.) So the base program for something like GTA is probably not that large. A few MegaBytes (millions to tens-of-millions of bits). However, what takes up the majority of space on the game is all the supporting data: image files for the textures, music files, speech files, 3D models for different characters, etc. Each of things is just a series of binary data, but in a specific format. Each file has its own format.</p>
<p>Thank about writing a series of numbers down on a piece of paper, 10 digits. How do you know if what you're seeing is a phone number, date, time of day, or just some math homework? The first answer is: well, you can't really be sure. The second answer is if you are expecting a phone number, then you know how to interpret the digits and make sense of them. The same thing happens to a computer. In fact, you can &quot;play&quot; any file you want through your speakers. However, for 99% of all the files you try, it will just sound like static unless you attempt to play an actual audio WAV file. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many digits are representing a for example ms word file of 100 words and all default fonts and everything in the storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the answer for this depends on all the others: MS Word file is its own unique data format that has a database of things like --- the text you've typed in, its position in the file, the formatting for the paragraph, the fonts being used, the template style the page is based on, the margins, the page/printer settings, the author, the list of revisions, etc.</p>
<p>For just storing a string of text &quot;Hello&quot;, this could be encoded in ascii with 7-bits per character. Or it could use extended ascii with 8-bits per character. Or it could be encoded in Unicode with 16-bits per character.</p>
<p>The simplest way for a text file to be saved would be in 8-bit per character ascii. So Hello would take a minimum of 32-bits on disk and then your Operating System and file system would record where on the disk that set of data is stored, and then assign that location a name (the filename) along with some other data about the file (who can access it, the date it was created, the date it was last modified). How that is exactly connected to the file will depend on the system you are on.</p>
<p>Fun question!  If you are really interested in learning how computing works, I recommend looking into electrical engineering programs and computer architecture courses or (even better) and embedded systems course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends.</p>
<p>The simplest way to represent text is with 8-bit ASCII, meaning each character is 8 bits - a bit being a zero or one. So then you have 100 words of 5 characters each, plus a space for each, and probably about eight line feed characters. Add a dozen punctuation characters or so, and you end up with roughly 620 characters, or 4960 0s or 1s. Call it 5000.</p>
<p>If you're using unicode or storing your text in another format (Word, PDF, etc.), then all bets are off. Likewise, compression can cut that number way down.</p>
<p>And in theory you could program directly with ones and zeros, but you would have to literally be a god to do so, since the stream would be meaningless for mere mortals.</p>
<p>Finally, a byte is eight bits, so take a game's install folder size in bytes and multiply by eight to get the number of bits. As an example, I installed a game that was about 1.3GB, or 11,170,000,000 bits!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I'd like to add a note about transistors here, since some folks seem to misunderstand them. A transistor is essentially an amplifier. Plug in 0V and you get 0V out. Feed in 0.2V and maybe you get 1.0V out (depending on the details of the circuit). They are <em>linear</em> devices over a certain range, and beyond that you don't get any further increase in output. In computing, you use a high enough voltage and an appropriately designed circuit that the output is maxxed out, in other words they are driven to saturation. This <em>effectively</em> means that they are either on or off, and can be treated as binary toggles.</p>
<p>However, please understand that transistors are not <em>inherently</em> binary, and that it actually takes some effort to make them behave as such.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: a MS word file with 100 words uses approximately 100,000 bits (binary digits, that is, 1's and 0's).</p>
<p>Here's the longer explanation:
First, we refer to those 1's and 0's not as digits, but as bits (binary digits).  </p>
<p>Second, a text file is technically different from a MS Word file.  A text file contains literally just that: text.  So for a true text file, the size is, as you deduced, the character count times the number of bits to represent a character (8 for ASCII text).  </p>
<p>A MS Word file, by contrast, is a binary file that contains all sorts of data besides the 100 words.  There is information on the styles, the layout, the words themselves, and then there's metadata like the author's information, when the file was edited, and if track changes is on, information about changes that have been made.  That info is actually what takes up (by far) the bulk of the spaces a MS Word file consumes.  A plain text file of 100 words would be about 6,400 bits; a MS Word file with the same words is about 100,000 bits (depending on the words, of course).</p>
<p>Your benchmark for comparison, GTA V, takes about 520 billion bits.</p>
<p>Hand type all those bits into storage?  Eh, it's a little fuzzy.  What you're talking about is somehow manually manipulating the registers in RAM.  And, sure, if you had a program that would let you do that (wouldn't be hard to write), then yeah, I guess so.  You could type in the 1's and 0's in to the program, the program would set the registers accordingly.  If it's a file you're inputting, then it's just about flushing the values of those registers to disk (aka, saving a file).  If it's a program you're inputting to run, then you've got to convince the OS to execute the code represented in those registers.  That's a bigger trick, particularly with modern operating systems that use signed executables for security.</p>
<p>Can you hand type a program in 1's and 0's?  Sure.  No one does that, obviously, though on vanishingly rare occasions a programmer will use a hex editor on code -- that's an editor that represents the bytes as 16 bit pairs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually seems to be more of a statistical question. Every ASCII character can be represented by 7 bits, but are often stored in 8/16/etc. bit data structures, and there are 128 different ASCII characters. But the clue here is obviously &quot;words&quot;. A word can be of different size, and obviously the sentence &quot;a a&quot; will have a smaller size than &quot;this word&quot;, but how is the distribution of 1's and 0's? </p>
<p>Some characters/letters are going to be used more than others. The letter 'e' is vastly more used than 'z', for example. And some ASCII characters used even less, especially in the context of words. A word is simply a sequence of characters, and in binary, they translate letter-for-letter, meaning that if </p>
<p>t = 01110100
h = 01101000
e = 01100101</p>
<p>then &quot;the&quot; = 01110100 01101000 01100101</p>
<p>Thus we see that a word and the binary length is proportional to number of letters in the word. </p>
<p>If W_l = length of word, then E[w_l] would be the expected length of a word in some document, and IIRC, that number is just over 5. So in a 100 word document, we'd have 5*100 characters, or 500 different characters. That's 4000 1's and 0's, if each character is represented by a 8-bit data structure. </p>
<p>Exactly how many 0's and 1's would depend on the word. Letter for letter, not in the context of words, the frequency is (most to least): EARIOTNSLCUDPMHGBFYWKVXZJQ</p>
<p>If you take the letters a - z, the 1 and 0 distribution is roughly 46% and 54%, uppercase letters simply shift the third bit from 1 to 0
whitespace has seven 0's, and one 1, so if there are 80 whitespace in a 100 word document, that would mean 560 0's and 80 1's. </p>
<p>SO, I would estimate, in a 100 word document / text file, with whitespace between words: </p>
<p>around 1800-2000 1's, 2500 - 2700 0's. If that's the question. You could easily make a program (in python, for example) which generates numerous 100 word text files from some NLP dataset, then run statistics / character frequency, and then convert to binary and count each 0 and 1. Do that N times, and calculate the statistics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thats a fun question. Each character is usually a byte, which is 8 bits (a bit is a 1 or 0).</p>
<p>For instance: <strong>01000001</strong> - is a capital 'A'</p>
<p>Taking the first 100 words in the english dictionary (I found the list online), <strong>A</strong> to <strong>Ableness</strong> here is how the sequence starts:</p>
<ul>
<li>01000001 - &quot;A&quot; <strong>uppercase</strong> <em>is signified by the first 3 bits (010)</em></li>
<li>00100000 - space character</li>
<li>01000001 - &quot;A&quot;</li>
<li>01000010 - &quot;B&quot;</li>
<li>00100000 - space character</li>
<li>01000001 - &quot;A&quot;</li>
<li>01100010 - &quot;b&quot; <strong>lowercase</strong> <em>is signified by the first 3 bits (011)</em></li>
<li>01100001 - &quot;a&quot;</li>
<li>01100011 - &quot;c&quot;</li>
<li>01101011 - &quot;k&quot;</li>
<li>01100101 - &quot;e&quot;</li>
<li>00100000 - space character.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first 100 words in english there are <em>895 characters</em>, including spaces. So that would be </p>
<pre><code>895 * 8(bits) = 7160(bits)</code></pre>
<p>So there are about <strong>7000 or so</strong> ones or zeros in 100 words. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon you are describing is called sudden brief unilateral tapering tinnitus (Yes it is called SBUTT for short) and the cause is unknown. There are some theories according to this article <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/08/what-causes-ringing-in-the-ears-tinnitus.html" target="_blank">What Is This God-Awful Ringing in My Ears?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what causes these phantom sounds? No one knows for sure, but there are a few theories. One involves the small muscles that attach to the three bones in the ear. These bones conduct sound vibrations, which get transferred into the inner ear and converted into neural impulses to the brain; the nearby muscles can help dampen sounds that are too loud, Dr. Jethanamest says. It’s possible that if one of those muscles spasms — kind of like an eyelid twitch — it could pull tightly, making your ear feel “full” and blocking external sounds. You hear a high-pitched sound, and then the spasm stops.</p>
<p>Another theory involves misfiring neurons of the small sensory cells in the inner ear, known as hair cells. These cells move in reaction to sound waves, which trigger the release of electrical signals to your brain, which it interprets as sound. If one part of this production line is messed up, you might hear something weird. “Maybe there’s just some slight change for half a second and some of those firings are a little bit off or changed a little bit in the neural activity, and that’s what creates that one-second thing that you hear or you feel,” Dr. Jethanamest says.</p>

<p>If it is, you voluntarily allow the external urethral sphincter to open and you'll pee. If it's not a good time to go, then your brain overrides the stretch receptors for a while and tells them to calm down for a bit. The process is repeated as the bladder expands. </p>
<p>If you wait too long, eventually you'll have no control over the external muscles and you'll pee no matter what. Or, worst case scenario, your bladder can burst if there is a blockage preventing the release of urine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have often heard that alcohol intake during the first few weeks of pregnancy is harmless, due to the embryo getting nutrients not from the mother but from the yolk sac. I've tried to read up, but haven't found anything conclusive. Wikipedia confirms that the umbilical cord is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord#Development_and_composition" target="_blank">not developed until week five</a>, supporting the &quot;harmless-hypothesis&quot;.
But other sources claim that the embryo/fetus can indeed be affected by alcohol intake before week five. According to <a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/developmental-timeline-alcohol-induced-birth-defects" target="_blank">this article</a> written by a researcher at the ASU, &quot;in the third week after fertilization that specific alcohol-induced birth defects begin to affect the developing embryo&quot;. The article lists many aspects of how the early development can be affected.
I've seen loads of other sources claim the same thing. But how does this work, if the embryo/fetus is not even connected to its mothers bloodstream yet?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So before the umbilical cord is developed, the new embryo is already implanted onto the mother's uterine wall. Basically in early development, the zygote has gone through several divisions to become a blastula. This ball of cells makes its way to the uterus and will eventually make contact with the uterine wall and implant itself into the mother's cells. </p>
<p>The site that this occurs will eventually develop into the placental attachment in later development, but the initial contact happens very early, well before 5 weeks. At this point, the embryo is attached to the mother but there's no real circulation happening and is instead passive diffusion from the mother's body is the biggest factor.</p>
<p>With regard to ethanol: since ethanol is an ambipathic molecule, it can easily pass through cellular membranes and disrupt them along the way. Now I don't know how much passive diffusion would allow the ethanol and resulting acetaldehyde to affect the embryo at this point, but there is definitely a route that the embryo could be affected by alcohol consumption before placental development.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So yes, the umbilical cord isin't developed till week 5, but at around the 12th day after fertilization the utero-placental circulation is established between the maternal sinusoids and lacunae in the syncytiotrophoblast. While maternal blood is not in contact with embryo proper(the part that is the baby) per say nutrients and things are diffusing across into the fetus. </p>
<p>Excessive alcohol intake around the second week time, a time where the mother usually doesn't even realize she is pregnant, affects the cells in the caudal(towards the tail) of the embryo's germ layers. This leads to a condition called caudal dysgenesis aka sirenomelia. </p>
<p>So in short, yes the embryo doesn't have a umbilical cord but that doesn't mean exchange isin't taking place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a maternal and child health MPH student. Decided to do some quick research on this for you.</p>
<p>I found two studies, both  of which women were interviewed about alcohol intake before pregnancy and during pregnancy (including very early pregnancy). </p>
<p>1) In the first study, &quot;There was no association between alcohol consumption before 15 weeks of gestation and small for gestational age, reduced birth weight, preeclampsia, or spontaneous preterm birth.&quot;
2) In the second study, &quot;We found no systematic association between binge drinking during early pregnancy and child intelligence.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't explain the biology behind it, as I am not knowledgeable in that area, but it appears research suggests it does not harm the fetus (since the children are being born in normal condition).
Now, this is not to say you should drink if you know you are pregnant and it is early in the pregnancy. It's always better to be healthy than put the fetus at risk. The first few weeks of development are critical to a fetus' outcomes, both in birth and throughout life, so staying away from anything harmful is advised. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During embryonic development, alcohol can change or delay the differentiaton of different cells. </p>
<p>Other people already said alcohol could reach the embryo without going through the cord. </p>
<p>When cells differentiate, 1 cell type can form different cell types after devision. Also, cells migrate during development. Disruptions cause developmental defects that will also affect other development later on. Basically, development is one big cascade of crosstalk and reactions.</p>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome can already occur when the mother isn't aware she is pregnant yet. 2 beverages can already kill some cells that play roles later on. I think it is recommended to not drink alcohol when you are planning on getting pregnant. </p>
<p>Im on mobile now, so I can't look up specific papers. You might want to look into Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Also look into somite/neural crest differentiaton. Disturbances in these cells might lead to neurological problems and facial deformities. Once again understandable because the cell gives rise to multiple tissues.</p>

Of this, about 161 watts is absorbed at the surface.</p>
<p>In comparison, the average geothermal heat flux is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget" target="_blank">.09</a> watts per square meter, 4000 times smaller and basically negligible for the purposes of evaluating Earth's surface climate.</p>
<p>However, the incoming solar energy is returned to space as infrared energy emitted from the ground.  The balance between these two shifts over the seasons, but over the whole year they cancel out almost exactly.</p>
<p>The net result is that the seasonal cycle cause the ground to heat and cool in the <a href="https://www.builditsolar.com/Projects/Cooling/EarthTemperatures.htm" target="_blank">upper few meters</a> of the ground, but below that its impact is almost zero.</p>
<p>When you think about it, if heat from the sun were constantly flowing into the ground everywhere, the Earth would be constantly getting hotter, and it isn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The air was about 25C, the first data point 25cm underground was about 5C, by about 1.5-2m you would be in permafrost at -7C and it stayed constant for about 50-75m before it started to creep up again by less than 1C per 100m. Until you get down to 1km deep or more the temperature from within is very negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've asked this question IRL before and never got the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p>I also don't seem to have seen the answer on this thread.</p>
<p>Let me explain, and hopefully someone smarter than me can reply with an answer:</p>
<p>Dig under the surface and the temperature doesn't fluctuate much.</p>
<p>That temperature cannot be used as the heat the core of the earth contributes because both the core and the sun are contributing to the entire temperature of the earth to some degree, in an equilibrium.</p>
<p>The point of no temperature fluctuation year round is just the point where heat becomes thoroughly insulated long enough that not enough dissipates from lack of sunlight to notice any change over the course of a year.</p>
<p>But the overall temperature of the earth is a combination of that emitted from the core, and that received by the sun.</p>
<p>So minus all light from the sun, and removing all currently &quot;stored heat&quot; that originated from the sun, what would the temperature of the surface be due solely to that emitted from the core?</p>
<p>Basically, picture a thermally insulated bottle with warm water inside, and a hot lamp on the outside of the bottle.</p>
<p>Minus the hot lamp, what would be the temperature on the outside of the bottle contributed from the warm water inside?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
