		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to address the <em>TV</em> portion as it can be considered separate from movie production and distribution.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To start, let us look at where TV shows come from. A production studio creates the material for a show. As tv production is expensive (2006 estimates are $120 million average for a season), the studio is often funded (and normally owned) by a conglomerate company, such as Comcast-NBCUniversal. Prior to production, the project is greenlighted (ordered) on the premise that it will be exclusive to a certain company (such as the NBC example above).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Airing of the show is negotiated for a time slot on a certain provider. For companies that own the channel (such as NBC), the slots are determined internally based on projected potential viewers and likelihood to draw from competitors' viewers. The channel owner will also sell advertizing slots to offset the cost of production and operation, and negotiate cost-per-subscriber for cable/satellite companies to stream content.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The cable company needs to negotiate with each company that they want to provide on their services. While some of these channels are profitable on their own (based on cost:subscriber), several are not (ESPN, Lifetime, SyFy). Bundling prevents viewers from paying $15 just for ESPN and allows smaller channels to thrive. Cable companies also sell some of the advertizing slots to recuperate broadcasting costs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now comes in Netflix. Netflix operates on the same principle as Video-on-Demand (VOD), but uses the internet instead of your media box. In order to display shows through its service, Netflix has to secure rights, the same way that cable companies do.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As most rights are held by TV channels, they are reluctant to lease viewing rights within a certain marketability period, which is why shows may not appear for a certain time following their DVD/BD season release. Some studios refuse to lease content to Netflix; Disney-ABC in particular is notorious for this. They also own <em>(edit: 30% of)</em> Hulu, to compete with Netflix and piracy.<br />

As an example ESPN costs consumers ~ $7.00 while TNT is the next most expensive channel and it runs about $1.75.  This is a dying business model and it is going to change very soon.  I think the catalyst is when larger companies like Cox, Comcast, DirecTV, etc allows ala carte channel options where you only pay for the channels you actually watch.  I personally have roughly 350 channels but I only watch about 20 of those with any regularity.</p>
<p>However the first thing that needs to fall for this to happen is DirecTV's monopoly with the NFL.  Once that falls it will really open up the market because people will leave DirecTV in droves</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three characteristics that psychology hypothesizes (and the evidence supports) are so integral to human societies that we have a biological predisposition to processing. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Group Membership</li>
</ol>
<p>They are distinguished from other characteristics in that they are processed and encoded a) very quickly b) involuntarily c) culturally universally and d) with very accurate recall.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the work of Leda Cosmides is relevant; you might google her for more info.</p>
<p>So while our perceptions and behaviour will certainly add a layer of complexity to identifying gender; it is very likely we have some innate neural circuitry devoted to it.</p>
<p>Edit: Group Membership</p>
<p>Originally, the list was gender, age, and <em>race</em>. However, from an evolutionary perspective --- necessary if we're supposing that there is any innate biological predisposition going on --- it makes no sense for race to be in this group. Humans have not been exposed to substantially different groups of other humans on an evolutionary time scale. Some very clever experimentation (see source below) established that it was instead &quot;group membership&quot; that was the important factor. That is, we do have a vested interest in establishing who belongs to our tribe and who does not belong to our tribe such that it could potentially be an evolutionary pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Group Membership&quot; really is as general and vague as it sounds --- it's about who belongs to the same &quot;group&quot; as us and who does not and that will vary depending on context. In any given context, we belong to multiple overlapping, hierarchical and competing groups and changing context changes the relative importance of those groups.  We will attend to indicators of group membership <em>to the degree that they are relevant</em> in a specific context. To the degree that race is an indicator of group membership within a community, it will be perceived and encoded in the same fast, automatic, rigorous manner than gender and age are.</p>
<p>The experiment in the source below shifted the social context to team sports and showed that they could override the race effect and replace it with team membership.</p>
<p>This seems to explain a lot of sensitivities that subcultures evolve that outsiders are largely oblivious to. For instance, everyone has an idea of what a &quot;valley girl&quot; sounds like when she's talking, but few realize that there was variation between groups of &quot;valley girls&quot;, particularly in their grammatical use of 'like', that was a clear indication to each other which group they belonged to, even though it was not necessarily a conscious behaviour on their part. Spend enough time with them, and you'd cue to those differences as well.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I felt this perceptual shift myself... I'm Canadian but went to grad school in the US. While it would be ridiculous to suggest that growing up I didn't <em>perceive</em> racial differences---I obviously did---I witnessed a subtle (and extremely uncomfortable) shift in my perceptions in the US. Race just had an <em>impact</em> that it didn't before and I found that I was more sensitive to it. It didn't really change my behaviour, but in my environment (a small college town in a red state) there was very little racial mixing. This was a couple of years before I encountered studies below that helped me explain that experience.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to make a related point here which might help you interpret other answers.  </p>
<p>There's often not a clear distinction between &quot;hardwired&quot; and &quot;learned&quot; in human (or animal) behavior.  Some things are fully hardwired (for example, you don't have to learn how to beat your heart) and some are entirely learned (like the Konami code).  But in many cases we are hardwired to learn.  For example, rats (and humans) aren't hardwired to know that certain foods (like rotting foods) can make you sick.  But they <em>are</em> hardwired to rapidly associate nausea with flavors eaten beforehand, even if there's a significant time gap.  If you give a rat a flavor, then make it feel nausea through some other means afterwords (radiation was originally used), the rat will avoid that flavor in the future.  If you try the same thing with a light or a noise instead of a flavor, the rat won't learn nearly as quickly or easily.  That's because rats are hardwired to link taste and nausea. (here's the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/122/3160/157" target="_blank">original paper</a>, though IIRC the first one doesn't test other senses.  Also it's paywalled)</p>
<p>Likewise, humans are not hardwired to walk, but they are hardwired to learn to walk.  Human infants tend to do certain activities (like move the legs alternatively, sit up, and observe and mimic those around them) that lead them to learn to walk.  But the actual walking motion and the precursors that lead up to it have to be learned and practiced.  And toddlers have to learn about what sort of ground they can walk over without falling (eg, gaps and edges).  They have to practice motor control to improve it.  So walking is instinctively learned.  Here's a <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/adolph/publications/AdolphRobinson-inpress-LearningToWalkPreprint.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> you can read if you'd like to learn more.</p>
<p>There are plenty more examples out there...language being a big one.  So when you read about &quot;hardwired&quot; or &quot;learned&quot; behaviors, ask yourself if those definitions are capturing the entirety of what's occurring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright I'll take a stab at this one!</p>
<p>Short answer yes, but the longer answer is yes but it doesn't really mean anything.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/10/12/your-brain-first-notices-race-gender-before-all-else/60650.html" target="_blank">this article</a>
and this harvard study says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you meet someone new, the first thing your brain does is take note of two characteristics: race and gender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it goes on to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that previous research suggests the FFA does not endow visual stimuli with meaning, so it probably does not know anything about sex and race. It’s simply a brain region in the visual system that sees faces as belonging to two different sets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so it seems as though it is one of the very first things that our brains pick up on, but it doesn't really have any meaning other than differentiating between them. Other parts of the brain would then assign meaning to what you perceive as male/female.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are animals that recognize genders. They have specific warning calls for each gender that are meant to warn their group about the dangers human males can cause. If that hardwired into them? At least if primitive species can easily differentiate between human genders it probably means that they have some brain mechanisms to easily understand human genders. That brain mechanism is then very primitive. So we probably don't need a high IQ to differentiate between genders. If it's not automatic from birth it is automated to become a reflex. But I would assume that some things like gender specific clothes are somewhat softwired but things such as breasts and high vs. deep voices are in a higher degree hardwired. But it's probably brain modules evolved to recognize genders but also evolved to adapt to their environment.</p>
<p>Here is one example of monkeys differentiating between genders:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the answer directly for you, and I'm sure someone else could do a better job of answering this, but I have something that points us in the right direction.  Per a study published in 2004, by Cellerino, Borghetti and Sartucci it was determined using various resolutions of pictures that facial recognition methods held by people to resolve gender use different cognitive processes.  </p>
<p>The study broke pictures down with reduced resolution and had test subjects select male or female.  It was determined at a level of certainty above pure chance, that a male face can be identified at a level of resolution that is far less detailed than a female face.  This is possible because the process involved in determining male faces with certainty at above chance is done differently than resolving if a face is female with certainty.  Additionally, the study found that generally females perform better at facial recognition than males.</p>
<p>Does this mean the human brain has &quot;areas&quot; dedicated to recognizing gender? I don't know if you can draw that conclusion specifically, but it does assert that the process to determine a male face versus determination of a female face is handled differently in the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way a solid object stays together as one solid object is because of the forces between the atoms and molecules inside the object. If you push or pull one end of it, that pushes or pulls the bit next to it, which pushes or pulls the bit next to that, and so on and so on until the whole object appears to move together.</p>
<p>However, it actually takes some time for a push or pull on one side of an object to reach the other side. This is actually much slower than the speed of light - it's the speed of sound. This means there's no need for the entire object to get pulled in at once - one part could cross the event horizon before the other end even knows what's happening.</p>
<p>Also, this strength is of course not infinite - if the strength of the bonds in the solid object are weaker than the tidal forces of the black hole, the object will get ripped apart.</p>
<p>So the short answer is that it would break down whatever is falling into it.</p>
<p>The black hole would also expand a bit, just because it's gaining extra mass. But it's not like it's opening its mouth to suck in something bigger than its diameter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A black hole is just any mass in a small enough space that creates enough density that light cannot escape from it. So whatever might fall into the influence of the black holes gravity, whatever the size, will join its mass with that of the black &quot;hole&quot; and expand its radius accordingly.

<p>If the matter that is about to enter the black hole is bigger than the black hole... THEN IT's ALREADY ANOTHER BLACK HOLE!</p>
<p>Unless the mass is so disperse (greater than its own Schwartzchild radius) that it's no longer a black hole, perhaps a very very big nebula or gas cloud.</p>
<p>But in that scenario, the black hole will suck whatever it encounters, while the rest of the cloud floats (with a hole in the middle). Unless there's enough time for the cloud to stay within the accretion distance of the black hole and it gets sucked whole.</p>
<p>But we cannot think of an star-like object thousands of times bigger than a black hole, because then its only another black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The black hole would expand, of course, because any black hole's size scales up proportionally to its mass. Add more mass to a black hole, it gets more massive and grows in size.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to grow large enough to swallow the original object that is 'fed' into it, though. Rather, the object's constituent material is compressed by the extreme gravity (potentially ripping the object apart in the process) until it fits into the black hole.</p>
<p>Imagine a dry sponge. Floating around in space, the sponge would tend to rest at a particular size. But if you laid the sponge on the ground, it would tend to flatten out a little (particularly at the bottom), becoming smaller than its 'default' size, because the Earth's gravity is pulling it against the ground. What the black hole does is similar, but much, <em>much</em> stronger. It would be able to not only squeeze the sponge into a solid block of plastic, but even squeeze the atoms in the plastic until they get crunched together and stop being atoms, and then squeeze the little particles that atoms are made of until they stop being particles too. Anything that falls into the black hole keeps getting squeezed down like this towards a single point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>THANKS FOR THE GOLD!!!</strong> my first time ever.... I would like to thank .... <strong>THANKS</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a playground with five groups of kids playing in a playground:</p>
<p>The first group is a bookworm club, and has the luxury of knowing the only language in which the rules of the playground/games/swings/rides are written. They only teach this language to their own kind. If anyone wants to know how a particular game/swing/ride works, they come to them. They also run schools where they teach written language (not the special language) to other kids. These are your Brahmin Kids. </p>
<p>The second group is the playground bullies club, but this group also the protects the playground from other kids who are not regulars, or want to take the playground for themselves. They know martial arts, and they write literature and arts in their local language. They bully everyone except the Brahmin kids, because they hold the power of knowledge. Others, they bully or pamper depending on how much they need them. One of them, is the de-facto ruler of the playground. These are your Kshatriya kids.</p>
<p>The third group is a group of rich kids, they own several of the swings/rides in the playground, they frequently trade with other rich kids who own stuff on other playgrounds. They keep paying up to the bully to ensure their own protection, and the protection of their swings etc. Sometimes the bullies are nice to them, sometimes the bullies take away their stuff, to fund their campaigns to attack other playgrounds. These are your Vaishya Kids.</p>
<p>The fourth group is a group of hardworking kids, whose sole purpose is to ensure everyone in the playground is fed, and everything in the playground works. They are paid measly wages by the traders and/or the bullies. They all share their knowledge of stuff through lore, and are restricted from learning any written language. <em>EDIT</em>: These are the Shudra kids.</p>
<p>The fifth group is detested by everyone else, because their main job is to clean everyone else's shit. Basically, clean the flush-less toilets by hand, take care of dead animals, work in the sewers etc. Since they work in so much filth, no one wants to even come near them, let alone touch them. Since they are forbidden by the bookworms to even talk to them, they have no way of learning anything new. These are your Achhoot (Untouchables) kids. (Come to thinks of it Untouchables has such weirdly different connotations in the west vs. India)</p>
<p>Now, as you see above, there are only two classes really trying to escape poverty. They can't because the knowledge required to enter the higher groups requires that they understand some kind of a written language, or years and years of martial training, or an incredible amount of sudden wealth. All three of these things were impossible to fake, and hence you were always stuck with caste you were born into.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is important to know that the caste system was NOT stronger in the past. New subaltern studies indicate very strongly that the caste system solidified and became excessively rigid during the 150 years of British colonial rule. The caste system originally was defined as a guild system - similar to the one in say Europe from the fall of Rome onwards (or traced back to Diocletian's reforms on guilds).</p>
<p>The varna system had 4 castes broadly, the Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. These 4 groupings were originally not prevented or banned from changing their groupings by accquiring skills belonging to another caste (guild?).</p>
<p>For instance, the writer (to whom the epic can be traced to) of one of India's most famous epics, the Ramayana was a hunter belonging to the Shudra caste.</p>
<p>You have had many kings who were either Vaishya, Brahmin or Shudra castes, we do know that the Nanda dynasty, the Marathas, Cholas for a start were from what would today be considered a 'lower caste', yet sources from their era do not even mention their caste, which should have been a huge issue if one went by how rigid the system today is.</p>
<p>If you take the Arthasasthra, it actually mentions the composition of the king's council and that it needed to have 2 from each major caste (why would a 'lower caste' person be included in the highest tiers of decision making in one of the most powerful empires this earth has seen?)</p>
<p>Take recent times, The Beautiful Tree, a report by Dharmpal on the education system prior to the British take over (using British sources interestingly enough) says unequivocally that the 100's of thousands of village schools around the country educated kids of all castes and also girl children without discrimination.</p>
<p>This is the background to the caste system per se.</p>
<p>To answer your specific question though, discrimination was really not a big concern based on castes till about the mid 16th century when the caste system did slowly start to get solidified (it really accelerated after the British take over), but even here you had very quickly, reform movements like the Bhakti movement emerge to counter these ill effects of the caste system. That said, your caste was tied to a trade, and in real terms, learning an entirely new trade was (and still is, in this modern world) very different. Secondly, the village as a social unit played a big role in the survival and prosperity of individuals, to cut those ties was (and still is) extremely difficult.</p>
<p>edit - left out the 5th caste, these were the untouchables, but this status was reserved only for those who worked the crematoria and those punished by exile from society who were made and called &quot;chandalas&quot;. These were excluded from everything.</p>
<p>Edit 2 - Just to clarify, the British did not invent this system,  they took an existing socioeconomical and cultural  structure, didn't understand it in the least, interpreted it the way their own system ran (priests, knights, traders and serfs with a bunch of slaves in the end) and applied their own rules to this system. The system then responded and became more rigid in response to this stimuli.</p>

<p>Despite what others are saying, there is no difference in skin color between lower and higher cast person.</p>
<p>The real case:
A person called A migrated from a distant village into my city of pokhara and said that he was a high caste man. He used to live in our house on rent. He had a wife. There was no way of knowing his caste. But two things gave it:</p>
<p>1) He tried to do bratabandha of his elder son which a common ceremony in which one shaves his head and puts on a sacred thread called janai. It indicates a transition to adulthood. The local priest asked him to put on the thread and A put on the opposite side. (See janai on google). So, the priest knew then on but since it was 1990 and caste system was criminalized, he did nothing. He revealed the caste to everyone and everyone knew his caste</p>
<p>2) When my grandmother was in hospital, she met someone from As village. She asked B about A and his caste was revealed. Since A had already moved to different house and it was the 90s, she did nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, rumor travels fast here. Its like a village. Everybody knew his caste. And his sons later married someone from their own caste.</p>
<p>So, you can see how difficult and risky it is to do something like that. If it was a 100 years before, he could have been executed. Only a kings command could change a low caste person to high in those times</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>On a much smaller scale energy is converted to mass around you constantly. Photosynthesis &quot;stores energy&quot; from photons chemically in hydrocarbons. Changing the chemistry very slightly changes the mass. It's negligible compared to the mass of the atoms themselves but it still occurs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct!</p>
<p>But the relationship between matter and energy is even deeper than you might think! When we say that &quot;energy is mass&quot;, we literally mean that <em>all energy is mass, and all mass is energy.</em> You can seriously increase the mass of a glass of water by microwaving it.</p>
<p>For instance, say you microwave a 12-oz glass of water that was at room temperature (293.15K) to just slightly under boiling point (373.15K) <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-room-temperature-in-Kelvin" target="_blank">source</a>.</p>
<p>That's a change in temperature of 80 kelvin. The thermal capacity of of water is <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/heat-capacity.html" target="_blank">4.184 joules per kelvin per gram</a>. (That is, it takes 4.184 joules of energy to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree kelvin).</p>
<p>Finally, our 12oz glass of water weighs 354.882 grams.</p>
<p>Throwing this all into the math-blender, we get:</p>
<p>Total energy added = 354.882 grams <em> 80 K </em> 4.184 J/(gK) = 118786.10304 J, or 118 kilojoules of energy.</p>
<p>Now, we may apply <del>Mr.</del> Dr. Einstein's famous equation:</p>
<p>E = m * C^2</p>
<p>Solving for mass, we get:
m = E/C^2</p>
<p>Plugging in our values (including the speed of light), we have:</p>
<p>m = 118786.10304 J/(299792458 m / s)^2 = 1.32167364 * 10^-12 kg</p>
<p>In other words, the weight of your cup of water <em>will</em> be increased by roughly <strong><em>one millionth of one thousandth of a gram</em></strong></p>
<p>Not nearly enough to be noticeable, but interesting nevertheless.</p>
<p>This works for <em>all</em> forms of energy too, including potential energies, such as the charging/discharging of a battery or capacitor.</p>
<p>The key thing to understand here is that, even in extremely high energy processes like fission and fusion, we're not creating or destroying <em>matter</em> at all -- instead, we are either releasing or trapping energy, which also happens to be mass, causing the matter that is <em>already there</em> to become either heavier or lighter.</p>
<p>However, if you can get the energy of your interaction high enough, like in the case of the LHC, matter itself <em>can</em> spontaneously appear, releasing some of the energy as true, physical mass/matter, rather than just increasing the weight (and speed) of any matter that was already present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So in theory, yes. But it would be unimaginably complex and take a truly ridiculous amount of energy to make an everyday object. Even with huge improvements in technology, this will probably never be more efficient than just going out and finding the material you need to make it in a more conventional way. It would probably be used to make tiny amounts of extremely rare matter, or maybe stuff that doesn't form naturally. Even then, there are or probably will be easier ways to do it (such as smashing existing stuff together in a particle accelerator).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In reality it's more complex. E=MC^2 (or M=E/C^2 has it was originally presented) Proves that Matter is a propriety of energy: The more energy a system has the more it weights.</p>
<p>Most of the registered mass of an atom comes from the energy holding the sub-atomic particles together. The rest comes from &quot;regular mass&quot; of those sub-atomic particles.</p>
<p>But yes, It is possible to make matter from energy. Not as a regular 3D printer because we are talking about stupid amounts of energy. associated with radiations and extreme temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

(For simplicity I'm glossing over hypothetical ways to change the total baryon number, if only because doing it on a large scale would be challenging.)

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked my grandfather about this before he died.  He was in the Navy during WWII fighting the Japanese in the South Pacific.  What follows below are his words and opinions, not mine, so save your hate...</p>
<p>He said it was not necessarily a big deal at the time, in terms of media coverage or public debate.  However, most people supported it.  You have to realize how emotional the country was following Pearl Harbor.  People were scared and extremely angry.  The big worry at the time was that the Japanese would invade the west coast of the USA, especially since almost our entire Pacific fleet was destroyed at Pearl Harbor.  </p>
<p>The Japanese were able to get detailed intelligence on Pearl Harbor by having operatives blend into the large Japanese-American population of Hawaii.  With the threat of an invasion, the powers that be decided to not take any chances.  They did not have a way of ferreting out operatives, so the only option was to isolate the entire Japanese community in internment camps.  They tried to give them good living conditions as best they could (in their opinion at the time).  Everyone was just so focused on the war, that they really didn't think twice about these Japanese-American citizens.</p>
<p>That basically what he had to say.  Interpret it as you will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidifiers and the like do it because they contain a fan.  In all of these cases, it's a safety feature.  </p>
<p>Fans run at different speeds by using different sets of windings in the motor.  These are literally wires that are wound to form a coil, which is part of how an electric motor works.  Using more or fewer windings in a coil changes the speed and torque of the motor/fan.    </p>
<p>If you suddenly apply a voltage to the low speed winding (1), a very large surge of current will flow through it.  If you suddenly apply a voltage to the high speed winding, the surge current will be much lower. </p>
<p>So electric motors almost always are wired so that you go from Off to the high speed winding to reduce the surge current.  This minimizes the chances of the surge current causing a problem (like a fire); it also makes the motor have a longer lifespan. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Bending/stretching/slightly heating this amorphous crystal leads to the hydrocarbon chains aligning with one another, meaning the crystal becomes more ordered, more tightly packed (density increases), and harder (work-hardening). This is like the dry spaghetti when they're still in the box: long chains running (mostly) in parallel. This changes the refractive properties of the plastic, making it opaque. Another effect of this process is that the plastic becomes more brittle, which is why if you bend it back and forth a few times, the piece of plastic will break in two along the hardened line you have created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Plastic may seem smooth, but if you look through a microscope, it's a little rough, and reflects only certain colours to your eyes, these are the colour we see to begin with. When you bend or stretch it, it becomes smoother, likens polished surface and reflects more light, and if we see all the colours at once, we see white.</p>
<p>Extra: the reason it becomes smoother is because plastic is made of lots of little long chains of plastic and when we stretch it, they slide over each other to hold on, but it makes the plastic a little thinner as they all squish up and become smoother. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
