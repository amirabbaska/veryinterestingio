I just read from the BBC that Ford is slashing 10% of its 200,000 global workforce (HALF of which is in the US) to boost profits and &quot;drive profitable growth&quot;. </p>
<p>The article also says Ford's share price has dropped 40% since 2014. I remember <del>they went bankrupt during the financial crisis and had to be bailed out</del> (edit - this isn't true at all, it was GM and Chrysler only, whoops! They did receive a line of credit from the government though), then hit record profits afterward. How are they in such deep shit again? </p>
<p>How do you explain what appears to be massive domestic and international success while seemingly always closing plants and acting like a company in peril (which cannot be good for share prices)?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since at least the early 90s, companies have been using &quot;slumping sales&quot; as a reason to lay off employees in the USA (especially), but also other countries.  Of course, the actual reason for this is automation, but saying you are laying off thousands of Americans to save money doesn't help your brand, so the press release blames slumping sales.</p>
<p>Recently, Coca Cola said they were laying off employees because people were drinking less sugary drinks, despite Coca Cola actually having increasing sales, because &quot;sugary drinks&quot; doesn't include their other markets like energy drinks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36376966" target="_blank">Foxconn Replaces 60,000 employees with Robots</a>  Foxconn is the manufacturer of Apple iPhones and many other electronics you or a family member own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/02/06/special-report-automation-puts-jobs-peril/96464788/" target="_blank">USA Today, Automation is the Greatest Threat to the Economy</a>  </p>
<p>This is also a reason that things like Universal Basic Income or shortening the work week are brought up.   When a very small percentage of the population is needed to manufacture the entire world's demand of goods, you can really only fix the problem a few ways:</p>
<p>1) Accept the problem, eliminating the middle class, and having the vast majority of the population live in poverty.  Of course this means less people buying things and is a long-term terrible result for even the wealthy.</p>
<p>2) Decrease labor hours for everyone.  If the work week was decreased to 4 days, with over-time for salary employees, many jobs would be created.  </p>
<p>3) Universal Basic Income or other &quot;wealth redistribution&quot; plans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A computer can compensate with a lot but expects outputs to be acknowledged and followed. If the planes were automated we could automate the the rest of the system but since human pilots are harder for a computer to predict due to our inconsistencies we have to put a backup human in the middle as a translator. It's not the best system but in order to change to a better one every single aircraft has to be safely fully automated first. After that you can start to change air traffic control. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source:  <strong>former</strong> USAF controller. The job was a blast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stressful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, working a scope full of traffic was fun. Stressful was maintaining focus on a mid shift (overnight) when you have two aircraft on the scope and you must remain vigilant.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you guys actually do? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We keep 'em separated. Usually by altitude -- broadly speaking, aircraft travelling north or east get odd flight levels, while southern- and western-tending traffic go with even altitude assignments.  Aircraft at the same altitude will be separated by 3-5 miles depending on aircraft types.</p>
<p>We try to move them quickly toward their destination, by abbreviating their filed flight route through our airspace.  </p>
<p>We montior traffic, and let pilots know when they can expect to see another plane in their sky.  This canbe especially important below 18,000 feet, where there are lots of pilots flying on &quot;visual flight rules&quot; -- going wherever they like (within the FAA's established rules).</p>
<p>The magic word is &quot;co-ordinate&quot;.  You talk to your neighboring airspace controllers, whether they're sitting next to you or three states over.  Radar and tower talk to one another constantly. Everyone works as a team to do the job together, safely and expeditiously <em>in that order</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of decisions are you making that can't be made by software? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software just doesn't do flexibilty as well as humans, and in ATC the variables are <em>constantly</em> changing.  Weather, time of day, and human whim impact takeoffs and arrivals directly, and it's much easier to have a human with judgement making calls versus trying to write a program that would cover all the possible eventualities.</p>
<p>edit to answer &quot;we can totally replace you with AI /  DeepMind / Wilson&quot;:</p>
<p>yeah, eventually.  </p>
<p>I think mainly it's a matter of a developer wanting to spend the resources necessary to create something that could replace controllers, or using those resources to automate something simpler.</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that automation software (like <a href="http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stars_dod/" target="_blank">STARS</a>) is already a thing. Software reduces the cognitive load on controllers and allows them to handle more traffic, but i think it will be at least 25 years before we need to worry about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3PfKf0ndik" target="_blank">TARS</a> calling traffic by himself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can speak to the &quot;why not computers&quot; part of the question, having done some work in the area of using AI for ATC operations. There's a few big issues right now that hold back use of AI for core ATC tasks like conflict resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Poor data quality. Civilian aviation radar systems actually give a surprisingly crappy idea of where planes are and what they are doing. There's this big international effort to upgrade the entire ATC system with stuff that lets planes self-report their positions to ATC (and to each other) via standard protocols, based on high-precision data from the plane's own instruments and satnav. These transponders (called ADS-B) are now really common on planes but aren't going to be universal until after 2021 probably (keeps getting bumped back). Interestingly, these transponders are civilian-readable and are the reason why there's sites like Flightaware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No idea how to train AI to be good at some tasks. For example, conflict resolution, the classic problem of determining when two planes might be in a position to hit each other soon and deciding what to do about it, and then issuing relevant orders to the planes. This is something that humans can do well but that AI does poorly. This obstacle might be removed in the future because deep learning is magical and makes absolutely anything possible. (I sound sarcastic here but there is a real potential for a big leap; ATC conflict resolution feels like one of those tasks that deep learning is born to solve.) No clear path exists for doing it anytime soon, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No infrastructure for communicating orders from machines to planes. This is actually getting fixed alongside the ADS-B thing discussed above. Planes are getting text message systems that let them get ATC messages and send/receive messages to each other (important for future plans to let pilots negotiate transocean/transpolar routes dynamically with each other based on conditions, and other cool ideas). But the implementation so far has been rudimentary and crappy. That could change soon, however.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job protections. The EU is very friendly to its ATC people, and they are one of the biggest civilian skies around in terms of traffic. US, less friendly these days but still friendly. Puts pressure on everything and everyone to keep humans in the loop.</p>
</li>
<li>Feels better. People don't trust AI more than they trust humans—yet. This is likely to change as driverless cars come into common use and people learn that AI is vastly better than humans at certain things, like, say, driving. Perceptions will change, and then policy may follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that said, there's been a ton of AI use in lots of different aspects of Air Traffic Management (ATM), a broader thingy that includes ATC as a subset. Basically all decisions about how and where to route aircraft as a result of weather-related disruptions in the US for example are being made by AI systems. All sorts of other stuff is now AI-based or is trending that way. So it may become the case rather quickly that only certain core ATC tasks are done by humans, while others take a lot longer to automate.</p>
<p>Whereupon there will no longer be any need for ATC, because nobody will have jobs that let them buy plane tickets. The 0.01% can then just use their ADS-B systems and aviation-grade text messaging systems and AI-based route negotiation systems to manage the tiny amounts of traffic of their private jets as they float safely above the tumultuous robot-vs-human wars raging below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TRAPPIST-1 is a prime candidate in the search for life beyond our solar system. It is one of the 300 closest stars to us, and hosts seven Earth-sized planets, several of which might have the right temperatures to host liquid water. It also has a remarkably precise orbital configuration. For every 2 times the outermost planet goes around the central star, the progressively interior planets each execute almost exactly 3, 4, 6, 9, 15 and 24 orbits. Such a long so-called resonant chain is unprecedented.</p>
<p>We recently translated these rhythmic planetary motions into music. We also assigned planets notes by scaling up their orbital frequencies into the human hearing range. The result is remarkably harmonious thanks to the near-perfect period ratios between planets. You can learn more and experience the awful cacophony generated by more normal systems at <a href="http://www.system-sounds.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.system-sounds.com" target="_blank">http://www.system-sounds.com</a></a>.</p>
<p>One puzzle that has loomed since the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 is how such a tightly spaced system of planets can avoid destroying itself due to repeated gravitational tugs. Our research has revealed a solution that relies on the same harmonic pattern responsible for creating such beautiful music. </p>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a diamond made entirely of carbon-14, which I understand undergoes beta minus decay into nitrogen-14, what will happen to its tetrahedrally bonded structure as individual carbon atoms decay, and are replaced by nitrogen atoms? </p>
<p>One idea I had was that the nitrogen escaped the structure leaving gaps in the lattice. If this occurs, would the diamond then conduct electricity, (given a significant proportion of the carbon had decayed) since some carbon atoms will be only bonded to 3 others, and will therefore have free electrons, similar to graphite? </p>
<p>Also, if the nitrogen were to escape, would it have to form nitrogen molecules as it does so (and therefore two adjacent carbon atoms would have to had decayed?), or would it leave the structure as singular nitrogen atoms? </p>
<p>Finally, could the nitrogen remain tetrahedrally bonded in the structure (forming four bonds to adjacent atoms rather than the usual three)? If so, after all of the atoms have decayed, what would you be left with? </p>
<p>Bonus question: would a diamond made of carbon-14 look any different to a regular diamond, i.e. refract light any differently? </p>
<p>Sorry this question is so long, but I'd be interested to find out what occurs, or if I have misunderstood the idea completely. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a naive stab at it: diamond is basically silicon in many, many ways.  They are both group IV atoms that form diamond lattices that result in semiconductors.  The real difference is that the bonding is stronger in diamond which is why silicon, as a semiconductor, has a bandgap of Si is 1.1 eV where diamond has one 5 times larger (5.5 eV).  Nitrogen, like phosphorous and arsenic, is an n-type dopant for a group-IV semiconductor. Thus, initially the diamond would behave just like a diamond that is becoming more and more n-type.  Electrical conductivity would increase exponentially with doping (i.e. conversion of C to N) but optical properties, to first order, would remain largely unaffected as the bandgap narrowing would be minimal.</p>
<p>However, there's a catch.  We don't actually use nitrogen as a dopant in silicon because of its very low solubility in Si.  What solubility means is that below the solubility limit, you basically have N playing nice with Si and basically it just takes the spot of an Si atom in the lattice but you still have an Si diamond lattice, just with the occasional N atom.  Beyond this solubility limit, the nitrogen begins to form its own separate phase.  So you no longer have N taking the place of Si, but rather separate regions of some nitrogen compound and silicon.  They separate.  At this point the material would start to behave like undoped diamond again with large defect grains whose average size increase as the average size of N precipitate grows.  However, I don't actually no the solubility of nitrogen in CARBON.  So that picture may change a lot, but regardless at SOME point you'll be past the solubility limit.</p>
<p>Beyond that I can't help you, as I'm a physicist not a chemist and things become more about chemistry at that point.  I don't know what precipitate nitrogen would form in diamond and I don't know if/when the material would crack or deform as the grain size of the N &quot;islands&quot; grew.</p>
<p>EDIT: The chemical symbol for nitrogen is N, not Ni, you think I would've remembered that....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen-vacancy_center" target="_blank">Nitrogen Vacancy Center</a> which is a Nitrogen atom replacing a C atom in a diamond next to a vacancy (missing C atom), so energy from the radioactive decay might promote the formation of such a vacancy (I don't know about the energies involved, so I cannot say how often this will happen).</p>
<p>With a half life of 5,730 years, C-14 will decay rather slowly, so any structural change is taken quite some time. So in the beginning the newly formed N will act as an dopant in diamond as /u/cantgetno197/ already explained, maybe also some N-V centers like I explained above. With higher and higher concentrations of N you would lose the &quot;diamond&quot;-character of your specimen, your C atoms would probably go towards the thermodynamically favored graphite structure. For the Nitrogen it is more favorable to be N2 (like in the air) compared to retaining the tetrahedal bonding of the diamond, but also the formation of some organic molecules like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine" target="_blank">amines</a> is possible (with enough H coming from the surrounding).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Timbers dry fairly slowly, at a rate of about one inch of thickness per year, so a 10&quot; by 10&quot; timber will completely dry in about 5 years.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dino bones are big. Lots of them died in mudslides and by being buried in ash or lost to tar pits or whatever.</p>
<p>Humans tend to retrieve their dead and put them in specific places, many of which are not particularly prone to fossilization.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs are not one species, but many, many species while humans are only one species.</p>
<p>So the likelihood of finding a human skeleton in fossilized condition is fairly low, just like finding a specific species like T-rex is fairly unlikely.</p>
<p>Most of the &quot;Good fossil&quot; rock is actually sea-bed or creek-bed where silting is a great way to perform the necessary prep for subsequent fossilization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we are finding a lot of good human tidbits in peat bogs and the few undisturbed tombs.</p>
<p>Strict fossilization, the replacement of the calcium and other organic material with rock-like material via ion exchange (it is ion exchange right?) takes much longer than you think.</p>
<p>So to be preserved something has to be buried just so. This is why you don't see billions of bison skeletons cluttering up the western united states, stacked like chord-wood even though the existence of bison for thousands of years in numbers in the hundreds of millions is pretty much an established fact.</p>
<p>So up until recently there were surprisingly few humans, and indeed great apes in general, and they were not fond of living in the conditions that lead to being suddenly covered in silt. So the chance of any one body being preserved is so unbelievably small that the cumulative chance that more than a minuscule fraction were actually were preserved explains the results to date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the sense that we usually think of it, fire does indeed need oxygen as fuel.  Oxygen obviously isn't readily available in space - so we have to be sneaky and find ways to work around the problem.  </p>
<p>The first way around the lack of atmospheric oxygen is to bring along your own oxygen supply!  Some rockets incorporate oxidizing chemicals like KNO3, others just pack a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-propellant_rocket#Propellants" target="_blank">tank of liquid oxygen</a> along for the ride.  In a lot of cases, though, you need a spark to ignite the rocket when necessary, which can add some complication to your system.</p>
<p>In most cases, though, the answer lies in another distinction: we don't necessarily need fire to move; we need <em>thrust</em>.  </p>
<p>We can create thrust simply by ejecting mass, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrically_powered_spacecraft_propulsion" target="_blank">several</a> different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_gas_thruster" target="_blank">ways</a>.  However, you can usually get significantly more thrust by involving some kind of chemical reaction.  A traditional combustion reaction - fire - would be one way to do that, but there are a couple of other routes.  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopropellant" target="_blank">Monopropellant</a> rockets use a chemical for their fuel which reacts when it comes into contact with something stable - a catalyst.  Chemicals like hydrazine and concentrated hydrogen peroxide can be passed over a catalyst bed (often, the catalyst is heated to improve the reaction efficiency), and the resultant decomposition of the fuel gives off energy, <em>in addition</em> to ejecting mass.  </p>
<p>Dropping back to the use of a fuel, oxygen, and an ignition source, there are also combinations of chemicals which spontaneously ignite when they come into contact which each other - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic_propellant" target="_blank">hypergolic propellants</a>.  </p>
<p>To answer your question directly, then, we don't always need to produce fire to create thrust in space, but we can do it if we need to!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is the critical difference between a turbojet engine and a rocket engine. Turbojet engines (or jet engines for short) are designed to work in the atmosphere, where oxygen levels are high enough that air can be pulled in by the intake ports or turbines, and then sent through the engine to undergo combustion with the fuel in the combustion chamber.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that you only need two parts for a combustion reaction: the fuel and the oxidizer. In most cases here on earth, the oxidizer is oxygen, but oxidizer is a general term for something that, you guessed it, oxidizes an element. So, if we dont have a readily available oxidizer, like we do in the atmosphere here on earth, we have to bring our own into space.</p>
<p>So, in a rocket fuel tank, there are actually two compartments, one for the fuel, and the other for the oxidizer. That's what allows a rocket engine to utilize combustion as a propelling mechanism for the rocket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll expand on the existing answer a bit because there is an important distinction that wasn't fully explained. In frequentist statistics, it is regularly assumed that you are determining the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false given some observed data. This is wrong. What frequentist statistics can actually tell you is the probability of your data (or data more extreme) emerging given the null hypothesis is true (or by chance, if you want).</p>
<p>It's a subtle but very important distinction for the types of inferences you can reasonably make. Frequentist statistics cannot ever actually say anything about the truth or falsehood of the null hypothesis, only about the data observed.</p>
<p>Bayesian statistics, on the other hand, allows you to determine the probability of the null hypothesis given the data observed-- something they call the posterior probability (i.e., the probability of a hypothesis being true after data has been observed).</p>
<p>The posterior probability, p(hypothesis given data), is obtained from the prior probability of some hypothesis before the experiment or observation, p(hypothesis), and the likelihood of some data occurring given the hypothesis under question, p(data given hypothesis).</p>
<p>Now the prior probability can rarely ever be known exactly, so instead Bayesian statisticians use models to determine a distribution of likely prior probabilities. And you might recognize what Bayesians call &quot;likelihood&quot; as exactly what frequentist statistics provides.</p>
<p>So, the ultimate difference between the two schools is that the Bayesian tradition goes beyond the likelihood of the data given a hypothesis (which the frequentist tradition is limited to) and instead weights it by prior knowledge of the likelihood of that hypothesis.</p>
<p>Both traditions have strengths and weaknesses, and the relative value of either depends on the type of question you are trying to answer and the types of uncertainties and biases you're willing to accept in your inferential process.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also <a href="https://xkcd.com/1132" target="_blank">obligatory xkcd</a>. Bayesians condition their expectations on the occurrence of the event--while frequentists look at the raw frequency of the event. Is the event rare enough to say we think the null is false (freq) vs what's the likelihood given our expectations/observations (bayesian). </p>
<p>Bayes rule: p(b|a): p(a|b)p(a)/p(b) where p is probability and a and b are events. So the likelihood of b given a is the likelihood of a given b time a over b. </p>
<p>Also, so excited to have something to contribute here!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A frequentist probability is a relative frequency. That means that if you have a probability p of some event occurring, and you observe infinitely many trails, the fraction of the time that your event will occur will be p. It's an objective value.</p>
<p>Bayesian probabilities are subjective &quot;degrees of belief&quot;. That means that they depend on your knowledge of the situation. And when you take some more data, you can use it to update your degree of belief to include the new information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose I shuffle the a deck of cards look at it and set it on the table without letting you look at it.  What's the probability that the deck is in order?</p>
<p>One reasonable answer is to say that the deck is either in order, or it's not in order, so the probability is either 1 or 0.</p>
<p>Another reasonable answer is to say that (assuming a proper shuffle) the deck has a 1 in 52! chance of being in order, so that's the probability.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, that corresponds to the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian viewpoints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal clinical setting, a person with malnutrition will be monitored very closely for changes in electrolytes. These electrolytes, usually potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium in particular, will probably need to be supplemented. Thiamine (Vitamin B1) should also be supplemented. Fluids should be monitored and may need to be limited at first. When you first start feeding someone that is malnourished, you &quot;start low and go slow,&quot; mainly in regards to carbohydrates which will affect the metabolism of those electrolytes. This process is typically the first few days of feeding a malnourished person. </p>

I'm a 6 foot tall guy, so obviously that's a dangerously unhealthy weight. The key is pacing and content. I was forced to stick to easily digestable food, like oatmeals, toast, soft fruits, rice, stuff like that, and i was basically told &quot;eat until you feel full and then stop.&quot; Then i had to wait a certain time period before i was allowed to eat again, give my body time to digest, and then hopefully next time I ate, I would eat more. It was a slow process, and there was a lot of vomiting involved when I ate too fast or didn't give myself time to digest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called refeeding syndrome. It's not that you can't digest the food, but that your body reacts to the increased calories by making enzymes to break down the food. But you're so malnourished that you don't have the right building blocks so you end up with all sorts of electrolyte disturbances which can cause arrhythmia and stuff.
Basically you have to introduce them to food very slowly, and/or monitor them and replete the electrolytes that they need asap.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starving kids in African countries are fed Plumpy'nut, which is basically peanut butter with added vitamins and nutrients. They use peanut butter because it's fairly easy to eat, doesn't require a lot of chewing, etc., and peanuts are easy for the body to digest. They also help build up fat quickly, which is necessary for survival in periods of starvation.</p>
<p>So starving people pretty much just have to be introduced to food very slowly, a little bit at a time. Peanut butter or something similar seems to work well, so long as the starving person doesn't eat too much at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I realize evolution takes a while, so the natural corals in place can't keep up to their environments' changing, but if coral grow in all different environments and depths through the world, why can't marine biologists engineer new, more heat-hardy algae and coral then stimulate them to grow in the dead reefs?</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm not the first person to think of this, so what's standing in the way? Why is there this upper limit on temperature when there doesn't seem to be a lower limit, since corals can grow deeper?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually being experimented with right now. Designing new coral and zoozanthellae is still in the realm of science fiction. However, there are numerous labs working on artificially selecting heat and co2 tolerant genotypes of important reef building corals. The hope being, that we can accelerate the process of natural selection to keep pace with our changing environment. </p>
<p>This is contingent on numerous factors, however, that are difficult to overcome. </p>
<p>1) Sexual reproduction in corals is a tricky thing to get right in a lab setting, although we are getting better at it.</p>
<p>2) this is a new field and it's just getting off the ground</p>
<p>3) It's very expensive and there is still very limited funding</p>
<p>4) we don't know if it is going to work. It's possible that the species we are losing are simply not going to be able to survive the conditions they are facing.</p>
<p>5) our government is not willing to accept the magnitude of the problem</p>
<p>There is still hope that coral reefs can be saved world wide. They won't be the same ecosystems that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years, but they may hopefully still exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
