		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiologist here, who has spent well over a decade of studying the neurophysiology of a sensory system (auditory).  </p>
<p>Think of it this way:  Your senses have evolved to help you survive (detect food sources, see predators, etc).  </p>
<p>We tend to think that our senses are there to continually provide us information about our surroundings.  That's true, in a sense, but they are really there (and are biologically designed) to detect <strong>changes</strong> in our surroundings.  </p>
<p>Continuous sensory stimuli (like constant wind blowing through trees) is a distraction.  What you want to be able to sense is, for example, the sound of a crack that might be a lion stepping on a stick as he is stalking you.  </p>
<p>All sensory systems are designed to fatigue to continuous sensory stimuli.  As a sound/sensation/taste/color/visual pattern/etc persists in time, it tends to fade into the background.  The reason is that the circuitry in the brain that processes this information isn't designed to process the same information over and over - it's designed to find and cause your to react to <strong>changes in this background information that represents a change in your environment</strong>.  </p>
<p>Taste (gustation) is the same as all other sensory systems.  The biggest effect you'll experience is when something new is introduced - that effect, though, wears off quickly as your sensory system acclimates to this stimulus and resets itself to be able to find/react to a new stimulus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>The Church of Scientology requested a tax exemption from wages originating from a religious institution based on the Victoria Pay-roll Tax Act 1971. The High Court asked the question on whether Scientology was to be accepted as a religion, and decided that they were. Scientology met the two criteria that they stipulated for the determination of whether an organization is religious; first “belief in a supernatural Being, Thing or Principle” and second, “the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, it meets the same standards as any major religion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Summary:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Universe had a beginning so there aren't necessarily stars in every direction</li>
<li>Some of the far away stars light hasn't reached us yet</li>
<li>The really far away stars light is red-shifted towards infrared (not visible to the naked eye) because of the expansion of the universe. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: To add in some points from the comments.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes some of the light from distant stars is blocked by dust and other objects in the way. The dust tends to absorb visible wavelengths and re-emit in the IR range which we can’t see but that wasn’t in the video so I didn’t include it in my summary.   </p>
</li>
<li>Inverse-square law for light intensity. Intensity reduces massively over interstellar distances but that doesn’t really help answer the question because every star does this. Multiplied by an infinite number of stars in every direction, suddenly that tiny bit of light from each star adds up and the night sky should be far brighter than it is. For why it isn’t, I refer you back to the video and my original 3 points.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The existing top comment correctly realises the OP is asking an age old question, that of Olber's paradox. The top comment though goes on to make some mistakes, the first is the solution of the paradox and the second is crossing the CMBR with the paradox which are not related.</p>
<p>The paradox is: If the universe is infinite then in every direction there must be a star. In such a scenario the whole sky would be a uniform brightness, the same brightness as the surface of a star in fact.</p>
<p>The paradox was first resolved long before we knew about the expansion of space, with a finite speed of light and a finite life time for stars there is only so much of the universe that each star can be illuminating at once. Imagine a shell that has a thickness equal to a stars lifetime propagating through the universe at c.</p>
<p>We later learned that not only would an infinite universe not be bright that our universe is not infinite, there is a observation horizon due to it's expansion and a start point 13.7bn years ago. This defeats the entire premise of the paradox where every single line of sight direction intersects with a star.</p>
<p>While you can explain the lack of light from distant stars as being due to redshift, it is answering a question already answered and is being a bit dishonest anyway since, you are going to be caught out in several other aspects of the more classical solution on your way to a more complicated unnecessary solution. For example, if you were to work out the average redshift of each unit solid angle in the sky you would find the sky would be much brighter than it is, and much MUCH brighter than the 2.7K you rattled off.</p>
<p>This 2.7K is where the mistake really lies is in equating the redshift from distant stars to the CMBR. The CMBR was not emitted by stars (which are the subject of the OP and Olber's paradox) but by a global distribution of hot gas circa 380,000 years after the big bang. </p>
<p>The biggest difference here is that the CMBR was in every direction, unlike stellar light which is only where a star is, it was also initially much cooler (&lt;3000K) and importantly this was emitted long before - and therefore much more heavily redshifted - than the light from even the earliest, most distant stars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a video with a great explanation of both the parodox and the answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yQz0VgMNGPQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/yQz0VgMNGPQ</a> </p>
<p>The paradox is basically.</p>
<p>1) If the universe is infinite then no matter where you look eventually you will directly see a star.</p>
<p>2) If every point in the night sky directly leads to a star then the entire sky will be as bright as all those stars. </p>
<p>I've seen a lot of responses about light dropping off in intensity based on distance however you have an infinite number of stars so it doesn't really matter how little light each star provides.</p>
<p>The correct answer to this parodox is that the universe is not infinitely old. So light from stars far away from us hasn't had time to reach us.</p>
<p>The expansion of the universe will prevent us from ever having a sky as bright as the sun because most stars will always be too far away for the light to reach us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Incredibly sad to see that no one has provided the correct answer. While it is true that the red shift from the expansion of the Universe does play a role, it's a minor one, at least at this point in time, and the inverse square law is entirely irrelevant as the amount of stars at some distance grows with the square of that distance, which cancels out the inverse square law of the intensity of the emitted light.</p>
<p>EDIT: For the CMB the expansion of the Universe is the key factor for not lighting up our sky and in that regard /u/Surprisedpotato's answer is correct , but not when it comes to star light as in OP's question.</p>
<p>The real answer to your specific question is time. The Universe has a beginning, a birth. The Big Bang happened a finite time ago so light from distant stars have only had a limited amount of time to travel, which means that light from the furthest reaches of space haven't had time to reach us. And most of the light emitted from the far reaches of space will never reach us, because of the expansion of the Universe, which is why that does play a role but that role will be a bigger, more important one, later on in time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question.</p>
<p>The reality that we've discovered in the past couple decades is that identical twins <em>won't</em> have identical DNA as they age. To clarify, the order of their DNA will be the same, but they'll have unique &quot;markings&quot; on their DNA that differ. Imagine if you gave the same news article to two people and asked them to highlight the important parts. This phenomenon is what we call &quot;epigenetics.&quot;</p>
<p>These markings are actually small additions to the structure of our DNA that control how active and inactive certain sections/genes are. What we've discovered is that these extra markers are acquired during life, and in certain cases can be passed down to our offspring. Some are added and removed constantly based on environmental factors, ensuring that identical twins will never really be identical. Others are more &quot;permanent&quot; and offer an avenue for distinction.</p>
<p>In one of the first studies on this, we essentially starved parent mice (but not to death), and then looked at both their DNA and that off their offspring. The parents adapted to low food environments by adding these on/off markers to certain metabolism genes, and that was passed to the offspring. The offspring survived on low food availability without the adjustment period of their parents.</p>
<p>I'm sure a forensics expert can tell you precisely what's tested, but this is where we're at right now in the field of genetics. </p>
<p><strong>Edit: My apologies that most of my follow-up answers to questions below this have been &quot;we really don't know,&quot; but honestly we really don't know a whole lot about epigenetics yet.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ID twins and I’ve asked doctors questions like this before, especially my genetic specialist. ID twins have enough difference in their DNA for experts to tell them apart, even when they’re born. Just like they don’t have identical fingerprints, their DNA differs. However most paternity tests aren’t 100% conclusive either — they usually give a 97% probability outcome at best. Even between regular siblings, paternity tests aren’t always conclusive. So the short answer is yes, but it would be expensive to drill down to get your answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to epigenetics, the twins would have slightly different histone packing and modifications to the DNA.  But I don't feel this would result in a usable system for paternity testing.  Whilst in labs the methylation of DNA can have readouts, but even with the inheritance of methylation patterns these can change, and in addition, anything more 'permanent' would have likely also been inherited from the twins parents, therefore they would share similar unlikely to change patterns.  I don't feel that with our with current technology of investigating epigenetics, it could offer a viable option for paternity testing.<br />
Alternatively, I propose that DNA sequencing would be far more viable - traditionally, paternity tests look at the length of specific genes to give a readout.  However, in our case, we would need to look at the actual genes coding regions (A,C,G,T).  The DNA repair and copying machinery are not infallible, and often makes small mistakes when you consider the size of the genome and the number of cells we have.  These are called Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (switching a C to a T for example).  You would need to look at a longer strand of DNA, and then read what the code is AAGGCATACTGA etc and possibly multiple genes but then any errors generated in one of the twins during conception will likely also have been inherited by the child.  I feel this is a method that would offer answers with our current technology, and it would not be prohibitively expensive.  Basically, you're comparing errors within the genome, because identical twins will still have errors between them, however rare they may be.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> I want to point out, I am not referring to NEW accumulative errors within somatics (adult) cells, these would not be inherited unless these are found in the sperm and meiotic progenitor cells (although still an option!) - I an proposing screening for mutations that were generated during the period when the father was an embryo which will have manifested throughout his system and gametes, these would still be evident when the father was any age and then inherited within the child.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You can do the math on this yourself pretty easily though.  Open the calculator on your computer, and type in 0.0039 (the thickness of a piece of paper).  Press the Times button, and then the number 2, and press enter.  Now press enter 102 more times.  By the mid-50's your calculator will actually reach a point where it has to start using exponents, and by 60 you'll have surpassed the what the calculator is capable of. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For example if you are trying to dissolve something that has a strong exothermic reaction with water (acids and bases being good examples of this) you can inadvertently heat up the water too fast causing it to boil and splatter all over the place.  Which of course if you are splattering acid solution all over the place it could injure you if you aren't careful. </p>
<p>Exothermic reactions in general tend to be dangerous to do because of the fact if too much heat is released too quickly it can even cause explosions.  Most lab accidents I've seen are usually because someone performed the mortal sin of chemistry by scaling up an exothermic reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flameless_ration_heater" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flameless_ration_heater</a></p>
<p>The MRE heater contains magnesium metal, iron, and table salt. Upon addition of water, the magnesium is oxidized exothermically. Because of the presence of iron and table salt, the reaction occurs quickly enough to produce boiling water.</p>
<p>An instant cold pack is an example of an endothermic reaction. Some solids, such as ammonium nitrate, dissolve in water endothermically. In an instant cold pack, the middle section containing the solid is broken to allow it to mix with the surrounding water. The resulting endothermic reaction draws heat from the surroundings. The water in the instant cold pack does not freeze, though, and the temperature will generally be slightly above freezing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>We can estimate the global mining <em>volume</em> (called the hash rate), but there's no way to measure efficiency.  The energy efficiency of mining can vary by more than an order of magnitude depending on the available hardware and the software environment, and efficiency is not reported or tracked by the Bitcoin network.  Miners using stolen or subsidized electricity have no reason to care about the efficiency of their operation, so it's not safe to assume that all Bitcoin production is economic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mining in cold climates can offset the cost of heating.  If a building needs to be heated anyway then Bitcoin mining is almost free; the energy is converted very efficiently into heat.</p>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, mining in warm climates can be more expensive than your computer's power consumption would indicate.  All the waste heat must be moved out, consuming even more energy.  Inadequate cooling can cause permanent damage to computer hardware.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some upsides and downsides to this. Firstly, it does consume a huge amount of raw power, and usually it's pretty constant. This just increases stress on the electrical grid, but it's likely not enough to matter depending on the size and setup of breaker stations and whatnot. Since it's going all the time, it requires the power grid produce more power <em>constantly</em>, which right now means little renewable energy can go towards the systems. There are things people can do to help though, such as using the heat produced from the GPUs to heat a home or a floor of a building or something, but that can be hard to make efficient as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

For example, stable planetary orbits can't exist in more spatial dimensions, and it would be impossible to make predictions with more temporal dimensions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is akin to asking &quot;why does forwards and backwards only have one dimension?&quot;</p>
<p>Time doesn't have one dimension, it is one dimension.</p>
<p>A dimension can be thought of as a Coordinate. To locate something, we need 4 coordinates, where it is in x,y,and z, and when it is.</p>
<p>Time is just another coordinate just like the spacial coordinates (although it is one we struggle to move freely in).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say time HAS one dimension but rather that time IS one dimension. It comes down to the idea that a dimension is simply the required number of measurements needed to define something.</p>
<p>Say we want to describe a car. You might say it's a 4-door, gasoline engine, with 4 seats and the gas cap on the left side. This would mean our car &quot;model&quot; is 4-dimensional, because to define any car in our model uniquely you need four pieces of information (number of doors, type of engine, number of seats, and gas cap location). That doesn't necessarily mean though that a car is a &quot;4-dimensional object&quot; in the way you might use that phrase in a science fiction context. A car doesn't become some trans-dimensional being like a Tralfamadorian just because you use four different &quot;dimensions&quot; to measure it.</p>
<p>Also we could add another dimension to our model, say &quot;color&quot;, to make it 5-dimensional. But, depending on how exactly we define &quot;color&quot; it might take MORE than just one dimension to fully measure color. For example, in many contexts, we define color by measuring the seperate Red, Green, and Blue components together to fully describe a color, which would make color itself 3-dimensional! (And thus, making our full car model 7 (4+3) dimensional) Alternatively, we can measure color using Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black components and have a 4 dimensional color space. It would also be possible to have a 1 dimensional color space if we used something like the hex codes that website stylesheets use to define color (e.g. the color red would be #FF0000, which means a value of FF for the red component, and 00 for the green and blue components, where FF here is the value 256 in hex). So you can see how the data itself as well as our representation can influence the number and type of &quot;dimensions&quot; we need. These dimensions are simply ways of enumerating data.</p>
<p>In our current model of space-time, if you have two events that both occur in the exact same position (measured using 3 dimensions: X, Y, and Z) then the only way to distinguish them is by the time elapsed between them. This number is represented in our system by total seconds elapsed, which is only one number and thus one dimensional. But theoretically, you could also measure it by seconds elapsed, hours elapse, and days elapsed like we do in less formal settings, which would make time 3-dimensional! But really it's still measuring the same, one thing that seperates two events in spacetime, which makes it one-dimensional. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
