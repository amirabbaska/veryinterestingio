We can routinely &quot;accelerate&quot; neutral atoms up to hundreds of keV or even 1 MeV through sequential ionization, acceleration, and recombination. While chargeless particles are not accelerated at any stage of this process, the net result is much faster neutral particles than you began with. This technique, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_beam_injection" target="_blank">neutral beam injection</a>, is commonly used in fusion experiments to heat the plasma. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not based off of our current theories. Electromagnetism works because we are able to create powerful fields with macroscopic tools. The other fundamental forces don't work for different reasons:</p>
<p>Gravity and Weak Nuclear Force: too weak to accelerate particles with such short lifetimes (they don't even lift)</p>
<p>Strong Force: a thing called &quot;colour confinement&quot;, essentially, once colour charges get far enough separated, they spontaneously create a pair of new charges between them to maintain colour neutrality, so we cannot have a macroscopically colour charged object (this is also why Q/G plasma is not something that can be physically separated into constituients that are not colour neutral)</p>
<p>Therefore EM is the only force usable to accelerate particles because it is the only one where we can maintain a strong enough field for a long enough time to be useful. The reason electric fields are used instead of magnetic fields is simply because they are more efficient at accelerating particles. As pointed out by multiple commenters below, it is possible to accelerate neutrons with magnetic fields, but why not just use protons and a more efficient acceleration technique?</p>

<p>Edits for clarity (and jokes)</p>
<p>Edit2: /u/phsics pointed out an indirect acceleration method called neutral particle injection that is pretty rad</p>
<p>Edit3: clarification that where I work is not a real source, but an implication that I have aquired knowledge necessary to answer this question correctly, will return with source links</p>
<p>Edit4: As pointed out by /u/ThatPhysicistTTU , the magnetic field cannot do work on a particle, so it cannot change the energy of a charge (i.e. increase the speed of the charge). However, a dipole CAN be given more an energy by a magnetic field if the magnetic field has a high gradient.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a physics grad student currently working on something called a Stark decelerator, which can accelerate (we mostly use it to decelerate to rest and trap) neutral objects that have an electric dipole moment. Fundamental particles unfortunately don't* have electric dipole moments, but atoms and molecules can (we study molecules).  There are also zeeman decelerators that can accelerate objects with a magnetic dipole moment, which particles can have (although, since I work on decelerating molecules and atoms I don't know how feasible it would be to use it to accelerate particles. </p>
<p>Both of these work on the same principle. The dipole moment interacts with the field to change the potential energy of the particle. There are many stages where you can create a high field that can be switched off. To accelerate, you time the switching so that the fields are turned on when the particles are in the region of high field. As they move away from the high field they lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, meaning they were accelerated. To decelerate, you time the switching so that the particle enters the high field region, gaining potential energy and losing kinetic energy, and then the fields are quickly turned off, leaving the particles with less kinetic energy (they were decelerated). </p>
<p>Maybe not what you were looking for, but in principle the answer to your question is yes.</p>
<p>Edit: the asterisk is because I work in a building with people who are searching for the electron electric dipole moment which should exist in some theories beyond the standard model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CJK Type designer here. </p>
<p><strong>1) Limited character set</strong>
As others have indicated, thankfully no one has to actually design millions of characters. Actual glyph coverage depends on the needs of the font. Let's look at Microsoft as a sample (including Latin &amp; other symbol characters). </p>
<p>Chinese (Trad / Simplified): 30,000 characters.
Japanese: 24,000 characters
Korean: 21,000 characters</p>
<p>Now, the above includes a lot of glyphs that most people probably don't need. In the case of Korean, the most basic fonts can have just around 3,000 characters (just Hangul and Latin, no Hanja) and work for most scenarios. For Japanese, there’s 48 Katakana, 48 Hiragana, and about 3000 core Kanji (for literacy), which would cover a majority of scenarios. But for a company like Microsoft, a greater degree of support is necessary. </p>
<p><strong>2) Accelerated and Semi-accelerated tools</strong>
In the case of Korean typefaces, there are tools that help expedite the development of Hangul characters. As Korean syllable glyphs are divided up into component pieces, one can instruct the tool on where to place those components and which variant of each component to use. For some fonts there are 40+ variants of each component! With this sort of tool, building can be faster. But it won't always work for a given situation and then the work has to be done by hand. </p>
<p>In some Japanese foundries, there is something of an ‘toolkit’ that is used with examples of the different kinds of strokes necessary for Kanji. So the digitizer (more on that later) can just drag in the one that is appropriate for a given glyph. However, as each glyph is different, there’s still quite a bit of manual tweaking necessary from there.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with Japanese and Chinese is, like with Korean, there’s significant manual adjustment of a given radical or stroke for every character. So even if a tool was able to at least ‘assemble’ the pieces into a given glyph, you’d have to make significant manual adjustments from there. </p>
<p><strong>3) It takes an army</strong>
I heard a story from a friend of mine who visited a Chinese foundry. Designers would pull a Hanzi from a hat and that would be the character they have to produce. With an army of 30 people working on a single font, they’d churn through the characters until the font was complete. </p>
<p>In one major Japanese foundry, there is a division of labor—“designers” draw the characters on paper, “digitizers” trace those drawings to digital representation, “production” takes the digital representations and produces actual fonts. All told, it is a significant operation involving a large group of people. It takes them a year to complete a single weight (say, the “Regular”) of a brand new font family.</p>
<p>Producing these things is a TON OF WORK. </p>
<p>A quick aside about Korean—given the existence of accelerated tools for production, these <em>can</em> be done faster than Japanese or Chinese fonts, but the best ones usually have manual edits and tweaking on an extensive number, if not all of the syllables. One Korean type designer I spoke to warned me about the use of accelerated tools—that the actual results from it are not that great. He, obviously, recommended doing everything by hand. </p>
<p><strong>Basically:</strong></p>
<p>1) It may not be as many characters as you think it is
2) There are some tools for accelerating work, though a lot is still manual
3) Usually the work is done by a group of people, over a period of time, rather than by an individual. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll talk Simplified Chinese, since that's what I know. The Chinese government has created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters" target="_blank">a list of commonly used characters</a>. It contains 8105 characters; characters outside of this list are going to be very rare (and even some characters within the list are rare, like 玃, the name of a particular kind of ape, or 𫚭, which I can't even find in my dictionary).</p>
<p>8105 is of course a much larger number than the 52 that we need for English (26 upper case, 26 lower case) that needs to be encoded. However, to <em>design</em> them, less work needs to be done. Chinese characters can be broken down into parts that are often repeated across similar words. For example, consider the word for shine 照. In the top of that character, you can see other component characters: the one for sun 日 in the top left, knife 刀 in the top right, and mouth 口 in the middle right. The bottom is four dots, a component historically derived for the character for fire 火. In all four of these cases, we can reuse these component parts in other characters that use them; the font designer only needs to design such parts once, needing only to resize them and move them around. In our example, other places we can use these four component characters are: 日 is on the left side of time 时, 刀 is on the bottom of cleave or chop 劈, 口 is on the left of eat 吃, and the modified 火 is on the bottom of hot 热, among many, many others. (For further reading, look up &quot;Chinese radicals.&quot;)</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that font design in English is not just designing the 52 characters (and miscellaneous punctuation). It also requires logic that governs what happens when two particular characters are placed together (ligatures) - for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature#/media/File:Ligature_drawing.svg" target="_blank">this image</a> shows what might happen if a font designer thinks that f and i should be rendered differently when they are together, as in fi: these are called ligatures. An extreme case happens in Arabic, where each letter has a different beginning, middle, and ending form. Chinese does not have such complexities that it needs to encode in its font (Chinese has a square symbol for each character, including punctuation, and these characters look the same no matter what's before or after it), which mitigates the file size and design requirements. And there's the logic about &quot;where it's legal to break to a new line&quot; - it's OK to break a line after a dash or hyphen, but not after an apostrophe (unless there's a space after it). The first example below is perfectly readable but the second one is odd:</p>
<pre><code>it's a new-
fangled idea

it'
s a new-fangled idea</code></pre>
<p>Again, Chinese has more simple rules regarding this, though there are still rules (you can't break right before a period, for example). But this is just a reminder that fonts are not just strings of character designs, there is also logic behind them that needs to be included.</p>
<p>In practice, Chinese fonts also include the basic English alphabet because it's so prevalent (and indeed in informal contexts some English letters are used alongside Chinese characters), and also there are use-cases where people will need obscure characters not in the list of 8105 commonly used characters, so font designers will need to include some such characters, too. So it is indeed far more work to create a Chinese font than an English one. It's just probably not quite as bad as you think it is.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm pretty sure there are similar official lists of &quot;commonly used characters&quot; in Taiwanese-style Traditional Chinese, Hong Kong-style Traditional Chinese, and Japanese (and maybe even Singapore-style Simplified Chinese? I'm not too sure). But the difference between these writing systems is a different topic.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I'm not a font designer, so the details might be slightly off. However, I am a Chinese speaker, albeit not quite a fluent one, and more importantly a Unicode enthusiast, if that's a thing, so the overall ideas should be correct. Anyone with more knowledge on the subject, feel free to elaborate on anything or point out anything that's incorrect.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Usually, characters for these 3 languages are packed into one font, called CJK fonts.</p>
<p><strong>First of all: do you know what fonts look like?: A list of characters</strong></p>
<p>To put it simple, each font is a gigantic list of letters. If you input a letter, and there's no matching character in that list, it will not come out right; sometimes a blank will show, sometimes a different, typically weird looking letter will show.</p>
<p><strong>Let's count the number of letters needed!: 50,000</strong></p>
<p>Japanese also uses their own letters, which are around ~50. But they come in both smaller form and bigger form, which doubles the count. Still, the number is somewhat reasonable.</p>
<p>Now for the main show! there are a lot of Chinese characters, as you already know. The problem gets even worse because China, Japan and Korea uses different kind of Chinese letter! Chinese uses the most simplified form (along with their own traditional form), Japanese uses less simplified form, and Korean uses the most complicated form. So you need 3~4 sets of Chinese characters.</p>
<p>And Korean letters are a bit more complicated; the written Korean, Hangul, consist of ~30 components, and you are supposed to combine 2~6 of them into one letter. Which means there can be a lot of letters you can make, if there's no limitations!</p>
<p>That's why font creators came up with a limit of their own. For Korean, they picked ~10,000 the most used letters in Korean, and put only those letters in the font. The same goes to the Chinese letters, although I don't know the number. I suppose you can google &quot;Chinese font character numbers&quot; for more detail.</p>
<p>Let's say there are 10,000 for Korean and 4 set of Chinese character. It ends up with 50,000. Add the Japanese letters and it ends up with 50,100. Whatever, let's go with 50,000.</p>
<p>By the way, that's the reason CJK fonts are way bigger than Alphabet-only fonts. Google is distributing Noto Sans series of fonts. If you're interested, look for Noto Sans English and Noto Sans CJK; and compare their size. CJK fonts are way, way bigger than English fonts.</p>
<p><strong>How the fuck do they design letters?: Divide and Conquer</strong></p>
<p>So, do the font designers design each and every letter in the font? All 50,000?</p>
<p>The simple answer is, yes, they design every single letter in the font. </p>
<p>But there is an easy way.</p>
<p>Did I mention that Korean consist of components? Similar principle goes for Chinese, although they are way crazier than Korean. There is ~10 components in Chinese, but in the most complicated case, Chinese characters are combined of 1~30 components.</p>
<p>But, still, they are made of components. <strong>Which means you can set a design standard</strong>. Once you make a design standard, you can use them as building blocks for more complicated letters. Like LEGO! When you combine each components into a letter, components might slightly change their shapes. Still, you can make more design standards for them, and use them for the letter.</p>
<p><strong>Even easier way!!: Don't design them at all</strong></p>
<p>There's yet another much easier way to deal with this problem. Buy a cheap font license, and recycle them.</p>
<p>Let's say you're designing a font specifically for Japanese and Japanese only. You don't need 50,000 letters; you only need 100 for Japanese letters and 10,000 for Japanese-Chinese letters. If you give up on the rest you can cut off 80% of the work! And that's how it's typically done. There are a lot of Chinese-only, Japanese-only or Korean-only fonts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a reporter at Quartz and a little while ago wrote a <a href="https://qz.com/522079" target="_blank">very in-depth article</a> on the process of creating Chinese fonts, by interviewing typographers in Taiwan. I'll answer your questions with my own knowledge and some quotes from that piece.</p>
<p>The short answer is that it takes a lot of work, and a lot of time. As I wrote in the piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An experienced designer, working alone, can in under six months create a new font that covers dozens of Western languages. For a single Chinese font it takes a team of several designers at least two years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But while there are many more glyphs—units of a typeface—needed for Chinese and Japanese, the number does not go to the &quot;millions.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default set for English-language fonts contains about 230 glyphs. A font that covers all of the Latin scripts—that’s over 100 languages plus extra symbols—contains 840 glyphs, according to Březina. The simplified version of Chinese, used primarily in mainland China, requires nearly 7,000 glyphs. For traditional Chinese, used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the number of glyphs is 13,053.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's important to know two things about Chinese characters to get a better understanding of how this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters share a large number of &quot;strokes&quot;—the same motion or parts of characters are common across dozens of characters.</li>
<li>Even so, each character has slightly different aesthetics, and &quot;balance&quot; is of critical importance. So even if the strokes are the same, a character may need to be tweaked (there are many graphical examples showing this in my piece)</li>
</ul>
<p>The short answer is that CJK font design is much more of a team effort, while Western fonts can be designed chiefly by a single person or small number of people. There is much more detail in my story, I encourage you to read it, but let me know if y'all have other questions.</p>
<p>Edit: Please be aware that there is a huge amount of misinformation in this thread. For one thing, the numbers of characters being thrown around randomly are based on <em>number of Chinese characters that have ever existed</em>, not on numbers of glyphs needed to create a font. As I say above, a simplified Chinese font needs close to 7,000 glyphs, although there are by some accounts 100,000 total Chinese characters. Second, as u/sajatypeworks rightly points out, while characters do normally share many strokes, that does not help much in terms of completing a character for a typeface. Each stroke or radical appears slightly differently in the context of a given character, so automated tools cannot do much more than collect the relevant strokes or radicals for a designer to manipulate. As you can see from some of the images in my piece, collecting these strokes and radicals is hardly the end of the process, which is why the font has to go through dozens of iterations before completion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amateur font designer here. Did you know an LGC (Latin-Greek-Cyrillic) font, like the one you're reading right now, can also include hundreds or thousands of characters? Most widely used LGC fonts cover all 3 of those alphabets. There are a lot of variations on most of the letters with various accents, and of course those numbers are doubled with capitals and lower case. Different weights and styles must be designed (e.g. italic, condensed, bold; some professional fonts have over half a dozen weights with 50+ combinations, like Extra Light Expanded Italic). Also many fonts have extra characters that are ligatures (two letters stuck together), the most common being ff, fl, and fi. (The font I'm typing in on my mobile, Dosis, has ligatures for 2 of those 3.) Unlike CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) fonts, which are generally monospaced, LGC fonts must be kerned, meaning each and every pair of characters (including punctuation and both letter cases) must be manually assigned a value for how close together they should be in order to &quot;look right&quot;. This has to be done by a human eye because a machine has no idea what &quot;looks right&quot;.</p>
<p>TL:DR; It's a lot of work to design a font for a language like Chinese, but it should be appreciated that &quot;a ton of work&quot; is also normal for fonts used for English. That's why many quality fonts are <em>not</em> free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infants are naturally curious. They often make faces that adults perceive as disgust when trying new foods, but it can just be a reaction to something they've never had before. It's new! There is a repeated exposures principle that suggests an infant or child should be exposed to a food 5-20 times before concluding that they do not like it. As kids get older they often become neophobic (afraid of new foods) and parents often pressure the kids to eat. Someone else mentioned that toddlers are at the stage where they are learning to exercise free will and will often rebel against eating the food the parent is pressuring them to eat. Often times parents will get exasperated and default to kid friendly foods like Mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, and French fries. </p>

<p>Edit: someone also mentioned that kids don't like bitter foods. This can be true and some people actually have a genetic variant that amplifies the taste of bitter foods making it more challenging for them to accept vegetables. I still think acceptance greatly depends how the vegetable is prepared.  <a href="http://www.prevention.com/food/healthy-eating-tips/new-gene-variant-identified-makes-vegetables-taste-bitter" target="_blank">Do you have the gene that makes you hate broccoli</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it, small children are biologically designed to not like bitter foods because bitter=poisonous.  So it's quite natural for them to have to learn to like some things.  Most of us outgrow that as we get older.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is just a power struggle, plain and simple.  The little one figures out that if they refuse what they are offered, they will get what they want.  I've even heard of kiddos being so hungry that they would cry all night from refusing to eat what was offered.  That is too much for most parents when the solution is simply giving in.</p>
<p>I was a pretty picky eater when I was young.  I just found something I liked and that's what I always wanted.  It wasn't the same thing all day every day, but the lunch I carried to school was the very same thing 5 days a week, for 5 years.  I don't remember not wanting other things, and my mom offered to make me other stuff, but I had my favorite and it was simple.  I was in my late 20s before I started to try &quot;new&quot; things.  My sister was shocked the first time I mentioned having Thai food.  I hadn't even tried rice until I was nearly 30!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They have no choice and can't express themselves. The parents are just shoveling food into their faces and the baby can't do anything about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when they become toddlers, they'll only eat chicken nuggets and french fries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point they know they like these things and the parents aren't really offering great alternatives. Do you think it is chicken nuggets vs buttered crab? Nope, it is nuggets vs mangled steamed vegetables. It is normal to not really prefer the things parents wish their children would choke down, and this is usually the tiny bit of self-determination they can try to obtain at this age. Everything else in their life is out of their control but they can close their mouths!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but as they get older, they start to have a more sophisticated palate.</p>

<p>Presentation is another point here. If you want to try octopus it can be a fun discovery, but if I sat you down and said you had to eat every sucker before you could leave the table and go to your room for bed (no, you can't stay up past 8 pm) you probably would feel differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</li>
<li>Marketing - The shoes are trying to grab your attention at the point of sale, and they <em>look like</em> they have &quot;advanced exercise tech&quot; integrated into them.</li>
</ol>
<p>A similar analogy would be electric/hybrid cars and why they're all arguably ugly. Part of it is for actual function reasons, but a lot of it is because consumers who buy them deliberately want to look futuristic, stand out, and appear <em>different</em> from regular cars.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: Some people are replying about the hybrid vehicles part. I assure you this is a thing. There's been studies that (particularly when the hybrid/green trend began) &quot;green&quot; vehicle owners want to be acknowledged about being green. Here are some links:

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, more than half of the Prius buyers surveyed this spring by CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore., said the main reason they purchased their car was that “it makes a statement about me.”</p>
<p>“I really want people to know that I care about the environment,” said Joy Feasley of Philadelphia, owner of a green 2006 Prius. “I like that people stop and ask me how I like my car.”</p>
<p>“I felt like the Camry Hybrid was too subtle for the message I wanted to put out there,” Ms. Gatch said. “I wanted to have the biggest impact that I could, and the Prius puts out a clearer message.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this is just a strategy used by some manufacturers. Other brands like Tesla are trying to do the exact opposite, which is to appeal to a crowd that want a luxury tier green vehicle that looks sleek and normal. As green vehicles are becoming more commonplace, there will be less of a consumer need to stand out from the crowd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, mathematics.  There are only so many solid colors one can go, and there are only so many shoes a company will offer at a certain time (though they often do have a lot).  Color combinations and schemes have more than one color so naturally you get more combinations.</p>
<p>If you had 10 solid colors, getting any sort of combination means combining by the other colors.  So 9.  10 x 9 is 90.  So there are 10 main colors and 90 other shoes with different schemes that can be made in a variety of ways.  Different patterns can be made whereas solid colors can't have different patterns.  Shoes might have different physical designs but you can recolor any design, so it balances out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And you're looking down more often, I think shoe companies make their running shoes &quot;ugly&quot; or neon because when we see them we're instantly reminded of running or working out. When I see a neon shoe I immediately associate it with running, it makes me want to run, reminds me I haven't in a while, etc. and furthermore, when I'm wearing them while I'm running I look down and get a psychological burst of energy because I've associated wearing the shoe with working out.

The other is that you are falling prey to conformation bias and only remembering the particularly ugly ones.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for lack of technical terms here, but this is what I know from working in AR/VR space where we had to take into account the science of the eye for calibration and ergonomics.</p>
<p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;hurt&quot;.  When you look around, two aspects of your eye are moving: the muscles that control direction, and the muscles that control focus.  The focus muscles are mostly indirect control, but you can learn you control them directly.  When your eyes are looking straight ahead (perfectly parallel) then your eyes believe you want to focus on infinity, so they move the lens to try to focus on infinity.  When you look at something 1 meter away, your directional muscles pull the eyes inward, and the focus muscles move the lens to focus on 1 meter away.  When you cross your eyes, your directional muscles pull your eyes all the way inward, and your focus muscles TRY to focus on 0 meters away, which they cannot do.  Those focus muscles are straining, and that is where the pain comes from.  When you look far to the left or right, your focus muscles are not straining, because you are probably looking at some object a few meters away.  You can feel the same strain if you look far to the left or right AND at an object right next to your face.</p>
<p>Also, you can learn to control the focus / directional muscles independently. Those &quot;magic eye&quot; images require it. Your directional muscles look &quot;through&quot; the page, but then your focus muscles must focus on the distance of the page.  Since these two muscles are conflicting, it can cause eye strain over time.</p>
<p>This is also another reason why AR/VR displays can cause strain / headaches.  Those AR/VR worlds display objects at different distances, but with the same focus (there is only one focal length of the lenses in the displays).  Manufacturers will set the focal distance to around 2 meters, since that seems to work well enough for most situations without causing much pain.  So when you look at a VR object that is only perceived to be 0.5 meters away, your directional muscles are looking at 0.5 meters, but your focus muscles are looking at 2 meters, causing strain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two systems exist for moving eyes. Conjugate movements are saccades and pursuits, fast and delicate. Convergence movements are slower and multipurpose, because the brainstem center that stimulates convergence also stimulates accommodation, focusing effort. This coordination of effort keeps the image single and focused at the same time. </p>
<p>Humans use convergence effort to help focus the eyes, so convergence developed to the degree you could stretch the tendons to a level of pain.</p>
<p>There was never a need to develop &quot;excess&quot; saccade ability, because extra-strength saccades would overshoot, for example.</p>
<p>So &quot;eyestrain&quot; usually results from an imbalance in the amount of effort needed to focus the eyes and converge them to the same distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye convergence (crossing your eye) is directly related to eye focus. When you focus you change the shape of the lens in your eye to clear things up close. That takes effort which is why we get eye strain when a lot of computer or phone use. </p>
<p>When you cross your eyes you are pulling the converging muscles and focusing at the same time. Without something to focus we tend to over do it and it can get very uncomfortable. But if you take a finger and slowly bring it towards your nose, crossing your eyes tend to be a little bit easier (up until you get too close).</p>
<p>Last thing: it gets more difficult as we age.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are- rhabdomyosarcoma, for example. </p>
<p>It's comparatively rare though because there isn't much turnover of cells in the muscle, and they don't get much exposure to carcinogens. Any lining of the body has a high rate of cell division, and that's where errors creep in. </p>
<p>Imagine photocopying the instructions for baking a cake every time you baked one, but instead of using a master copy you used the previous photocopy. And there's a little gremlin who can come in and change a number or a letter at random, and you don't know what the gremlin has been doing. </p>
<p>The first cake is fine. And so is the 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc. Until eventually you can't quite tell if it's 5 or 6 ounces of sugar. Or what that squiggle means that you're supposed to add a teaspoon of. This is what happens with cancer. The photocopying is cell division, and the gremlin is the action of carcinogens on the DNA of the cell. Most of these errors get caught, either by the error checking in the cell division mechanism, by the immune system which kills off cancer cells, or by the cell simply ceasing to function properly and dying. </p>
<p>Muscle cells don't duplicate very often, unlike your skin or the lining of your bowel. Your lungs, skin, bowels etc are all basically linings, and so have loads of cell divisions going on all the time. Rhabdomyosarcoma is commonly a disease of childhood, as this is when muscles are growing and the cells are dividing. When someone trains a lot in the gym, they don't actually get new cells in their muscles, it's that the existing cells develop more muscle fibres within them, so the individual cells get bigger.  </p>
<p>Basically, the muscle cells are like a cake recipe that you bake once a year. Skin, bowel, etc etc are cakes that you bake every day. Lungs are cakes with a particularly disruptive gremlin, if you're a smoker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The popular answer is the evolutionary one--that emotions have helped us survive. When we lived in the wild--with monkeys and mastodons and tigers--we needed emotions in order to react quickly to dangerous stimuli. If faced with a tiger, it's better to be rocked with a fear so strong it triggers a rush of blood than to sit around and theorize about the threat. We developed an emotional system because it could induce quick responses to danger.</p>
<p>Other emotions work the same. Humans are rather clever animals. We've managed to teach ourselves how to express ideas through written words, as well as emotions through art and music. Think about that for a minute. Through our art and music, the emotion felt by an artist may be encoded through color, shadow and harmony to be decoded and experienced by an observer or listener. That is arguably one of humanity's greatest accomplishments. </p>
<p>And yet, despite the apparent ease with which artists or musicians can create a work that unlocks emotions in the audience, <strong>we have no idea how it does such an amazing thing. We do know that emotions may be expressed in art -- and that humans can readily recognize them.</strong></p>
<p>As with music -  Jordan Peterson explained this pretty well in one of his lectures.</p>
<p>We want meaning in our lives. Life is a balance between order and chaos and we don't take too well to chaos but it can be overcome and made into order, making us feel accomplished and life meaningful. Music mimics this process. It's highly ordered and miraculous. He claims even the most nihilistic of us like music because of this reason. It generates meaning. People on psychedelics often say they really understand and can see the structure of music way differently than the normal waking state. Haven't done them though so can't comment.</p>
<p>More details :</p>
<p>Music is processed by the auditory system in the brain, just like verbal information (speaking). The auditory system is connected to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotion processing. Music can, just like verbal information, activate the entire limbic system and thus stimulate an emotional response if it's suitable for the situation (context processing is also important in stimulating an emotional response).</p>
<p>The same goes to other sensory perceptions - vision can also stimulate an emotional response, for example art paintings. Smell is unique in the sense (pun unintended) that smell information travels directly to its cortex in the brain, unlike the other sensory information that first passes through a relay station (the thalamus), and is tightly connected to the hippocampus (responsible for memory formation, context and emotion processing). Smell can thus trigger very profound memory recall to specific situations</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read an interesting dissertation a while back about this effect in music.  The idea was that music impacts us on a lot of different levels at once.  On the physical level, studies have shown that your heartbeat responds to the beat of music, which in turn influences your mood/excitation.  On the social level, we are taught from a very young age to interpret certain sounds certain ways.  For example, many Americans interpret music in minor keys as &quot;sad.&quot;  There is also the associations that our brain makes - we hear a particular tinkling run of notes, and that tinkling sound is associated by our brain with water falling.  Then you add in personal experiences, and the result is synaesthetic (which means experiencing one sense triggers memories of others).</p>
<p>So I hear a song with a slow beat (slows my heart, relaxes me), in a major key (socialization = happy!), where the melody reminds me of moving water (like the waves at the beach), and my brain takes all that together and connects me to a wonderful memory of building a sandcastle with my niece at the beach.</p>
<p>I can't speak to other forms of art/literature, but I suspect there's similar results.  The dissertation was &quot;Indra's Note:  An Investigation into Musical Awareness&quot; by Randall Pabich</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well remember that all art, music, and literature, is made by <em>people</em>. People who wanted to <em>express</em> something through one of these mediums. Express something like a feeling, or thought, or idea, something that they could not convey in simple words, as they were confronted with a strange gap between the limited range of everyday communication, and the seemingly intangible nature of the thing inside of them, waiting to be shared.</p>
<p>So they try to bridge this gap. They try to create paths, links, associations, from the '<em>thing</em>', the little bit of reality within, to something created outside, which mirrors that feeling inside. The artist, hoping to be able to re-create the feeling - or something analogous to the audience - tries to keep in mind that this path can't be too unique to him or her. It needs to be a path that could take many to a similar place within them, even if they're all different people.</p>
<p>Artists create art because they are moved. What makes them great artists, is not conveying just what they moved, but recreating the way that they became moved at all, through the basis of our mind which is the senses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the comments here are from a scientific perspective. I'd like to add a philosophical perspective to the conversation. </p>
<p>Extraordinary art (in general) resonates with us when it points to some deep truth about the nature of our reality as humans. Whether that is the truth of suffering or our hope for the alleviation of that suffering, art reminds us of what it means to be human by tapping into that which we all desire, fear, love, or hate. Goya's <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Goya_Dog.jpg" target="_blank">Dog</a>, for example, immediately conveys a sense of isolation and fear that we have all experienced. Sometimes we are not as connected with that part of our inner life, so seeing the image punctures the dam we've built up, and the emotions pour out. </p>
<p>Or see this explanation of <a href="http://www.classicfm.com/composers/mahler/guides/symphony-no-2-genius/" target="_blank">Mahler's 2nd Symphony</a>. If you pay attention to the symphony, it's almost impossible not to be moved, since we all fear death. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbonation is bubbles. Bubbles pop. That's why carbonated drinks feel tingly in your mouth. Have you ever blown bubbles outside, and had one pop close to you? Sometimes you get sprayed with the soapy water as the bubble pops. The same thing happens in your mouth. When the bubbles pop, the drink can spray the inside of your mouth.</p>
<p>So what happens when you eat spicy food? Well, spicy food has a chemical in it called capsaicin. It touches your taste buds and makes them feel hot. When you drink a carbonated drink and you have capsaicin in your mouth, the bubbles pop, and they spread that capsaicin around to more taste buds. Instead of cooling your mouth down, it makes it spicier! </p>
<p>Maybe that's what you are feeling. Not everyone feels the same thing. Some people don't mind the spicy flavor spreading. I like to drink beer with spicy food. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As others have mentioned the the capsaicin in peppers are what causes the spicyness. This is actually the capsaicin agrivating and activating the pain/nerve receptors on your tounge. </p>
<p>The carbonation in sodas are not a taste either as others again have mentioned this sensation is caused by the popping of the bubbles on your tounge.</p>
<p>Most liquids tend to spread the capsaicin around your mouth and throat. (Milk being one of the exceptions.) A carbonated beverage would do the same while the bubbles pop in your mouth and throat.</p>
<p>Some people might find these sensations to be less pleasurable together. I personally am not bothered by drinking a carbonated beverage with spicy food. </p>
<p>Basically to some extent it is just your personal preference. </p>
<p>Although I would be interested to know whether and how much these sensations actually effect the fruity taste of the peppers and the sugary taste of the soda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bioluminescence is produced by chemical reactions involving molecules called luciferins.  These chemicals are able to produce light very efficiently without a lot of waste heat.</p>
<p>As for making them, well, we can.  The reason we don't use chemicals for lighting is because, while efficient, they aren't very <em>bright</em>.  Try lighting a room with a bucketful of fireflies and see how much illumination they'll give you.  Enough to <em>see</em>, but probably not enough to read by.</p>
<p>Another issue is that bioluminescence requires a constant feed of new chemicals to power it.  You need something producing new luciferins, as well as oxygen to make it glow.  Like a fire, oxygen will be consumed in the reaction and must be replenished, so you can't keep it isolated in a tube.  Less convenient than electric lamps.</p>
<p>But for situations that don't require much light, scientists are already looking into it - <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/lamp-whose-light-comes-bioluminescent-bacteria/" target="_blank">check out this bacteria-powered lamp</a>!  It has it faults - it isn't very bright, the bacteria need to be fed, and it needs to be in motion to keep the oxygen flowing.  But still cool stuff.</p>
<p>It also turns out that luminescent genes are one of the easier things to splice into...basically anything.  Scientists have made glowing plants, fruit flies, shrimp, mice, rabbits, and even cats.  I've heard of plans to use genetically engineered glowing trees instead of street lamps in some cities, so that's something to look forward to.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, most of these genetically engineered organisms are florescent, not luminescent - they don't actually produce their own light, they just glow in the dark.  But there are some experimental <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/we-may-one-day-be-reading-light-houseplant/" target="_blank">bioluminescent plants</a>, although it seems they have shorter lifespans because they use up a lot of their energy to produce light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
