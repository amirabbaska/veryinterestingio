		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello /r/AskScience! <a href="https://homewardboundprojects.com.au/" target="_blank">Homeward Bound</a> is a ground‐breaking leadership, strategic and science initiative and outreach for women, set against the backdrop of Antarctica. The initiative aims to heighten the influence and impact of women with a science background in order to influence policy and decision making as it shapes our planet. The inaugural 2016 voyage took place from 2 - 21 December 2016 and was the largest‐ever female expedition to Antarctica. We care about science, the concerns of others, and we think science can unite us towards seeing and managing the planet as our global home. <strong>Ask us questions about our Antarctic journey, the Homeward Bound Initiative, and why it matters, especially now, for there to be gender equity in leadership. We'll be back around 2pm U.S. Eastern Standard Time to start answering!</strong></p>
<p>Answering questions today are 5 participants from the inaugural Homeward Bound expedition:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This'll get buried, but this is my only real area of expertise.</p>
<p>The top answers here are all pointing at health insurance companies, which is sort of right-ish, but not for the reasons they say.  There are other counties with private insurance that don't have our problems.  Most countries, in fact, have some private companies that offer supplemental plans beyond government ones.</p>
<p>The central issue is <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/3/89.full" target="_blank">how prices are set in the united states</a>.  You could just go google Uwe Reinhardt articles and he'll say it better than me. </p>
<p>Quick terminology primer: payer = who pays the doctor's bill.  this can be an individual, the government or a commercial insurance company.  provider = the one providing the care.  doctors and/or hospitals.</p>
<p>In virtually every OECD nation, prices are set centrally.  Whether there's full government ownership of the healthcare system (e.g. in france most hospitals are owned by the government) or just a single payer system (hospitals and other providers remain independently owned).  The incentives centralized pricing creates are exactly what you want:  providers do things efficiently enough to make a profit, take a loss on that business, or stop performing a procedure and refer patients elsewhere.  The government can tweak the reimbursement rates in order to adjust how the system performs.  If colonoscopies turn out to be a waste of money because they're ineffective, you lower the reimbursement rates and doctors stop doing them.</p>
<p>That's not how it works in the United States.  Here, we have literally thousands of different prices for any given procedure.  Simplifying things quite a bit, there's a government rate (medicare) which is fixed by CMS. This rate is significantly lower than what a commercial insurance company would pay the provider. </p>
<p>Prices for commercial plans are all set in secret negotiations between providers and payers.  The price paid by a commercial plan is based on the relative market strength of the payer and the provider.  </p>
<p>If it's a big insurance company with 75% market share negotiating a rate with a small provider with 5% market share, they can negotiate a low rate because that provider NEEDS to be able to accept patients with that insurance plan or they'll go out of business.  </p>
<p>If it's a small insurance company with 5% share negotiating with a huge provider, the provider calls the shots and can negotiate a high reimbursement rate.  The insurance company needs to be able to send patients to Big Brand Name Hospital because otherwise nobody is going to sign up for this plan.</p>
<p>This creates HORRIBLE incentives.  Hospitals don't need to be efficient if they can get a lot of money out of insurance companies.  The way to improve your negotiating position is by having a gigantic patient base, providing a lot of extremely high-tech services that people demand, by marketing the hell out of yourself, etc.  If I'm running a hospital and have to choose whether to invest $100M on improving efficiency or $100M in building/buying a facility in a new market, I'm not going to spend it on efficiency improvements.  </p>
<p>There's one state (<a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/5/1395.full" target="_blank">Maryland</a>) where inpatient reimbursement rates are flat and tied to medicare rates across all payers.  Private insurance companies pay exactly what the government does.  This required special legislation, but guess who has had the lowest increase in inpatient costs in the nation in the last 20+ years?</p>
<p>There's a lot more going on than this, but most of it eventually comes back to how payment/pricing works.  That's the biggest difference between the USA and most of the rest of the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Canadian married to an American so I do have some perspective on the issues, because there are multiple reasons. </p>
<p>1 - Fear. The average American is terrified of anything messing with whatever &quot;plan&quot; they have chosen. </p>
<p>2 - Distrust of Government. As a canadian I think that government's job is to provide a protective role between the people and corporations and our baser instincts of greed etc. They do so by passing laws that protect the people who are in a very inequitable position to defend themselves. A whole swath of America thinks that the government should just go. </p>
<p>3 - Propaganda I have seen over and over again in thread like these people come and say ridiculous statements like &quot;Canadians are coming to the USA to get health treatment because it's so good&quot; like the exception makes the rule. Or Canadians have to wait so long for health care. `The truth is that for the vast majority of people especially the indigent and middle class, you are so much better off anywhere with socialized health care. Yes sure if you're part of the 1% you'll be fine, but you'd be fine anywhere. </p>
<p>4-American Exceptionalism (More propaganda) Many Americans are completely convinced that America is the best country in the world. Truth is they just make this very general statement but what is America best at? Sardine fishing? (No) Clown schools? (No) Italian cuisine (Hell no) What the fuck does that statement even mean? The rest of the world (some of whom actually love their countries) just don't even at this statement. So one statement I have heard is that America also has the best health care in the world and if you look at certain hospitals who do research and specialized medicine that may well be true in part, but you &quot;Average American&quot; will never set foot in the hallowed halls of those places. </p>
<p>5- Health Care is a human right. This is how other countries look at health care. We all gladly pay so that we are all protected cradle to grave and it's cheap. For instance my no deductible, no co-pay plan costs us on a sliding scale a maximum of $900 per year. <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/data/ontario-health-premium-rates" target="_blank">https://www.ontario.ca/data/ontario-health-premium-rates</a>. My 70 year old mother in law pays more than that for her Medicaid top up. My husband when he first came here had no health coverage, and he got really good free checkups from a community health center and no it wasn't overrun. We all believe that we should all be taken care of and healthy and that we will pay for other people. Illness is the great equalizer. </p>
<p>6-The major reason that health care is expensive is that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people that work at the hospital processing insurance, at the insurance company denying claims, staff at the hospital to collect cash payments, checks, billing, accounting. For the most part, those people do not exist here. In fact, one time I was in ER because I had a foot infection and was getting IV antibiotics, and this American guy came in and broke his arm, he had an X-ray and a cast and Dr. care. So it came time to pay and no one could accept his payment, the nurse literally didn't know what to do. They charged him $375 and then they told him to sit by the door lol. They had to go upstairs and find out how much to charge, and how to accept payment. The guy had cash so they finally just found a paper and wrote a receipt on that. It took longer to take the money than to treat his arm. </p>
<p>7-You don't ask for it. Because you've been told that socialized medicine is bad, you don't demand it. If the government took away our socialized medicine here in Canada, we would draw and quarter the responsible people. No politicians dare fuck with health care because it would be political suicide. The End. </p>
<p>Imagine a world where the Dr doesn't care how much to charge and you can go to any hospital or Dr and they are on your plan. Your Dr has one goal, to treat your condition. Imagine never having to wait for your new job coverage to kick in, or even deal with preexisting conditions. No one goes bankrupt because of medical debt and in fact it doesn't exist, unless you take a loan for your boob job or botox. It's really nice. You should try it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Health insurance companies. I do billing for offices and let me tell you that health insurance companies only exist to make money as the middle man. </p>
<p>Let's say you and your employer pay $2000 a month to an insurance company to have decent coverage for a family. Well most likely you will still have a deductible/coinsurance/copay on top of that premium. If your family is relatively healthy (which if you think about it the majority of people are) then you have paid over $24000 for one year and let's say for argument sake less than $2000 in health services.</p>
<p>And not only that but the insurance companies are contracted with your health care providers to pay the lowest rate they can. So what your doctor actually bills out is much higher than the actual cost. Therefore someone without insurance can be screwed even if they can get some kind of discount through their provider. I personally find it all insane. The amount of rules, red tape, delay and bullshit insurance companies cause I believe is a major factor in why our health care system doesn't work as well as it could. They basically control the patients and providers.   </p>
<p>Edit: This has way more responses than I expected. I'm not saying insurance companies are the only factor, but they are a huge part and to say otherwise makes me believe you either work for one or have never dealt with them. There's many problems with the current system and I believe it comes down to it being a for profit system. I don't believe it's doctors that are the greedy ones. They deserve to be well compensated for the amount of school and work they have done. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Born-Canadian here, who has lived, worked, paid taxes and used healthcare in the US (as well as Canada and European countries)....And I think it's just a cash-grab..although Population plays a big part in why they are &quot;justified&quot; in charging more. Healthcare for 350 Million is different than 35 Million.</p>
<p>We have Health Insurance in Canada. We use it to help pay for medications and emergencies...But why does the same medication cost Three times as much in America?
I have a canadian plan similar to HMO/PPO plans in the US, where coverage is 90% and co-pay is 10%...But the cost of the meds is waaaayyy less in Canada.
There's many other fees that people don't discuss either...I paid $50 each time I visited my doc, that wasn't covered by insurance..What's that fee for??
My infant daughter needed to visit Emergency once in California...X-rays, medications, blood tests, etc...Ended up costing me Thousands.
Shortly after, I returned to Canada and have taken her to countless doctors, hospitals, specialists and haven't paid a dime to any of them!</p>
<p>The American healthcare system is poorly designed, because the people who need it most (kids, seniors, veterans, disabled people, etc.) are the ones who can't afford the help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Health insurance is the single ELI5 answer to this question. We have a multi-billion dollar industry standing between ourselves and our health care. The insurance industry making more money for everyone except the person who is sick and the millions that will never get sick.</p>
<p>With insurance, there became a financial disconnect between the doctor and the patient.  Health care providers were able to charge the insurance companies a higher rate then the individual patient could afford. And of course, the patient seeing nothing but the benefit of not having to pay that high bill basically became a product to be bought and sold by these two entities.</p>
<p>The absolute best thing we could do as a country is dismantle the health insurance industry and return to patient/doctor relationships.  The next best thing we could do is close down the VA and expand Medicaid to every single American by default funded by a large increase in the SS tax and allow those with the money to augment their coverage with those golden plans everyone wants.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.williams.edu/Astronomy/IAU_eclipses/eye_pressure.html" target="_blank"><strong>DO NOT PUT PRESSURE ON YOUR EYES</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most are familiar with closing the eye lids and pressing on the eye to see 'phosphenes', the constructs of our cortex in response to signals from the retina, but stimulated by pressure not light. Such pressure, if from a blow to the head, produces the 'seeing stars' effect commonly referred to. However, it is not recommended that this be done often or with any significant pressure. <strong><strong>Clearly applying sustained pressure on the eye is the same as the risk from Glaucoma, and often an exterior pressure is greatly in excess of that which might be internally generated. Non repairable damage is likely to result from any significant increase of pressure on the eye.</strong></strong> The rate of damage and extent of vision loss will be governed by eye health and age for the most part. When young the eye is resilient and pressures are absorbed more easily in other structures. With age tissues become more rigid, there is less natural protection, and the risk is increased.</p>
<p><strong>It is for these reasons that any situation that brings pressure on the eye, especially for extended periods, be avoided.</strong> </p>

<p>What's happening is that there is fluid in your eye. Increasing pressure on these fluids triggers your rods and cones in the back of the eye to send signals back to your brain, randomly. The fuzziness you see is random noise.</p>
<p>The pressure triggers channels that are usually triggered by light energy, and act like little gates turning on and off when they encounter certain types of light. Enough pressure overwhelms these gates, and causes them to &quot;break open&quot; creating fuzziness. The reason you don't see pure white is because each rod and cone needs time to &quot;reset&quot; before it can send another message. So instead of seeing pure white, you see white and black fuzzy dots. </p>
<p>Your brain likes patterns, though, and it's always looking for patterns in anything you see (trying to find edges, shapes, etc, so you can understand what you're seeing) </p>
<p>So when the brain sees random &quot;static&quot; noise, it starts to find shapes in it. Like, if I threw a bunch of marbles onto the ground, I bet you could start connecting dots and making shapes out of them.</p>
<p>So that's why you see geometric patterns and images, out of random static fuzz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A film director is more in charge of the artistic &quot;vision&quot; of the film. Often on sets, the director won't even be looking through a camera feed, instead focusing on the script and performance - leaving things like sound and visuals up to all the others working on the film (assistant directors, cinematographers, editors, special and practical effects people etc.) but acting as a middle-man to help coordinate them towards a goal.</p>
<p>So animation or any other medium with a &quot;director&quot; job title is similar - they're in charge of realising the message, themes and artistry of the performances, while there are subordinate directors who focus on the other stuff - eg. director of animation.</p>
<p>That said, there isn't really a hard and fast rule about these things. Some film directors are also basically the director of photography, or sitting in the editing room or even acting in their own films, and some animation directors are hand-drawing keyframes alongside the animation team.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A relatively new thing that has come about for 3D animation is a special roll called &quot;previs&quot; short for pre-visualization.  Between the story-board and the final animation, a previs sits down and does a &quot;crappy&quot; run through of many of the scenes in the movie (basic lighting, low to no texture, really low poly count, unrefined animation with only key time points).  A few previs takes can be made of a scene in just a few hours covering with lots of variations to run by the director.  The director either approves of one of them or gives a bunch of suggestions to adapt things (almost like a director of a live action movie) and the previs goes and tries a few more takes of the &quot;crappy&quot; animation to adapt to these suggestions which only takes a few more hours.  Previs shots that are approved by the director get handed off to the final animators who spend incredible amounts of time getting all the details to their final level and refinement.</p>
<p><em>EDIT:</em> Source: I occasionally hang out with the guy who was previs on Sausage Party.  He was the one who had the surreal work experience one point of coming in every day for a few weeks to animate food having an orgy, and then sit in a room with a director and talk about which food-sex shots worked or not and why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in the animated film industry at a major studio, so I can definitely shed some light on this.</p>
<p>An animated film has a defined pipeline, which is loosely broken in to Story/Editorial, Asset Departments, and Shot Departments. The Director has a 9-5 on the Studio Lot, and breaks his time up (rather, has his time broken up for him) among all of the working departments. </p>
<p>Story and Editorial is where the Director spends roughly ~80% of his time (in most cases). Story is concerned with writing the script and boarding the script, while Editorial is concerned with Editing the boards together to form the blueprint of the film, and recording talent (or &quot;scratch&quot;/standin dialogue, if talent is not available). Nothing goes in to production without boards to inform. </p>
<p>The last ~20% of the Directors time is used as an approvals bottleneck for the Asset departments, who build the Assets (ex. modeling / texturing), and the Shot departments, who ingest the built assets to create the final film (ex. animation, lighting). This ~20% usually rises to 100% in the last couple months of production, as Story/Edit drops away. </p>
<p>In terms of an approvals process, it usually begins with the individual department's Head of Department, moves on to the Production Designer (sometimes in concert with the Art Director), and finishes with the VFX Supervisor / Producer(s) / Director(s). Depending on how featured or otherwise important what is being shown is, it may not require the full treatment. A characters hairstyle would require the full treatment, but the texture of a basketball might not necessarily need approval past the Head of Department for Surfacing, as it will be seen in a final shot later on by everyone. </p>
<p>tl;dr The Director spends most of his time with Story/Editorial, and trusts a multi-stage approvals process below him to show him only what he needs to see, and one that should be staying within his vision. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Then comes ADR and basic sound effects, after those are recorded the storyboards and sounds will be put into something called an animatic. And animatic is basically the important camera positions frames and movements within an animation without all of the small details because its simply made in order to get a feel for what the film will look like and make it easier to plan. Once the animatic is done the keyframes from the animatic will be made into proper drawings/models (depending on whether it's 2D or 3D). Once the keyframes are done they will be sent elsewhere where the inbetween frames are made (this takes the longest ). Once the inbetween frames are put in the film is ready to be lit and textured (or be coloured). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. There is plenty of fossil evidence that during the much warmer period of the Cretaceous (145 - 66 million years ago), the ice free land in both polar regions supported luxuriant forest ecosystems. There were conifer populations that existed, although the leaf falls and winter die-back of deciduous type trees greatly reduced energy and respiration demands, allowing for such communities to migrate north into the Arctic in the mid-Cretaceous. </p>
<p>Trees would have been generally spaced further apart than how we see in todays forests, in order to make the most of the sun when it was available. All populations would have been able to utilise the continuous months of sun during the summer/winter (depending on pole) to produce a large amount of the so called earlywood - cells with large, hollow interiors and thin walls that are good at conducting fluids - to meet the high fluid conduction demands of rapid growth. In contrast, the latewood of polar trees contains a layer of much smaller, thicker walled cells. </p>
<p>The earlywood-latewood cycle is seen in trees growing in seasonal areas today, but fossils from Cretaceous polar forests show a much more pronounced difference both in the size of the earlywood cells produced, and in the relative overall thickness of the different growth layers. The transition is almost instant and the latewood layers are extremely narrow, only being produced in the weeks of twilight either side of extended darkness - a period of complete dormancy with no new cells produced at all occurred during darkness.</p>
<p>Edit: light micrograph sections of growth cycles that indicate the kind of difference I mentioned:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a reasonably common phenomenon.  One common way it can happen is when species are strung out over a large geographic area, but the population doesn't mix frequently.  Individuals breed with their neighbors, but not with more distant populations.  When the gradient is smooth, it's called a cline.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology</a>)</p>
<p>But you don't need a cline to get the pattern you mention.  Sometimes it's simply distinct species that can hybridize in certain ways but not others.</p>
<p>When these &quot;species&quot; stretch out around a geographic barrier and meet on the other side, two adjacent populations may be unable to breed directly.  This phenomenon is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species" target="_blank">ring species</a></p>
<p>Really I think it's kind of remarkable that species sort out as well as they do (at least for certain branches of life). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allegedly there were tools and documents, including malware (trojans and the like), RATs, methods of hacking and controlling people's phones, SMART TVs, computers, and other devices that relay through a network (possibly Alexa, Siri, Cortana, etc.) that were used by the CIA and shared with NSA, that were leaked to former intelligence agents. At least one, or of a handful of these agents had transferred the tools and documents to WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>Supposedly, this is only part one of the 'hugest leak' in history, and WikiLeaks will be continuing the Vault 7 database through the month. Considering the amount of documents to go through, I believe it'd be safe to assume they've had these files for months now, considering it's as late as 2016 documents. What is scary is that WikiLeaks mentions that encryption on devices, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, are pointless due to the remote protocols that can take control of your Android or iPhone itself, thereby bypassing the app(s) themselves. Or that a user could have their files uploaded to a server right now, from their phone or computer, without knowledge, and presumably it wouldn't be identified through network mappers such as Wireshark. </p>
<p>Leaks are not a rare occurrence in this day and age, as we've seen from Cellebrite's leak, and the Shadow Brokers' instances. While there are people that see WikiLeaks, and Julian Assange as being allies of Russia, or as being shady (Rex Tillerson, Roger Stone, etc.), there's no solid evidence, AFAIK, but due to this, people see this move as being political to draw away attention from the Sessions controversy, or further administrative actions. It would seem that WikiLeaks has been waiting quite a while to release these documents, so perhaps it is due to U.S. politics, or perhaps it is due to them feeling this to be the right time. People will note the Clinton emails being leaked out during the campaign, and see that as similar to this. This would be bias, and I am only stating that to show how people may and could see the leaks. It might be political, it might not.</p>
<p>At this point, we should definitely be alerted and aware of this, because if such tools end up in the wrong hands -- with black hats, or even dumbed down for script-kiddies to use, it could be incredibly dangerous, especially with the rise of self-driving vehicles (WikiLeaks cites a tool used to control a person's car, though not much information is given. People were quick to jump to the conclusion that the CIA may have used this in the death of Michael Hastings, though it cannot be confirmed as of now.) I'm sure some of what I've written is wrong, but this is what I've gathered from a quick read of the Vault 7's ToC. Expect more to be uploaded -- over 8,000 pages which means it could take some time to see the true effect this leak will have, as people (if the tools themselves are uploaded), will seek to modify and use the tools for their own personal gain. You wouldn't need physical contact with someone's device, since everything could be done remotely. This is becoming quite scary.</p>
<p>Hope that was good enough. I'm sure others could explain with far more insight, but :/ </p>
<p>What can we do about the government surveillance? Not much. They're able to bypass encryption, control devices, search through our information (they can see usage data of your device -- meaning they can figure when you commonly use your device, and when you're commonly offline), record your visual and audio interactions, and upload your files to their servers all without you ever knowing. I could be glum and say privacy is dead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We are taught that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a system.  That is valid when classical statistics can be applied- when there are many accessible quantum states available to the molecule within a range of the average thermal energy (kT).  So at high enough temperatures this might hold true for electrons and for the motion of atoms within molecules or crystals as well as for molecules in a gas, while at low enough temperatures it will break down for all of them.  (Due to their small mass, quantum levels are spaced far apart for electrons and so this approximation only would apply at very high temperatures and low densities.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>tl;dr: Yes you can double or half the temperature of something, but not in the way you're probably thinking.</strong></p>
<p>The confusing part of this topic for most people is that the temperature scales that we use in day-to-day life are kind of...arbitrary. The &quot;zero&quot; on the Fahrenheit scale was based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit#History" target="_blank">the temperature of a mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride</a>, while the &quot;zero&quot; on the Celsius scale is based on the melting point of pure water. While both of these are solid reference points that anyone can measure, they really don't have any deeper physical meaning relating to the nature of temperature.</p>
<p>When we measure things, we tend to start at 0 and work up. A ruler starts at zero length no matter what units you use, a speed of zero mph or kph always means you're standing still, the pressure of outer space is zero<a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/MimiZheng.shtml" target="_blank">^^(not ^^exactly)</a> whether you're using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch" target="_blank">PSI</a> or <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/\(Gh\)/wwhlpr/pressure_units.rxml" target="_blank">millibars</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch_of_mercury" target="_blank">inches</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr" target="_blank">torr</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit\)" target="_blank">atmospheres</a>, etc. But what about temperature?</p>
<p>Temperature is, in rough terms, a measure of the amount of random &quot;motion&quot; atoms and molecules have at extremely small scales. For a gas, this essentially means <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/kintem.html#c3" target="_blank">the average speed of a given molecule in the gas</a>. For solids and liquids, it roughly corresponds to the amount of &quot;jiggling&quot; the molecules do on a microscopic level. More motion/jiggling means higher temperature, less motion/jiggling means lower temperature. Many of us learned this from high school chemistry. So what would you think a proper &quot;zero&quot; for temperature would be? Naturally, you would think that &quot;zero&quot; temperature would be the temperature at which there is no motion/jiggling at all. And that's exactly what we see in physics and chemistry: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> is the temperature at which atoms would (<a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5889074/why-cant-we-get-down-to-absolute-zero" target="_blank">theoretically</a>) have no random &quot;jiggling&quot; at all.</p>
<p>So if you measure the temperature of something on a temperature scale that starts at absolute zero, then you can properly talk about &quot;doubling&quot; or &quot;halving&quot; the temperature. By far the most common scale that fits this definition is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin" target="_blank">Kelvin</a> scale, which is basically the Celsius scale but it starts at absolute zero. So while absolute zero is -273.15C, on the Kelvin scale it's just 0 (and, conversely, the melting point of ice is 273.15 Kelvin).  2000K truly is twice as hot as 1000K, and 50K truly is twice as cold as 100K. Using our day-to-day scales like Fahrenheit and Celsius, this wouldn't be true: it would be like measuring things with a ruler that starts at -4 &quot;blinches&quot;, which is the same as inches but it starts at -4. We know that something that's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6QXqQzD.png" target="_blank">10 inches long</a> is twice as long as something that's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wfzDTfg.jpg" target="_blank">5 inches long</a>, but if we used our strange ruler then something that was 6 blinches long would actually be twice as long as something 1 blinch long, which really doesn't make any sense if we're just doing simple calculations!</p>
<p>Now that you have the background, we can finally get a proper answer to your question. If it was 0F today, and tomorrow it were going to be twice as hot, you might want to consider evacuating you and your loved ones, because <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0F+to+K" target="_blank">0F is 255.4K</a>, and <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*255.4K" target="_blank">2×255.4K=460F</a>, which is pretty close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451" target="_blank">autoignition temperature of paper</a>. If it was 0C today, then tomorrow's doubly-hot weather will be even more unbearable: <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*273.15K" target="_blank">2×273.15K=273C</a>, which is getting close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Bulk" target="_blank">melting point of lead</a>. </p>
<p>Interestingly, if you doubled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth" target="_blank">lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth</a> (184K, which is −89.2 °C or −128.6 °F), you would get <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*184K" target="_blank">368K, which is 95 °C or 202 °F</a>, which is close to the boiling point of water, and way above the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/HottestSpot/page2.php" target="_blank">hottest natural temperature recorded anywhere on Earth</a> (outside of a volcano or a forest fire). So, in practice, it's never possible for today to be &quot;twice as hot&quot; or &quot;twice as cold&quot; as tomorrow. Unless, of course, <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/22111/temperature-of-mercury/" target="_blank">set up a homestead on Mercury</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have already been some good answers, but I'll chime in on a subtle point that I think is worth mentioning. In general, <strong>temperature is a macroscopic characteristic of large ensembles of particles</strong>. In statistical mechanics, we would call temperature an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties" target="_blank">intensive</a> variable. &quot;Temperature&quot; starts to take on a different meaning when you get down to single particles. There is certainly a relationship between the microscopic characteristics of each particle and their collective, bulk properties, but it's very incorrect to assume (except for very special cases) that all of the particles in, say, a gas at room temperature are moving at the same speed. The distribution of the microscopic characteristics like energy and speed can be found with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution</a>, which is an incredibly important piece of math in all statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the speed of a particle is not linear with its kinetic energy. You may have seen the expression for kinetic energy before, KE=(1/2)<em>m</em>v^2. You'll notice that the energy scales with the velocity squared. So, if you double the energy (and kept m the same), you've only doubled v^2, so increased v by the square root of 2. It also becomes more complicated because there are many ways for energy to &quot;hide&quot; in the system that aren't related to the translational speed of the particle. </p>
<p>As other people have pointed out, &quot;zero&quot; temperature really only has objective meaning if you're talking about absolute zero, which is 0 Kelvin,  about -273 Celsius, and about -460 Fahrenheit. However, even if you made up your own thermometer with its own scale, there would be a lowest possible temperature that would correspond to the same &quot;absolute zero&quot;. From a microscopic perspective, the bulk property of absolute zero temperature is due to every single particle in a system being in its ground state, or its lowest possible energy. Again, it's an unusual case because every single particle has the same energy.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question directly, particles at 80 C do not move twice as fast as particles at 40 C. On average, they are moving faster, but it's much less than twice. At out roughest approximation, we can simply let velocity increase go with the ratio of square root of temperature, so moving from 40 C to 80 C, and converting to Kelvin, we have sqrt(353)/sqrt(313) = 1.06. So, <strong>they're moving about 6% faster on average</strong>. Again, this is a very rough approximation, the real story is much more complicated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the other question (do molecules go twice as fast) the answer is no, they go sqrt(2) times as fast.

<p>Related to your original question would perhaps be saying something's twice as hot as 72F; for which the same method would yield ... 72F. Which does makes sense - because 72F is not hot, nor is it cold; so twice as hot as not-hot or not-cold should also yield ... not-hot or not-cold.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a physics point of view, degrees C is absurd (although F is worse). So yeah there isn't a meaningful way to interpret &quot;twice as warm&quot; in C. As people have observed, you can convert to kelvin, but that get you answers like &quot;twice as hot as 0C is ~250C&quot; which doesn't really answer the question your colleagues are asking.</p>
<p>To answer that question (or approach an answer), consider this. Can humans really feel temperature? If you take two blocks, one rubber and one metal, and leave them for a while, which feels colder? You know they are both the same temperature but the metal feels colder. Ok now if I put some ice on each block, which ice melts faster? You want to say the rubber, because it felt warmer, but the truth is it's the one on the metal block. The reason is that metal is a better conductor, and it's the same reason the metal feels colder: we don't really feel temperature, we feel the rate of change of temperature on our skin and use that as a proxy.</p>
<p>So the question you really want to ask might be: at what temperature does the rate of change double?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
