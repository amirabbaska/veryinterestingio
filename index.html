		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The perception of time durations are crucially bound up with memory. It is essentially our memory of an event that allows us to form a perception of its duration. We subconsciously infer the duration of an event from our memory of how far in the past something occurred, of how long ago the beginning and end of the event occurred. </p>
<p>If an event or day is particularly novel, it will be encoded more strongly and be more present in the mind than an event or day where very few novel memories are formed (i.e. when you do the same things you always do repetitively), and so the perception of how long it took will be altered based on the extent and size of those novel memories.</p>
<p>This is true for remembering a day last week, or remembering just a few hours ago, or a few minutes.
All of that, including the feeling of slowness or fastness of time, is based on your awareness of the memories, and the attention you paid when you encoded them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you first drive to an unfamiliar location it always seems very long to get there but after driving the route for a while it feels shorter.  I believe it is your brain paying attention to everything the first time and storing that information which gets translated to your perception of time.  After driving it for a while your brain selects only the landmarks to pay attention to and so your perception of time becomes compressed.  While it does probably take less time after a while the difference is not as great as we perceive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Through fMRI we have been able to observe that when we are consumed in an activity, these areas begin to &quot;wink out&quot;. Not necessarily all turning off at once but certainly less active than usual. This plunges us in what some call &quot;the deep now&quot;. </p>
<p>I'm not well versed in this topic so I don't know every detail of this phenomenon. The Flow Genome Project has been working on this very thing and I suggest anyone interested in this to read up on the research the team has been conducting.</p>

<p>The processes that are run to treat the water can be different from brand to brand. Just to name a few: reverse osmosis, ultra violet rays, filtering. Also where they get the water from, some come from springs (if they come from springs, the label must say which one), others from treated water. This also affects the taste of water as well. <del>Also, you cant sell 100% clean water because just like in a pool you would get algae after some time inside of the bottles.</del></p>
<p>Edit: As some of you pointed out, and my mom explained me better: Algae may show up when the purification process is simple, it doesnt purifies the water enough. Also, once you open a bottle of water it gets contaminated with air and bacterias, its really bad to let an opened bottled of water for long periods of time, specially if it gets hit by the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Their RAM almost certainly is of the ECC variety, which is basically the same type of RAM technology as used in normal PCs, except they have an additional chip on them that calculates checksums, to ensure that no memory corruption goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>They usually use special motherboards that can hold 4 or more CPUs each, and often several hundred gigabytes of RAM. The CPUs they have often has a lot more cores than consumer models too. Intel's high-end server CPUs can have 18 cores each. However, if you really wanted to, you could still get one of these 18-core CPUs, put them on a motherboard with one single CPU socket, install windows and play counterstrike on it, if have more money than you have sense.</p>
<p>Several motherboards with several CPUs each are then connected together with an extremely high-speed network link.</p>
<p>In general, supercomputers operate in the same way as regular computers, but they're just hundreds, or thousands of semi-independent computers that are linked together into a cluster, and software written in a way that divides up the computing tasks into segments, and feeds a number of segments into each cluster node.</p>
<p>When it comes to storage, supercomputers don't typically require an enormous amount of actual storage. The actual data sets aren't necessarily extremely big in size, they just require extremely complex calculations to be performed on them.</p>
<p>If you have enormous computers that are mainly used to store enormous amounts of data, such as facebook storing every single picture and video anyone has uploaded, the term for these things are datacenters, not supercomputers.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.top500.org/" target="_blank">https://www.top500.org/</a> you can see the current toplist over the worlds biggest supercomputers, how many CPUs they  have, and how high maximum performance they have.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Super computers today consist of compute nodes, which are mostly like individual computers. Each node has a number of processors, with a number of cores, and their own RAM, and a couple network cards. There are nodes dedicated to the networking, essentially a switch or router, to ferry work and data to each compute node. The thing with the compute nodes is they're not stand alone, they're not each running their own operating system. The compute nodes have no need for video cards (though there may be some sort of primitive console access for diagnostics) or necessarily for hard drives (though there may be one as a cache).</p>
<p>So you can take your notion of ram and processors, and just multiply it by the number of nodes.</p>
<p>There are other characteristics, and that has to do with topology. This is an issue with your computer, too, about where CPU cache is, the memory controller, the north and south bridge, and other aspects. For a super computer, the complexity of connecting all these nodes becomes a significant factor. The technology may not exist to have a central dispatch to some 40,000 processors totaling some 10 million cores as exists in the current world's largest super computer. So there tends to be a number of hops and different routes so data can get from any processor to any processor as fast as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in this field and provide some answers.</p>
<p>RAM/HDD size is different depending on the architecture of the supercomputer. Most of them use a cluster of individual nodes (~2x CPUs up to 32, ~minimum of 256 GB RAM, fabric interconnect, management/login networking) or build them into a monolithic, singly addressable pool of CPUs and RAM . So you would log in to some systems (I think SGI?) and you'd be presented with a couple hundred cores and terabytes of RAM. The separated nodes use a message passing interface or remotely and directly address the memory when the compiler and application running the processing is configured. This allows all the nodes to know every part of the workload and can communicate as one. The multiple interconnects are usually Infiniband, a custom interconnect (used by Cray and some others) or the faster ethernet (think 100 gigabit or higher) and require all of those connections are bonded together in order for that one node to not slow down the nodes in the current workload.</p>
<p>I hope I broke it down and kind of explained the reason for the RAM separation at least.</p>
<p>For HDD, they're usually hosted on large storage area networks which are an entire system dedicated to providing ones and zeros to the supercomputer cluster as fast as it can. These are usually whole server cabinets of drives or increasingly solid state storage. They then connect to the interconnect directly (or through filesystem servers (usually a dedicated supercomputer node) that manage the clustered storage  and have petabytes available in a high performance capacity directly through the nodes' interconnects.</p>
<p>I've touched on a couple implementations, as there are other ways and locations for storage to be accessed or physically stored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Supercomputers are mostly made of consumer parts.</p>
<p>A typical supercomputer is, in essence, a number of regular computers connected via a network. These are called nodes. Each node will have the usual processor speed, number of cores, ram. However, they usually use top of the line setup (ie 4x24 core setup, up to terrabytes of ram), but the specific setup depends on if it's set up for data heavy, memory heavy or CPU heavy tasks. The HDD is usually on a network and shared among these nodes, and is usually huge and set up for hugely parallel reads and writes, so files might take longer to open initially, but can have data firehosed into them.</p>
<p>The important extra parameter is the network. The speed and latency of the network is very important, as is the shape of the setup. Nodes that are close together, in some sense, might be directly connected, so messages sent between them are sent quickly. Nodes that are far apart might be indirectly connected, so messages need to make several &quot;hops&quot; to go from one to the other, meaning they're sent more slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

At the time, it was explained to me that Progressivism is the PC way of saying liberalism and was adopted for marketing purposes. (look at 2008 Obama/Hillary debates, Hillary said she <strong>prefers</strong> the word Progressive to Liberal and basically equated the two.)</p>
<p>Lately, it has been made clear to me by Progressives in my life that they are NOT Liberals, yet many Liberals I speak to have no problem interchanging the words. Further complicating things, Socialists I speak to identify as Progressives and no Liberal I speak to identifies as a Socialist. </p>
<p><strong>So please ELI5 what is the difference between a Progressive and a Liberal in the US?  Is it different elsewhere in the world?</strong> </p>
<p>PS: I have searched for this on /r/explainlikeimfive and google and I have not found a simple explanation.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong> Wow, I don't even know where to begin, in half a day, hundreds of responses.  Not sure if I have an ELI5 answer, but I feel much more informed about the subject and other perspectives.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is political theory, and there is just what people call themselves.  </p>
<p>In theory, one can describe three ideological axes (or more, but these three are relevant to this question): Liberal vs. authoritarian, conservative vs. radical, and progressive vs. regressive.  </p>
<p>Liberal means power is distributed while authoritarian means it is concentrated, but does not speak to how the power is used.  Conservative means change should be minimized while radical seeks extensive change, but does not speak to what the change should be.  Progressive seeks to distribute material resources (or more nebulously, social value) while regressive seeks to concentrate material resources (ditto).</p>
<p>&quot;Libertarianism&quot; would in theory be liberal, conservative, and regressive.  &quot;Socialism&quot; in the old Soviet sense would be authoritarian, radical, and difficult to define on the third axis because while material output is distributed the capital is concentrated all into the hands of the state.  <em>Democratic</em> socialism would be liberal, radical, and progressive.  </p>
<p>&quot;Conservatism&quot; as defined in US politics would be authoritarian, radical, and regressive, while &quot;liberalism&quot; in US politics would be liberal, conservative, and progressive.</p>
<p>&quot;Liberal&quot; in European politics does not refer to power in general, but rather specifically to minimization of economic regulation, but does not particularly concern itself with other forms of power.  It is somewhat of a synonym for &quot;neo-liberal&quot;, although this term is nebulous in itself.  &quot;Conservative&quot; in Europe usually means authoritarian, conservative (as opposed to US &quot;conservative&quot; radicalism), and regressive.</p>
<p>In other words, to answer your summary question, Liberal and Progressive in US politics are often used as synonyms, but <em>can</em> be used to distinguish between someone's issue emphasis - whether they are focused on economic distribution and social equality, or on fighting authoritarian government policies.  People who see both as highly important will just call themselves by either name, or even combine them as liberal-progressive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't really like replying to threads on big subs when there have been so many comments already, but I feel obliged to since all the comments are lacking in one way or another (e.g axis theories of political ideology are hack because ideology does not lie along a neat spectrum.)</p>
<p>There is a difference between 'progressive' and 'liberal', which is based in what each stand for. <strong>As a general rule of thumb, from a technical perspective all liberals see themselves as progressive, but not all progressives see themselves as liberal</strong>. This does not apply in all circumstances but is generally true enough to hold.</p>
<p>First, a quick caveat to get out of the way - the US population is bad at political terminology, and as such 'Liberal' is basically synonymous with 'more left wing (whatever that means - it can vary massively depending on the person) than the current regime'. </p>
<p>However, the very concept of Liberalism, worldwide, refers to an ideology which values human liberty and equality. 'Liberty' and 'equality' are both very vague concepts, however, and as such Liberalism tends to be an umbrella term which can refer to almost diametrically opposed ideologies. The biggest split is between those who value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty" target="_blank">Negative liberty</a> (heuristic: 'the freedom to fuck people over without constraints'), and those who value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty" target="_blank">Positive liberty</a> ('the freedom to not be fucked over', and to achieve one's personal will). Generally speaking, those two camps are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism" target="_blank">classical liberals</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism" target="_blank">social liberals</a> respectively. However, despite both being liberal ideologies, the two can often disagree more than they can agree.</p>
<p>For example - take something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline" target="_blank">Standing Rock</a>. A classical liberal might argue that Dakota Access should have the liberty to build it's pipeline. However, a social liberal might argue the opposite - that the pipeline will damage the liberty of the residents. Hence classical liberals tend to oppose state intervention, whereas social liberals are much less scared of it.</p>
<p>[A quick interjection: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism" target="_blank">Progressivism</a> states that advancements in technology, science, etc - but, most importantly, social justice - are key to increasing human happiness. It's not really a true political ideology due to it's vagueness, but it's in opposition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary" target="_blank">Reactionary politics</a>, which favour a return to the past, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism" target="_blank">Conservatism</a>, which generally defines itself by opposition to change. I only realised once I finished this post that I hadn't defined these, and I couldn't slot it in anywhere else, but it's kinda important to know.]</p>
<p>Both ideologies of classical liberalism and socialism liberalism, however, are united in their defense of the economic system of Capitalism. I could write for a long time about this, but to cut a long story short: Socialism, as an umbrella of political ideologies (like liberalism), was born from Liberalism and considers itself to be more dedicated to human emancipation from suffering by virtue of opposing Capitalism, which Socialists see as exploitative. Hence some Socialists consider Liberals of every flavour to be anti-progressive, since they support Capitalism. Some liberals (especially some classical liberals, who tend to ally more with the Right wing) may in turn suggest that Socialists are anti-progressive - but in general terms their objection is more the bog standard 'nice in theory not in practice' tedium rather than because they perceive Socialism (which, again, is extremely broad - ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism" target="_blank">Libertarian Socialism</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism" target="_blank">Marxism-Leninism</a>, aka Stalinism) as not Progressive. </p>
<p>As such, in this sense, we can <em>generally</em> say that <strong>all liberals consider themselves progressive, but not all progressives consider themselves liberal</strong>. </p>
<p>Specifically with respect to Clinton, I think she was just expressing a personal preference or personal definition more than actually adhering to either of these ideologies.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any further questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glad to see some discussion on this. As an Australian living in the US, I'm constantly having to explain it when I'm talking about politics and happen to mention that the Liberal Party (in Australia) is actually the most conservative/right wing of the major parties. In the US, people think &quot;liberal = progressive or left wing&quot;, but it's not that simple.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party in Australia is called that way because they are <em>economically</em> liberal. They are laissez faire capitalists, believing in open and free markets and minimal government intervention in business. The party who leans towards lower taxes, less red tape and restrictions on companies etc. Freedom from government ... that sort of thing. This aligns them more with the Republicans in the US. But that's liberalism to us, or rather, economic liberalism. But they aren't socially liberal. They are conservatives on that front.</p>
<p>I'm constantly having to intersperse comments like &quot;the Liberal Party, <em>which by the way is conservative</em>&quot;. This comes up often in the usual debate over gun control, in which it is noted that the Prime Minister that enacted Australia's current gun laws was &quot;Prime Minister Howard of the Liberal Party&quot;. People in America go &quot;well duh, of course liberals would support such a thing&quot;. No, the Liberals are conservative and PM Howard was one of our most conservative prime ministers ever.</p>
<p>A quick Google suggests that Canada is similar to the US, in that the incumbent Liberal Party is a socially liberal and economically progressive one. The equivalent in Australia would actually be the Labor Party ... and the Liberal Party would be their opponents.</p>
<p>TLDR: the meaning of the word liberal has been twisted in the US and doesn't mean the same thing as in (some) other places. You're better off using 'progressive' instead if you want to talk about the kind of socially progressive policies espoused by 'liberals' in the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a ton of great answers here explaining the philosophical and historical definitions, but most are ignoring one important aspect: barely anyone in the general population (in the US) uses those definitions.</p>
<p>Back in the 2000s, &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; were used interchangeably by most people, with most people defining those concepts based on political party lines. &quot;Liberals/progressives&quot; were Democrats while &quot;Conservatives&quot; where Republicans in the eyes of the common man (&quot;moderates&quot; were simply those that had views from both parties nearly 50/50). It was really that simple, though very inaccurate.</p>
<p>Why has that changed? Well, because Bernie Sanders ran on a platform further left than Hillary. At his rallies Bernie said that Hillary shouldn't consider herself a progressive due to her relatively moderate views. Of course, Hillary and her supporters disregarded this as a frivolous attack.</p>
<p>Now, the Democratic party is somewhat split and undergoing change (just as the Republican party is). Bernie supporters, self-proclaimed &quot;progressives&quot;, see the term Liberal as too far right, as a representation of the Democratic establishment (and everything wrong with it in their eyes). Hillary supporters still see the two terms as interchangeable, just as Hillary did.</p>
<p>This is why &quot;Liberals&quot; are willing to call themselves as Progressive while &quot;Progressives&quot; usually reject the term Liberal.</p>
<p>Again, other people explained the philosophical definitions perfectly, but this is how I see the dynamic in the US. You should go back to your friends and see which ones voted for who during the primaries, because I'll bet that the dynamic above applies to your social group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They're labels for party affiliation, rather than being actual descriptions of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism" target="_blank">philosophical position</a>. The reason Hillary eschews the term liberal is because in the 1970s, a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbionese_Liberation_Army" target="_blank">violent</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground" target="_blank">radicals</a> took the label and applied it to themselves, making it very, VERY unpopular with people who are now in their 60's and over.
Really, all domestic policies devolve into two simple questions: 1) Should the government intervene to address <issue X>. 2) If so, how? Issue X can be any controversial domestic question: Gun violence, poverty, abortion, internet peering policy, growing sugar, terrorism, flag burning, import competition, drug abuse...</p>
<p>Each party's position (of whether to intervene) will change radically, depending on the issue, and they'll even trade positions over time. That's how the Democratic party has found themselves defending free-trade policies passed by mostly Republican votes. At the time, it was a bipartisan bill which encountered most of its opposition from Labor Unions, a group which aligns itself with Democrats.</p>
<p>Political parties are brands, and their job isn't to be philosophically consistent, their job is to appeal to voters, while differentiating themselves from the other brand(s).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a person sues because a police officer violated their civil rights, the lawsuit is almost always against the officer. Sometimes you can sue the local government if it has an unconstitutional policy (like a secret racial profiling policy you could somehow prove existed), but if there's no specific policy then the suit is against the individual officer.</p>
<p>However, individual officers rarely pay any significant portion of a judgment against them. The reason is that governments typically indemnify them. Indemnifying someone means you pay for their legal defense and the judgment against them. For example, your auto insurance company has an indemnification agreement with you for any motor vehicle accidents you cause. </p>
<p>Sometimes the indemnification is required by state law, sometimes it's required by county ordinance, and sometimes city officials decide whether to indemnify or not on an individual basis. Regardless of the exact method, almost every police officer gets indemnified for these types of suits.</p>
<p>There are a couple reasons a city may want to indemnify an officer. First, it helps make sure that your officers aren't afraid to police to the extent you want them to. If you want officers to be &quot;tough on crime&quot; but they have to worry about personally getting sued for being &quot;too tough&quot; then they won't carry out the orders vigorously. On the other hand, if the city is on the hook then it has an incentive to make sure it doesn't make its officers go too overboard because then it will be paying out a lot in judgments.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the person suing, it's good to have indemnification because if you win a $1 million judgment, most police officers wouldn't be able to pay that while a city could. Of course it also takes money from government funds that could be used for public services.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that officers sometimes do have to contribute to judgments against them, but in practice it's usually a small amount of officers and they only have to contribute a small amount.</p>
<p>The reason the money doesn't come from the police pension fund is that the fund is either (1) a contractual obligation the city will have to pay no matter what or (2) privately held by the officers/their union and not accessible in a judgment against an individual officer. You also probably don't want to rob an entire police department of its retirement because one person did one really crappy thing once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No one is perfect. </p>
<p>As well, having the employer (in this case the government) be on the hook for misconduct means that they are forced to take an active role in <em>preventing</em> it. If you don't believe me, check out workplace injuries during the early 1900's in the US. It wasn't until laws were in place that required employers to pay out to injured employees that things like safety harnesses and guard rails were implemented en mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you do something bad to someone, and you're unable to compensate for it, it's immoral to have the person the harm was done to be penalized (Not receive compensation), or penalize those who had nothing to do with it (other members of the said fund/group). As such, especially when this said harm was done as a part of assigned duties of a person, it's the organization behind this assignment, that caused this harm, that should be paying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As these cases progress, typically we receive a very quick response to dismiss the individual officer and proceed against the city or police department.  By the time of trial or settlement, most of these cases will no longer contain the individual officer as a defendant - depending on the circumstances.  </p>
<p>To the rest of your question, the payment will never come out of the police pension fund - that's just not how it works (others have explained why).  The police department pays out exactly how Walmart or any other private firm would - from their operating fund or from insurance coverage (depending).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems like most of these answers are just reiterating why oral or IV antibiotics alone don't solve abscesses, while you're asking why we can just put a needle into the cavity and push the drug in.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abscesses are often acidic to a point where their pH would change the composition of the antibiotic to the point where it would not be effective in killing the bacteria. Medications are made so that they work in specific areas of the body under certain conditions, including at physiological pH ranges seen in a human. The pH of the inside of an abscess can vary from the normal range and thus, delivering the medication bolus directly into the center of the thing would be kinda like putting a plastic brush into a pot of molten lead and then trying to scrub the inside of the container with it; the brush isn't gonna get the job done anymore. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draining the abscess is usually the most effective thing to do because, like everybody said, IV antibiotics don't really get in deep enough to do what you need on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>After the abscess has been drained, we often put in something called Iodoform gauze, which is like a long strand of cloth with &quot;medicine&quot; on it, so essentially kill whatever is left in there while the tissue heals. Why is this medicine effective? Because it's really just an iodine compound, it still works at whatever pH the abscess now is. </li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently there's some disagreement on whether or not the iodine gauze is good or bad or necessary, I've usually seen it and it's always worked from my short experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Any injection runs the risk of breaking the barrier between circulation and the infection because injections generally break tissue. You do that, and then you can go from an abscess to a systemic infection where the disease is in your blood and therefore affects everything possible instead of that tiny region of the abscess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The packing is gauze usually with iodine or some other medication soaked into the gauze.  This causes a wicking action and I would pull out 3-6&quot; and cut off the crusty nasty end.
My last one was on my foot and extremely bad. It required 2 surgeries for cleaning and debridement. A wound vac was placed (a hard foam was cut to fit in the hole in my foot, a vacuum tube is placed over it and it's all sealed to my foot. This allows a constant negative pressure on the wound drawing puss and blood from the wound).</p>
<p>This stay had me on several IV antibiotics over a week as well as take home meds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Women would literally get pulled over by the police to be given a rose. Everyone had to drive with their lights on like it was the first day of school (before it became mandatory nationwide to drive like that). I had to call all my relatives that were female and congratulate them and wish them good health etc. I brought in chocolate for my female teacher. Many men went all out for this. Really the whole society went out, at least in the city I grew up in. When I moved to the US, no one celebrated and no ever really heard of it until the last few years. No one still celebrates it, more of a social media blitz and that's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It was made to celebrate the equal rights of female workers. It became especially important when on March 8th, 1917, the Russian Revolution first began.

<p>The reason you're only now hearing about this is probably due the significant media attention that this day received this year. The reason you hadn't heard of it until now is the fact that its not really a part of Western culture and it actually finds its root in Eastern Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If your asking about transmitting electricity across a gap, however, there are much more clever ways to do this. Assuming you're using AC current (or possibly a square wave D.C.), you can use inductive or capacitive coupling. This is how wireless charging works. It's not always super efficient, but it doesn't involve big balls of plasma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: they don't survive.</p>
<p>The life expectancy of the mentally ill is short. From the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2011/no-health-without-mental-health.shtml" target="_blank">NIH</a>, and specifically addressing Americans, mental health, and life span.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;...on average, Americans with major mental illness die 14 to 32 years earlier than the general population. The average life expectancy for people with major mental illness ranged from 49 to 60 years of age in the states they examined — a life span on par with many sub-Saharan African countries, including Sudan (58.6 years) and Ethiopia (52.9 years). Average life expectancy in the United States is 77.9 years. It would appear that the increase in longevity enjoyed by the general U. S. population over the past half century has been lost on those with serious mental illness (SMI). In fact, this drop in life expectancy due to mental illness would surpass the health disparities reported for most racial or ethnic groups. Yet this population is rarely identified as an underserved or at-risk group in surveys of the social determinants of health. </p>
<p>Why is there such a profound disparity in life expectancy for those with SMI? Disorders such as schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder are risk factors for suicide, but most people with SMI do not die by suicide. Rather, the 5 percent of Americans who have SMI die of the same things that the rest of the population experiences — cancer, heart disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and diabetes. They are more likely to suffer chronic diseases associated with addiction (especially nicotine), obesity (sometimes associated with antipsychotic medication), and poverty (with its attendant poor nutrition and health care) and they may suffer the adverse health consequences earlier.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't need good social skills to dig through a dumpster for discarded food or clothing.</p>
<p>There are also soup kitchens that might feed them as long as they behave while on the premises, even if they might still say unusual things.</p>
<p>They might have good and bad days too, like most people. Perhaps they're able to keep it together for long enough to buy some bread one day, even if they were behaving erraticly some days earlier.</p>
<p>In some areas, there are cash refunds for empty cans and bottles. Homeless people in these areas often go around collecting these, and turn them in for money. You only need to find like 15 bottles to be able to afford a loaf of bread, which might sustain you for a few days. Sure, it's not a varied diet, but it keeps you not-dead, and you can supplement it with random stuff you find (or steal) elsewhere, like the occasional fruit, or maybe even some meat if you're lucky.</p>
<p>As for water, you'd be amazed at what you'll drink if you're thirsty enough, and cities often have fountains or other running water somewhere. Maybe they'll find a half-empty water bottle on the ground now and then too. They might keep a bottle to fill up whenever they come across fresh water.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking random stuff you find lying around is of course risky. It could be contaminated with lots of stuff. That's why it's not exactly uncommon for homeless people to be of poor health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Winnipeg, one of the coldest major cities in the world; I am continually astounded that people survive the streets here. Most homeless people hit the relatively balmy West Coast for winter, but there are still those who stay, and deal with temperatures that can reach -50Celsius (-58Fahrenheit) on rare occasions, and frequently stay below -20C (-4F) for weeks. </p>
<p>They mainly sleep in shelters, but some get banned for disruptive behaviour, and some cannot pay the minimal entry fee; the cardboard recycling dumpsters here have lids, and in the very worst pinch, they provide a relatively sheltered and insulated sleeping spot, if you can hazard the chance of getting accidentally dumped in a trash compactor truck.</p>
<p>Sleep aside, no shelter provides day services, and so they must find ways to stay warm for at least half the day. In the downtown core, Winnipeg has built a series of insulated walkways between buildings, over streets and underground, to allow comfortable pedestrian movement. This helps business to stay alive in winter, but these walkways are also a way for the homeless to stay warm without being targeted for &quot;loitering&quot;; they can simply walk around in neutral spaces, where no store-owner can kick them out. All the same, there's only so many times you can do laps in the walkways before you need to find a place to sit, shit, eat, panhandle, or busk, and I can't say what they manage to do then.</p>
<p>For many years, Winnipeggers have talked about our Frequent Flyers; a few homeless and mentally ill people, less than 20 of them, who rack up massive bills for the city by calling 911 and getting a free ambulance ride and checkup; 911 operators are bound by regulation to send an ambulance if the caller lists certain symptoms (which I will not disclose); they may be on first-name basis with the caller, and be fully aware of their ill intent, but if they didn't send paramedics, they'd lose their jobs. </p>
<p>The Paramedics are similarly bound; if the &quot;patient&quot; lists certain symptoms, they must assume good faith and bring the patient to the appropriate hospital that specializes in the symptoms described; basically, this means that a free phone call can be used as a way to get social contact (fucked up as it is, they are often genuinely desperate for any kind of interaction), warmth, and a free ride to a few locations in Winnipeg. It's infuriating and ingenious at the same time; they cost us huge amounts of money, I've heard estimates in the hundreds of thousands all told, and it would be so much more affordable if we made some other sort of provision for them, like maybe bought them each a bus pass. Chances are, they'd lose or sell it though.... it is a pickle.</p>
<p>Sorry if this was a little off-topic, I got carried away. Hope it's interesting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oftentimes, homeless people wind up in jail. Not for long periods, but they are highly prone to becoming &quot;regulars&quot; in the local jail wherever they live. The homeless are locked up for many reasons: stealing is most common, but sometimes it's for harassing others, assault, or drug crimes. Homelessness, mental illness, and drug use are all correlated. </p>
<p>I work in a jail and very frequently see inmates living on the streets after they are released. But contrary to popular belief, homeless people do not relish being locked up. No one likes being in jail. They can't wait to be released because even if they have nowhere to live, they are at least free to either find more drugs or because they just hate the highly structured life that comes with being incarcerated. When they go to jail, they are fed and given medical treatment for whatever problems they have and even get a few days worth of whatever medicine they need after being released. And this is part of how they survive: jails have a fundamental purpose in keeping inmates alive. </p>
<p>I've seen one homeless person in particular with a combine five years of time in jail - but his longest sentence was only 25 days! So the average length of his stay is something like a few days at a time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chicagoan here. There's an EXTREMELY schizophrenic woman that lives under the awning on Randolph that is always talking to herself. Never makes eye contact. But is always eating. I imagine she survives literally exclusively on the kindness of strangers. </p>
<p>Abama is like the metra station poltergeist. He's drunk as fuck 24/7. Sleeps with lit cigarettes in his mouth. And gets arrested when shit goes south for him. But he's quite funny, in like a &quot;fuck it and fuck you&quot; kinda way. Not a laugh at this drunk homeless man kinda way. So I think people give him cash when they see him. People smoke weed with him fairly frequently. I certainly notice when he gets locked up for a few weeks. </p>
<p>This one dude, whose entire understanding of the english language is &quot;Have a nice day guys&quot;. Who is always excited to be there, despite being dealt a completely shit hand in life. His like weird split second positive interjection really stands out.  He goes away in the winter though. I think he's got something figured out. </p>
<p>But there was one dude. Whose entire existence was just as like a silent mummy under a pile of blankets on wacker. Never interacted with anyone. He just died when it got too cold. Froze to death on the sidewalk. </p>
<p>So I guess like. Some do. Some don't. all depends on how you sell it  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
