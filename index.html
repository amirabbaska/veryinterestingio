<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komatiite" target="_blank">Komatiitic flows</a>. These are a type of volcanic flow involving low-silica magnesium-rich lava. Komatiites had a distinctive composition, were high-volume, very high tempearture and low in volatiles. They used to produce large sheets and are associated with nickel deposits. Their production required the earths mantle to be hotter than it currently is. Most are af Archean age (&gt; 2.5 billion years) with a few slightly younger stragglers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another obvious one would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation#Relation_to_atmospheric_oxygenation" target="_blank">Banded Iron Formations</a>, especially Algoma types. BIFs are laminated sedimentary deposits rich in iron oxydes, and the source of most iron production today. These were related to the great oxygenation event and are pretty much all formed in the Proterozoic (2.5 to 0.54 billion years ago.)</p>
</li>
<li>Planetary glaciations of the <a href="http://authors.library.caltech.edu/1015/1/KOPpnas05.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Snowball Earth&quot;</a> type. Imagine the icecaps growing all the way past the tropics and meeting at the equator ... Latest one ended about 580 million years ago, and we haven't seen another one since.</li>
</ul>
<p>A comprehensive list could undoubtedly be done, but it would require work...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lycopsid trees (which incidentally look like something by Dr. Seuss) had just invented lignin, a major polymer in modern wood. It took a while for decomposers to fully catch up and figure out how to break down this new polymer fast enough to keep up. Enormous amounts of dead trees that could not rot piled up until they were buried or burned in massive forest fires. Quite a lot of coal started out as charcoal from those forest fires of dead rot-proof trees.</p>
<p>Decomposers eventually learned to keep up with lignin, and it's still around as part of the wood in every form of plantlife you'd consider a tree. Nothing like the Carboniferous will ever happen again unless trees invent a new inedible polymer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airlines want to make as much money as they can, which means operating each flight as close to 100% full as possible.</p>
<p>Imagine you're operating an airline. Most of the time, a few people don't show up for their flight. So you start selling a few extra tickets for each flight. If everyone shows up, you don't have seats for them all. But everyone showing up is very unlikely.</p>
<p>Actual airlines use statistics to determine how many no-shows are likely to happen on each flight. They factor in everything, such as where the flight is to and from, age of the passenger, gender of the passenger, if they're flying with anyone else, the time of the flight, the weather that day, and a <em>ton</em> of other factors. With all of this information, they can get a <em>very</em> good estimate of how many people won't show up for a particular flight. So they then go ahead and sell more tickets for that flight, based on their estimate.</p>
<p>Most of the time, there's no issue. Everyone who shows up gets to fly. But some of the time, there is an issue, because more people than expected showed up for the flight. In these cases, airlines typically offer incentives for travelers to voluntarily give up their seat on the flight, and although this costs the airline some money, the extra money they make by overbooking to get every flight as full as possible more than offsets this cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Great Barrier Reef is a zone which indicates a relative diversity of life on Earth, like Rainforests. The more diverse life is on the planet, the better, as we humans like to harvest things. Imagine if rubber trees didn't exist? Or if the fungi that made up immune suppressants didn't exist? Diversity is really good and when one of these places loses its diversity, we see that most other places are losing diversity too. Furthermore, an estimated 375 billion dollars are generated from food and tourism related to reefs, with about 500 million people dependent on their survival. Animals that depend on these corals for food go too. Entire food chains are disrupted. Imagine no more snapper, grouper, clams, or oysters! Fish rely on corals for protection from larger predators. </p>
<p>About 70% of Earth's oxygen comes from the ocean, from the smallest organisms to the largest kelp forests. Losing life in the ocean directly impacts our world's ability to sustain life. If the reefs, which are some of the most fragile ecosystems start to die, then it's an early warning sign that things are going to get worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're just talking about the Great Barrier Reef, the most tangible effects are local. If the corals bleach and die, the reef structure will still be there for some time, but will gradually be lost to erosion. (When corals are alive, they balance out the erosion by laying down new calcium carbonate skeleton.) So first you'll lose the species that depend on live coral, like butterflyfish that feed on coral. Then you'll start to lose the species that depend on the physical structure as their habitat, including lots of fish that are commercially important. The reef structure is also important for dampening the force of waves coming into shore, so as you lose the structure to erosion you also lose protection from storms.</p>
<p>The bigger problem is that it's not just the Great Barrier Reef. Coral reefs throughout the tropics and subtropics all face the same threats (ocean warming which causes bleaching, ocean acidification which makes it harder for them to build skeletons) and they collectively support millions of people in coastal communities in terms of providing protein, coastal protection, employment (e.g. tourism), and cultural identity. The loss of coral reefs on a global scale is a huge looming disaster.</p>
<p>There are scientists working with coral to try and identify the ones that are most tolerant of warmer water, clone them (they can regenerate from fragments) and use them to build new reefs. This works on a small scale but it's hard to do it at a large scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coral Reefs are highly connected system where almost everything is interdependent on something else. Also it is important to understand the hard Corals are bleaching due to ocean acidification (due to increasing temperatures) which also have impacts on many molluscan species preventing them from building up layers of their calcium shell for defense. Corals and sponges play a particularly large role in remove nutrients from the water and with excess nutrients, there will most likely be decreased visablitly (reducing the photosynthetic capabilities of my of the reefs primary producers) and huge blooms of algae and plankton. This can have massive impacts on the surrounding reef organism and even change the coral reef to a less productive and diverse algae prone system. The point I am trying to get across is nature is extremely complex, far more complex than our models and estimation could ever predict. All we know for sure is that there will be change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel that the other answers are all missing some clarity, so I'll attempt my explanation here of <strong>The Standard Model</strong>.</p>
<p>As far as we know, all the matter that we can see in the Universe (ie: &quot;stuff&quot;) is made up of two types of particle: <strong>hadrons</strong> and <strong>leptons</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>hadron</strong> is a <em>composite</em> particle; they are composed of several other more <em>fundamental</em> particles: <strong>quarks</strong>.</p>
<p>We currently know there are 6 different types of quark (Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Strange and Charm) each very similar but with slightly different properties. As /u/Aelinsaar pointed out, quarks cannot exist on their own, so they group together in two's (<strong>mesons</strong>) or three's (<strong>baryons</strong>) (<del>and theoretical groups of five</del> and also less commonly, in groups of 4 and 5, as /u/mfb- points out below). <em>Protons</em> and <em>Neutrons</em> are baryons (which makes them hadrons), composed of Up and Down quarks only (2 up + 1 down and 1 up + 2 down, respectively). Protons and neutrons make almost the entirety of the visible Universe, and it's why we can refer to &quot;stuff&quot; as <em>baryonic matter</em>: stuff made of baryons.</p>
<p>There are many other types of baryon and meson formed by different combinations of quark, many of which can be studied in the LHC (a large collider of hadrons, or alternatively, a collider of large hadrons), but they are all &quot;exotic matter&quot;.</p>
<p>A <strong>lepton</strong> is a <em>fundamental</em> particle. There are six known leptons: three <em>charged</em> leptons (the <strong>electron</strong>, the muon and the tau) and three <em>neutral</em> leptons (the neutrino, the muon neutrino, the tauon neutrino). They are all very similar to each other, the main difference being that they are respectively <em>more massive</em> than the previous (the electron and the neutrino are the smallest of their groups).</p>
<p>So, these so far are all the <em>fundamental</em> particles of matter. Normal, everyday stuff is made of protons and neutrons (up and down quarks) and electrons. For all elements (except hydrogen) in their neutral state, that means a small, tight nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a large, diffuse &quot;cloud&quot; of electrons. This answers the main scope of OP's question, but I'll carry on for a bit more.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about anti-matter?</em></strong></p>
<p>Above is only half the picture. It turns out that all of the <em>fundamental</em> particles I mentioned have a corresponding <strong>anti-particle</strong>. All of the fundamental particles above have a property called &quot;charge&quot; (of electric charge) which can be positive or negative, and one of the things that differentiates some of those particles from the other is how much charge thy have. The easiest way to think about a particles anti-particle is that they are identical, except they have the opposite charge (this is not strictly true - neutrinos are neutral, so an antineutrino differs through a different property - the <em>lepton number</em> which I haven't gone into here, but you can look it up if interested). When a particle comes into contact with its anti-particle, they annihilate (they release a lot of energy). Anti-particles are created all the time in natural processes, but they annihilate almost immediately. A big open question in modern physics is why the Universe seems to be made of &quot;matter&quot; rather than &quot;anti-matter&quot;; we believe that when the Universe was created there were equal amounts of both.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about the photon? Isn't that a &quot;fundamental particle&quot;?</em></strong></p>
<p>I've gone over &quot;what stuff is made of&quot;. However, stuff needs to be able to &quot;interact&quot; with other stuff, otherwise what's the point? It turns out that the Standard Model also takes into account how stuff &quot;interacts&quot; with other stuff, and that's where the photon comes out.</p>
<p>There are four main ways that all the above matter interacts, known as the four <em>fundamental forces</em>. They are <strong>electromagnetism</strong>, <strong>gravity</strong>, <strong>strong force</strong> and <strong>weak force</strong>. Explaining properly how they fit into the Standard Model is a bit beyond ELI5 territory, involving some rather nasty an complicated maths and physics (gauge theory). However, it's not entirely incorrect to say that when particles interact with each other, they do so under one of these four forces, and that this interaction takes places as the exchange of a particle, called a <em>force carrier</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Electromagnetism</strong> is by far the most studied and well understood of the forces, and is the one everyone is most familiar with. It determines everything from the fact that the sun shines with light and heat to the fact that your fingers can &quot;come into contact&quot; with a wooden table instead of passing through. The force carrier is the <strong>photon</strong>, and all electromagnetic interactions can be said to involve the exchange of a photon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>strong force</strong> as mentioned by another user is the force that mediates how quarks interact with other quarks and holds them together into baryons and mesons. It is also responsible for holding together protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. The force carrier is the <strong>gluon</strong>, and all strong interactions can be said to involve the exchange of a gluon. The strong force is about 137 times stronger than electromagnetism (at very small scales)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>weak force</strong> is responsible for radioacive decay and nuclear fission. It's not often studied alone, but usually together with electromagnetism as they are very closely related. The force carriers are three: the <strong>W^+ boson</strong>, <strong>W^- boson</strong> and the <strong>Z^0 boson</strong>. It's thousands of times weaker than electromagnatism.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Gravity</strong> doesn't actually form part of the Standard Model. This is another Big Question in Physics: how to unify Gravity (whose main theory is General Relativity) with the Standard Model. The force carrier in this case is thought to be the <strong>graviton</strong>, but it's never been observed and some scientists debate it's existence at all. It is by far and large the absolute weakest of all the forces, billions and billions of times weaker than electromagnetism. Think about it: with your puny little hands you can lift something up, immediately and easily counteracting the gravitational pull of the entire planet Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What about the Higgs Boson</em></strong>?</p>
<p>Of all the fundamental particles I've mentioned (quarks, anti-quarks, leptons, anti-leptons and force carriers), the only one missing from the Standard Model is the <strong>Higgs Boson</strong>.  I won't go into much detail at all other than to say that it is another fundamental &quot;force carrier&quot; which we currently understand to be responsible for the mechanism by which all the other particles gain mass.</p>
<p><strong><em>What's this everyone else has mentioned about bosons and fermions?</em></strong></p>
<p>All of the mentioned particles have several intrinsic properties (although not all of them have them all). Some of the most common and that we are most familiar with are mass and charge (like electric). Turns out almost all of them have an intrinsic property called &quot;spin&quot;, which is related to the intrinsic angular momentum of each particle. The easiest way to visualise spin is to think of the particles actually spinning (although this is completely incorrect!). Spin can have a direction (up or down) as well as a magnitude (an &quot;amount&quot; of spin). This amount can come in half-integer values (1/2, -3/2, 5/2, etc) or integer values (0, -1, 2, etc).</p>
<p>Almost all particles have spin. <em>Composite</em> particles have a total spin which is the sum of the spin of their components. All quarks and leptons are &quot;spin-1/2 particles&quot;, which means they all have a spin of 1/2 or -1/2.</p>
<p>All particles with &quot;half-integer&quot; spin are <strong>fermions</strong>. All particles with &quot;integer spin&quot; are <strong>bosons</strong>.
The main and most important difference between fermions and bosons is that at low energy, they &quot;obey different statistics&quot;. What this means is that when you want to describe a collection of particles (which we often do) and you have to describe their behaviour statistically (because they are too many and too small and too similar to be described individually) you need to use different statistical methods to describe their behaviour (Fermi-Dirac statistics for fermions and Bose-Einstein statistics for bosons).  This leads to a big difference between fermions and bosons - the <em>Pauli Exclusion theory</em> which states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same &quot;state&quot;, but two identical bosons can - which is a very important phenomenon in quantum physics.</p>
<p>Although all leptons and quarks are fermions, that is not the case for atoms. Depending on the amount of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, atoms can be either fermions or bosons. This means that sometimes different isotopes of the same element can have vastly different properties at low energies.</p>
<p>This was an overview of the Standard Model which obviously is missing out a <strong>LOT</strong>. However, I think I've covered almost all of the basics in an easy-to-understand manner. Please do let me know if something is unclear (or incorrect).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right, so here's the deal since school:</p>
<p>The atom is composed of just what you said, but there is a strong indication that protons and neutrons are composed of more fundamental particles called Quarks, as you said. They're the constituents of a family of particles called Hadrons which are all of the particles which are dominated by the 'Strong' force/interaction (i.e. 'The Strong Nuclear Force you learned about, I would guess). In particular they're a subset of that family called Baryons, which are composed of three quarks, and Mesons of two quarks which we can ignore. </p>
<p>Now, quarks (at normal energies) can only exist in bound groupings; the force which binds them gets <em>stronger</em> as you try to &quot;pull them apart&quot;, to the point where instead of doing so, you input enough energy to create new bound sets of quarks and other particles. This is getting very non-ELI5, but I'll bring this back, I promise you.</p>
<p>So we have the basics: Hadrons are systems of bound quarks (the only way we get quarks), and protons and neutrons are a subset of Hadrons called Baryons. You can't study individual quarks, and if you try to break their bonds you just create new groups of bound quarks scattering around. So... why does this matter? Obviously in most of our lives, in chemistry, you can treat a proton as being fundamental.</p>
<p>Enter the LHC, the Large Hadron Collider, which discovered the Higgs Boson you may have heard about over the years. Now you may have some idea about what that name means, because you know that they must be &quot;colliding&quot; neutrons and/or protons. In fact they do, and at velocities <em>very</em> close to the speed of light, with truly drastic energies. </p>
<p>When these protons (beams of them really, but lets treat this individually) collide, they undergo something called scattering; scientists can study the tracks left by little subatomic particles which result from the process of trying to overcome the Strong interaction I talked about above. You don't get to see quarks, but you can see the evidence of interactions that are best described in terms of quarks. </p>
<p>As to why this matters... well... if you want to confirm existing physics or discover new physics, you need to explore new conditions (in this case very high energy levels). It's not easy; to paraphrase a much smarter person than me, it's like trying to study clocks and clockmaking by smashing clocks together and studying the pieces. </p>
<p>Except the pieces only exist for brief instants, and you can only study evidence of that existence, or infer it from math which says, &quot;If I start with 1 unit of energy, I must end with 1 unit, always&quot; followed by clever accounting from known sources. </p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and you asked about the Electron, which is a fundamental particle called a Lepton, which is not believed to have any constituent parts. That said, you probably learned about a model of the atom in which electrons were treated as discrete particles orbiting a nucleus; the &quot;billiard ball model&quot; which is so well loved and well known. Now that understanding has given way to the notion of energy levels and a probabilistic view of the electron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Super simplified just to give you something to grasp, read the others of you want more details. </p>
<p>Atoms are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. </p>
<p>Protons and neutrons are things called hadrons</p>
<p>Hadrons are made up of quarks, specifically 2 &quot;up&quot;s and 1 &quot;down&quot; all tied together with gluons</p>
<p>Fermions are just a category of subatomic particles. It includes quarks and even things made of quarks like neutrons. It also includes nonquark things, but thats the general idea</p>
<p>Bosons are the other category of subatomic particles. In my mind, these are more &quot;energy&quot; things. It includes photons and gluons</p>
<p>So quarks are the atom of atoms. Imagine all of those Styrofoam ball models you made in middle school being made of even smaller balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Electrons are elementary particles, meaning there is nothing smaller, or nothing smaller that we know of, but protons and neutrons are made up of quarks. There are also other particles that are not in atoms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">The Standard Model</a> is our current model for particle physics. If you look at the table, you can see the different elementary particles and what they do. For example, Fermions are the &quot;mass&quot; particles, and the gauge bosons mediate 3 of the 4 fundamental forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Re-defining protons and neutrons to be formed of these quarks that have 6 flavors and &quot;color&quot; charge (similar to how the electron has electrical charge) allows quantum theory explanations of the weak (radioactive decay) nuclear force and the strong nuclear force, that mirror the quantum electrodynamics theory that describes electromagnetism, and allows for a unified (quantum) theory for 3 of the 4 fundamental forces of the universe.</p>
<p>Quantum gravity is still an issue; the force of gravity is still best explained in terms of deformed or warped spacetime, rather than an interaction between fundamental particles that's mediated by the &quot;graviton.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Mites, other forms of parasites, ant wars, death of the queen, lack of food or sugar or water, predators, disease, and so many more. A colony can usually grow proportionate to its amount of resources, and room to roam. I am not sure how old the oldest ant colony is, but many colonies in captivity have survived for many years. Most colonies with only a single queen only last until her death. This is due to the fact that queen alates(young queen ants and their male equivalents) participate in yearly nuptial flights when they leave to mate. Male alates die right after this, but female alates that do make begin an entirely new colony, with only a few eggs to start. There are some species of ants that can have several queens however, and if the acclamation of the new queen goes well each time theoretically a colony could live forever.</p>

<p>Ant genetics are a little weird. The females come from fertilised eggs, while the males come from unfertilised eggs, meaning they're haploid. Since the workers are all female, it means the queen needs a ready supply of sperm, preferably not her own sons. So they store sperm from the nuptual flight in an organ called spermatheca. Though it will be rare (due to other forms of mortality), the queen can run out of sperm. The colony can't make more workers, so it will eventually die off.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Resonance frequency.</p>
<p>Microwaves operate at a frequency/energylevel designed to heat water in a food.  If you deviate either of those, then your microwave will actually take longer to cook food.</p>
<p>But that frequency/energylevel can also be shared with other objects.  Some of those will absorb the waves just as readily, if not more so, than water.  This is where our nonmicrowave safe container labels originated.</p>
<hr />
<p>Check this out.  It's for neutrons, but the concept translates for any particle.  <a href="http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1019v1/img/h1019v1_113_1.jpg" target="_blank">http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1019v1/img/h1019v1_113_1.jpg</a></p>
<p>The neutron is created at a high energy on the far right, and has a low chance of interaction (cross section) with a particle.  But as it collides, it loses energy.  As it loses energy, it has a higher chance of interaction.</p>
<p>Those peaks in the middle?  That's the Resonance Absorption Region, and it's where a microwave is designed to work.  In that area, we have a very high chance of the neutron just getting absorbed.  </p>
<p>In a reactor, that's bad, the neutron was wasted and didn't cause a fission.  In a microwave, it's good.  We just heated the water up even more.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next.  Heat propagates through materials differently.  So yoru plate might heat up just as quickly as the food, but the hot spots spread out very quickly and burn your hand when you grab the rim.  </p>
<p>An option for you, add a little water before you microwave something, especially if it's drying out.  The free water will boil and the steam will heat up your food as it rises through it.  It'll be a lot faster than trying to boil just the internal water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves induce rotation of water/fat molecules at the atomic level, which generates heat. If your food is frozen the rotation doesn't occur very well. The portion of the food touching the plate thaws first, allowing the free molecules to move. So most of the heat is generated right where the food touches the plate. Hence the plate gets hotter than the food. </p>
<p>The material of the plate or possible coating might conduct heat very well allowing that plate to absorb more heat from this process, which will also make your plate feel much hotter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the different materials (plate vs food) absorbing radiation differently and heating differently one should also consider how we perceive temperature. Your skin does NOT measure temperature, it senses the transfer of heat. </p>
<p>For example if you go into a room with a wooden table and a metal chair both are the same temperature (room temperature). However if you touch the metal chair it feels much colder. This is because metal can transfer heat much faster than wood, as a result the heat leaves your hand and flows to the metal chair very fast leaving your hand feeling cold. </p>
<p>If you stood in outer space without any clothes on you would not feel cold as there is nothing for you to transfer your heat to, you will slowly radiate heat in the form of light but this would take a long time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little late to the party but I read something interesting on it a while back. The idea that prevails currently is that your brain has 3 (and a half?) ways of knowing whether or not you're moving. 1) it's telling your legs to move and they are 2) your inner ear says you are 3) your vision says you are (and a half: your peripheral vision says you are). If there is a mismatch on any of these fronts ie: you're in a car reading (legs say they're not moving, direct vision says you're not, peripheral says you are, and inner ear says it's confused depending on how bad the driver is) your brain wants to know why. Because your brain hasn't evolved as much as our modes of transportation have it can come up with only one explanation, you're being poisoned. The fastest way your brain has to get you unpoisoned is to forcefully eject whatever nasty thing you put in your face back out of your face bits. How much your brain actually believes it's being poisoned varies from person to person so not everybody gets car/ motion sick. </p>
<p>Tldr
Brain: wtf is happening guys?
Legs/ears/eyes: yes things are a happen
Brain: uuuuuhhhhh poison? Idk man just to be safe empty out whatever we just ate and we'll call it good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I frequently suffered from motion sickness and only recently discovered the reason.</p>
<p>It's because the jerks / accelerations felt by you inside the vehicle give the illusion that you are moving, but the still insides of the vehicle give the illusion that you are at rest. Your brain can't handle these conflicting inputs and hence - motion sickness.</p>
<p>An interesting corollary of this theory verified by observation is that <strong>the driver does not feel motion sickness, even when the other passengers might.</strong></p>
<p>This is because the driver's attention is fixed on the road, and therefore their brains realize the fact that they are indeed moving, corroborating the input felt through the accelerations experienced by the driver.</p>
<p><strong>Fix for motion sickness</strong> : </p>
<p>If you're in a car, look out the windscreen and concentrate on the road in front of you. I've done this experiment many times now. Everytime I don't do it, I feel motion sickness. When I do it, I feel just fine.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The purpose of concentrating on the road is to anticipate the turns and the bumps of the motion in advance, and prepare yourself for them. The driver is the one guiding the vehicles, so they already have this covered. For other passengers, you need to make a conscious effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From what I understand, thyroid cells are the only cells of the body which will readily absorb iodine - thus making this radiation a very safe form as it won't damage other cells.  But as the RAI is taken as a pill, the radiation irritates the stomach lining and salivary glands, causing nausea and vomiting as a side effect.</p>
<p>Wouldn't having an RAI infusion avoid that particular side effect?</p></div></div>

The iodine pill is transported in special containers to control exposure, and then just tossed back when the patient goes to the nuclear medicine technicians.
