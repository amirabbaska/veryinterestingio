Another part is that it appears that frames have been removed from the scene, making things appear much more frantic. </p>
<p>The biggest thing, however, is that the scene is shot in a way that makes you feel like you're Harry. The camera focuses on Harry, only showing you threats as they become relevant to Harry. </p>
<p>At least, that's the best way I can describe it. Hopefully this helps/actually makes sense.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hepatitis viruses (including D and E also) were identified in a time when biologists and medical professionals knew very little about viruses, or where able to classify them appropriately. The word hepatitis means &quot;inflammation of the liver,&quot; so naturally this is what all the hepatitis viruses have in common. They all cause some form of inflammation in the liver which leads to symptoms that are similar. </p>
<p>Hepatitis A is in the picornavirus family of viruses, same family as polio. It's an illness that people get by drinking or eating contaminated foods (this is refered to as fecal-oral transmission) often in third world countries where sanitation is poor. It looks and feels way worse than it is, lasting only one month and almost never killing anyone who gets it. </p>
<p>Hep B is a member of the hepadnovirus family. It's transmitted through sex and needle sharing, making it a blood borne pathogen. It looks much like hep A at the onset of illness, resolves, but unlike hep A which has no carrier state, hep B has a carrier state which often times develops into chronic hepatitis (chronic liver inflammation) over the course of many years, and often presents with kidney failure and even liver cancer. whether or not this occurs depends on the persons immune system. Unlike hep A, when we find hep B infections we treat them aggressively with antiviral medications. </p>
<p>Hep C belongs to the flavivirus family, same as West Nile virus. It is transmitted only through blood, which makes it most common in people who share needles. Unlike hep B, hep c infections become chronic most of the time, leading to liver cirrhosis (hardening) and also liver cancer, same as hep B, but much more commonly. Infact, hep c is the most common cause of hepatocellular carninoma. We treat hep c as we do hep b, but cannot vaccinate against it (as with hep b) because the virus itself is too variable in the way it coats its outer shell. </p>
<p>In summary, the hepatitis viruses are not a family of viruses. They are a group of viruses from different famililies that all happen to affect the liver in some way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are caused by different viruses and therefore cause different illnesses. While they all cause &quot;hepatitis&quot; or inflammation of the liver, they are far from the only viruses that cause that. EBV (the most common form of &quot;mono&quot;) also can. As can CMV and other viruses...as well as many non-viral causes (autoimmune diseases, Fe overload, tylenol toxicity, fatty liver, alcohol, etc).</p>
<p>Speaking in broad strokes, Hepatits A tends to be transmitted through a fecal-oral route...meaning fecal contamination of food or water and is typically ingested. It often causes a brief illness that most people get over from,  but can be dangerous to certain groups of people.</p>
<p>Hepatits B is a virus made from DNA (the other 2 are RNA). It is usually sexually transmitted. It can also occur through blood-borne transmission (transfusions, sharing needles for IV drug use) and in some cases can even be passed from mother to child during pregnancy and birth. Unlike Hepatitis A which usually is only a transient illness, Hepatitis B can lead to immunity in some people, but other people can develop chronic disease which can eventually lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer (&quot;hepatocellular carcinoma)&quot;</p>
<p>Hep C is usually transmitted by the blood borne route. Most people do not develop immunity to it and have chronic infection which ultimately leads to either liver cancer or cirrhosis. </p>
<p>There is no vaccine for Hep C but there are new drugs that can kill the virus. Meanwhile, there are vaccines for HepA and HepB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my experience Hep A, wasn't nearly as bad as you'd expect. I somehow managed to get Mono (EBV) and Hep A (as well as tonsilitis and pharyngitis) at the same time, ended up in hospital for a week. My only real symptoms of EBV and Hep A were hot feverish sweats and headaches from EBV like a severe cold/flu without coughing and sneezing etc and yellow itchy skin coupled with really strong smelling brown urine and white excrement. Sleep was not my friend for about a month, thats to say uninterrupted sleep - even now 3 months later I can't get enough rest - what I wouldn't give for a good 12 hours sleep a day.</p>
<p>The only reason they kept me in hospital was to make absolutely certain my liver recovered ok and that there wasnt some kind of underlying illness on top.</p>
<p>For anybody interested both the hospital and my personal Dr seem to think it was caused by my work, I'm a broadband, and phone technician. I go into people's homes to fix faults, I used to have drinks sometimes when offered - not these days. Also I have to work in manholes in the street but take precautions but could also be that somehow. </p>
<p>This was probably about 3 months ago and I am still struggling with energy levels at work and home - about 1 or 2 in the afternoon I'm ready for a nap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, while Hepatitis B is transmitted by blood contact, it is extremely transmissible via this route.</p>
<p>An outbreak in Sweden among cross-country runners was tracked to a Hepatitis B carrier who was among the faster runners - small cuts on his legs from grasses/flax and twigs provided a means of infection for following runners.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, there is a high endemic rate of infection among Polynesian groups due to maternal infection of babies who generally develop chronic Hepatitis B infection (95%). This impacts the general population, with &quot;playground infection&quot; a common infection vector.</p>
<p>I've been involved with treatment trials for chronic Hepatitis B, and there have been some really positive developments.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sanitizers almost always use alcohol, which bacterial cells don’t really have any cellular means of developing resistance against.  You may as well worry about developing resistance to having a nuke dropped directly on your face.  Alcohol essentially saps bacterial cells of all moisture instantaneously, and to combat that they would need to develop characteristics which would essentially make them not even bacteria anymore (like a plant-like cell wall or a eukaryote-like complex cell membrane)</p>
<p>EDIT:  I got a few things wrong, thanks for pointing them out everyone! (no sarcasm intended).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alcohol doesn’t work mainly by sapping moisture, it actually causes the bacterial cell membrane (and eukaryotic cell membranes also) to basically dissolve.  We can put it on our hands because of our epidermal outer layer of already-dead cells which basically doesn’t give a fuck about alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bacteria actually can develop resistance to low to moderate concentrations of alcohol, by devoting more resources to a thickened cell membrane.</p>
</li>
<li>Look up bacterial endospores.  These can survive highly concentrated alcohol solutions and cause surfaces to be re-colonized under the right conditions.</li>

<p>Let’s think about if you wanted to wreck someone’s car: you could do a small targeted attack (cut a brake line, drain the fuel, ruin the steering). For every strategy you choose, they can improve it (locked fuel door, etc). You could also take the less glamorous approach and just completely destroy the car baseball bat at midnight style. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what’s in the hand sanitizer. </p>
<p>The triple antibiotic soaps and hand sanitizers will absolutely cause resistance to develop. This has already been documented and it is discouraged to use those types of soaps and sanitizers. </p>
<p>For alcohol based sanitizers, the mechanism of killing bacteria is much more intense, for lack of a better word. Antibiotic resistance can be through random mutations of the targeted protein or an enzyme that sequesters or degraded the antibiotic; antibiotics act in a very specific way, so resistance is just a change in the very specific mechanism. Alcohol’s effect is far-reaching and affects nearly all aspects of bacteria. It is very unlikely that all the proper mutations will be present to resist the alcohol’s effect. In fact it’s so unlikely that it hasn’t been documented to any reasonable degree that I know of. </p>
<p>The 0.01% is most likely due to bacteria forming spores or improper technique over a tiny portion of the skin. </p>
<p>Please correct me if I’m wrong or have any assumptions I should state. </p>
<p>Edit: felt that further clarification of why spores don’t develop resistance was necessary.
You can think of spores as dehydrated cells. They have a thick cell wall that resists most extreme environments, e.g. low nutrients, low and high temperatures, low moisture, radiation, etc. so they won’t react to any stimulus at ergo they won’t acquire resistance since they aren’t really living (so to speak)
They are actually a worry when sending space equipment to other planets. How do we know if life found there is native or just a spore that decided to start populating the planet when it fell off the space equipment?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are confronted with a stressful event, your brain anticipates the energy and focus for the event. It's gonna stimulate or slow different systems in your body. In stressful situations (good or bad), you are gonna use your accelerator (sympathetic system) and pump more blood, breathe more oxygen, get more focus and make your muscles more reactive. This is you, bracing and getting ready to get through the event.</p>
<p>In an anxiety disorder, you have your foot constantly on the accelerator. Any situation can become stressful by the way your brain analyse it and adjust to it. Your brain perceives danger in a non-threatening situation or over stimulate in stressful events. This is what happens when you have a panic attack, your body responds excessively to stress.</p>
<p>Antidepressants regulate some pathways of this nervous system. It forces the accumulation of certain chemicals in your brain so these nervous pathways are not constantly stimulated. It may help to manage the disorder better.</p>
<p>Edit: Grammar, better phrasing. For all the redditors going through anxiety and/or depression: you are strong and resilient, you can adapt to everything. What you feel is temporary, nothing lasts, you are not defined by your diagnosis. Your doctor loves you, has seen you distressed and prescribed you antidepressants and/or anxiolytics to help you get through. If your symptoms or depression longers for way too long or you have difficulty to manage it, please seek help, please see a psychologist/counsellor/GP/psychiatrist. You'll be amazed by what you are capable to overcome. We love you.</p>
<p>To respond to some questions and stays in an ELI5:</p>
<p>Anxiety is your physiologic response to a stressful event. A disorder is a maladaptive response to what we consider the norm. When you have an anxiety disorder, you chronically react too much or have difficulty to come back to a normal state.</p>
<p>Anxiolytics (for benzodiazepines, most commonly used) work on your central nervous system by making your neurons less excitable, this is extremely useful to calm you down during a panic attack or in prevention when you have to confront a stressful event. Your muscles respond less to the accelerator, your heart calms down, you breathe slower, your muscles relax. Unfortunately, this is highly addictive and just treat your physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Depression is a low mood state, a temporary inability to feel excited or joy. It is normal to feel that way. What we consider not normal it's when this state last for more than 6 months or is accompanied with worthless feelings and/or suicidal thoughts. Your antidepressants medications will help you having more good feeling molecules in your brain, helping you a get through the rough events you are going through. However, this takes time to have an effect and this will make your brain produce or recapture less of these molecules (this is why you need progressive withdrawal and develop tolerance).</p>
<p>Depression and anxiety are commonly seen together. A lot of anxious persons develops depression states or juggle with both disorders. We do not know exactly all the mechanisms, different theories going on. Same with medications, we know half the exact mechanisms of very common molecules on our nervous system. That is why it seems off to put people on antidepressants with chronic pain or anxiety, but we do know there is an effect on the nervous system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a long-term patient/sufferer of a severe/chronic anxiety disorder (panic w/agoraphobia, which I assume is based on GAD because it's been so many years but I dunno).</p>
<p>I like understanding things so have asked lots of questions of my doctors and done lots of research. The following is according to my understanding, although as described, I'm not in a position to call myself an expert.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is an anxiety disorder?</strong></p>
<p>This question has two potential meanings: When do we consider anxiety a disorder? And, what causes anxiety disorders? So I'm going to broach both.</p>
<p><strong>When do we consider anxiety a disorder?</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety disorders are not singular entities. It is not a fact that you either have or do not have one in the same way as you can either have or not have a cold. There is not a single pathogen, or single physical issue, or anything we can objectively see on a scan or in a blood test that can tell us whether you do or don't have a disorder. </p>
<p>Instead, anxiety disorders are classified according to clusters of symptoms. The main 'symptom' of any mood disorder is that the mood (whether anxiety, depression, whatever) causes significant distress and dysfunction. So if you're 'a worrier' but it doesn't really bother you and it doesn't mess with your life at all, then depending on country (the US seems to enjoy pathologising from what I see/hear...) a psych is going to be reticent to call that a disorder. Generally, it's only considered a disorder if it's actually causing you pain and holding you back in life. (As an aside, this is not true for ego-syntonic disorders like personality disorders and some cases of eating disorders - e.g. people with anorexia often claim to 'choose' their disorder and do not consider it a 'bad' thing - but when it comes to mood disorders like anxiety, suffering and dysfunction are key).</p>
<p>As for the different 'types' of mood disorders, the lines are really just drawn in the sand. That's why many people have a long list of 'disorders', because there's significant overlap and you can fit into many categories at once. People with GAD often experience OCD features. Most people with GAD also have social anxiety. People with panic disorder often have GAD. Most agoraphobics have panic disorder. Most people with anxiety have depression and vice versa. This is because we're not dealing with a specific disease entity here, these labels just describe which symptoms you're experiencing at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>What causes an anxiety disorder?</strong></p>
<p>No one knows exactly. There are many theories. These span genetics, neurochemistry, and social and environmental factors (such as how you were brought up). It is generally accepted that the cause is <em>probably</em>, a bit of all of these things, but treatment normally focuses on changes thoughts and behaviours that you have learned in childhood (which have been shown to be a significant factor in either causing or perpetuating anxiety), or changing neurochemistry with antidepressants. Even when it comes to medication, most people agree that antidepressants aren't the 'cure', personal change through therapy is the more sustainable way to recover. Antidepressants are generally seen as a way to stabilise mood so that one can make necessary changes to themselves/their lives to reduce overall stress.</p>
<p><strong>How is this linked to the sympathetic nervous system?</strong></p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system is activated under stress regardless of whether you have an anxiety disorder or not. The physical symptoms of an anxiety disorder are experienced by everybody under stress, but they tend to be worse with an anxiety disorder simply because you experience them more severely and more often. </p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system governs your fight/flight response. Under stress, all human bodies will go into 'turbo mode' and start prioritising all the systems needed to help you flee danger or fight it. Your blood is directed to your muscles and away from your digestive system and skin. So you get pale/blanched skin; nausea; diarrhoea; vomiting; IBS etc. You breathe faster and your heart beats faster to get super oxygenated blood to your muscles to help them move more quickly. So you feel dizzy, faint, and get heart palpitations and sometimes chest pain (which is actually just muscle pain). With so much energy sent to them and a sudden desire to move, move, fucking move; your muscles tense up in readiness. So you get aches and pains all over your body. You also sweat to cool you down during your flight/fight. </p>
<p>So, like I say, everybody gets these symptoms to varying degrees when nervous/anxiety/stressed. But in an anxiety disorder your body is constantly reacting like this and your body isn't really made to be in turbo mode all the time, so you get additional symptoms -exhaustion, fatigue, confusion, brain fog, insomnia etc. Essentially, your body is just <em>knackered</em> and it's struggling because it's being pushed so hard.</p>
<p><strong>Why do antidepressants work on anxiety?</strong></p>
<p>No one knows. No one knows why antidepressants work on depression either. They also don't always work, but there's no good way of seeing who they will work for and who they won't. Many people find no benefit from medication; many others find enormous benefit from medication. </p>
<p>Some people believe that this may be because of a chemical imbalance in the brain; but another way of seeing it would be that when you are depressed/anxious, your brain creates/reuptakes different neurotransmitters in different amounts. What are depression/anxiety anyway in the physical sphere except a brain process? So it could be that by artificially disrupting the brain process that is triggered by stress/danger, you can reverse engineer the situation so that you 'trick' the brain into behaving as if it isn't under stress/danger. </p>
<p>This is already an overlong response so I will stop there. Hope it went some way to answering your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people will take SSRIs for only a period of time until their anxiety has settled, but to have an anxiety disorder, its a chronic imbalance. This can cause everything from stomach problems to pain, overwhelming fear, and so on. My neurologist did a good job of reminding me that when you get embarrassed, you blush, meaning that the blood vessels in your cheeks actually expand. This is just a little explaination of the effect that the hormones which control your &quot;feelings&quot; can affect your physical self.
I know this isn't exactly answering the rest of your question (cause it's already been answered), but that is really what anxiety is. An imbalance of chemicals in your brain. So any pain or nausea that comes with it, isn't someone being &quot;crazy&quot; it's a very real pain.
I just went through 6 doctors to find out why I've been having overwhelming pain, tremors, nausea, fatigue, vertigo (and so on),and two years and many ER visits, mris, ct scans, xrays, and LOTS of blood tested, I am diagnosed with PTSD. Turns out that the back of my mind is still processing things that have occured, even if the part of my mind which I can control, feels accepting of the trauma.
(This means that I have hormones running through me that are causing damage to my body) the mind is so very weird. I've been on anxiety meds for about 5 years already, and I'm soon going to be on other meds to help with the current situation.
I hope this helps to explain anxiety and stress disorders more. I have a genetic anxiety disorder and a stress disorder brought on by trauma. It's crazy stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; aspect of your nervous system is a highly evolved survival mechanism. The ability to instantly put your body in a ready state to deal with life threats has been a key factor in animal development. However, humans have two traits which have complicated this mechanism.</p>
<p>The first is higher brain function. We can form complex thoughts, thus materializing threats and confusing or overloading the reflex. Our ancestors risked becoming the prey of larger carnivores, whereas modern man risks unemployment or losing a parking space....yet our brains perceive those threats similarly.</p>
<p>The second is our domain over our environment. We've eliminated large carnivores from the equation. Similarly we've shaped our terrain into (mostly) harmless cities, suburbs, farms etc. Shelter protects us from all but the most extreme weather events. Science has uncovered the mystery of disease. Simply put, the lack of consistent life threatening stimuli has possibly de-calibrated the sympathetic nervous system slightly. (much like some experts suspect &quot;germophobic&quot; people have a higher chance to develop allergies due to lack of immune system exposures.) </p>
<p>I hope this helps in some respect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the behavior of subsonic vs. supersonic flow. You are right that subsonic flow will increase in gas speed as you narrow down a nozzle, but this is only true up until the speed reaches Mach 1. At that point, the flow is said to be &quot;choked&quot; and you can't increase the speed. This is because subsonic flow is considered incompressible, in that the density doesn't significantly change as the conditions in the nozzle change. But as the gas approaches the speed of sound, it becomes more and more compressible and at Mach 1, if you try and increase the speed by narrowing the nozzle further, you're just compressing the gas more without increasing the flow velocity.</p>
<p>So because of this compressibility, supersonic flow will also <em>decompress</em> as the nozzle area increases, which in turn increases the velocity as the nozzle area increases. This type of nozzle is called a &quot;de Laval&quot; or &quot;converging-diverging&quot; nozzle if you're interested in learning more.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the gold!</p>

The reason that rocket nozzles are bell shaped instead of cone shaped is because it straighten out the flow, so to speak. Right after the combustion chamber the nozzle quickly opens and then the angle gradually decreases towards the opening. This shape redirects any of the gases flowing radially out of the combustion chamber towards the opening in an actual direction, resulting in an increase in thrust since the sideways forces don't result in forward thrust which is what is desired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this is non-trivial, and I remember pulling my hair out in 3rd year fluid mechanics courses trying to understand it. It comes down to the fact that the air leaving the nozzle is supersonic, and that supersonic flow behaves differently than subsonic. Pressure waves move through the air at the speed of sound, and thus once your flow goes supersonic, increasing the pressure of the gas in the exhaust doesnt result in a bigger flow rate (or thrust). It does, however, result in a bigger shock wave at the exit. But your flowrate is 'capped' at mach 1 with this system.</p>
<p>Why the bell shape exists is something I will have to look up, but essentially it is there to manipulate flow rate into rising above the sonic threshold, and thus provide more thrust.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It looks like there is are already great answers, but I want to clarify and simplify a bit. When gases are traveling at subsonic speeds: when you decrease the flow area, such as with a nozzle, the gas speeds up. When increasing the flow area, the gas slows down. Supersonic is the exact opposite, since it is hypercompressed, it wants to expand: by increasing the flow area, velocity increases! The diverging section (bell) allows the gases to expand, speed up, and drop in pressure. </p>
<p>The specific bell shape comes about to control the expansion of the gas. Ideally, the gas is allowed to expand just enough that the pressure of the gas at the nozzle exit equals the pressure of the atmosphere around, and the shockwave from the gas changing from super to subsonic occurs at the exit plane. If the nozzle is too big at the exit, the gas pressure drops below the atmospheric pressure and atmospheric air actualy enters the engine and drops efficiency. Shocks also form inside the engine nozzle. If it is too small, the gases exit the nozzle at a higher pressure than atmosphere, and you lose efficiency because the air has left over energy that could be converted to velocity still. Shocks also form at weird places outside the engine. The characteristic smoothness of the bell helps the flow change continuously and in a laminar fashion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are right, so I'll just summarize and fill in a few gaps. Subsonic flow accelerates when the nozzle diameter decreases. Supersonic flow accelerates when the nozzle diameter increase. The derivation for this has always seemed counterintuitive to me, but it is not hard to follow if you have some calculus experience. Search for &quot;converging diverging nozzle&quot; and you'll find some examples.</p>
<p>The short version is that the isentropic flow equations (no heat added or viscous effects) creates a relationship between changes in pressure and changes in density. Conservation of momentum creates a relationship between changes in velocity and changes in pressure. Conservation of mass creates a relationship between changes in area, changes in density, and changes in velocity. Combining all of these together gives you a relationship between changes in velocity and changes in area, and that relationship changes signs when Mach number is greater than 1.</p>
<p>The bell shape specifically is to control shocks in the supersonic flow. Any diverging (increasing area) nozzle should accelerate the flow, but the bell shape does it while minimizing the energy lost to shock waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your eyes and ears have to agree with each other.

So your eyes see you moving but your vestibular system, which is in your ear, keeps a fluid in it to sense balance. If you're in a car maintaining speed, your eyes say &quot;dear God almighty this is fast so much is moving Jesus!!!&quot; Meanwhile your ears are saying, &quot;dude idk what you're smoking but we are standing still right now chill out&quot;. </p>

However, if the size of that volume increases to infinity the gap between different allowed energies approaches zero and you get a continuum.  Thus, one can say that the physics of a confined particle and a free particle are very different. </p>
<p>However, this is only true if one is considering physics whose energy scale is much less than the energy gap associated with this confinement. For example, a system of particles at room temperature on Earth (~300 K) has ~0.025 eV (electronvolts, a unit of energy) of thermal kinetic energy. Thus, such a particle, like say an electron in a solid, will only behave &quot;differently&quot; than a free particle if you confine it so much that the discrete energy gaps become larger than 0.025 eV (which occurs for electrons in silicon if you confine it to a volume of less than ~10 nm, something that is happening in the trillions of transistors driving the computer you're using right now - electrons in MOSFET transistors exist in an effective 2D world because of this quantum confinement).  If you confine it to a larger box than ~10 nm, say so that energy gap is ~0.0001 eV (which is much smaller than the 0.025 eV of thermal energy) then it will behave like a free particle because the &quot;fine detail&quot; of its structure of allowed energy is hidden by the much larger fluctuations in energy brought about by the thermal motion; kind of like a microscope that isn't zoomed in enough so that a material we know is made of a complex structure of animal cells, just looks like skin.</p>
<p>So, coming back to your original question,  in an infinite universe &quot;free&quot; particles have continuous energy spectra, where in a finite universe (whether it be finite in the sense that it ends, or if it's periodic, where you loop back to where you start) energy spectra are discrete.  HOWEVER, this is only discernable if we consider phenomena whose energy scale is less than the discreteness. And the larger a finite universe is, the tinier this discretization detail is.</p>
<p>We have never observed &quot;discreteness&quot; of free particles, so either the universe is infinite, or it's at least big enough such that the discreteness is tinier than our ability to detect.  Which brings us to the pragmatic answer that if the discreteness ends up being tinier than an energy scale we could EVER, even in principle, be able to discern, then it pragmatically makes no difference.  Everything will effectively behave as if it were a continuum anyway. </p>
<p>Realistically, the universe that is currently observable is already far, far, far, far, far too big, such that even if there was magically an &quot;end&quot; just beyond it (or a periodic looping), the energy discretization would still be so outrageously tiny we'd never tell the difference.  So realistically: no, it won't matter to Earth physics.</p>
<p>However, it would tell us something crucial about its curvature and the type of cosmology that describes our universe.  Thus, it would tell us something about the fate of the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There would necessarily be some theoretical breakthrough, a groundbreaking observation, or probably a couple of both to get to that point. So, on the way to that answer there would certainly be some changes to our understanding of physics. But if we got a &quot;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" target="_blank">Word of God</a>&quot; that it's either finite or infinite, that wouldn't really change much from our perspective. There are many ideas in cosmology that predict a finite or infinite universe, so the answer to that question on it's own doesn't really narrow things down much.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two hormones governing moulting and metamorphosis in insects. Ecdysone is a fat soluble hormone and increases towards the end of each instar (it accumulates in body fat). Once a threshold is crossed, a moult is triggered. Ecdysone levels drop immediately after the moult, then slowly build up again towards the next peak.</p>
<p>Juvenile hormone (JH) shows declining expression with age. It tells the body what the next stage should be at the ecdysone peak when moulting is triggered. In a caterpillar, once JH levels drop below a predefined threshold, the next ecdysone peak initiates the pupal stage. If the caterpillar is underfed, this ecdysone peak (and hence the next moult) is delayed until sufficient energy reserves are available. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called bioregenerative life support, and in falls in the broader category of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Short answer is yes, but not infinite and not without disadvantages.</p>
<p>Note that plants aren't the only way to recycle oxygen. Currently they use water electrolysis to inject oxygen into their atmosphere, and use the resulting hydrogen to apply the Sabatier reaction with CO2. This yields methane as a waste product, and captures oxygen from CO2 in the form of water, so they can later apply electrolysis again and recycle oxygen.</p>
<p>A clear advantage of using plants would be trapping carbon into edible forms, so you'd be recycling not only oxygen but also food. However, not all plants have a 100% edible mass, and those who do usually offer very few calories if not negligible (e.g. lettuce).</p>
<p>A problem with plants is that they could die under some conditions, so this system isn't 100% reliable. And in any case, whether bioregenerative or artificially regenerative, you can never achieve a 100% reuse of ECLSS resources. But it's ok, you can get close enough and have them for a long time relying on very little supplies.</p>
<p>They are actively researching on this topic. Recently they've been able to grow lettuce in the ISS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whoa something I can answer - I worked on the Lunar Greenhouse Module at the University of Arizona! </p>
<p>Bioregenerative Life Support Systems could continually produce oxygen and some amount of food (our goal was always atmospheric conditioning with food production as a windfall of that). In fact, you kind of have to decide if you'd like the plants to focus on growing leaves for oxygen production or fruits for food production. Either way, there are a lot of challenges in feeding those plants. We proposed using composters to recycle human waste to make the system fully sustainable, as plants &quot;breathe&quot; pure water out which could then be utilized as drinking water as well. I don't know all the details about that part of it, as that wasn't my section. We also intended to use Fresnel lenses with fiber optic cables to deliver sunlight directly to the plants, with blue and red LEDs as a backup (it'd be placed underground because the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hydroponics would have difficulty in a low gravity environment like the ISS without some real specialized design, which the plants may not like. The moon would give us an environment that is a little more familiar to us and the plants. </p>

While we have been able to grow sunflowers aboard the ISS, the lack of gravity showed some problems in their development.</p>
<p>Plants require gravity to tell then which direction their roots should grow. Obviously, down means soil. Without gravity, plants become lost and will have more difficulty growing, resulting in limp produce.</p>
