		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be hard to quantify the (possibly perceived) affective (read emotional) aspects to peoples eyes. We can measure pupal dilation, saccadic rhythms and movement. These have some emotional correlation, but nothing dramatic for softer &quot;mood&quot; style emotions.</p>
<p>That said people automatically &quot;hide&quot; their true intention/feelings by posing their face. Many facial/body posture muscles differ in neurological connection to autonomous and conscious parts of the brain. In fact the eyes are a good &quot;tell&quot; because they are more strongly wired to autonomous systems.</p>
<p>A lot of the processing we do of the emotions displayed by others does happen subconsciously in parts of the brain separate from regular sight. So the possibility of miss-attribution is there.</p>
<p>Its one of those questions we should gain insight into as fMRI studies of emotion and cognition advance.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was going to look it up and write it in the style of this subreddit, but really the explanation I found was already perfectly ELI5 and I could only make it worse by changing it into my own words, I'm just going to quote it.</p>
<p>There are several theories for this and we don't know which could be the right one. We still haven't understood it completely.</p>
<p>THEORY #1</p>
<p>When you're watching a scary movie, the brain senses a potential threat. So, your adrenal glands release a hormone called adrenaline, which is responsible for the 'flight or fight' response. It prepares the body to confront danger. It increases your energy by several folds. For this, it pumps blood from the periphery (hands, toes) to your vital organs such as heart, kidney, lungs etc so that they pump faster, and work more efficiently. As a result, your face, hands and feet  tend to feel cold'.</p>
<p>When your body temperature decreases, in an attempt to restore the former optimum temperature, the Brain and spinal cord tells your  muscles to tighten and relax one after the other. This causes the sudden electrical shiver down your spine. </p>
<p>THEORY #2 </p>
<p>This is an evolutionary quirk. The reason behind this is the same reason the cat's fur stands up when it is started. The pilomotor reflex. </p>
<p>In an attempt to look BIG and SCARY during threat, the muscles tighten and the hair attached to these muscles stand up (goosebumps) and again this sudden contraction of muscles is experienced as a 'shiver' .  Ancient man apparently used this reflex to scare away wild beasts. And this reflex though has little significance today, remains.</p>
<p>During emotional experiences :</p>
<p>This has happened to all of us. Whenever we've experienced something so unimaginably beautiful or overwhelming- a song, a person, a speech. </p>
<p>Apparently, whenever your brain is triggered by strong emotional stimuli, such as listening to music, it releases a cocktail of hormones, one of which is dopamine. Dopamine is the pleasure hormone. Some suggest that  it's when music sets off some memory of your past/ an overwhelming emotion which you experienced that the brain responds through a sudden alternate muscle contraction and relaxation. It could also be the sudden changes in rhythm of music that trigger such a reaction. </p>
<p>And again, you experience that electrical shudder. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is partly due to the same reason we get goosebumps. The shivers are usually followed by goosebumps, which is in part an evolutionary response. This was more useful when we were covered in body hair, and the hairs stood up when the pores pulled closed. This is to seem &quot;larger&quot; in the same way that cats raise their hairs when threatened. Our response is usually triggered by something scary/emotional.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one's really given a good answer. Although I'm no expert I'll give it a go. In that situation you described it's probably the feeling of an adrenaline rush going through your body since you imagined yourself in a life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>In response to this, your brain thinks you're in danger and so tells the sympathetic nervous system to kick into gear, causing adrenaline secretion among a whole bunch of other effects mediated by the sympathetic system. This is designed to keep you alive and survive whatever immediate threat is endangering you, however in your case it's all imagined. </p>
<p>Happy to be disproved though. I think shivers down spines is a bit of a contentious issue with regards to them during music, but I'm fairly confident since they are happening when you imagine danger it's due to the sympathetic system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

When you send out someone to negotiate on your behalf you have a need to tell them stuff that the people they negotiate with aren't to know - like for instance the minimum they must get in a deal for it to be acceptable.<br />
Since every country has this need to protect the secrecy of what they say to their diplomats and what the diplomats know and do, they (mostly) agree to a trade. I won't bother your diplomats and you won't bother mine. This is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
Diplomatic immunity means the sending country shields the staff of a diplomatic mission from many ordinary state powers like search and seizure of personal effects/property, arrest and prosecution for crimes. If there's evidence of wrongdoing the host country can only</p>
<ul>
<li>present that evidence to the sending country and ask that they <em>waive immunity</em> - allow the person to be prosecuted by the host country without claiming immunity.</li>
<li>declare the relevant people <em>persona non grata</em> - unwelcome in the host country. They must then leave the host country within a reasonable timeframe or they are no longer covered by the immunity of the diplomatic mission. </li>

Your home country can choose to prosecute you or even revoke your immunity, but normal practice is to just bring a diplomat home if they've angered the host country.</p>
<p>Although various systems and informal arrangements have existed for millennia, the 1961 Vienna Convention made diplomatic immunity a treaty obligation.</p>
<p>Note that this full immunity only applies to a 'diplomatic agent' - staff of various kinds will receive differing treatment depending on the country they're in and the agreements between the two countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first off countries have ambassadors in other countries to facilitate negotiations etc.  As a general rule you want some sort of representative there even during a war.  This will allow a conversation to start towards negotiating a peace.</p>
<p>Now on to your question.  Diplomatic immunity is there so that the ambassadors and others associated with the embassy don't have to worry about being arrested on false charges on order to gain leverage.  It is a long standing tradition that messengers are allowed to deliver there messages without being harmed otherwise how can 2 governments talk.  This has simply been expanded when ambassadors and embassies became a thing. Ambassadors can be expelled from a country but they cannot be charged. </p>
<p>These are also not absolute rules.  A government can waive diplomatic immunity.  For instance countries with simikar values may say that someone involved with the embassy can be charged.  This would be done in the interest of maintaining good relations between the 2 countries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you kill your neighbor. In this altercation, the state will impose its power over you by forcefully arresting you, physically dragging you into a prison and judging you for your crime. This is a vertical relationship, one of hierarchy. </p>
<p>Now imagine countries are neighbors. If one kills the other, or does them harm, there is no higher entity to forcefully execute a punishment (e.g. a government with legitimacy over the use of power and a hierarchical, vertical relationship to impose its will). </p>
<p>That means that relationships between countries are horizontal, or anarchic (anarchy understood as the opposite of hierarchy). This was established by the Peace of Westphalia, in 1648, which established the nation-state as the model for sovereignty amongst the waring European principalities, dukedoms, fiefdoms, etc. </p>
<p>Since then, it has been established that all countries have sovereignty. What's more, since the Hague Conference in 1907, nation-states agreed that all countries are legally equal to one another (again, imagine the concept of your neighbors, you are all equal under the law). </p>
<p>Alright, so with all that as background, let's get to the meat of your question. For centuries, nation-states tacitly agreed that other country's diplomats could not be detained, arrested or tried in another jurisdiction, as that would violate their sovereignty. That is because diplomatic agents are considered an extension of that nation-state, placed in another country to insure friendly relations with the other government. </p>
<p>Why is this? Very simple. With time, countries realized that their diplomats could be subject to political pressure by the host country in order to extract information or carry out a certain policy. Imagine that an American diplomat in Israel is going to work one day and is stopped by the local authorities. Lo and behold, they &quot;find&quot; a ton of cocaine in the trunk. But Israel is willing to overlook this if the American diplomat does such and such things. See how easy it would be to submit them to political pressure and blackmail? This is also why diplomatic immunity extends to family members. </p>
<p>Diplomats duly accredited to another country are therefore &quot;immune&quot; to that country's jurisdiction in ALL criminal or civil matters. This immunity is irrevocable, except by written consent by the diplomat's country. So even if a diplomat went out on the street and killed 10 people and screamed that he was waving his immunity, he would not be tried in the host country, unless his country's government agreed to this. What would likely happen is that he would be declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; (unwanted person) by the host government, giving him 48 hours (minimum) to leave the country. </p>
<p>So did he get away with murder? Not exactly. The idea is, of course, that he would be tried and sentenced in his home country, which DOES have jurisdiction to punish him. </p>
<p>The details of all of this were eventually codified, after centuries of unwritten norms, in the Vienna Conventions (the first from 1961), and are signed and ratified by virtually all nations. </p>
<p>First time on ELI5, so not sure how much detail I should put in this, but I think I covered most of the dynamics. Happy to take questions!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science fiction seems to state either you will explode, or nothing will happen and you suffocate.  Neither of these is correct.</p>
<p>The first noticeable effect you would observe on someone ejected into space would be flushing of the skin.  It would quickly turn red as the blood vessels get closer to the surface.  Eventually the larger blood vessels with bulge out.  Some may rupture leading to bruising.  This is not comfortable.  Folks on youtube occasionally stick their arms into vacuum chambers, they claim this is very painful.  This may cause the victim to shout, exhaling early.</p>
<p>Further the victim could hold their breath.  The vacuum of space is not so strong as to rip the air from their lungs, but holding their breath would be uncomfortable as well due to the negative pressure.  this would provide a brief extension to their consciousness, but they would eventually exhale and begin to suffocate.</p>
<p>during suffocation the victim may indeed move their mouths open and shut, clutch at their throat, or tug at the collar of their shirt, and look <em>VERY</em> distressed.  They would eventually fall unconscious in likely under a minute (varies)</p>
<p>When they fall unconscious they would enter the fetal pose (knees slightly bent, arms loose, head down, as this is the natural position of the body without gravity or conscious interference.  They may spasm once more before death, otherwise they will not move again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your digestive tract would begin to swell up due to trapped gases, and some gasses would begin to leak out of your esophageal sphincter and anus.</p>
<p>Any moisture on the surface of your lungs and other mucous membranes would start to boil off.  This would feel chilly, but not cold.  EDIT: I was inspired by a comment to do some math, over a minute or two it wouldn't matter much but over a longer period of time you'd get pretty cold. But you be dead so.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of air your lungs would start working backwards and oxygen would start coming out of your blood.</p>
<p>Your body would swell as small gas bubbles started forming in soft tissues, some small capillaries near the surface might burst.</p>
<p>Previously dissolved gasses  would begin to form bubbles in your blood vessels, but your blood would not boil because your blood pressure is high enough to keep the boiling point above your body temperature.</p>
<p>After 15 sec enough oxygen would have diffused out of your blood into your lungs that you would pass out.</p>
<p>Your body would continue to swell to somewhere in the region of 2 times your typical volume, at which point your skin would have pulled taut enough to halt further gas formation.</p>
<p>You now have the worst sunburn of your life on whichever side of you has spent the past minute in the radioactive hellhole that is unfiltered sunlight.</p>
<p>At 1min 30sec brain damage starts to occur.  Repressurization anytime prior to this results in full recovery with proper medical intervention.</p>
<p>At approximately 2min brain damage is extensive enough to be incompatible with life, beyond this point no amount of medical intervention can save you.</p>
<p>EDIT 1: No don't hold your breath, your lungs will burst and you will be extra mega boned.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Water boils at a lower temperature in space, your body happens to be higher than space boiling.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: We know this cause some poor sap (Jim LeBlanc) mega fucked up by managing to dislodge the air hose on his suit while in a vacuum chamber.  For his bravery he earned 87 seconds of vacuum and a bad earache but was otherwise ok.  Also some fucked up dudes thought that trying it out on some dogs would be an OK thing to do (another comment further down has the link).</p>
<p>EDIT 4: Omg I get it Total Recall has a scene like this.</p>
<p>EDIT 5: After some questions about the dog tests I have poached the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/survival-in-space-unprotected-possible/" target="_blank">link</a> from u/clocks212 bellow, go show him some love!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;But death is not instantaneous. For example, one 1965 study by researchers at the Brooks Air Force Base in Texas showed that dogs exposed to near vacuum—one three-hundred-eightieth of atmospheric pressure at sea level—for up to 90 seconds always survived. During their exposure, they were unconscious and paralyzed. Gas expelled from their bowels and stomachs caused simultaneous defecation, projectile vomiting and urination. They suffered massive seizures. Their tongues were often coated in ice and the dogs swelled to resemble &quot;an inflated goatskin bag,&quot; the authors wrote. But after slight repressurization the dogs shrank back down, began to breathe, and after 10 to 15 minutes at sea level pressure, they managed to walk, though it took a few more minutes for their apparent blindness to wear off.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>However, even if you're rescued slightly before dying, you are still really messed up.</p>
<p>If you don't close your eyes, the water in your eyes will start to boil due to the difference in pressure so your eyes will dry out. Same thing for the saliva in your mouth.</p>
<p>You will need freeze instantly, but steadily lose warmth.</p>
<p>You will get hard sunburn. On Earth, our atmosphere protectes us from a lot of sunlight. In space, you are not protected and will get dangerous burns.</p>

<p>However, if you are rescued after a few seconds, you would survive relatively unharmed.</p>
<p>The closest we ever got to this was in 1966, when NASA technician Jim LeBlanc's space suit had a leak in a vacuum chamber.

<p>EDIT: So it has been a while since I studied astrophysics, and most of my previous statement is incorrect. The observable universe is about 90Bly in diameter, but this is due to the expansion of the universe. So while the light from an object has been traveling for 13.3 billion years, the object is, in reality, approximately 46Bly away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Since light moves at the same speed no matter what point you view it from, we are able to measure lightyears as a constant variable. The distance light travels in a year remains unchanged. Since we have no way of speeding this up, the edge of the observable universe is as far as we can see. These galaxies that are on the edge, since their light has taken many billions of years to reach us, at this moment physically ARE totally different from the way we SEE them. The edge of the observable universe is as far as we can see because the light is billions of years old, and any newer light from further off galaxies wont reach us for quite a while.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>based on my arm-chair understanding of the creation of the universe it's a guarantee. There was a period of expansion that exceeded the speed of light and then it took a really long period of time for light to actually be able to be released. Once that happened, anything that had already gone in the other direction was too far off to ever see again. Basically it was receding from us at a rate that light could never bridge the gap. Now, to temper this, is the idea that the universe is 'bound' and that the light would just come at us from the opposite direction. If we ever get the same light signature from two opposite locations then we'll know the definitive rate of expansion and the actual size of the universe. Right now we're looking for that, but the light is so faded that we're pushing at the limits of detectability already and I don't think anyone believes we're even close. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes. There are a few types of underground water supplies. The first is the water table. </p>
<p>When it rains where does that water go? Well you do see most of it run down the sidewalks, and streets. Where does the rest go? Underground of course. It drains through cracks, and soft soil till it reaches the point of saturation. The bottom of that point is the water table.
For example this water table is at 75ft. You take a drill,or even shovels, and started digging a hole you will hit water (depending on the last good rain) anywhere from just below the surface of top soil to 75ft.  Where you place the pump in that type of well will give you so much water. If you go into a drought that type of well goes dry rather quickly. </p>
<p>The second type of underground water supply is an aquifer.  Aquifers are deep. My example will be the one near me in San Antonio Texas. Surrounding San Antonio you have rivers. Comal, Guadeloupe, San Antonio, etc. They start in the hills, and flow down to the sea.
Rivers are the blood vessels of the earth.  What you see on the surface is just one vain. Underneath them in the cracks in the bedrock are the rest.
All that water from the rain that didn't soak into the ground runs off into the creeks that supply most of the river's water. As time goes on between rain storms the upper layer of soil drains the rest of the water tables into the river. Then the river supplies the underground aquifer.
The San Antonio aquifer is larger than the city itself by hundreds of square miles. Test wells drilled into it at several locations is how it is measured. Every night the local weatherman on the news will tell you what the level is. On average it is around 640 feet.
The water dept keeps an eye on that daily to make sure the population and agriculture have adequate allocations. If it gets low you have restrictions put in place. Like not watering your lawn on certain days. To extreme examples of limiting total number of gallons used per day.</p>
<p>Sorry if I put you to sleep. I know a five year old would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogeologist here.</p>
<p>Generally, groundwater is present in most places across the Earth's land surface. Unlike the picture in most people's heads of underground rivers and caves, the water is usually trapped in the tiny pore spaces (gaps) between rock particles, or in fractures and cracks in the rock.</p>
<p>Part of my job is telling people where to drill wells to get the water they need. Most of the time, it is possible to get groundwater unless the rock is something extremely impermeable like a mudstone or claystone.  Even these rocks can sometimes have fissures that may contain water.</p>
<p>One interesting relationship you can see on maps is the one between river networks and the potential for groundwater.  On mudstone, drainage is terrible, leading to most water getting whisked off by rivers before it has the chance to make it to an aquifer. The density of the river network is far higher.</p>
<p>On a very permeable rock like the chalk here in the U.K., there are far fewer rivers - most of it soaks into the ground and ends up in the chalk aquifer before rivers can form. It's possible to drill wells in the chalk that yield millions of gallons of clean water a day.</p>
<p>Here's a link to an old log of such a well dug in the chalk. It's made of several boreholes, a dug well and a connecting tunnel that they had to lower people down to dig:</p>

None of those actually exist. Instead, aquifers are usually made of loose or consolidated sand or gravel. There are small spaces (pores) between the grains, like in a box filled with marbles, and water fills these gaps. The pores are connected, which allows the water to flow to areas of lower pressure. Wells are basically holes in the ground, so water flows into them to fill that hole.</p>
<p>How deep you have to drill a well varies by aquifer. To give an idea of how much they can vary, u/Juanfartez said that the wells in San Antonio were about 640 feet deep, but in the town where I am in western Minnesota, the wells are usually about 80 feet, and the aquifer itself starts at about 20 feet below the surface. </p>
<p>Not all places will have aquifers, because not all types of rock store water and allow it to flow. Clay, for example, stores water pretty well, but it doesn't allow it to flow. You can see this by squeezing a handful of wet clay. Igneous and metamorphic rocks like granite or marble only allow water to flow through fractures in the rock. So while they can be aquifers, they generally aren't very good because they can't hold much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello. Pilot here. There are a LOT of inaccurate replies to this post. Let me clear some things up.</p>
<p>Concord stopped flying for a huuuuuuge range of reasons. No one factor or reason killed it by itself, but as a combination they mounted up and where eventually too much. I will list the main reasons that killed it off.</p>
<p><strong>1. A tiring airframe</strong></p>
<p>Aircraft have a shelf life of sorts. Unlike a car, an aircraft is exposed to a lot of stresses and strains during its operational lifetime that weaken it's structure and components. Different parts of the aircraft have different life expectancies (The engines being the largest components with the shortest life expectancy) but generally an aircraft lifespan is measured in something called cycles. Depending on the aircraft, one cycle is either one complete startup and shutdown of the engine, or one take off and landing (Regardless of how long the aircraft is actually in the air). An aircraft can only do so many of them before specific maintenance has to be carried out to extend it's life so it can do more cycles. The more it is extended, the more expensive and in depth that maintenance becomes. Eventually there comes a point where it's just not worth it and it has to be retired.</p>
<p>Concord was getting close to this point. She was an old aircraft and extending her life further and further would soon have come with complications like shortened flight hours, restrictions of movement/speed and all kinds of things that is undesirable in a commercial aircraft. I will allude to this more later, but many people view the Paris Air France crash as the end of the Concord. It wasn't. Her airframe cycle life would have killed her off a few years later regardless, but we will touch more upon that later.</p>
<p><strong>2. A reluctant maintenance company</strong></p>
<p>Airbus had a contract to maintain the Concord and it was said that they where somewhat reluctant to continue on with it beyond its renewal date. Maintaining the Concord required extremely skilled people and sophisticated facilities only a company like Airbus could bring to the table. When Airbus indicated they did not want to do it any more, that was a big problem that did not really have an immediate solution.</p>
<p><strong>3. A downturn in it's economy</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Concord was always profitable. It can never be said to have been a huge source of profit for BA/AF and it might be fair to say it sometimes was closer to breaking even but it never ran at a loss. The reason for this was economy of scale. It ran on a schedule that allowed it to break even. Concord never flew with empty seats. The price of a ticket was astronomical and that reflected its operating costs. The upside of this was that flying on it was almost a zero wait experience that got you from London to New York in 4 hours 15 minutes once check in time was calculated. There where no queues at the airports or checking in three hours early or anything like that. Minimum check in was 45 minutes before the flight, it had it's own baggage check lines and security for only 160 people. Your time in the airport was kept to an absolute minimum. The downside of this was you couldn't book a flight to fit your dates, you fitted your dates round flying on Concord. An aircraft on the ground that isn't flying and carrying passengers absolutely haemorrhages money for an airline, but in the case of Concord the time spent on the ground was unavoidable so it was factored into the cost of a ticket.</p>
<p>That being said, there was a downturn in it's economy that began to pinch into this. As fuel prices and maintenance costs rose, the ticket prices couldn't really begin to keep up, high as they where already and it was predicted its maintenance costs would outstrip what could reasonably be claimed back in it's ticket costs in the near future. This meant at some point, the aircraft WAS going to begin operating at a loss.</p>
<p><strong>4. A loss of confidence and increased safety measures after the crash of an Air France Concord in Paris</strong></p>
<p>Many people like to believe that the loss of the Air France Concord in Paris was the final nail in the coffin for Concord. It wasn't. In fact all other things being equal it would barely have phased BA/AF in terms of worrying about the aircraft's future as the aircraft had a near flawless safety record at that time. At some point in time, every airframe has a crash for some reason. The fact Concord had operated for so long before it's first fatal accident was a testament to the aircraft.</p>
<p>However it was just one of the factors that weighed up against the aircraft.</p>
<p>A lot of safety measures had to be retrofitted to the aircraft after the crash. It's worth noting though if the crash had been directly to do with a fault in the airframe then Concord would likely have been scrapped there and then. It's no secret in the aviation world that the damage to the engine and resulting fire from the tyre debris striking the fuel tanks did not destroy the Concord. Had it remained on the ground and come to a stop it would likely have been possible to get some or maybe all of the passengers off. Sadly what destroyed the aircraft was that the plane took off before it's take off speed had been achieved and the aircraft basically stalled into the ground. Therefore BA/AF where confident that with the adaptions to the engines and fuel tank strengthening the aircraft would be as safe as it could be. However they where hugely expensive to implement and BA/AF where never fully sure of being able to recoup the costs against a potentially nervous and very small (Due to the cost of a ticket) customer base. Then 9/11 happened which further had a bad ripple effect across the airline industry and Concord unfortunately had to take some of the brunt of that as well (One of the huge impacts was no longer being allowed to visit the cockpit of Concord mid flight which was often a big part of the experience).</p>
<p><strong>5. BA/AF did not want to share their toys</strong></p>
<p>After it was announced that the Concord's would be retired, British Airways and Air France had a multitude of offers from several aviation companies to take or buy the aircraft and continue flying them. One of the most likely offers was  from Virgin Atlantic. However Richard Branson did not believe he should have to buy them after they where basically gifted to BA/AF by the French and British governments. As it turns out BA where not willing to continue operating them but they sure as hell wheren't going to let anyone else have the prestige of operating them, and as they legally owned them, they said no. It was entirely feasible they could have had a few more years in them, but BA did not want them appearing in someone elses livery.</p>
<p>Hopefully this clears up the main reasons why Concord stopped flying. It was a shame she stopped flying when she did but make no mistake, her time was coming to an end regardless of any crashes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For two reasons. </p>
<p>Firstly, was the France disaster, where a Concord took off, suffered some major malfunction, and wound up upside down on the ground, with everyone onboard dead. While it was a genuinely magnificent plane (and I did get the chance to see one arrive at my local airport once, when I was a kid), such a well-publicized disaster occurring to one of the very few Concords in the world (iirc, there were only 12 in commercial operation) killed the brand stone-dead. </p>
<p>Work was done go recover things. After years of investigation and reengineering, Concord was prepared and readied to fly once again. A press event was arranged, and a crew of press, enthusiasts, and airline senior bods were assembled for a flight from London to New York, which they hoped would reestablish the Concord as the premier choice for those who wanted fast, luxury travel. The flight was successful, the landing event for the press went exactly to plan, and everything seemed poised for success. And then, just thirty minutes later, the first plane hit the World Trade Centre. Concord's return was overshadowed by about the single worst thing that could possibly overshadow it. </p>
<p>The aviation industry took a long time to recover from those attacks. Concord's relaunch didn't stand a chance, and was given up on in mid 2002.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Concorde was never a financial success.  It cost as much as a 747 to operate, with a third of the passengers.  And when you figure all the non-flight time involved in door-to-door travel across the Atlantic, it wasn't that much faster, you are still going to waste most of your day in transit.  Finally, because of the sonic booms, it could only travel at full speed over the ocean.</p>
<p>Then in 2000, Air France flight 4950 hit some debris on the runway during takeoff, ruptured a fuel tank, and wound up crashing into a hotel.  Over 100 people died. The Concorde was grounded for a while, and by the time it returned to service, 9/11 happened, result in a decrease in air travel.  The airplane was also badly outdated and due for a major upgrade.  British Airways and Air France instead decided to pull the plug at that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of what other people have been saying, the relative time advantage of a faster flight disappeared.</p>
<p>Let's say the flight is 3 hours vs 6 hours. That's twice as fast, that's a big deal. You could easily wake up in the morning, fly to Europe for an afternoon meeting, and fly back home in time for dinner with your family. Indeed, this is how they originally pitched it.</p>
<p>Over the years, airports have become busier, security has become tighter. You can't just hop on a plane anymore. You need to show up for your flight a couple hours in advance. Factor in the extra time you spend getting to/from the airport because a lot more people fly these days. Pretty quickly, the whole advantage of having a flight that's faster starts to disappear.</p>
<p>Even if you had the Concord available today, you couldn't really fly to Europe for your meeting and get back the same day anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually TWO effects here.</p>
<p>One is evening out the <em>aerodynamic</em> stability.  If you have a bent arrow shaft, it drifts to the right.  If it rotates 90 deg, it drifts up to the left, another 90 deg, back to the left, another 90 deg, drifts down, and over the long range, it just takes a spiral path but the center of the spiral is dead-on in the long run, but it's hard to gauge how wide the circle of a bent arrow will be, and what the angle of that offset will be where it actually hits.  Net result, if you're a master archer, the bent arrow may spiral in a 1ft radius and basically hit with +/- 1 ft accuracy of a perfect aimpoint at 10 yards AND 100 yards.  If it did not rotate, it might drift 2ft at 10 yards and 50ft by 100 yards.  And you'd have no way to know which way it'll drift, or how far, it's random.</p>
<p>The other is <em>gyroscopic</em> stability, which requires higher RPM.  It keeps the bullet from turning.  This is always accompanied by aerodynamic stability, already covered.</p>
<p>Arrows don't do that second one, BTW.  Commonly they only rotate about once per 20 ft.</p>
<p>Early musket balls and cannonballs got limited benefit from this.  They have a nasty instability in back which spinning only helps marginally.  Yes, golf ball dimples would have improved them greatly, but they didn't know, and would have trouble manufacturing it.  </p>
<p>In the 1840's the Minié ball (which isn't a ball, it's a &quot;bullet shape&quot;) was invented and changed everything.  Those were revolutionary for a number of reasons, but really benefiting from rifling was a big one.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile</a>)</p>
<p>Cannonballs were spherical until the mid 1800's.   Initially, cannonballs were just iron balls, bouncing and rolling through a crowd smashing through people.  They did use rifling in later cannonball-firing cannons.  Those NEEDED to be spherical to maximize bounce.  Since about 1800, they'd been using spherical &quot;shrapnel shells&quot;, exploding cannonballs, which didn't technically need to be spherical because they didn't bounce, but they didn't quite figure that out.  Mid 1850's, they realized they could make a cylindrical shell and the now-familiar pointy nose and fit more volume of explosive inside and it would benotably more accurate and longer-range.  Pretty much all cannons were rifled by then anyhow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most bullets will not be perfectly symmetrical sure to flaws in the manufacturing process. These flaws will cause a bullet to naturally veer during flight. Think of a plane with the tail kinked slightly to one side, it will not fly sight without constant adjustment from the pilot. Since bullets cannot be stress once shot, one way to deal with this natural tendency to veer off is to spin the bullet to balance out the veering. If a bullet would normally veer slightly to the left, then spinning it causes it to spend half that time upside down as it were and it veers back to the right.</p>
<p>Think about an American football thrown in a spiral. The football is not a perfect ovular shape, because it has stiches on one a side that create increased drag. Spinning the ball causes those stiches to spend the same amount of time create drag in every direction rather than throwing it without a spiral where the stitches always stay on the same side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically things are lazy, they don't want to move, but you can motive them and once you do, they don't want to stop. </p>
<p>They also have a hard time changing directions, because that would imply in stopping in one direction than having to move in another. </p>
<p>Rotations are changes in direction in time, every moment it's slightly different. </p>
<p>Now like I said, thing are lazy, if they have to move, then so be it in only one direction and at a set speed, any changes are annoying. But if they have to change directions, then let it be in very small ways, so it's acceptable to them rotating. </p>
<p>For the last part of this basic understanding, is that the faster it is made to move, the harder you need to motivate them to pick up speed AND the harder it is to get them to chill, making them stop (this is key to the question at hand). </p>
<p>This is true for the bullet and for the air, so when interacting, the one that's the laziest will win. </p>
<p>Air is an whole country's army, but it's in peace so the soldiers are dispersed. </p>
<p>The bullet on the other hand, is a small but firm gang trying to bring havoc into the land. </p>
<p>If the bullet goes in one direction and just pushes the air, then they'll start uniting (accumulating) and can more effectively stop or change that direction. </p>
<p>Now if a bullet goes foward but is ALSO rotating, then you did a lot more motivational speech to it, so not only is it flinging the air soldiers all over the place and thus they can regroup, it will take a lot more soldiers to make it change it's direction! </p>
<p>TLDR: Motivated objects will fling the air soldiers so they can't regroup and will need a lot more soldiers to contain it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Throw a piece of paper, and how does it fly?</p>
<p>Not well, because of many factors, namely wind resistance.</p>
<p>Ok, so crumple up the piece of paper into a ball and throw it. How does it fly?</p>
<p>Not well, but slightly straighter. Still because of wind resistance. This time it slows down too quickly.</p>
<p>Ok, so throw a ping pong ball, and how does it fly?</p>
<p>Again, not well, still because of wind resistance. This time it flies further and straighter, but still slows down too much.</p>
<p>OK, so make it denser. Take a musket ball and shoot it. How does it fly?</p>
<p>Better. Much better. But it still flies off in one direction. This is still because of wind resistance. As the ball flies through the air, it hits patches of air that are different pressures, temperatures, or velocities (wind speed), and it pushes the bullet off path.</p>
<p>OK, so let's make the bullet really aerodynamic. Now how does it fly?</p>
<p>Better, but still gets pushed off too one side or another.</p>
<p>OK, so what happens if we spin the bullet?</p>
<p>Ah, now we get to the good stuff. When you spin the bullet, a certain amount of energy is stored in the rotational energy of the bullet. Because of the physics of centrifugal/centripetal motion, any effort to turn or move the bullet is resisted by the energy in the spin of the bullet. So if the air wants to make the bullet turn, and therefore veer off to one side, it gets resisted by the spinning energy of the bullet. Now, the bullet can still turn, but the forces acting to turn the bullet need to overcome the rotational energy of the bullet in order to get it turning (and therefore veering off path).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here. The insides of your lungs are coated in a liquid called a surfactant. </p>
<p>This lowers surface tension, making it easier to breathe, and, crucially stops your lungs from collapsing. Specifically, it stops your alveoli, the small little containers for air, from collapsing. </p>
<p>My lecturers tell me that every 100 breaths or so we take a deeper inhalation, which helps mix this surfactant </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student - We occasionally take deeper than average breaths to ensure all windpipes and alveoli are open fully and to open any closed alveoli. Think of it as almost a mini reboot of the lungs. They are named lung recruitment manoeuvres and can occur for a variety of reasons including as otherwise mentioned high PaCO2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that it's an autonomic function responding to <em>slightly</em> too much carbon dioxide from just not remembering to breath enough. Your body is trying to maintain equilibrium in your blood via bicarbonate buffer system, and you simply needed to blow off a little extra CO2 to keep things optimally homeostatic. You probably just had slightly too much CO2 built up from not breathing quite deeply or often enough. Could easily happen if you're extremely relaxed or concentrating really hard on something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
