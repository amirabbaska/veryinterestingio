The number itself has its own meaning, independent of how you choose to represent it.  If you'd like an imperfect analogy, it is like writing a word in one typeface or another; the choice of typeface does not change the word.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, all bases are equally easy to work with and do any sort of math with for most general purposes. In niche situations, where for some reason certain numbers keep popping up a lot more than you would expect them to randomly, OR if storage &quot;fits&quot; a medium neatly, a particular base might be better (purely due to more compact or evenly divisible storage), but that's not the case most times.</p>
<p>Base 2 for computers makes sense physically due to how we designed the transistors, for example, but even that was just a largely arbitrary decision of how we CHOSE to design them. You can (and people have done so) build base 3 computers, etc.</p>
<p>It's hard to even think of any other example of a system that inherently has some numbers come up more often, or where storage is more natural only in one way. Even if you think of counting with your hands, you could imagine doing so in MULTIPLE ways that all seem about equally reasonable based on the biology. One finger = one integer? Base 1. One finger = a binary bit? Base 2. The first way, but only for the left hand, then the right hand does tens? Base 6. Counting half-extended fingers at the knuckle to get three gestured states? Base 3. Count every finger, then raise a foot for tens? Base 11. Count each knuckle on your whole hand with an index finger of the other, then use lowered fingers on the other for tens? Base 16. Blah blah.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no interesting and useful property of numbers that depends on the number base. The base is just a way to write down numbers. It doesn't change the number in any way. </p>
<p>Edit: Apparently many people don't like my blanket statement. The truth is these types of questions pop up on this sub fairly often because I think many non-experts think base representation is something fundamental or something that hinders our understanding of math or anything like that.</p>
<p>The answer to these questions is always the same: all of the important and useful properties of numbers have absolutely nothing to do with the base. The base is just a way to write down the number; it doesn't change the number in any way. So rationality, primality, being a power of 7, transcendentalness, etc. all have absolutely nothing to do with the base. </p>
<p>Sure, you can come up with some property that depends on the base. For instance, an integer is even if and only if its base-2 reprentation ends in 0. But who cares? That's not really too important and if you're going to reference the base specifically in your property, then you're just cheating the intent of my blanket ststament that bases don't matter. Because they really don't when it comes to the myriad of questions similar to that of the OP. </p>
<p>(Does base matter for some applications? I suppose it matters in how floating point arithmetic is performed. But, again, that's just so far from what OP is asking or what the myriad of similar questions ask. But I suppose part of one's expertise is knowing that stuff like floating point arithmetic is just irrelevant to the OP's question, and so I apologize for any confusion there.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we are in a simulation, and the simulation used some limited precision arithmetic with a particular numerical base, then it is theoretically possible we might observe effects that depend on the base. Other people have answered that the mathematical properties of numbers do not depend on the base used to represent them, and that is true, but the numbers that we can represent and the accuracy of calculations do depend on the precision and base used to represent them. If a computed simulation used <strong>limited precision arithmetic</strong>, then there are numerical artifacts that depend on the base.</p>
<p>Suppose are are living in a simulation, and the simulation is implemented with a computer that uses floating-point formats like our own computers do. In the common 64-bit binary floating-point format, the unit of least precision is 2^-52 times the value of the largest bit in a number. E.g., if an object is at a location represented by 5 units of distance, the smallest possible move the simulation could represent would be a distance of 4•2^-52 units (4 because that is the highest bit in the binary representation of 5 and 2^-52 because of the width of available bits in the format).</p>
<p>Imagine our technology progresses to the point where we can see some of these quantum effects in experiments (by which I mean numerically quantum, not quantum mechanics quantum). We might see that a distance of 5 units can be altered by amounts of 4•2^(-52), a distance of (say) 11 units can be altered by amounts of 8•2^(-52), a distance of 23 units can be altered by amounts of 16•2^(-52). The binary nature of the floating-point representation is visible in the quanta: They appear in amounts that differ in ratios of powers of two. (We do not need any knowledge of the absolute magnitude or meaning of the units of distances. We just observe that the ratios of quanta are powers of two.)</p>
<p>If the implementation used a base-10 representation of floating-point, we would observe the ratios of quanta to be powers of ten.</p>
<p>So, if we are in a simulation, it is theoretically possible that the numerical base used to compute the simulation could have effects we might observe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The golden ratio is a beautiful mathematical <em>idea</em>, but it doesn't manifest in nature as much as is claimed in videos on youtube or books about the universality and even mystical significance of the ratio. It is 'pop' science, tenuously connected to a wide array of natural processes because people find that idea aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p><em>Mathematically</em>, the golden ratio is fascinating. It is the irrational number with the simplest continued fraction expansion...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and it is the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. </p>
<p>Fibonacci numbers <em>do</em> show up in science, in ((almost?) exclusively biological) natural processes, though this relationship also doesn't occur as much in nature as is often claimed. The number of spiral patterns in the arrangements of leaves around branches, petals around flowers, and scales around pine cones are often consecutive Fibonacci numbers - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotaxis" target="_blank">phyllotaxis</a> - and the higher those numbers get the closer the placement of elements around those spirals is related to the golden angle (the golden mean as applied to the circumference of a circle). This arrangement arises because it is the simplest and most efficient way to arrange petals (for example) such that they all get the maximum amount of sunlight with the least amount of work.</p>
<p>In a sense the golden ratio is a lot like a Platonic 'ideal' - the idea that circles (for example) are always just approximations of some ideal perfect circle, that the forms of everything we see in nature are imperfect shadows of pure ideal forms that we cannot perceive directly. In that sense the golden ratio is the ideal, perfect relationship that is approximated in natural forms by the Fibonacci numbers. This leads some people to assume that there must be something universally important about the golden ratio, in the way that ideal-but-inaccessible forms were considered important to ancient Greek philosophers. But such ideas are in the realm of philosophy, not physics.</p>
<p>tl,dr: the golden ratio is fascinating in mathematics as the eventual limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and as an organizing principle in some spiral biological processes. Claims that the golden ratio has some other significance or cosmic relevance might be interesting philosophically, but they have little to do with science.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Deep down in the genetic code of the seed is the simple genetic code that says &quot;have these cells build more of themselves.&quot; If you let all those cells grow, the ratio between old cells and new cells will usually be the golden ratio.</p>
<p>The golden ratio is so common in nature because it is the product of such a simple idea: the ratio between the first thing and the second thing is the same as the ratio between both those things and a third thing. It's what you always get when you tell cells or leaves or branches or scales to just &quot;grow more of yourself.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuropsychologist. Short answer is, many people do. </p>
<p>As has been noted in several posts, brain functions are in many ways &quot;geographically&quot; located. It is very common for Alzheimer's disease to first impact the left temporal lobe. In more &quot;classic&quot; presentations, the disease impacts two regions, the first being the medial temporal lobe where hippocampus is, a formation that plays a major role in memory functions. The second, moving outward (towards the ear) is a region of the temporal lobe very important for language functions. </p>
<p>In addition to memory difficulties, another classic first symptom of AD is language disturbance called anomia, or the inability to name objects.  In daily living this is observable when people have more &quot;tip of the tongue&quot; moments&quot; or circumlocution (talking around the name of the object). Example, when grandma asks for a pen, but cannot come up with &quot;pen&quot; --- &quot;Can you pass me that...you know that thing you write with....it has ink..&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some amount of compartmentalization / functional specialization in the brain so that different areas of the brain are more involved in certain functions than others. Different kinds of memory (such as semantic (memory of facts), procedural (memory for skills like walking or playing an instrument), and episodic (memory for events that happen to you)) are localized in different parts of the brain. Language (both understanding and production) are also localized separately. Alzheimer's does not seem to have as much of an effect on those as on episodic memory. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're suffocated by being locked in a small box, it's not actually the lack of oxygen which is the problem.</p>
<p>Normally the cycle is 20.9% oxygen, 0.04% CO2 in, then 16% oxygen 4% CO2 is exhaled.  </p>
<p>Inhaling 1% is very uncomfortable, &quot;stuffy&quot; air.  7%-10% CO2 is toxic and will lead to suffocation <em>even if there's sufficient oxygen</em>.   Excess CO2 will change blood pH and the body can't handle that.</p>
<p>So if you exhaled into a bag along with a tank of pure O2, well you could add the equivalent of +4% pure O2 on one side and vent out 4% of the volume of gas on the other side, but the CO2 mixed into the air so you don't remove the 4% CO2.  No, the new CO2 level after partial venting is 3.84%, still toxic.</p>
<p>So we're got 3 problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can't maintain breathable air by just adding O2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can't breathe pure O2 when diving either, O2 is toxic at the increased pressures experienced while diving.  We can't dilute it with CO2 either, it can ONLY be diluted with nitrogen or (rarely) with helium.</p>
</li>
<li>We don't want to waste any volume of air here other than the CO2, but we can't just vent CO2 selectively.  Not only would we waste the remaining 16% O2, but a larger volume of inert nitrogen too, and we don't want to carry a huge volume of nitrogen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Same's true for spacecraft.  Spacecraft can't tolerate high O2 either because it makes everything super-flammable.</p>
<p>What we have is a CO2 scrubber of lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide.  These adsorb ONLY CO2 from the air and form a carbonate, this does reduce the volume of air and and equivalent volume of O2 can be added.  The nitrogen (78% on Earth, varies in diving and space ships) is not consumed nor regenerated.  The CO2 is literally &quot;scrubbed&quot; out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a certified rebreather diver. I dive the Poseidon MKVI and 7.</p>
<p>The rebreather machine is basically a Nitrox mixing machine on my back. One of the small bottles is 100% O2. The other is regular air. On the surface it feeds me the pure O2. As I dive it blends more and more air into the system to keep the gas safe to breath. </p>
<p>The breathing system is a closed loop. Bubbles only exit the system when I use the gas for buoyancy purposes. The O2 will get used up by my body to survive so there is a sensor that automatically replaces the O2 as my body metabolizes it.</p>
<p>The CO2 my body produces is deadly so there is a chemical in the system that absorbs that CO2. That's called the scrubber. Mine is a prepackaged sodalime chemical that I can buy at any rebreather specific dive shop.</p>
<p>That's about it. Rebreathers are great. They are totally silent. Fish don't run away when they see you. They seem to think you are just another fish instead of a bubble spewing monster. One very small 2L tank of O2 can last me three - four hours of diving. If you dive with regular divers that ends up being an entire weekend of 2 tank diving. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans don't exhale solely waste gasses - in reality, there is still some oxygen in the gas mix that you breath out. Rebreathers function by allowing this gas to be recycled, adding appropriate amounts of oxygen from the tank to the recycled air, and by filtering out gasses such as CO2 (IIRC). I can't give you any exact numbers, but this is my understanding from reading the Wikipedia page a while back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<ul>
<li>breathing consume only a small part of the dioxygen in the inspired gasses, &quot;replacing&quot; it by CO2</li>
<li>So you still have O2 in the expired gasses, and it is mainly the CO2 which could become toxic when re-inspiring expired waste gasses.</li>
<li>Rebreather work by removing this CO2 from the expiring gasses, keeping them breathable</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the details are a lot more complicated than that (what is used for removing CO2, how to keep partial pressure of O2 high enough and so on), but the barebone principes are these.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>What they did instead was use a carbon paper and a roller machine to take an imprint of the front of the credit card with the numbers. This was commonly part of the receipt, and one copy would be torn off and given to the customer.</p>
<p>The problem with this, of course, is that now all these receipts you are just throwing away left and right have your whole card number on them. </p>
<p>This is where the extra numbers on the back to confirm an online(or at the time, over the phone) purchase can be used,  if you only had a receipt you found with the front of someone's card, you would not have all the numbers needed to complete a transaction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They're in a different spot than the main credit card number, so if you get a picture of the credit card you still can't use it because you don't have the security code.</p>
</li>
<li>On systems that save your credit card number, they are not supposed to save your security code, which means you need to type it in in order to place an order. That means that if someone else gets access to my computer or login, they can't order stuff for themselves because they don't have my security code. The same goes if the seller's system gets compromised, enabling hackers to access our credit card numbers - but they can't use them without the security code.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to /u/Dacke comment... Android Pay is actually way more secure because when it transmits a credit card, it actually transmits a one-time credit card generated just for this transaction, so stealing it is pointless.</p>
<p>As with any security system any time you have <em>static</em> or non-changing information it is considered easy to individually compromise. </p>
<p>The new chip in new credit cards in america means that you never actually transmit the credit card number to the payment system. Instead you transmit an identifier and a rolling code. The code is verified by the server to verify legitimacy. Since reading the code is pointless since it changes by algorithm every few seconds you have a much more foolproof system. So <em>at least</em> the card readers in every store are no longer attack-vectors for credit card theft. Previously you hack a credit card reader provider and you get <em>everything</em>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just three extra digits, it's a separate code that is used very differently.  The credit card number identifies the card, can be read by card readers from the magnetic strip, and is stored by merchants' systems that store your card information.  Or, if they use the old machines that make an imprint of the card, that number is on the imprint (which means the full credit card number is on the receipt).</p>
<p>The CVV code (the three extra digits) is just written - on the back of the card, with no raised plastic, so it won't appear in imprints and won't be as easy for people to see or photograph.  It is <em>not</em> stored when your card number is stored, and PCI (the standard in the US that companies that take credit card numbers are required to abide by) places more restrictions on where you can keep that number.  It can only be temporarily kept for use during a single transaction, and that's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a set of regulations that dictate the payment card industry called PCI.  if you want to do anything with payment cards you have to be PCI compliant.  One of the major things in PCI compliance is you cannot store the CVV (those digits).  You also cannot store the mag stripe data.</p>
<p>This makes it hard to copy a card from legitimate hardware.  It also allows companies to tell how you used your card.  Merchants are charged different rates for &quot;card present&quot; (you physically swiped your card) and &quot;card not present&quot; (you typed in your card number, like an online purchase).  There are other categories and large companies can negotiate rates.</p>
<p>The numbers are also present on the back of the card, which makes copying the numbers more difficult.  If I wanted to steal your credit card number with the CVV I'd have to see both sides of your card.  This means is most likely need physical possession of the card, I cannot sneak a picture.</p>
<p>When you combine these features it makes it more difficult to steal someone's card number.  It doesn't make it impossible but does out up enough barriers to stop a good amount of low-level thieves.  Furthermore the way the numbers are used with mandatory industry standards they serve a purchase for the men behind the curtains that run the show.</p>
<p>Lastly I've called the digits CVV but different companies and networks may have a different name for them.  They serve the same purpose though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's quite simple. Advertisers pay money to Google/Youtube for the rights to show an advertisement before (or during) a video. Google/Youtube takes a cut of the revenue, and the Youtuber earns the rest.</p>
<p>The amount advertisers are willing to pay in terms of cost per click or cost per view, is dependent on many factors, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The popularity of the Youtuber / video</li>
<li>The target audience of the Youtuber / video</li>
<li>How competitive (from an advertiser perspective) the video is (or its associated keywords are)</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain videos are not eligible for monetization (so Youtubers typically won't earn ad revenue from them). This includes, for example, many videos depicting nudity or sex and videos containing extremely foul language or controversial / offensive topics.</p>
<p>If a video contains commercial music, sometimes the music publisher or record label will file a copyright claim over the video and instead of taking it down will request the Youtuber's revenue share instead. So, in these cases, the Youtuber is not penalized but also does not earn ad revenue from the video.</p>
<p>Youtubers also make lots of money (much more than standard ad revenue) by negotiating product placement deals directly with advertisers to personally use and/or promote a product (such as a mobile app, web service, gadget, etc.) within their video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend is a popular YouTube creator (currently between 150k-250k subscribers). There are three core ways YouTubers make money. </p>
<p>(1.) YouTube AdSense: </p>
<ul>
<li>This is purely getting paid for views on videos, because there are ads on videos, such as display ads (the ads next to the video), overlay ads (ads that pop up at the bottom on the videos), and skippable and non-skippable video ads before the actual content. Depending on the time of the year, the amount a creator is making is roughly between $1 to $2 per 1,000 views. YouTube does this because they are getting a cut of the revenues that the advertiser is paying for on the videos. Some videos are not &quot;monetizable&quot;, so the creator will not earn anything for the views. This is generally because of offensive content within the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) Sponsored Content:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is advertising within the video itself. This form of advertising can occur in many different forms, but a few examples would include companies paying for their products to be featured in videos, merely having the products mentioned in a video, or saying something along the line of &quot;this video is brought to you by [XYZ Company].&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>(3.) Selling Branded Products:</p>
<ul>
<li>This one is pretty obvious. Selling t-shirts, stickers, hats, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>My girlfriend is only involved in (1.) &amp; (2.) at the moment, and she made ~$50k in 2016. Each community within YouTube is different, but in her sphere, the majority of earnings come from sponsored content with AdSense being a nice bonus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ad makers pay YouTube to put their ads on YouTube videos. YouTube keeps a portion of that money (around 30% I think) and then pays the youtuber based on how many views they get. For a non-partnered youtuber, it's about 10 views for 1 cent, 100 views for 10 cents, 1,000 views for $1, and $2,000 for 1 million views (these are all estimates, it varies a lot). I'm not sure how different it is for partnered YouTubers, but I think it depends more on who they're partnered with. It also depends on your viewer base, and more specifically, how many viewers have Adblock.
On videos over 10mins you can put extra ads, and therefor some extra money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the brain releasing neurotransmitters like oxytocin which is normally only released when we are in love or when we feel safe/protected or are caring for children. Allegedly animals we find cute (cats/dogs) were selected for their &quot;cuteness&quot; over centuries but what makes them cute turns out to be the ratio/proportion/distance of their eyes and face face shape, which is nearly that of human children. So, in essence only human children were originally meant to elicit that feeling but we have created/found other things that also stimulate that part of the brain and thus sort of tricks us into finding it attractive/urge to protect it from harm. Baby animals are also like this and there have been citations of adult animals caring for young  of other species probably also for similar reasons: their brains are sort of hardwired to instinctively care for &quot;cute things&quot; which babies of most species are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh good lord. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am a tea snob.</p>
<p>I'll start by saying there's nothing <em>inherently</em> wrong with using a microwave, <em>so long as you're only using it to get the water to the correct temperature</em>. </p>
<p>Tea is a lot more delicate than most people think. You do not -- I repeat, <strong>not</strong> use boiling water for tea, and you never, <em>ever</em> boil the tea in the water! </p>
<p>You need very specific temperatures, and very specific steeping times for different kinds of tea. For example, green tea needs to be steeped for 1-2 minutes in water that is 80 degrees C (175F). That too is generalised - some green teas must only be steeped for 30 seconds! </p>
<p>Steeping the tea for too long will make it bitter. Same with the temperature being too high or too low! That's why people keep dumping sugar and milk in tea. If you make tea correctly, <em>you don't need to add anything to it</em> to make it delicious. </p>
<p>Now if you're using some, shall we say, non-delicate tea, like the kind that comes in tea bags, then it's not a big deal since that's not going to be delicious anyway. And there are more resilient teas that can handle a wider range (in fact, there are some Display Teas that are designed to have hot water added to them for an entire night). </p>
<p>As a sidenote: the people across the pond are in a glass house about tea. They know <em>nothing</em> about brewing. Unless &quot;the pond&quot; is the pacific ocean and you're going to China, and also 200+ years back in time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves don't heat evenly, and hence there are several possible results, none perfect: cold spots in the water, superheated water that boils vigorously on contact with the tea, or water that's been heated long enough in the microwave to come to a rolling boil, at which point there's a good chance that the oxygen has been boiled out.  All of these can affect the flavor of the tea.</p>
<p>Most people who are into tea agree that most black teas should be seeped with water at 212°F(100°C).  A tea kettle or hot pot, whether electric or stovetop, heats from the bottom, creating convection currents that stir the water, allowing the temperature to be uniform. Plus it's easier to know exactly when the water reaches the desired temperature. <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/06/04/microwaving_water_for_tea_why_are_the_results_so_lousy.html" target="_blank">Partial source</a></p>
<p>At the risk of being a tea snob, if you're adding a tea bag to a cup into which you've poured hot water, you're already compounding the problem. The water will cool off from the cup, so when you add the bag, you're dealing with water that's already colder than it should be. Whenever I use bagged tea (mostly just herbals), I always put the bag in first and then pour the water onto it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different teas need to be brewed at different temperatures and for different lengths of time to get their proper flavor.</p>
<p>Black teas for example are usually steeped at higher temperatures (200-212F) for longer periods of time, whereas a white/green tea that is more delicate is generally steeped at 150-180F.</p>
<p>Different teas have different chemical makeups which greatly affect the flavor of the tea, and how long and hot it can be brewed at before it gets bitter and ruins the taste. Brew your jasmine needle at 212F and you're gonna burn the hell out of it, making it bitter and disgusting.</p>
<p>Many pre-packages teas that you would buy from the store (Lipton, store brands etc.) are very fine, sometimes powdery, and generally just low quality tea. The finer the particles are, the more surface area the water hits, and hence the faster the tannins and other flavors infuse into the water.</p>
<p>The proper way to get the best quality tea in terms of flavor would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use loose leaf teas (the higher the quality, the better the taste)</li>
<li>brew the tea at the proper temperature and length</li>
<li>use freshly brewed water, do not re-heat previously brewed water</li>
<li>use the highest quality water available to you (contaminants in the water can affect the taste)</li>
<li>store your tea in an air-tight storage container, away from other materials that may have a strong aroma (spices for example)</li>
<li>store your tea in a dark area (generally keeping it in a metal tin would do)</li>
</ul>
<p>Like /u/sterlingphoenix said, you want to avoid using boiling water, generally 205-210F at the hottest. If you are using a high quality loose leaf tea, and using water that isn't riddled with hard minerals, you should have a great tasting tea without any sweeteners.</p>
<p>You can of course add sugar, honey, etc. but depending on what kind of sweetener you use, this will greatly affect the flavor of the tea, and in most cases, will hide the true taste of the tea. Good tea does not need to be sweetened, and it's healthier to avoid sweeteners anyhow.</p>
<p>I HIGHLY suggest checking out Adagio Tea (www.adagio.com).</p>
<p>They have a large variety of high quality tea available at an affordable price, plus they don't charge shipping over certain amounts. They also have a rewards programs, clubs (subscriptions) and more. They do a lot of free samples, and limited time tea variants etc. Been buying from them for years now and I am very happy with their prices and quality. The shipping is quick too.</p>
<p>The reality is that there IS a proper way to get the BEST flavor out of the tea. If you are drinking tea to just have something hot to drink, that's fine, but you're really not getting the proper tea. It's kind of like playing your Skyrim on an Xbox instead of a PC :^)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here with the alternative answer as many others have given you your expected answer.</p>
<p>I'm going to assume you have, without an aircraft or other pressurised container to protect you, somehow accelerated to a speed above 761mph, the speed of sound at sea level (Assuming 20°C or 68°F ambient temperature). Let's call it 800mph.</p>
<p>Long before you even got anywhere near the 800mph mark, you would be dead. The faster you accelerated to the 800mph mark, the quicker you die, but die you would. Screaming would not happen. The how will vary greatly depending on the speed of your acceleration but many of the principles will be the same.</p>
<p>The first thing to kill you is debatable and again, dependant on your speed of acceleration but at a moderately slow acceleration in my opinion the first thing to send you off this mortal coil would be breathing resistance. As you accelerated somewhere beyond the 400mph mark, the air pressure forcing against you would be too great for you to intake and expel air out of your lungs, even by turning your head away against the wind. You could wear a helmet of some kind to prevent this but then the air around your mouth is moving with you and thus breaks the rule of the question.</p>
<p>But turning your head at this point in time is kind of moot. Because you wouldn't be able to. As you go faster and faster through earths atmosphere, you begin to bump up against air, because even though you can't see it, air has mass. The faster you go, the faster you bump up against it and eventually the air in front of you can't get out of your way fast enough. So the air starts to feel a lot more solid as it compresses. At 600mph it's pretty hard indeed. Too hard.</p>
<p>Although there are many people who have ejected from fighter aircraft at speeds in this range and even higher, many of them suffer from horrendous injuries and most pilots will attempt to eject in a way that minimises their forward velocity if they are able to. <a href="https://theaviationist.com/2015/03/17/sr-71-mid-air-disintegration/" target="_blank">The fastest ejection ever to succeed took place at three times the speed of sound but the pilot had many aids to ensure it was possible</a>. Most jet jockeys of slower aircraft don't have what he had. </p>
<p>However even when they do eject, the air resistance slows the ejected pilot down pretty quick. But your not slowing down, your still accelerating to our magic 800mph. Bumping against that air faster and faster, the air cannot get out of the way any more so it does what a gas does when it can't move. It compresses. That makes it harder. And as it gets harder, it begins to get harder for whatever is compressing it to move through it. In this case we will assume your flying like superman, so it's your head on the firing line. It will be subject to around 3g of force (Three times the force of gravity). This doesn't sound like much but it's a constant force. This isn't a huge problem unless you move your head even just the tiniest little bit, in which case your neck snaps like a twig as you pass somewhere around the 650mph mark from the air resistance, which is too great for a human spine to endure (If your accelerating really fast, this will likely kill you first).</p>
<p>Except you might not feel it because you might have cooked to death a few seconds before, and if you haven't then it won't be long before you will. Because when you begin to go so fast that air can't get out of your way fast enough, the side effect of it compressing is that it begins to heat up and it gets hotter the faster you go and the more it gets compressed. This is the same reason that spacecraft return modules and the shuttle will heat up to extremely hot temperatures as they return to earth, and why most comets and asteroids burn up in earths atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now your not going anywhere near as fast as most spacecraft are when they re-enter earths atmosphere, but at 800mph the temperature is still going to be hot enough to kill a human. Aircraft use special composites and design techniques to bleed the heat off but at 800mph it's not too hot for an airframe to handle. It's definitely too hot for a human though. It's tough to give an exact temperature as it would depend on a huge range of factors but it would be somewhere between 200°F or around 93°C if not hotter. You would only survive a sustained few moments of that at most.</p>
<p>How fast all this happens depends on how fast you accelerate but there's no doubt at 800mph your screaming days are over. If there was any screaming to be done, you did it involuntarily long before you broke the sound barrier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a pressurised compartment or spacesuit or something, the air between your mouth and ears isn't moving relative to you, so things are normal. If the air is moving past you faster than the speed of sound, (either you or the air can be moving) the sound from your mouth may not be able to travel through the air to your ears.<br />
You might still hear something due to sound waves propagating through your bones, but it's more likely that you'd not because the air around your head would be pressurised by ram pressure and probably deafen you.
This reasoning may well be invalid because air behaves differently when it is hitting your face at hundreds of metres per second to when it is unimpeded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The long answer is:</p>
<p>If you traveling faster than speed of sound, at first, you will have the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhlxH9XDW_A" target="_blank">bow-shock wave</a> in front of you. Second if you scream, the sound wave (which is the small perturbation) will propagate only inside <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/machang.html" target="_blank">Mach cone</a>, where the cone slope depends on your velocity and equals to sin(alpha) = c/v, where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of sound and &quot;v&quot; your velocity.
