		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brain isn't &quot;doing&quot; anything in that sense besides sending and receiving neural signals. Let's take the bending of your arm for example. An overly simplified explanation of how that works is the brain fires a signal down the nerve that is connected to the muscle. At the nerve-muscle connection, various processes occur that cause the muscle to contract and raise your arm (depolarization of cellular membranes, release of calcium ions from the the sarcoplasmic reticulum, attachment of myosin to actin, etc.). All your brain had to do though is fire a signal. It doesn't need to know or understand the steps that happen downstream. </p>
<p>An analogy would be to turning on a television. You control the power for the television. When you want to turn it on, you press the power button. Does the fact that you push the power button mean you intrinsically know exactly how the TV is turning on? Just because you know &quot;to turn the TV on I push this button&quot; doesn't mean you understand all of the computers, wires, and electrical signals that actually cause the TV to turn on.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The map is able to represent roads and mountains fairly accurately, and you know how to use the map to get somewhere, but the map doesn't tell you what mountains are made of or how roads are made, or what these actually look like in reality - it's just a tool you can use to navigate.
Similarly, your brain doesn't represent true reality, it just takes a select few stimuli and creates a map of the world that you experience as consciousness and it allows you to move limbs and think so that you can survive. There is no need for the brain to inherently understand what an atom is or how muscle contraction works in order to survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're missing is the difference between automatic and voluntary processes. You don't consciously tell your heart to beat or your eyes to focus or your stomach to digest food. All of that happens adjacent to human consciousness. If you do force your body to act outside of its normal happy place, it simply cuts you out of the equation. Hold your breath or otherwise screw up your breathing on purpose, and you will just pass out while normal automatic processes take over. In a sense, we are piloting a plane on autopilot, not moving every single part needed to maintain safe flight. We might tell the flight computer where we want to go, but we don't make the adjustments it takes to change course.</p>
<p>We are our brains. We are every automatic process that makes up alive. But how we know what we are is as much philosophical as it is scientific.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Humans are pretty much like children driving cars: They test the pedals and turn the steering wheel a bit and see what happens; after a bit of experimentation any 6 year old can drive. If they put in fuel and drive, out come exhaust gases; if something hits the car something breaks, if something breaks it doesn't work anymore... That doesn't mean kids know how the car works specifically! and they don't need to to be able to drive.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, our brain does &quot;know&quot; how our bodies work, its just that we aren't consciously aware of that knowledge at all times. The brain is not a monolith, there are different regions of the brain which engage in different functions. The parts of the brain which control bodily functions are predominantly the lower brain, which is no more advanced than the neural networks we see in primitive creatures like worms and crabs. It simply does not operate on a conscious level and is automatic and reflexive in nature. Most higher order thinking occurs in the upper regions of the brain, which operates in a much different manner than the lower brain. </p>
<p>Think of it this way, say the regions of the brain each have their own language. The lower brain deals with an entirely different subject matter than the upper brain and speaks an entirely different language. The signals being sent out by the lower brain are so different from the ones in the upper brain that the upper brain is unable to &quot;translate&quot; them to a form in which it could be fully conscious of.  And the upper brain is unable to send signals to the lower brain which would fully translate in a way to significantly alter their function. They just operate differently. That is why your body doesn't shut down if you pass out or fall asleep. </p>
<p>And if you want another explanation, the lower brain really doesn't &quot;know&quot; all of what it does. It is mostly automatic, kind of like when a moth is attracted to light. It is something which is beyond its own control, a reflex that occurs naturally. It is simply wired differently from the other parts of your brain which control consciousness. It's the same reason why your toaster can't play video games on it and why your smart phone can't heat up pop tarts. Even though they are both machines, they are wired in entirely different ways and perform entirely different functions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In most cases bleeding can be managed with administration of fluids, blood transfusions and correction of any underlying coagulopathy. However, some organs can bleed profusely if injured. If the spleen and its capsule are ruptured we do a splenectomy. If a lobe of the liver is lacerated we do a hepatic lobectomy. If a major vessel (aorta or vena cava) is bleeding we do an exploratory laparotomy and ligate/suture the bleed. If a non-vital organ like the urterus is bleeding they can also do embolization. This is where they go in with a catheter and artificially induce a clot upstream from the bleed. It leads to necrosis of the tissue and isn't ideal, but it can save the patient from bleeding to death. Surgery and other invasive procedures are not without risk, and at the end of the day it's a risk/benefit calculation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From being in the OR I can tell you that a Exploratory Laparotomy is what they start off with and then will go in and suture what they can to control bleeding. They also use staples that are non toxic and are designed to have tissue grow over them. Sometimes if bowl is affected by the penetrating injury then they follow all 20+ feet of it, called running the bowel, cut what is torn (messed up jagged edges;hard to line up for healing) so they cut the part that is affected then bring them side by side like so (II) then they staple them together so it looks like PI then the cut a hole at the bottom section to rest a new opening and then they suture it. Sometimes if the bleeding can not be controlled but the patient is stable then they irrigate the abdomen and will pack it with gauze at the bleeding site waiting for a clot to form. Then a big plastic film is placed on the opening (kind of like Saran Wrap but it's sterile) and the patient is taken to the ICU. There he will stay until its stable enough to bring the patient back in to the OR to go back in and hope the clot formed and they can close him (by close I mean bring his chest/abdomen cavity together). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to assume you are talking about something like school workstations or business/office laptops. </p>
<p>While true that there is a factor to defending against brute force attacks. These computers also tend to be part of a network where a single server has all the username and password stored. When you login, it will connect to the network and check with this server if your password is valid. Once confirms that it is a match, it stores this password temporarily on your computer. Now you're able to use the computer.</p>
<p>So the next time you login with the <strong>correct password</strong>, it doesn't connect to the network, it just quickly checks if it matches the locally stored copy of the password. If it matches, you're good to use the computer. Because the speed it takes to check for a match on the computer is essentially processing speed, it feels almost instant.</p>
<p>Now, lets say you type in the <strong>wrong password</strong>, what happens next? Well, it <em>still</em> checks with the locally stored copy, except this time, it <strong>doesn't match</strong>. So, since it doesn't match, <strong>one of two things must be true</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your password is truly wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>Your password is actually correct, but the temporary copy stored on the computer is not up to date since the last time it connected.</li>
</ol>
<p>So it connects to the network server and checks. This extra step is what most people associate with the wrong password taking much longer, and especially exaggerated when the quality of the connection is slow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a different scenario than the ones listed in other comments. This scenario applies to very poorly coded applications with poorly set up databases. </p>
<p>For username/password pairs stored in databases, a common (although inefficient) way to check for correct username/password is to send a query to the database like this: &quot;get me the record where username is 'x' AND password is 'y'&quot;. (For those familiar with SQL: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?) The database first searches for usernames that match 'x' until one is found, then checks if the password for that record is equal to 'y'. The problem is that if the username matches, but password doesn't, it will continue looking for another username/password combo that does match, until it runs out of records in the database. For databases with TONS of records, this takes a long time.</p>
<p>To cover my ass on this comment, let me reiterate that this situation applies to poorly coded applications and poor database configurations, but lets face it, there are a TON of those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This effect is achieved by spraying drops of water onto the ice that freeze into little bumps. The pebbled surface actually decreases friction for the stone because there is a smaller area of contact between the stone and the ice. The sweeping comes into play as the stone is traveling down the ice. Sweeping the ice in front to the stone briefly and slightly raises the temperature of the ice, which further lowers the friction. More sweeping means the the stone will travel further and curl less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are two possibilities : </p>
<p>1) The universe is infinite</p>
<p>2) The universe is finite, but has no boundary. The universe would be looping on itself, and when you travel to one edge you just end up on the other side. This is the 3D equivalent of a pac-man world, in which when you cross the boundary on one side you're back on the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others point out, the universe probably doesn't have a definite boundary, and even if it did it is outside the observable universe. However, that shouldn't prevent us from imagining what such a boundary could look like.</p>
<p>From a General Relativity perspective, there are several ways of designing a universe with a a definite boundary. The simplest one is probably the reflecting boundary condition. Here is a toy metric with that property:</p>
<p>ds^2 = -Heaviside(x)^(-1) dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2</p>
<p>This metric has an infinitely tall gravitational potential for x&lt;0 (Heaviside(x) is the Heaviside step function, which is 0 for x&lt;0 and 1 for x&gt;0. I'm using it here because I assume you want a hard edge rather than a fuzzy edge), making it impossible for anything to move past it. All matter and radiation would be reflected, so it would look like a perfect mirror. Flying into it with your spaceship would be like flying into a copy of yourself coming from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>(It might be tempting to use the metrix ds^2 = -dt^2 + Heaviside(x) dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^(2), since that looks like a metric where the x coordinate becomes meaningless for x&lt;0. But this doesn't actually work - it's just an extreme unit change for x&lt;0).</p>
<p>More complicated behavior is also possible. For example, space could become 1-dimensional:</p>
<p>ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2 + Heaviside(x)(dy^(2)+dz^(2))</p>
<p>or fray into a web of rolled-up dimensions, or whatever.</p>
<p>However, all of this falls into the domain of &quot;metric engineering&quot;. I'm just writing down these metrics without any accompanying explanation for how they would arise, or whether they would be stable, etc.. I'm not aware of any reasonable theory that predicts a hard edge to the universe like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe as a whole (ie well beyond the <em>observable</em> universe) most likely has no boundary. It is either just infinite and open, continuing forever, or finite but closed, like a torus.  So there's no real way to talk about the edge of the universe because it isn't a prediction of any sophisticated cosmological models.</p>
<p>However, there is a related question I think is more meaningful: if inflation is correct then inflation is most likely eternal.  This means the universe consists of an expanse of still inflating regions, dotted by tiny pocket/bubble universes where inflation has stopped, with new bubbles constantly forming.  Our observable universe is just a subregion of one such bubble.  </p>
<p>These bubbles, as far as I understand it, are finite, and therefore have boundaries.  So I think it is meaningful to ask what the conditions are like at the edge of our bubble.  Even though we can never access this region of spacetime, such a place does exist (unlike a boundary for the <em>total</em> universe).  However, I don't know the answer to this.  But whenever your question comes up, the answer is always to correctly reject the premise of a boundary for the total universe, and not mention this parallel question with respect to our local bubble universe.</p>
<p>To some extent, I think the answer is unclear because there is also an idea in eternal inflation that various constants in physics (eg particle masses and symmetries, Higgs vev) are restricted to bubbles, and vary from bubble to bubble.  So possibly the edge of our bubble would be a place where our normal physics just stops working.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start, making a reply to this question within the rules of &quot;AskScience&quot; is practically improbable.  The question is setting an environmental variable that is in its own nature &quot;speculative&quot;.  The answer would fall into the category of speculation because we have to define what the boundary is.  We can only speculate on what the boundary is, because we don't know for a fact what the boundary is.  As such, this question should be a discussion.</p>
<p>In order for the human eye to see something, there must be energy particles radiating from this boundary that are inside the human eye's visibility range.  Otherwise, there must be energy particles radiating that an instrument can detect and report said anomaly.</p>
<p>If the boundary is an endless void, it really is not a boundary, and matter or energy can move beyond it and back.  This is basically an observed boundary because nothing exists beyond this point.  Anything that leaves beyond this point has no means to return, as there is nothing to act upon to have an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>If the boundary acts like the context of a blackhole where anything that passes beyond will never return, then there is nothing to radiate light and nothing to bounce radiated light from.  Therefore, it will appear as an endless void, and anything that passes into it will disappear, forever.  This is a special applied case of the endless void, except the boundary actually exists in nature.</p>
<p>If the boundary does not allow anything to pass beyond it, never lost to an endless void or blackhole condition, then anything hitting that boundary should bounce off of it, perfectly.  As such, it should appear like a perfect mirror.  If this boundary does not perfectly reflect everything, then that means matter or energy can be destroyed.  Otherwise, it is a wall that could be broken through, and therefore no longer qualifies as a boundary to the universe.</p>
<p>Alternatively if the boundary does not reflect everything that hits it perfectly, there is a special unknown anomaly that can create a visible wall on some spectrum where whatever hits it is converted from one arrangement of matter or energy into another energy, and yet all energy and matter hitting this barrier must be released elsewhere along the barrier.  Under this condition, I have no idea what such a boundary would look like unless I know how the energy and matter return from it.</p>
<p>For the last consideration of a possible boundary, I must set this example with navigating the surface of Earth.  If I move in one direction, I will never reach an &quot;end&quot; to the Earth because the surface wraps around a sphere, but the surface of this sphere has a finite area.  Due to that finite area, we can draw the surface like a map, setting &quot;boundaries&quot; where moving beyond one boundary wraps you around to the other side of the map, or basically the map repeats itself beyond that &quot;boundary&quot;.  Consider this boundary in the universe, you would continue to see the universe, as the universe would continue infinitely but has a finite volume of space that can be mapped and such imaginary boundaries set for where the map repeats itself.</p>
<p>Another note, nothing can radiate from beyond this boundary because nothing else exists beyond the boundary, except for the case where space has finite volume but repeats itself in every direction.</p>
<p>Multiple edits, because I keep forgetting something...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really a question that science can answer. You're basically asking &quot;if things weren't as they are, how would they be?&quot;. It'd be like saying &quot;if 1 + 1 didn't equal 2, what would it equal?&quot;. They're nonsensical questions that could have any completely arbitrary answer.</p>
<p>There's no indication of any sort of boundary at the &quot;edge&quot; of the universe. Our best guess is that it either goes on forever, or it loops back on itself (possibly in some complex geometry). If it didn't go on forever, and also didn't loop back on itself? Well, then it's anybody's guess what the edge would look like. But that's just it - any idea would be a wild guess without any evidence backing it. One thing we know for sure is that the universe <em>is</em> larger than the observable portion of the universe, so even if there were some sort of edge we're never going to be able to see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple of different answers to this. This is a bit long, but it should help. It mostly has to do with avoiding predators and not being eaten. Consider the Rabbit - their movements are either big and strong, fast hops and leaps. Or when are still, only their faces, where their sense organs are, tend to move around quickly, to scan the area and make sure that nothing of danger is around them. </p>
<p>As to why some motions are larger and stronger than others, you have to go into a bit of muscle biology, a bit advanced for a 5 year old...</p>
<p>Animal muscle fibers are catagorized in two types - Red and White Muscle Fibers. These types are based off of the amount of Glycogen (White) and Myoglobin (Red) that is found in the individual muscle cells. These fibers coexist in all musculature, in humans and animals.</p>
<p>Red Fibers, those higher in Myo, can carry more O2 to the cells, and are built for long, steady action. Thighs, Legs, Glutes - weight supporting muscles White fibers are higher in Glycogen, a sugar molecule, which gives quick bursts of energy when used, but doesn't have the same overall energy carrying potential that HgB heavy cells would. Muscles more responsible for quick movements than supporting weight</p>
<p>This is why Chickens have White and Dark meat. The dark is the Thigh, carrying the whole weight of the bird. Take a biopsy of it and you would expect to see a higher concentration of Red fibers. the white is the Wing; doesn't really do too much except the occasional flap, it will have a lower % of Red fibers, and more White fibers. But no tissue is 100% of either. </p>
<p>So, now that we have addressed these 2 fibers, we can actually answer the question.</p>
<p>&quot;Small Animals&quot; say, a Rabbit  is going to have greater concentrations of those White Fibers in some muscles, and Red's in others.  The hind legs of a rabbit are going to have  more Red fiber, while its facial and frontal muscles would be more of the White type - fast reacting, short spastic movements</p>
<p>So, these animals move by launching with these strong Red Fibers, giving off massive shots of energy to move as far as possible in one motion.</p>
<p>Other movements, like twitching, sniffing, anything else cute that little bunny rabbits do - those are all based off of the White Fibers. They move in quick little twitchy - in fact, their other name is <strong>Fast Twitch</strong> fibers (the Red fibers are <strong>Slow Twitch</strong>). They can move around without expending too much energy. But if a rabbit has to escape a wolf or a hawk? it just has to get from point A to point B as fast as possible, in one single motion, to avoid being eaten. But do it for 20+ minutes and it'd be exhausted. Different types of movement </p>
<p>Have you ever shivered in the cold? Your body is putting itself into a Fast-twitch Overdrive to burn as much energy as possible and keep its temperature elevated. Little furry animals do the same. Quick movements to heat up the body, based off the rapid firing of White Fibers. Now, throw in things like Sight and Smell to avoid predators, instinctively being afraid of larger animals, you can see put together the puzzle of why these animals would move around the way they do. </p>
<p>SO! And finally, here's the answer to the question. Small animals are twitchy, because;</p>
<p>It takes more energy for them to move (a rabbit hopping vs a large dog casually walking), so they tend to save </p>
<p>The  way rodents and other small mammals twitch their noses around, or seem to focus from point to point with ninja-like concentration but ADHD-like speed, is because those movements are controlled by muscles that are predominantly White fibers. Or in some cases, to conserve or produce heat, the way we shiver, or how we blink to produce tears. While the larger motions, such as moving legs, would be done by muscles with a higher concentration of Red fibers. </p>
<p>They just don't have the dexterity for fine movements, so to us, they seem twitchy and spastic, like a dog scratching itself</p>
<p>I understand that this is ELI'ing a little more than 5 years old, tried to put it as simple as possible, if you have any more questions feel free to ask</p>
<p>Here are a couple of sources that will give you some more info on Red v White Fibers</p>

<p>Edit: Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold&quot;</p>
<p>other users have been mentioning Mass / Force, and they are correct; the muscles of some small animals don't have to be as strong and delicate as those of larger animals -&gt; consider a cow's legs vs those of a gerbil. One is going to be a lot more Red than the other, simply because it needs 1000's of times more energy (O2) than the smaller animal's related muscles would.</p>
<p>And, a very common question; Humans have both of these fibers in all of our muscles as well. Your glutes would have a different composition of red and white than your pecs would, as would your triceps from your palmar muscles. Lebron's calves would have a different makeup of the two fibers than Messi's, or Bolt's. The exact makeups are not exact and are subject to change in every individual</p>
<p>as for the user who asked why I Capitalize every Other word? Because I can't gesticulate over the internet and that's how I add emphasis in my text. Eat it :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party, but the muscle fiber answer is not all that relevant. I don't study this specifically, but have done some work on animal locomotion and sensing. </p>
<p>So... if small things don't move in quick, twitchy movements because for some random reason small things have white muscle fibers (this isn't true in all cases, and even if it were it wouldn't be the <em>reason</em> they have that)... <em>why</em> do small things move fast and then stop?</p>
<p>There are a lot of parts that go into it, but I think they mostly boil down to three basic reasons:<br />
1) It's easier for them to move fast<br />
2) Moving fast is still hard<br />
3) They need to know what's going on around them</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small things have much less mass relative to the amount of force they can generate, and can do things much faster because of it. This is the same reason that ants can lift big things. Muscles generate force based on the cross-section of the muscle (area, r^2 ), while inertia changes with the volume (r^3 ). That means bigger is, all else being equal, slower. If you are interested in how scaling affects living things, I highly recommend Haldane's essay <a href="http://www.physlink.com/education/essay_haldane.cfm" target="_blank">&quot;On Being the Right Size&quot;</a>. It's a great read, and still basically accurate even though it was written in 1928. We've known about some of this stuff for a <em>long</em> time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It costs more energy to run at a high step frequency (how many steps you take per second) than to run at a low step frequency, even after you take size into account! This sucks for small things that have to take many steps to cover distance quickly. Mouse muscle, for example, uses 6 times as much energy per gram as horse muscle when they are both running. <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/138/1/301.short" target="_blank">Here is a paper about it!</a> So you can take steps fast, but they cost energy. </p>
</li>
<li>Okay, but how do you control your movement while you do this? Small things see at about the same speed as fast things: it takes ~1/10th of a second to perceive a change, or about 100 milliseconds, almost no matter your size (a few animals are a little faster, like 70-80ms if I'm remembering right, but same ballpark). This means, among other things, that when you're jouncing around taking many steps every second, it is much harder to compensate for the movement of your eye. A mouse takes nearly 10 strides per second at full speed (same paper I linked earlier); that means that each stride takes barely over 100 milliseconds! It is very difficult to figure out what you need to do on the next stride before you take it at this scale, especially with your eyeballs bouncing around very fast. You are mostly relying on faster senses for this, but vision gives you much better long-distance information. So, if you want to move effectively, you want to know where you're going. What's the best way to do this with the slow visual system? Stop running around and take a look! (Weirdly, because hearing is faster but sound takes time to travel, it looks like bat echolocation works on about the same time scale.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Basically, if you are small, there are several things you want. One, you want to get where you're going, and you can move very quickly for your size! Two, you want to not use up all your energy at once, and that's hard when you take a lot of steps fast! Three, you want to stop and figure out what's going on around you occasionally! </p>
<p>So what's the solution? You can take a lot of steps very quickly, then stop and breathe and look, then take a lot of steps very quickly. This also is probably good for avoiding predators, as some other posters have mentioned. It also probably means you're going to want to use a little more fast-twitch muscle, as the current top post mentioned. And seriously, every person who has worked with small animals will be able to tell you that they actually do this, even on treadmills! That paper I mentioned above looks at running at difference sizes, and has this to say about small animals: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It proved very difficult to obtain data from small animals walking at a constant average speed on the treadmill. The mice, chipmunks and white rats normally maintained slow average speeds by running to the front of the treadmill, stopping, and riding to the back. The animals sustained these oscillations for long periods without utilizing a steady speed walk.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/138/1/301.short" target="_blank">&quot;Speed, stride frequency and energy cost per stride: how do they change with body size and gait?&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really is inherent to how small animals move; they <em>love</em> to go fast then stop, then go fast then stop, and even when you really, REALLY try to get them to do something else, they won't do it! It's not just fear, either: people have tried a <em>lot</em> of ways to get them to run at a constant speed. They are built for this!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because small animals can have much stronger bones and muscles proportional to their mass, compared to larger species.</p>
<p>This is related to something called square-cube law. If the size of something is changed by a factor of k, its surface area is squared (k^2) and its volume is cubed (k^3). As an example, if something is doubled in size (retaining its proportions), its surface area is increased by a factor of four, and volume by a factor of eight.</p>
<p>The strength of bones and muscles is, roughly speaking, defined by their cross-sectional area. In essence, if a bone or muscle grows twice as thick, its strength is quadrupled, but at the same time the mass of the animal is multiplied by eight, so in actuality the bone and muscles have become weaker relative to the mass of the animal.</p>
<p>This means that, not only are the bones of small animals typically much stronger than those of large animals - which allows animals like mice, rats, squirrels, monkeys, or small children for that matter to survive falls and impacts that would be easily fatal to a large animal or a grown human - their muscles are also proportionally stronger for their mass. That means they can produce higher acceleration, either as movement of limbs or head, as part of their locomotion.</p>
<p>To use a bigger scale factor, if you have a small animal and another similar animal, but eight times as big, the large animal is 64 times as strong but 512 times as heavy. That means, if the small animal can achieve jump acceleration of 20g, the large animal can only muster about 2.5g jump acceleration.</p>
<p>And, because they <em>can</em> jump and move with higher accelerations, why shouldn't they?</p>
<p>This propensity for quickness is also compounded by the fact that since these animals <em>can</em> move in this fast, twitchy fashion, they also benefit more from fast muscle fibres, which makes them capable of even more twitchy hoppy movements. Though in actuality, they might lose some muscle mass if they don't actually need to jump at 20g accelerations as a survival factor - if they can afford to lose some muscle mass, it may be beneficial to do so since maintaining muscle tissue can require a lot of energy, and being very small animals, they can still move quite rapidly even with proportionally less muscle.</p>
<p>And, by comparison, larger animals often need to have stronger bones, different bone structure, and more muscle mass in order to be capable of walking, moving, and obtaining enough food to maintain those bigger muscles. Thus, size is one of the more interesting variables in terms of evolution - both big and small sizes have several advantages and disadvantages. Small size usually means fast breeding cycle which means the species evolves fast and rapidly bounces back from population depletion. Large size means the animal is less vulnerable to predators and can have access to foods that smaller animals literally can't crack, but as a downside it takes a long time for a specimen to mature, taking care of the young becomes a major resource drain, and population upsets have a far more severe long term effects because the population can't replenish as fast as smaller species can.</p>
<p>As a funny anecdote, when the developers of Kerbal Space Program were designing the Kerbals and animations for these little green menaces, they found that their initially specified size for them made their animations look unnaturally twitchy and fast, and they had to enlarge them a little bit to make them more relatable and to get the animations to look good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because their eyes are on the sides of the head, they're unable to use the fact that one eye sees the same scene slightly different from the other as we do, something known as parallax. In order to compensate for this, they examine a scene, then move their head quickly to get another perspective. Their brain is able to use the two images to give a rough estimate of depth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://500womenscientists.org/" target="_blank">500 Women Scientists</a> is a grassroots organization started by four women who met in graduate school at CU Boulder and who maintained friendships and collaborations after jobs and life took them away from Boulder. Immediately following the November 2016 election, we published an open letter re-affirming our commitment to speak up for science and for women, minorities, immigrants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA. Over 17,000 women from more than 100 countries have signed in support of 500 Women Scientists, pledging to build an inclusive scientific community dedicated to training a more diverse group of future leaders in science and to use the language of science to bridge divides and enhance global diplomacy.</p>
<p>500 Women Scientists works to build communities and foster real change that comes from <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-successful-movements-have-in-common" target="_blank">small groups, not large crowds</a>. Our <a href="https://500womenscientists.org/take-action/#pods" target="_blank">Local Pods</a> help create those deep roots through strong, personal relationships. Local Pods are where women scientists meet regularly, develop a support network, make strategic plans, and take action. Pods focus on issues that resonate in their communities, rooted in our mission and values.</p>
<p>With us today are six members of the group. They will be answering questions at different points throughout the day so please be patient with receiving answers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I've got a question for Dr. Ritterbush. I've always wondered, since humans haven't explored more than 5% of the ocean (That's what most reports say so I have assumed this to be accurate), the Marine creatures we've assumed to be extinct might have adapted to live in the unexplored regions, and there might be some which the world has never seen. What are the chances of creatures we presume to be extinct to have adapted and survived in different conditions which we haven't explored yet? Is it not possible for Marine creatures to be trapped under polar ice blankets, still have a chance at survival?(My knowledge of this comes off an article I read about Japanese researchers who managed to revive microscopic creatures after having frozen them for 30 years). Have you personally​ encountered any such species which was deemed extinct but was rediscovered whilst exploring new regions (or species which have been frozen for millenia) in your years of research? If so, what species were they?</p>
<p>P.S.- I haven't studied biology much(I will be taking up physics) so please forgive me if any of the my questions seem obnoxious to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully someone will expand on this in greater detail because I'm on the toilet at work on mobile right now, but here goes. </p>
<p>IIRC German engineering grew into the powerhouse that it is today, following their defeat in WWII. One of the provisions within the Morgenthau &amp; Marshall Plans (basically a plan giving Germany the finger for being huge DB's during WWII, while trying to make sure they wouldn't ever be able to go for round III) was that Germany wouldn't be able to spend anything having to do with military operations or development. <em>Obviously this is a gross oversimplification, but I'm going off memory and I'm on the toilet so cut me some slack.</em> Consequently all of the engineers and businesses that had been part of the German war machine transitioned to private industries. Since the money that the German gov. had previously been spending on being dicks to all of Europe was now just laying around (not counting all the money they had to pay out for reparations), they decided to invest in domestic infrastructure. All of the aforementioned factors [many omitted], in addition to the efficiency of German production, and absolute necessity were driving forces in Germany's post-war reconstruction. </p>
<p>Tldr: Germany wasn't allowed to make shit that went &quot;boom&quot; after WWII, but the engineering nerds who were previously working in the war effort still needed to make money. Instead of designing/producing weapons &amp; war machines, they began focusing on making cars &amp; shit to sell to the chumps across the pond in Freedomland. </p>
<p>This is all going off what I remember from a one day section in my AP Gov class during my junior year of high school. There's probably more holes in this crude account of history than Swiss cheese, so hopefully one of the kids I used to copy off can pop in and clear it up for you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I was taught in Design History was that German products used to be of lesser quality before the 20th century, so they formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Werkbund" target="_blank">Deutscher Werkbund</a> , an association of industrialists, craftsmen, architects etc. to make better products and rebrand &quot;Made in Germany&quot; as a sign of quality.</p>
<p>There was a TIL I think a few days ago about the Made in [Country] mark, saying the British invented it (near the end of 19th century) to mark foreign goods which were generally of inferior quality.</p>
<p>Another aspect of their current quality is the coupling of specialist high schools with the industry where they basically train their employees from day one.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a couple of different reasons but I'll try to separate them.</p>
<p>Chemically, there's 3 different 'types' of tears; Basal, Reflex, and Emotional. The other two tears are a result of irritants or just general lubricant for the eye in the form of mucus, but emotional tears are made up of stress hormones such as cortisol (which will relieve tension in your body which is argued for why you feel better after crying) and leucine enkephalin, a natural painkiller and endorphin (stuff you get while doing exercise) which also uses up cortisol in the body and makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Psychologically, everyone cries because it's a form of non-verbal communication that you are feeling sad or might be injured, or anything that means you might need help, despite you not being consciously aware of it. You can't make yourself cry unless you think of something emotional. </p>
<p>You cry when you're emotional because your body treats an emotional stressor as if you have been physically injured. You might be in relatively low physical danger when told that a family member has passed away, but the overwhelming stress and emotion causes such a build up of stress hormones from the sympathetic nervous system (increases heart rate, respiration, supresses digestion, etc) that you will most likely cry or feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>When something makes you extremely happy, you remove a lot of distress from your life (if not momentarily). Looking at the GAS (Hans Selye's General Adaption Syndrome) model for stress, most people are subconsciously in the 'resistance' stage; meaning they have increased their resistance to stressors to get through their lives. When something extremely great happens to you, say a partner proposes or you win the lottery, that stress resistance level is no longer needed, so excess stress hormones that were activated to keep you resistant are released in Emotional tears.</p>

<p>Edit: The situation now is that she had a plan to hurt herself that she had not decided to go through with. Years ago, before we even met, she did attempt suicide.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chances are, even if your girlfriend went in voluntarily, if she is placed on a hold, then she will be held involuntarily for 72 hours. If she readily admits to being a danger to herself or others, she will very likely be put on a hold and transferred to a facility for treatment. If she does not meet the criteria for a hold, she should be released, as far as I'm aware. I'm certain recommendations will be made for her to follow and resources will be made known to her.</p>
<p>You are correct, those 72 hours will not begin until she is given a Psych eval at the emergency room by whoever is on at that time. The Psychiatrist will write his recommendations, whether that is a hold or otherwise and she will be either released outright or released to a facility for processing and treatment.</p>
<p>This is a tough situation to be in, hang in there, both of you.</p>

This takes 24-48 hrs from when it is submitted, signed by the patient and a Nurse Practitioner or Doctor. (There SHOULD always be a NP or Doctor on staff seeing patients 24/7 but again due to the location and lack of staffing this could be the following day or it seems in her case the following business day which is a large issue in the Mental Health Care field) You cannot be at risk of hurting yourself or others. If you are, the Hospital will put you on a 72 hour mandatory hold. This does unfortunately mean 72 hours from her medical and psychological exams. This is for the safety of the patient and society. Its like a cool down period where you are forced to think about any future bad decisions you are planning. Most of these start with you breaking the law and being brought in by police. If you are depressed or just losing your mind a little and need a time out from life to recoup, you are likely in the Psych Unit at will and learn to understand that staying for at least 72 hours will allow you to regulate your medication safely. Some people don't take medication but choose to take advantage of some helpful 'classes' during their stay. Depending on how busy the hospital is and how many people in the area are a high risk and need to be admitted they will be able to release highly stressed but non-dangerous individuals earlier than those looking to harm. Good Luck and hopefully she feels better when she's out!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
