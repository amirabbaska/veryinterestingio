		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple considerations here.</p>
<p>For one, the US is largely geographically isolated from the world's geopolitical hot spots. In the 20th century, that was Europe. These past 20 years, the Middle East. In this century, it may well become Asia.</p>
<p>As a result of lessons learned from WW2, the US has maintained that it's best defense is to keep forces and the capability to keep forces overseas.</p>
<p>That means a Navy that can deliver men and materiel overseas and the ability to defend them from submarines and aircraft. That means an Air Force that has hundreds of aerial refueling tankers and strategic airlift transports (e.g., the US has over 400 tankers and 220 strategic transports - the rest of NATO nations combined have a grand total of around 40 dedicated tankers and 20 strategic transports).</p>
<p>But on the other end, you need bases for said troops and materiel to be put at. Hence nations come into agreement with the US to station troops in their nation.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, these aren't imposed on the host nations - not now, anyways. Nations must sign a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for the US to station troops. A SOFA states the legal rights of US troops in host nation - for instance, a SOFA in the UAE woild bar US troops from being subject to local Sharia laws we disagree with.</p>
<p>You'll note too that the four nations with the most US troops overseas are Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Italy. Three of those four are the vanquished Axis foes of WW2. As a result of various treaties to end the war, those nations were occupied by US and Allied forces, which is how many of these bases came into US hands. Heck, the UK still has British Forces Germany - a contingent of 5000 that aren't due to depart until 2020, a full 75 years after the war ended!</p>
<p>In addition to economic and political benefits of US troops stationed overseas (a lot of developing nations get money poured in from it, and it's a source of employment for locals too), South Korea is a good example of another reason nations may want us.</p>
<p>By keeping US troops in the country and along the DMZ, any attack by North Korea will inevitably kill Americans. That guarantees the US would respond. These tripwire forces are a big reason Poland and other Eastern European nations are more than happy to station US troops there, even as Western Europe is less happy about them.</p>
<p>I want to add too that the US has <strong>simultaneous</strong> defense treaties with NATO and Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc. A war with North Korea does not absolve the US of fulfilling it's defense treaty with Europe if they get in a fight with Russia. As thus, the US prefers to keep forces overseas to stop it from getting to a fight in the first place.</p>
<p>Finally, European and Asian militaries benefit from reciprocal agreements. Not only do those nations get to train directly with their American counterparts, but they have agreements to use US bases in the US.</p>
<p>That's right, we have foreign troops stationed in the US. Did you know that the German Air Force has squadrons stationed in the US at Holloman AFB in New Mexico and NAS Pensacola in Florida?</p>
<p>Hell, did you know that tiny Singapore - yes, Singapore - has FOUR Air Force squadrons stationed in the US.</p>
<p>The vast airspace and land we have allows a lot of smaller nations to train. And they get the benefit of a US alliance? It's a no brainer for a lot of nations </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said about host countries benefiting economically and having a certain amount of protection and the US benefiting by being able to have a decentralized military, there's also a historical component. </p>
<p>The US has a relatively large presence in countries like Germany, Italy, Japan, and Korea. What do these countries have in common? The US has been involved in wars with all of them. After WWII, they set up bases in Germany. Selflessly to help rebuild it after a terrible war. Selfishly, I presume, to ensure that another disgruntled German didn't write a book about his life and rile up the working class. Germany was also a strategic border to maintain with the Iron curtain during the Cold War. Korea was another country during the Cold War that the US didn't want to lose more than the 38th parallel to communism. </p>
<p>All of the countries mentioned weren't in a great position to tell the US that they didn't want them there when the US started forming bases. Fortunately, the US seems to be doing mostly right by all of these countries 50+ years later. They aren't forcing political change or establishing figure head leaders. They seem to save that for countries they don't don't plan on occupying long term</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Former solder in Germany here.  The Stattus of Forces agreement (SOFA) is the actual piece of paper that allows the US to have a base in another country (that we are not currently at war with).  Usually the US sells weapons or rents the land.  Also in the SOFA are agreements about how many local people the military must hire.  We had janitors that were German, soldiers only cleaned floors in secured areas.  Most of the gate grass were also local.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this question may be better understood addressing all four modes of language: reading, writing, speaking, and listening.</p>
<p>While reading and listening to a language involve the intake of information, speaking and writing involve the output of information.</p>
<p>These &quot;output&quot; modes are exceptionally more complicated than &quot;intake&quot; modes, because proper language output demands that grammar be at least moderately adhered to. In other words, you have to understand the structure of a language to actually form sentences.</p>
<p>Reflecting an everyday example of the question, pick up a book by one of your favorite authors, especially someone with a distinct style of writing. Can you write (output) like that person? You might not even fully comprehend all of the words that they use, and almost certainly couldn't replicate their writing style. However, it is likely that while reading (intake) them, you understand the text just fine.</p>
<p>Now to translate that theme into the question, replace the forms of relative intake and output. Someone familiar with the speech patterns, core vocabulary, and contextual clues of a foreign language can understand what is being said, but will likely be unable to reconstruct the language themselves, which is the essence of actually speaking it.</p>
<p>Also remember that intaking (reading, listening) a language utilizes context, where outputting (writing, speaking) does not benefit from this.</p>
<p>As a final point- and I could make more, but this should suffice - note that most foreign languages have pretty radically different accents associated with their words (and if you don't think so, try to imitate full sentences). Intonations, letter pronunciations, and speech patterns all fluctuate so much from one language to another that it's likely the case that an individual has grown accustomed to hearing and understanding foreign speech without ever speaking the language enough to even correctly mimic the words. This is especially true of children who grew up with the language in the household but who haven't learned to communicate in it.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies a few things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah haha! Another question I can answer. </p>
<p>Think of it as the difference between taking a multiple choice vs. free answer test. What makes it harder to speak is because all the cues we take from the media or person expressing information are missing whenever we try to express our own opinions. When we take a multiple choice test, we have the cues of the question and answers to help us find an answer. With free choice, we lose a lot of what we can use to guess the correct answer.</p>
<p>When I'm at the fish market, and the fishmonger says the word <em>yu2</em> (rising tone), from the context around me at the fish market, his profession, his products, and my mission (buy fish) all help me guess that he must mean 鱼 or fish. </p>
<p>If I meet someone on the side of the road and they say <em>yu2</em> is delicious, well, I don't have as easy a time figuring it out because there's less to go on to surmise the answer from what I know about them and the environment where we're speaking. </p>
<p>When you're speaking, what makes it hard is that you have to do note than just passively receive the information, you have to form it yourself. It's like watching a baker bake a cake, and then you try next. You get the concepts and everything behind it not performing it  becomes so much more difficult because not only do you have to do what you've been taught, questions you didn't have before spring up, causing you to slow down or never unable to express yourself. In addition, most people don't have the right skills to get them out of a language jam, like describing the item I'm an accurate way. So, compared to a road block in your native language where the entire map is revealed after exploring the area for a while and getting all your fast points, you're starting at level 1 with maybe a few slivers of the map revealed not knowing how they all intersect and join together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ugh this is such a cool question!  The answer get's at some very real-life applications of quantum mechanics.  </p>
<p>The basic answer is infra-red radiation is a more effective way of heating up common materials (water, plastic, organic things) because photons in the infra-red part of the electromagnetic spectrum are more heavily absorbed by these compounds, but this is only part of the answer!  The next obvious question is: why is that?  Why for instance doesn't the visible and UV radiation from sunlight cause even more heating since it's higher in energy?  The reason for this has to do with a couple concepts: 1) what exactly is happening on the molecular level when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed and turned into thermal energy and 2) the concept or resonance and how this translates into absorption spectra of various compounds.  </p>
<p>Let's get into the first idea.  Several things can happen when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by a material.  Classically we are taught in science class that electrons in lower energy orbitals are pushed up into higher energy orbitals when they absorb EM radiation but this only really tells a small part of the story (this is what causes the classic &quot;absorption spectrum&quot; of various chemical elements - so valuable to astronomy).  It turns out EM energy can actually be absorbed in myriad other ways, however to increase the temperature of a substance, it has to be absorbed in such a way as to increase the kinetic energy of the molecules making up that particular compound, since temperature is our perception of the average molecular kinetic energy of a substance.  To accomplish this, the EM radiation will typically increase the vibrational energy of the chemical bonds present in this substance, though interactions which increase the rotational energy or flex the bonds will increase kinetic energy as well.  In the case of your microwave for instance, a machine that projects high intensity EM radiation (in the microwave area of the spectrum - hence the name) the way kinetic energy (a.k.a. heat) is imparted on your food is by increasing the vibrational energy between the hydrogen-oxygen bonds in water.  That's why you'll notice that the more water-filled portions of food you heat in the microwave often heat up disproportionately compared to other parts!  </p>
<p>This takes us to #2, why is infrared the part of the spectrum that is responsible for temperature changes, not other parts of the spectrum.  Well this has to do with quantum resonance.  Let's take the example of water again as we just discussed.  Imagine a water molecule, with two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  The hydrogen atoms and oxygen are mutually attracted to each other (if you're curious why, look up covalent bonds on wikipedia).  Their mutual attraction exists such that there is a perfect distance at which they will be at their lowest energy state; where the attraction they experience due to their electronegativity (another chemistry concept) is balanced by the repulsion their positively charged nuclei experience towards one another.  This is their &quot;bonding length&quot;.  In school we make models of molecules with balls and sticks, which implies bonding length is constant, but in reality, the hydrogen and oxygen in water are bouncing between each other as if they are on springs, constantly oscillating between attraction and repulsion.  </p>
<p>Remember earlier that increasing the vibrational energy of a chemical bond will in turn result in an increase in that molecules kinetic energy (resulting in a net temperature increase for the compound as a whole) so consider for a second what it would take to increase that vibrational energy.  You would need the right amount of energy to perfectly increase that &quot;bouncing back and forth&quot; oscillating motion between the hydrogen and the oxygen atom.  If the photon that interacts with this system is too high in energy, it will either disrupt the system violently (i.e. the way ionizing radiation works) or simply not be absorbed at all.  Alternatively, a photon with too little energy will not have sufficient &quot;oomph&quot; (read: energy) to significantly affect the vibration of the oxygen and hydrogen.  But a photon at just the right wavelength and frequency can add energy to the system by imparting just enough energy into the chemical bond as to increase the frequency and amplitude of the vibration, and lead to an increase in kinetic energy.  It is primarily infra-red and microwave radiation that exists in this &quot;sweet spot&quot; of energy to interact so strongly with the chemical bonds of most common organic compounds in a way that produces heat.  Other kinds of radiation simply are too energetic or not enough.  This is the concept of &quot;resonance&quot; and I think it's an apt word to describe it.  </p>
<p>Another way of thinking about this is what something looks like when it does NOT absorb a part of the EM spectrum.  Let's take water for example.  Water barely absorbs visible light (compared to something like ink for example), so it appears clear.  When visible light interacts with water molecules, it is hardly absorbed so the waves largely pass through it unhindered (they are in fact &quot;refracted&quot; but let's not get into that right now) and as a result it appears transparent.  In contrast, water would appear &quot;black&quot; in the infrared spectrum since it heavily absorbs these wavelengths.  Interestingly if you take this logic a step further, you could infer that black objects, which absorb the entirety of the visual spectrum, are essentially doing what water does to infra-red energy; they are absorbing it and transforming it into kinetic energy.  If you want to test this theory, take two water bottles, one filled with pure water, and another filled with india ink out into the sunshine on a bright sunny day.  Both bottles have similar infra-red absorption since they are largely filled with water, but the one with ink in it will additionally absorb most of the visible spectrum.  It should be noticeably warmer at the end of the day.  </p>
<p>tl;dr: Infra-red energy is absorbed by chemical bonds in most common organic compounds, increasing their vibrational energy and leading to higher average kinetic energy of the molecules making up that compound (i.e. tempearature); other areas of the EM spectrum are either too high energy or too low energy to interact with chemical bonds in this way!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, infrared is the type of light emitted by &quot;hot&quot; things, so we associate it with heat.</p>
<p>The process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">blackbody radiation</a> and I think this <a href="https://www.mdscc.nasa.gov/upload/201211/Tabla_con_amarillo.jpg" target="_blank">graph</a> captures the relationship between being &quot;hot&quot; and infrared radiation well. Everything with a temperature (so, everything) emits light, and the frequency and amount of that radiation is a function of temperature. Room temperature is 300 K, so things that are &quot;hot&quot; in an everyday sense tend to be a few hundred to ~a thousand Kelvin, and all of those temperatures emit mainly in the infrared. Being &quot;red hot&quot; refers to the fact that something is hot enough to start emitting in the visible, but even then the vast majority of their radiation is in the infrared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how a stove turns red when it gets hot?  Hot things glow -- that's the black body radiation people keep talking about.</p>
<p>It turns out that the stove is glowing, even if it's not visible to the human eye.  At room temperature, and especially body temperature, objects still emit light -- infrared light.  </p>
<p>Why haven't we evolved to see this light?  Well, our eyes are machines made of proteins that only work properly at certain temperatures.  It would be pretty difficult to distinguish the IR glow of a faraway object, from the ambient glow of the camera/eye itself.  IR cameras deal with this sometimes by actively cooling the assembly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>...because when objects absorb energy from other forms radiation, eg; gamma, x-ray, microwave, visible light and so on... it is typically remitted from the absorbing substance as infrared.</p>
<p>So you can detect heat energy using infrared but the source of the heat energy itself may be anything outside of the infrared spectrum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

What I believe: I believe that our inner voice is a simulation of an auditory perception. We do these simulations to either plan ahead in time how we want to react to a sound perception (e.g. hearing a voice), or if we want to actually plan an utterance for ourself. (We may perhaps practice a speech by using the voice in our head.)
How this inner voice is related to propositional thought is very controversial. I don't really have an opinion on it. It's also not well understood how auditory imagination relates to the memory of sounds and metacognition. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>There are other examples of words that mean their own opposite. My favorite is &quot;sanction,&quot; which means both &quot;to approve&quot; and &quot;to disapprove&quot;/&quot;to punish.&quot;  So you usually have to use context clues. If a headline reads &quot;the UN sanctioned the use of force,&quot; you can figure out in the article what really happened. </p>
<p>That may not be possible with bi-monthly. If a boss says &quot;schedule this meeting bi-monthly,&quot; it's best to ask for clarification. </p>
<p>All of which goes to show that language is a spontaneous order, not a unified system governed by a rational body that decides what words should mean.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly question of dose and pharmacokinetics (the speed the substance acts). When you carefully inject something into bloodstream (some bigger vein), pretty much all of it spreads around the body fast. That way you can exactly control the dose and make the most out of what you have. If you injected it elsewhere, the odds are it would work too - but if it hit a muscle (intermuscular application), it would take much longer to get where it needs to be, which generally means lower &quot;maximum&quot; effect over longer period of time. </p>
<p>With pharmaceutical drugs you want the best controlled outcome you can get. With bad drugs you want to get the most out of the dose. Both is better achieved by getting it right into blood. (Unless you go for intermuscular application on purpose)</p>
<p>With poison darts and bites, the substances are so efficient and/or in dose large enough that you dont really care. Yes, hitting a vein WOULD make it faster and stronger, but even muscle is good enough.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you take a drug by mouth, it may get diluted by the &quot;first pass effect.&quot; All the stuff that enters your blood stream from your stomach and intestines goes into vessels that carry blood directly to the liver before that blood goes anywhere else in the body. The liver has enzymes that change certain substances (other drugs can pass through the liver mostly or entirely unchanged). So if you take a drug by mouth that is significantly metabolized by the liver, very little of it will reach the general circulation unchanged. But if you inject that same drug into a vein or a muscle, the drug has a chance to circulate to all or most of the body before passing through the liver where some or all of it can be metabolized.<br />
If you get a drug injected into a muscle, it takes time for it to enter blood vessels and get carried into the general circulation. So, a tranquilizer injected into muscle is going to take a bit longer to work than the same drug injected directly into a vein. (This is why I want to throw something at the screen every time I watch a TV show where someone gets injected in the leg with a tranquilizer and they immediately pass out.)
Now, if you happen to inject into an artery by accident you can cause real havoc. Every veterinary student has, no doubt, heard the story of the vet who was trying to inject euthanasia solution into the jugular vein of a horse but missed and put the drug into the carotid artery instead. The drug went whoosh right up into the brain. The horse reared up and then fell, nearly crushing the person. Not how you want a euthanasia to go, by the way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version is with most pharmaceuticals you want a particular controlled reaction. Overdoses can be dangerous, and not enough medication would be ineffective. It has to do with how well the drug in question absorbs, and how quickly, what it has to pass through - a tablet or capsule by mouth must pass through the GI tract, troches and enemas absorb via mucous membranes, ect. See pharmacokinetics, above. </p>
<p>It also has to do with ease of use. Most prescriptions you pick up at Walgreens are tablets and capsules, because they're the easiest to self administer and if you have to, it's relatively easy to puke something back up if you realize something is wrong, but it's slower to take effect and less efficient in the dose it might deliver. Same concepts with topical agents - easy to administer, wash off if rash occurs.</p>
<p>Intravenous administration has the benefit of taking effect almost immediately because it doesn't need to be absorbed, it just puts the medication directly into the bloodstream. The downside is that it's difficult to self administer, especially if you dislike needles, and not everyone has a sharps disposal at home. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually transistors work simply <em>because</em> of quantum effects.  While the gate width is getting smaller the gate depth has always been small enough to allow quantum tunneling and it is what allows gate switching.</p>
<p>So what does all that mean?  I'm going to greatly simplify to start out so bear with me.  Let's start from what makes a transistor.  You have a source and a sink port, think a wire.  Now you put a &quot;gate&quot; on top of that wire.  The gate is where you control of the wire can pass electricity.  It is not possible to do this with a conductor unless you physically break the connection between the source and sink ports (called a relay).  In a semiconductor however it is possible to dope the material (like silicon) with another material (like boron) in small quantities.  This in turn adds electrons, or spaces for the electrons to go, depending on what dopant you use.  Now what does this have to do with the gate?  Well you can use the gate to push or pull electrons to the top turning the top layer of the semiconductor conductive or insulating.  Now we aren't at tunneling yet but what I have described so far is not possible under Newtonian physics, meaning we are already in the quantum realm.</p>
<p>Ok so the difference between bare silicon and boron doped silicon is not really strong enough to make a switch, you'd be able to change resistance some but not too any appreciable level.  So instead you have to do an opposite doping with something like phosphorus.  Remember where I said before you have a situation where some dopants add electrons and some add spaces for the electrons to go (called holes)?  This is where it is important.  </p>
<p>So now we have a region where you have a ton of electrons a a region where you have a ton of holes right next to each other.  Well electrons hate being together (same charges and all, like the poles of a magnet) and they start going towards the holes.  The holes are really just a lack of electrons but they have essentially a positive charge so they hate each other too and start going towards the electrons.  The holes and electrons make out and create what is called a depletion region, an area of no charge that is completely insulating and prevents all current from passing.  Depending on the number of holes and electrons on both sides this determines the size of the depletion region because of the voltage on either side.  Eventually it all evens out and becomes stable (which takes time and can effect the speed of the switch).</p>
<p>Remember the gate?  Well now we can use this to control the size of the depletion region by changing that voltage on one side.  So why do we care about quantum tunneling?  The basic concept of quantum tunneling is that for any energy barrier (like the depletion region) there is a finite probability that something can just pass through it even if it doesn't have enough energy to pass or go over (it's not about it being too low energy but just a probabilistic effect).  As an aside this is a basic statistics theory that applies in other fields like evolution (there is a finite probability that something will survive with traits that are completely non beneficial for it's environment and evolutionary pressures).  But back to electrons...</p>
<p>So switching takes time (since electrons do have a finite speed, even if it is really fast) and energy, so instead of pumping tons of power into that gate to completely eliminate the depletion region (which is not possible without destroying the transistor) we just use enough to shrink it down so that the probability of the  electronics tunneling gets large enough that we can use it to pass current.  Since we don't destroy the transistor we can now switch the current flow on and off by controlling the width of the depletion region.</p>
<p>I will end with commenting that semiconductor development focuses on making the switching faster, more efficient and require less space so you can cram more transistors in the same physical area.</p>
<p>No need to worry about quantum effects, instead you should thank them for making computers possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well simply put - <strong>Because our brains are bad at multitasking</strong> </p>
<p>Daydreaming is a short-term detachment from one's immediate surroundings, during which a person's contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake.</p>
<p>Day dreaming is not actual sleep (despite the word &quot;dream&quot;). It is simply a short-term detachment from your surrounding. Put simply, it it just your mind wondering. Like any other action you take, you do it with your eyes opened.</p>
<p>This is mainly due to our brains being very good at selective attention. It is impossible for the human brain to focus on every bit of information it receives, so instead it will focus on one or two main points and effectively ignore the rest.</p>
<p>When we form mental images, we use many of the same parts of the brain as we use to process visual images. So, when you bring up a vivid mental image, you aren't able to make full use of those areas to process what you're actually seeing. Obviously, there is still plenty of information coming in through your eyes, but since you are distracted, it is not processed as thoroughly as when you are focused on the world around you.</p>
<p>The same goes for when you bring a memory to mind. I've often been listening to someone talk, and when something they says triggers a memory, I might not even hear what they said for the next few moments. The brain isn't too great at multitasking.</p>
<p>There are many types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst psychologists, however the characteristic that is common to all forms of daydreaming meets the criteria for mild dissociation.</p>
<p><em>What part of the brain switches those controls saying to stop processing outside information and start imagining?</em></p>
<p>We are not sure. It gets tricky from here. Not sure if is understandable for a five year old :( Experts now agree, however, that daydreaming is a normal, and even beneficial, cognitive function-albeit one that is largely still not understood. An area of the brain called the “default network,” which becomes more active as the level of external stimulus decreases, is often considered responsible for daydreaming. The default network mainly includes the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the posterior cingulated cortex/precuneus region, and the temporoparietal junction </p>
<p>Neuroimaging studies have offered support for this hypothesis, though only indirectly. These studies demonstrated “correlations between reported frequency of task-unrelated thoughts and default network activation during conditions of low cognitive demand, as well as stronger default network activation during highly practiced compared with novel tasks in people with higher propensity for mind wandering.” A different interpretation of these data, offered by Gilbert et al., argued that “instead of mind wandering, activations in the medial PFC part of the default network may reflect stimulus-related thought such as enhanced watchfulness toward the external environment that is also likely to occur during highly practiced tasks”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baddeley's working memory model tells us there is a part of our mind called the central executive (located in the frontal lobes) that controls where our attention is focused, and filters out the rest. It decides what is relevant for you to feel or notice. Mostly through practice. </p>
<p>When you first hear a loud constant noise (say, roadworks outside) it bothers you - but after a while you stop noticing it, because the central executive registers it, but filters it out of your conscious perception. When the drilling stops you tend to notice the silence as a relief because that filter no longer has to work. It's why we study better in quiet environments. </p>
<p>Same goes for hearing your name in a crowded room - central executive processes all, but only sends over stuff you might find interesting or relevant. </p>
<p>When daydreaming, we are focused on introspection so our central executive puts other stimili on the backburner until you need them again. </p>
<p>It's also what those &quot;you are now breathing manually&quot; or &quot;you are now aware of the position of your tongue in your mouth&quot; memes take advantatge of. Sorry. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely fact check me, but what we learned was that when people start to day dream or think introspectively the portions of the brain that are used for attention and working memory (right parietal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) &quot;quiet down&quot; in the sense that they lower their activity rates and the default mode network turns &quot;on.&quot; The default mode network is a network of brain regions that become more activated when the brain is focusing less on outside stimuli and more on internal reflection, day dreaming, or even meditating.   This network changes then Brian waves from beta (alert and active) to alpha (awake but relaxed). That's part of the reason people &quot;snap out of it&quot; when interrupted while daydreaming. Basically when zoning out different regions of the brain get activated and the higher thinking centers quiet down so you are less aware of what's going on in the outside world and more aware of your internal monologue, thoughts, feelings, etc. </p>
<p>Paragraph and Sources: In neuroscience, the default mode network (DMN), also default network, or default state network, is a network of interacting brain regions known to have activity highly correlated with each other and distinct from other networks in the brain.[3]</p>
<p>The default mode network is most commonly shown to be active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest, such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering. But it is also active when the individual is thinking about others, thinking about themselves, remembering the past, and planning for the future.[3][4] The network activates &quot;by default&quot; when a person is not involved in a task. Though the DMN was originally noticed to be deactivated in certain goal-oriented tasks and is sometimes referred to as the task-negative network,[5] it can be active in other goal-oriented tasks such as social working memory or autobiographical tasks.[6] The DMN has been shown to be negatively correlated with other networks in the brain such as attention networks.[7] Thinking about others also could include guessing their thoughts, emotions, and psychological motivations.</p>

When you're daydreaming, the network known as the Default Mode Network is more active. The DMNs activity is inversely proportional to the activity in the Dorsal Attention Network, which is more active when you're consciously thinking about something like math, higher-order reasoning, or anything where you feel like you're concentrating. So the DMN is active when you're thinking about nothing, when you're daydreaming or really any time you aren't concentrating
