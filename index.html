		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the technology at the MRF or material recovery facility. At a typical single stream meaning you put all recycling in one bin there are a variety of &quot;screens&quot; material passes through that separate out 2d from 3d things so paper from other material. Screens that separate glass. Eddy currents to pull out aluminum. Optical sorters that can be used to separate plastic types #1 - 7 or glass or different types of paper. However there is always something called residual in the end commodity. Residential would be like plastic straws or caps in a ton of glass sold on the market. Residual in glass has increased significantly since many MRFs have moved toward single stream. Additionally glass ends up being broken in small pieces in single stream recycling and has lower market value.  Add increased residual to the situation and glass recycling is a money loss for MRFs. </p>
<p>TLDR yes all economically reasonable attempts to pull out non recyclable commodity items and separate commodities for market are made but not everything that shouldn't be there is pulled out and what isn't is residual shit in a commodity kinda like the ends pieces on a loaf of bread </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partly it is because things like murder are just that much more rare in the UK compared to the US.</p>
<p>The countrywide murder rate in the US is 5 times higher than in the UK. ( 4.8 per 100,000 people in the US and only 0.9 in the UK)</p>
<p>London itself has a homicide rate of about 1 per 100,000 which is pretty low for a big city. Cities in the US with high crime rates can have a rate as high as 44.6 (Detroit), 45.2 (New Orleans), 51.1 (Baltimore) and 60 (St. Louis). Even relatively peaceful large cities in the US still have a far higher murder rate than London.</p>
<p>So generally weapons to exert lethal force with are far less needed when the average person you meet on the street is much less likely to be a killer.</p>
<p>The fact that guns are much less common in the UK even among career criminals, means that as a cop walking or driving the beat the fear of getting shot at is far more diminished.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_police_officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has a list of British cops who died while on duty and actively trying to prevent a crime or pursue a criminal (excluding those who suffered regular workplace accidents and also during war or in paramilitary situations). It is a surprisingly short list and being shot appears about as often as collapsing dead while trying to run down a suspect on foot. Stabbings are a more serious risk and reportedly stab-prood west are more sought after than bullet proof vests.</p>
<p>It probably helps that the geography of England makes calling for backup to get professional help an easier thing than in a large and thinly settled country like the US. If shooting needs to be done they can call in those who are actually trained to handle guns rather than do it themselves.</p>
<p>All those however could be argue are just symptoms. The root cause is perhaps found in the cultural difference. You can broadly separate societies along a spectrum of cultures of honour vs cultures of law. In cultures of law the authorities have a much more firm grip on the monopoly of violence while the societies that focus more  on honour over law will have people seeking redress in case of being wronged personally.</p>
<p>Cultures of Honour tend to be more violent as a result. This goes on large scales like Europe vs the Americas and inside countries like North vs south in the US, but also in subcultures inside of societies like the inner cities with their gang violence in the US or insufficiently integrated immigrants almost everywhere.</p>
<p>If you don't trust the police to protect and help you and deal with you fairly, you will seek out you other means of keeping yourself safe.</p>
<p>In the US people will regularly own guns for the sake of protection while such a thing is mostly illegal in the UK. Gangs don't shoot at each other much in Britain and despite reports of no-go zones there generally are no place where the police won't go at all.</p>
<p>The people trust the police more in England and thus the police can trust the people more to not be out to violently murder them. Even criminals usually don't see the need to escalate things to levels of violence that would require guns to solve.</p>
<p>With the average person on the street far less likely to be armed with a gun and in a mood to kill a cop. Cops in Britain are far less concerned with being armed with guns themselves.</p>
<p>It is a crazy situation from an American perspective but it works.</p>
<p>Also to the guy who wondered if a five year old would know what Scotland yard is:</p>
<p>When I was a kid many, many years ago I knew Scotland Yard as sort of the place where all the inspectors were from in all those crime and mystery stories set in Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;Inspector X of the Yard&quot; used to be a very common trope in all sorts of murder mystery stories, so the whole idea of Scotland Yard being where all inspectors are from was something embedded in public consciousness. Most people especially kids probably had misconceptions about what agency and jurisdiction are associated with the building, but it was and to a degree is still very famous.</p>
<p>I even remember a board game named after Scotland Yard that involved hunting a criminal throughout London in cooperative play across a map of public transportation of they city.</p>
<p>I guess the whole thing may have become too much of a cliche and not bee as familiar for modern youths, but it should still be well enough known today especially as the 5 year old of this subreddit is not supposed to be literal one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scotland Yard is the HQ of the Metropolitan police, the force responsible for policing most of London.</p>
<p>The metropolitan police do have guns. Not every officer, but they do have armed units which can be called out when necessary, or when needed to patrol high risk areas.</p>
<p>The average officer doing routine patrols is unlikely to need a gun. Guns are heavily restricted in Great Britain, so it's unlikely they will be facing a criminal with one. And if they do, they can call for backup and get armed units sent in.</p>
<p>Of course you might say that criminals don't follow the law, therefore might have a gun despite them being illegal.</p>
<p>That's true to some extent, but it's generally hard to get hold of a gun and simply having one is a serious crime. So usually only the most hardened career criminals will have one. And the police are unlikely to run into a situation with them on a routine patrol. If they're doing a planned raid they will bring guns if they think they might need them.</p>
<p>Also the more petty criminals might not feel the need to have a gun anyway, since they're not expecting police or random civilians to start shooting at them.</p>
<p>By the way, I've been saying &quot;guns are illegal&quot;, but that's not strictly true. Handguns are illegal, but some other types of guns such as rifles and shotguns are allowed in some cases, but heavily licenced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in an company that advises / sells software to U.K. police forces, a large number of the other staff (not myself) are ex police of some kind.
A few weeks ago I had a very similar discussion with one of our guys who had been a firearms trained officer (which in it's self is quite a big deal) before leaving the force and joining us, but when policing the street always preferred to be unarmed, especially in situations involving volatile drunk crowds.</p>
<p>The example he gave was to imagine you are 2 on 1 or 2 on 2 with a couple of drunk blokes who need a stay in the drunk tank. You are going to end up on the floor with these guys to cuff and arrest them, but if you are armed you simply cant. The risk of you firearm being taken off you is too high, so you have to draw your gun instead to try and get them to comply... but they are drunk so they don't. How do you escalate now?
When the run either at you or away from you, does that justify lethal force? No.</p>
<p>Where as with a baton or even spray, it's non lethal and you can still muck in and risk approaching without the risk of arming the target with your own gun.
It's what he described as 'real' policing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Armed officers in the UK are very, very skilled and have often undergone extremely high level training with special forced units like the SAS. In counter terrorism roles they'll have contact with the security services too.</p>
<p>If you're in the middle of an armed heist and you face armed cops in the UK it's not going to be beat cops with pistols. It'll be more like taking on a special forces team. Usually that doesn't last very long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/878672-overview" target="_blank">http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/878672-overview</a></p>
<p>Obviously, my eyes were taken out of my eye sockets and replaced gently and carefully by an expert team of surgeons with assistance from amazing anesthesiologists.</p>
<p>The visual side effects of this surgery took about four months to go away, but it was well worth the hassle, because my vision is now perfect, and the only maintenance I need is a few eye drops morning and night.</p>
<p>Among the side effects that came and went and were most disconcerting--double vision, which was most difficult when I was lap-swimming, because it was hard to tell where I was in relation to other swimmers and the lane markers; driving was impossible, because the road would randomly rise to the sky or the lanes would split apart so that a two lane road would look like it was taking five or six lanes. There is technical terminology for these effects, but the main point I am trying to make here is that even in the best of conditions, with the best medical care on the planet, this was not something anyone would willingly do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The issue would be related to how your brain processes the new visual inputs that don't have a common bearing and are not focused together. Currently, assuming both your eyes are in their respective sockets your brain can piece together all the &quot;images&quot; coming in from the eyes as they are focused on the same thing at any given time. </li>
<li>How would it affect your vision: I'm not sure. Sorry. But my assumption is that since one eye can't focus (lack of muscle control once the eye pops out) you lose depth perception at the minimum. </li>
<li>How would it affect your vision field: you would not be able to see a majority of things on the side of your popped out eye. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your eye pops out of the socket, you've got much bigger problems than wondering if you'll see from the eye when it pops out. There are a crazy amount of connective tissues around the eye holding it in.</p>
<p>However, I can attest to how delicate the optic nerve is. Any damage to it and the vision in that eye is gone. Unless it's like the delicate surgery others have mentioned for Graves disease, if your eye comes out, it's done for. </p>
<p>Source: was shot in the eye with a bb gun. No actual damage to the nerve from the bb but the impact in the tissue behind my eye put some pressure on the nerve for a split second and it was gone forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vacuum &quot;pull&quot; is nothing but the internal pressure pushing against a lack of external pressure. So the force is given by a pressure differential of about one atmosphere acting on the area of the breach. For a small hole this is not a lot at all: Atmospheric pressure is 1 bar = 10^5 Pa = 100000 N/m^2 . If you have a breach with a cross section of 1 m^2 , the force would be 100000 N, i.e. roughly the equivalent of of 10 tonnes of weight distributed over that area. A hole with 100 cm^2 area (a fist sized hole in the hull) would only have 1000 N force, roughly 100 kg worth. Enough to lose air, but if you want to plug such a hole by putting e.g. a body part or a book on it it will hold.  </p>
<p>If you have access to a vacuum pump (e.g. in a science lab) put your finger over the tube and you will feel a slight pull - this is exactly what would happen with the space scenario. </p>
<p>Movies rarely let science get in the way of a good story.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of other comments concerning peeing and pooping in utero (in the womb):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meconium present at birth indicates fetal distress, the baby was stressed by something in the delivery process or shortly before.  As has been noted, the stuff is really sticky and if it has been aspirated (inhaled) can lead to breathing difficulties.  This can potentially be fatal so meconium at birth is not a good finding.</p>
</li>
<li>If a child fails to produce urine due to malformation of the kidneys or urogenital tract (bladder and urethra) a condition called oligohydramnios occurs.  Not only do we &quot;drink&quot; our urine as mentioned but we also &quot;breath&quot; it in the womb.  Babies inhale and exhale amniotic fluid.  If there is insufficient amniotic fluid because baby is not peeing, these breathing movements cannot occur normally and the lungs do not develop normally leading to severe problems at birth which can potentially be fatal.  In really severe cases of low amniotic fluid because baby is not making urine something called &quot;Potters sequence&quot; occurs.  &quot;Potters&quot; is not someone's name but comes from the fact that the child looks like they had been trapped in a clay pot.  They have abnormal development of the lungs because they have no &quot;breathing&quot; in the womb (the uterus has squeezed them and restricted this), have abnormal development of the joints in the arms, hands, and legs because they could not move (baby could not kick and move in the womb), and have abnormal appearance of their face because it was smushed by the womb.  They may not have the normal lines on the palms of their hands because they could not move them.  If severe enough oligohydramnios, the child will not survive due to the failure of the lungs to develop normally, the lungs look &quot;solid&quot; and not like &quot;sponges&quot; because they little sacs (alveoli) where oxygen adsorption occurs do not develop.  Peeing in the womb is REALLY important!</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Just a couple of months into their development, little humans begin peeing freely into the amniotic fluid that surrounds them in the womb. Then, foreshadowing all the gross stuff that babies do once they’re born, they’ll consume that urine as they swallow the amniotic fluid. Every last one of us has spent several months drinking our own pee.</p>
<p>In utero pooping is less common. Fetuses get their nutrients from food that their mothers’ digestive systems have broken down, and the waste from that food stays with mom and is taken care of on her end (Thanks, Mom!). Fetuses do ingest some stuff—mucus, bile, fine fetal hairs called lanugo, cells lining the inside of the womb—that needs to get disposed of, though. All this stuff gets broken down by the fetus’s digestive system and forms a viscous, sticky mass of feces called meconium.</p>
<p>Meconium is almost odorless and mostly sterile. It usually stays in fetuses’ bowels until they’re born, but some kids—around 13 percent—just can’t wait, and let it loose in the womb. This can be a problem, since feces is now floating in the amniotic fluid that the fetus swallows and takes into its lungs, and “meconium-stained amniotic fluid,” as the docs call it, can lead to serious respiratory distress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called &quot;Meconium,&quot; as u/maaagill said, and babies sometimes do &quot;poop&quot; in the womb-- I was a meconium baby as I was born two weeks late because as usual I was too lazy to get up. It's not <em>super</em> dangerous for a baby to womb poop but it's not really good, because they can inhale the substance when they breathe on their own for the first time. In this case they put a tube down the baby's throat to suck it out and clear it. It left me with a scratchy voice for a little while :)</p>
<p>EDIT: Since people have been asking, &quot;a little while&quot; was as long as six months, according to my mom. I can't really comment since I was an infant, and I can't ask my mom now because we don't speak anymore.</p>

Some cultures value being polite (abiding by perceived social norms to avoid conflict), some value being honest even if it is abrasive and &quot;not nice&quot;. </p>
<p>A polite person won't tell you you're being an idiot to your face. A nice person will help you avoid looking like an idiot in future interactions with other people. Polite people may talk about you behind your back to their friends and the greater community saying you're an idiot even if they tolerate you on the surface. That's where the insidious aspect of being &quot;polite&quot; comes into play. Just because someone is polite doesn't mean they like you. People confuse being &quot;polite&quot; and being &quot;nice&quot;.</p>
<p>There are some cultures where if you do something that makes you stand out, people will tell you about it bluntly. That's considered &quot;not nice&quot; but in many ways people learn from the experience faster than cultures that promote social cohesion (nice) over corrective communication.

<p>Generally speaking though, Canadians are more chill than Americans, and tend to be more polite (which is akin to being nice).

You know how you can compress a jpeg image to shrink the file size but make it less detailed even though the physical dimensions of the image stays the same? Youtube does mostly the same thing, but to the video instead. When you chose 4k instead of 1080p youtube doesn't compress the files as much when it gives it to you to watch, thus leading into a better video even though the physical dimensions of the video for you is the same (at 1080p) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Subsampling</p>
<p>A 1080p video is usually 4:2:0. That means that for every 4 pixels, there are 4 pixels worth of luminance data. 2 larger pixels for part of the color data and zero pixels for the other part</p>
<p>4k video encoded in 4:2:0 has doble resolution. And obviously double color resolution</p>
<p>So a 4k 4:2:0 video is equivalent to a 2k 4:4:0 video when played in a 2k display</p>
<p>It's sharper because it has more information even though there is the same number of pixels displayed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A scaled 4k to 1080p will have a subjectively better visual appeal than one that's captured natively at 1080p. Super sampling your source and downcompressing later will always yeild a more qualitative superior result. A number of factors are at play when down scaling though. Especially the filters used to render the down scaled image/video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's no such thing as &quot;transferring cleanliness&quot; much like there's no such thing as &quot;transferring coldness.&quot; Hot things transfer heat to cold objects, much like there was a net transfer of (temporarily) live bacteria from your hands to his. </p>
<p>In reality, what probably happened was a transfer of some bacteria to his hands (which were killed if he still had disinfectant on them like you say), and you took some of the disinfectant onto your hands too, which killed bacteria on your hands as well.</p>
<p>By the way, your body is crawling with bacteria like you wouldn't believe. They aren't bad—your skin exists to keep them out and to control. In most cases, there is no need to disinfect your kids' hands unless you or they have an active cold. And the immune system—especially in childhood—requires stimulation for proper development and function. There's been a slew of research that correlates insufficient exposure to &quot;germs&quot; and other foreign bodies with a higher rate of allergy development as well as autoimmune disorders. One reason for the recent FDA move to pull antibacterial soaps off the market is because they didn't actually do anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TL;DL: Some bacteria is stronger than others, and will &quot;win&quot; against other bacteria. If person A has a strong bacteria colony on their hand, and person B does not, some of person A's bacteria will try and set up a colony on person B's hand. To answer the question here. If the disinfectant was still present, likely a lot of bacteria would die.

<p>Those aren't mutually exclusive, so it could be both. The question would be whether or not you used enough hand sanitizer to destroy the bacteria on both of your hands.  </p>
<p>It's like asking, &quot;If I pour hand sanitizer on my left hand and rub my hands together, am I making my left hand dirtier or my right hand cleaner?&quot;</p>
<p>If you used just enough for his hands, it's likely that the sanitizer took care of the bacteria on his hands, but couldn't kill all of the ones on your hands. If you put too much on his hands, and it was enough for both of you, then ... it's enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The dominant cultures probably stayed the same, many bacteria have died on this day, very little has changed though. I jest, but in truth there is no such thing as a &quot;clean&quot; hand.  The supposedly &quot;sterile&quot; hands after washing are actually a breeding ground for new pathogens. The instant the disinfectant stopped acting (after water rinse) an exponential growth pattern of any and all air born microbes began on your child's hands. the moment you touched his hand, you re-inoculated his hands with whatever was growing on your hands... the cracks and crevices of your wrinkles probably had a different ecology than the smooth surfaces, mites and other slightly larger microbes probably went along with the bacteria, viruses, and whatever else happened to be there... the niches may be slightly different between you and your kid so the end ecology of the two area's likely ended up slightly different.  The longer you don't touch your kids hands the more his established ecology proliferates, the more you touch him.. the more your ecology is present... his ecology having less effect on yours, as yours is more established. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Germs will always spread to areas of lower concentration given they can stay alive/dangerous in that medium. The adhesive and cohesive properties of microbes depends on many factors and can be quite complex. When you probe smaller regimes, water tension and van der wals forces become significant. But ultimately, a clean hand can only gain dirt and a dirty hand loses dirt to the clean one. If you define cleaning as the subtraction of dirt from something that isn't dirt, then it should be acceptable to say when the dirty hand loses mass in the form of dirt, it is quantifiably getting cleaner. The dirt lost partially escapes into the environment, and the remainder attaches to the clean hand. So if losing mass in dirt is becoming cleaner, the inverse can be said too. As the clean hand gains mass in dirt, the hand becomes dirty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fiber. </p>
<p>The density and, er, stability of feces is a measure of water and fiber, at its most basic. </p>
<p>Consume a proper water and fiber for the 'best' feces. Other things like indigestible sugars also contribute (sugar alcohols like xylitol) by passing through largely intact.  </p>
<p>Long version:</p>
<p>Fecal make-up is based on health and diet. A diet rich in fiber will produce denser, drier (but not too dry, it should still be 'soft' but firm), and sturdier feces. The best wiping feces are the ones you don't have to push out, but come out as a semi solidish 'log' mostly on their own. </p>
<p>When you push, you're forcing fecal matter that may not be 'ready' through a small hole. Imagine pushing a banana through a rubber tube. If the tube and the banana are properly aligned, the banana will slide through easily. If the banana is too soft, you have to press it though, and that causes smearing. </p>
<p>Fiber firms up and gives structure to your feces. Proper water supply allows your colon to coat the feces in a mucus for passing. You need enough fiber to have sturdy feces and enough water for it to be slick. If it's off, then the feces can be too soft for the mucus to help, requiring you to push it out, which smears it like the banana. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The optimal ass-hair length is short but not bare, like facial hair after a week or two of not shaving. I shave once every couple of months and bear the itching for a day in order to get months without a dingle-berry as my reward. Wipes with a bald ass are the worst because your toilet paper tends to get stuck to your skin.  </p>
<p>if you want proof I'm right, take a gob of peanut butter and put it in your hair when it's ~1&quot; long, then try to wipe it out with toilet paper. It gets all in the hair and you can't get it out without a million wipes. If you have a buzz cut it will wipe out much easier.  </p>
