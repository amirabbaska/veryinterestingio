I can see there is some evidence that neonicotinoids kill bees, but it's not obviously conclusive (from my very quick scan of the literature).</p>
<p>These kinds of questions have been asked a few years ago, but I believe significant new evidence has come out since, so I think it's worth asking again.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the answers so far.  I just wanted to clarify: I suppose the point in the question is - if they ban neonicotinoids, would that have a significant positive effect on bee populations?  </p>
<p>Of course, many of the answers have addressed that, and answers to the unclarified question are still appreciated.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Neonics&quot; are insecticidal chemicals that will kill pretty much any insect including bees. The problem is with application. No one is spraying bees with insecticide (maybe some peoole are idk) but their use leaves large residual ammounts in the environment which eventually get back to the bees since they tend to get around. Neonics are used to protect crops from crop pests but guess who is pollinating thise same crops? Its the bees. So even without targeting bees with insecticides they still get adequate contact and dosage to have an effect on their health.</p>

That's part of the problem; neonics stick around and become an issue for non-target species. I deal with pesticides daily in my career and these are indeed a problem. I support a ban, because we have many other effective and less harmful products we can use. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out that &quot;pesticides&quot; includes herbicides, which do not affect bees in the same way as insecticides (like neonicotinoids).  Often times for my job (maintaining vegetation on power line corridors) people use the blanket statement of &quot;pesticides&quot; and believe we're killing everything. Herbicides strictly target plant cells, not animal cells.</p>
<p>As another commenter said, neonicotinoids are generally used to protect crops from pest insects like aphids, which unfortunately has collateral damage on bees and native pollinators.  This is one of the reasons why large scale agricultural operations have to rent hives of European honeybees. They literally have tractor trailers of bee hives delivered to their farm and spread them out over their cropland. And then because bees need a diverse diet of pollen in order to be healthy, they rotate these hives to different types of agricultural fields.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neonicotinoids are pesticides similar to nicotine, a natural insecticide in tobacco. Like most pesticides, they are categorized based on their application. In this case, they are a general insecticide that will target any insect that comes in contact with it, affecting their nervous system. Bees are natural pollinators so they will become in contact with residual insecticides. The problem with pesticides is that even though they are meant to target specific pests, they can have an unintentional effect on other species such as organochlorines.</p>

The two studies — one that examined honeybees in Canada and the other that looked at three bee species in the United Kingdom, Germany and Hungary — were the first large-scale investigations to test the popular agrochemicals influence on bees in real world settings.
The work also turns many preconceived notions about bees and pesticides on their heads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! We are Seth Wynes and Kimberly Nicholas, authors of a recent scientific study that found the four most important choices individuals in industrialized countries can make for the climate are not being talked about by governments and science textbooks. We are joined by Kate Baggaley, a science journalist who wrote about in <a href="http://nbcnews.to/2AjqKSL" target="_blank">this story</a></p>
<p>Individual decisions have a huge influence on the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere, and thus the pace of climate change. Our research of global sustainability in Canada and Sweden, compares how effective 31 lifestyle choices are at reducing emission of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. The decisions include everything from recycling and dry-hanging clothes, to changing to a plant-based diet and having one fewer child.</p>
<p>The findings show that many of the most commonly adopted strategies are far less effective than the ones we don't ordinarily hear about. Namely, having one fewer child, which would result in an average of 58.6 metric tons of CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions for developed countries per year. The next most effective items on the list are living car-free (2.4 tCO2e per year), avoiding air travel (1.6 tCO2e per year) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e per year). Commonly mentioned actions like recycling are much less effective (0.2 tCO2e per year). Given these findings, we say that education should focus on high-impact changes that have a greater potential to reduce emissions, rather than low-impact actions that are the current focus of high school science textbooks and government recommendations.</p>
<p>The research is meant to guide those who want to curb their contribution to the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, rather than to instruct individuals on the personal decisions they make. </p>
<p>Here are the published findings: <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta" target="_blank"><a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta" target="_blank">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta</a></a></p>

I am a chemical engineer, and I have done research on some of these type of debates when I was in college. Most studies found that paper actually takes more energy to make, and recycling wood pulp actually creates a higher CO2 output on the environment, while most plastic items are relatively simple and easy to make, without the massive expulsion of CO2 on the environment. While this is true, it is also true that plastics,when littered in the environment do have a strong impact on wildlife. My question is, how can paper recycling create more CO2 output but still be considered a safe replacement for plastic?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First, is this true, and is it worthwhile to cut out beef alone?</p>
<p>If so, what then is the added benefit from moving from a beefless diet to a vegetarian diet?</p>
<p>Lastly, is there then a greater benefit moving from a vegetarian diet to a vegan diet?</p>

<p>Alright now to the question: most of the latter vitamins (FGHIJ) were compacted in vit b (thus it being called a complex). Also vit B is a mess because most of them changed numbers or in some cases even letters eg. Bm &amp; Bt. There were also vitamins that came after K but no consensus has ever been reached over them.</p>
<p>A lot of vitamins disappeared because they were non essential and thus not a vitamin. The whole problem with vitamins is that there isn't a clear definition and was made up a long time ago by people who did not understand the human body that well.</p>
<p>TL:DR vitamins changed names and numbers because they found out some of the vitamins weren't actually vitamins, or they were found in the same foods and thus became a vitamin complex. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience PhD student here. Also do a lot of coding. </p>
<p>First, we have to take seriously the proposition that programming languages are literally a form of language. They're not a great 1:1 mapping onto the languages that we speak because they're rather more narrow and don't have as rich of a lexicon or grammar -- most programming languages, by necessity, have a strict grammar structure and relatively few keywords -- but they are still some form of language-like construction, possessing of a grammar structure and words to fill it with, used to express some idea.</p>
<p>But one big difference is that programming languages are derivative and based on a natural language that is learned at some point. Language keywords have a meaning. I'm not really familiar with programming languages that aren't based on English keywords, but I'm sure they're out there (or at least could be). But words like <code>def</code> , <code>var</code>, <code>class</code>, etc. have a meaning and so reading them, even in a programming context, will still activate the part of your brain that deals with written language (aka <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661303001347" target="_blank">the visual word form area</a>). </p>
<p>So there isn't a lot of work that has been done looking at programming languages in particular, but there has been a pretty significant amount of work done on natural vs. artificial languages and what the differences are between learning first and second languages. And there has also been a fair bit of work done on math in the brain. </p>
<p>Taken together, programming is likely to be some mix of the two, leaning heavily on the visual word form area as well as the other areas focused on comprehension of written language, but also relying on some extent on prefrontal areas that are important in planning and mathematical tasks. Little work has been done on this, both for practical reasons (getting a subject that knows how to program things while lying perfectly still for hours on end is nothing short of a miracle, forget the logistical nightmare that would be creating a non-interfering non-ferrous keyboard for them to type on. The mere thought sends chills through my grad student spine) as well as funding reasons (not many people care what the programmer is thinking as long as their pushes seem sane).</p>
<p>tl;dr: it's probably similar, but it will be different in some ways. no one really knows.</p>
<p>I can edit in links to sources if people are interested, but it's late and I'll do it tomorrow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most important distinctions between programming languages and Natural Languages is that they fall under different types of syntax.</p>
<p>Formally, programming languages are context-free languages meaning they can be correctly generated by a simple set of rules called a generative grammar.</p>
<p>Natural languages, on the other hand, are context sensitive languages, generated by a transformational-generative grammar. Essentially that means your brain has to do two passes to generate correct sentences. First it generates the &quot;deep structure&quot; according to a generative grammar, just like for PL. But to form a correct sentence, your brain must then apply an additional set of transformations to turn the deep structure into the &quot;surface structure&quot; that you actually speak.</p>
<p>So generating or parsing natural language is inherently more difficult than the respective problem for programming languages.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm only pointing out what I believe to be the biggest cognitive difference in PL and NL. This difference is rather small and only concerns syntax, not semantics. And there are pseudo-exceptions (e.g. Python). In general, I believe the cognitive processes behind both PL and NL are largely the same, but I don't have anything to cite towards that end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question:</p>
<p>How does the brain handle mathematics differently than natural language? Why does it seem so hard for people to read math?</p>
<p>Could it possibly be easier to learn and develop math if we were to use words instead of symbols?</p>
<p>Dr. Leslie Lamport (Computer Scientist) claims the following:</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that the best way to get better programs is to teach programmers how to think better. Thinking is not the ability to manipulate language; it’s the ability to manipulate concepts. Computer science should be about concepts, not languages. But how does one teach concepts without getting distracted by the language in which those concepts are expressed? My answer is to use the same language as every other branch of science and engineering—namely, mathematics.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of these have multiple meanings, these are the ones I run across most often. </p>
<p>Beat: a length of time. This is used nonmusically as well, “step on stage, give a beat, then deliver your line”. In music is it usually the pulse that you can clap to. In 4/4 time, for example you get 4 beats in your bar. </p>
<p>Bar: a bar is a logical collection of beats. Bars usually get 3 or 4 beats, but other options are possible. </p>
<p>Step: I usually see this in composition programs. It is common to have a run of notes that are all the same length, for example 8 sixteenth notes. The step is the distance between each note. If you were notating this, you want to step at sixteenth notes. You typically set your step to eighth notes or triplets or quarter notes. </p>
<p>Tempo: how fast the beats happen. Usually measured in “beats per minute” or BPM. </p>
<p>Rhythm: this is the collection of notes in the music. Take all the notes in a phrase, and that is the rhythm. </p>
<p>Tact: I have never heard of this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A beat can refer to a number of things.  ELi5 version - it's what you clap along or bob your head to in a song.  Look up any video of Dr. Dre mixing in the studio and he is likely bobbing his head to the beat.  Most rock songs, you clap to beats 2 and 4 only, rather than every beat.</p>
<p>Bar or barline is how the beats are organized - into groups of 3, 4, 6, etc., depending on meter - 3/4, 4/4, 6/8, etc.  Each bar has a specific number of beats, depending on the meter, or key signature.</p>
<p>Step or interval is the distance between notes. If you are familiar with piano, the distance between two adjacent (touching) notes is a half-step or semitone.  </p>
<p>Tempo - how fast the beats happen.  Punk is usually really fast.</p>
<p>Takt is interchangeable with beat, according to Merriam-Webster.  I've also seen it used in place of tempo as well as the conductor's baton.</p>
<p>Rhythm - refers to the way in which a melodic line moves against the beat.  Think of the song &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;  Sing it in your head (or aloud if you want).  The first word of the song has a rhythm different from the beat, using a &quot;dotted&quot; rhythm, meaning the first syllable of the word is held 50% longer than the beat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beat - a basic length of time. You can think of it as a 1 base unit.</p>
<p>Bar - a logical collenction of beats, usually 2, 3 or 4, but almost any combination is possible.</p>
<p>Step - the distance in pitch between two notes that are next to each other, such as C and D (Do and Re).</p>
<p>(Thought I might add another one as it's relevant to steps.</p>
<p>Skip - the distance in pitch between two notes that are not next to each other, such as C and E (Do and Mi). )</p>
<p>Tempo - the number of beats in one minute (BPM). This is the most important factor in how fast the piece feels. In the olden days people weren't that pracise and just used italian words like Allegro (fast) or Moderato (moderately).</p>
<p>Tact - This is a very uncommon term. It could potentially have two meanings.</p>
<p>1 Archaically it used to be the word for the musical bar. It still is in use in many other languages.</p>
<p>2 It is the feel of the beat. You may sometimes notice musical modulation, very popular in jazz or swing, where the notes &quot;feel&quot; right, but arguably, mathematically the beat may shift in length to what &quot;feels&quot; right/better.</p>
<p>Rhythm - the combination of different lengths of the beat (beats) put together, often with distinguishable start and end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this, we should first take a look first at the circulatory system’s method of flow.</p>
<p>The blood comes out of the heart and into the aorta and arterial system.  The arteries are much thicker because of their more robust tunica media layer.  That’s basically a smooth muscle layer that handles the high pressure, and in the case of the arterioles (medium sized arteries), it changes tone to effect your blood pressure.</p>
<p>Once the blood goes through the capillary level (where it moves more slowly to accommodate oxygen, CO2, and metabolite diffusion), it goes into the venous system to make its journey back to the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>***CUE Part where DVTs (deep vein thromboses) happen</p>
<p>The venous system is composed of very floppy vessels with valves to help prevent backflow of blood.  It has a much thinner tunica media and it depends on the contraction of skeletal muscle (the voluntary muscles you use to walk) near it to help with blood flow when flow fights gravity (returns to the heart).  If blood isn’t moving fast enough, the clotting mechanisms kick in and you get a thrombus (fancy pants word for clot).</p>
<p>When you’re sleeping, your legs are more or less at the phlebostatic axis (on a horizontal plane with your heart), meaning return flow is <em>much</em> easier because you aren’t fighting gravity to get that blood back up to the heart.  When you sleep, your body moves a tiny bit to keep venous return flow going, but the gravity is your most influential variable.  With the gravity being alleviated, you aren’t usually laying down  long enough to make a difference.  If you’re down for more than a day or two, we start to treat it a bit.</p>
<p>*In the hospital, we use some anticoagulants (anti-clot meds) and powered compression devices to simulate skeletal muscle contraction.  This is mostly because people are in bed for days at a time without a lot of motion while recovering.  The tops of the beds also tilt up, so gravity makes an appearance again.  This is why nurses put pillows under the knees or slightly elevate the legs (some nicer beds can do this) so the hips are the lowest part of the body (not with a straight knee as that actually inhibits flow as well—I’ll get into that at the bottom).  Minimizing the effects of gravity helps the venous circulation even more than the compression machines by themselves.</p>
<p>Quadriplegic people bound to wheelchairs often have tilt chairs because they get almost no skeletal muscle activity in their whole body.</p>
<p><strong>Answer time/ TL;DR</strong> When you’re sitting for prolonged periods, your skeletal muscle activity is low, but because you’re flighting gravity, your blood has a tendency to push into the venous walls and expand them (remember they’re floppy), causing a decrease in flow velocity due to a widened vessel.  It’s like taking the sprayer nozzle off a garden hose.  The change in diameter causes an inverse change with regards to flow even though the same amount of fluid is going through.  When the blood is allowed to slow down like this, it causes an increased risk of clot.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why a clot is so bad.  It can break away and float to your lung, causing a Pulmonary Embolus (PE) and killing part of your lung.  It could float to your brain and give you a massive stroke.  It could also block your coronary circulation and give you a heart attack.  All three of those can kill you.</p>
<p>Getting up frequently on flights helps decrease the risk for clots.  Couple that with compression socks/sleeves/tights (the leg is more at risk than the thigh and is the more important part for compression), and that usually reduces the risk of clot formation <em>dramatically</em>.  Also to note, compression shorts aren’t a good idea because they prevent a backflow as the blood goes from the uncompressed leg to the compressed thigh.  Distal is more important, so the compression should be greater there and should decrease as it gets more proximal to your body (distal = further from heart, proximal = closer).</p>
<p>If you have clotting disorders, consult your physician before flying.  If you’re on birth control or pregnant, it’s a good idea to get your PTT/INR checked regularly (clotting factors).  This is purely educational and not a substitute for medical advice.</p>
<p><em>As promised: the straight knees thing!  Straight knees actually cause the veins to bend a tight (but small) turn.  Think of it as a kink in the garden hose that causes resistance in the vessel.  When people pass out from standing with straight legs, this is why.</em></p>
<p>Hope this helped!  I love physiology!  Let me know if you have questions!  Again, this is just for educational purposes.</p>
<p>Please excuse any typos/autocorrects.  I did this on my mobile.</p>
<p>Edit: Yay Gold!!! Thank you so much kind stranger!!!!  I’m stoked to figure out what it does 😁</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called a deep vein thrombosis and its more common after surgery, during travel, and in people who are at greater risk for it due to blood conditions and platelet count. </p>
<p>The changes undergone in the body after having surgery can increase clotting and the chances of having a clot. This is made more likely by being more sedentary when recovering due to pain and mobility so it's important that people get up and walk at set schedules, even if it hurts. Patients are often given heparin injections to thin the blood after surgery, even going so far as to have patients self inject for days after being released from the hospital. </p>
<p>Sitting for long periods isn't great for the body, but under normal conditions it isn't that bad. However when traveling for long periods of time, crammed into small and uncomfortable airline, train, or bus, seats, coupled with the seating position, circulation problems from seat design, and that at many times people are discouraged from getting out of their seat, people are more likely to develop them. Blood also tends to pool in the lower extremities when seated for long periods. Imagine a 20 hour flight to Australia in coach, where you can only get up and move around sparingly due to tightly packed seats. Outside of restroom breaks you might not get up at all. </p>
<p>Laying down in bed doesn't put so much pressure on the thighs and cause blood to pool in the legs. It also doesn't affect circulation in any negative way unlike sitting. Standing still causes blood to pool in the lower limbs, however the action of walking helps with circulation and the muscle movements and motion help stimulate blood flow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is still significant research to be done and hurdles to overcome with this. However, US Patent application ID US 12/990,420 is for a magnetic radiation shiled. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to provide an effective shield, the strength if the shield magnetic field at the source is perferably at least 1x10^-4 Tesla. To obtain a boundary between the shield magnetic field and a typical solar wind background magnetic field of around 1x10^-7 Tesla at a distance of up to a few hundred meters from the spacecraft a field strength of less than .1 Tesla at the magnetic field source will be generally sufficient. Allowing for effects if field persistence in the plasma environment, average electrical power from about 100W to 10kW, and more preferably from about 500W to 5kW may be provided by the power supply to drive the magnetic field source to generate the shield magnetic field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be for a spacecraft about the size of a desk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

At least the charged particle part.
The power consumption is not really a problem.</p>
<p>The challenge lies in extra weight and complexity, effect on everything and anyone on board, and perhaps heat.</p>
<p>It’s easier to just live with the particles bombarding the ship. I read somewhere that the ISS use cpu’s from the 90’s because the 90 nm (or there about?) process can take far more beating from particles going trough the ship, than the modern 14 nm process.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that hasn't been addressed yet in the context of this discussion is the subject of magnetic reconnection, and more broadly the fact that the solar wind direction and speed, as well as the Interplanetary Magnetic Field alignment vary quite a bit. It's more than possible that your magnetic shield that just barely balances the dynamic pressure of the solar wind could collapse to a very short range, if not entirely disappear, during a shift in the IMF. Reconnection events have the potential to drive any proposed plasma shield into the craft it's protecting, so that's equally as &quot;difficult&quot; to sell. Really though, the (nominal) solar wind ain't the killer for space travel. It's those darned cosmic rays and solar energetic particles that kill most electronics. Solar flare induced x-rays don't help the situation either. The current consensus is as most people have described: Put a bunch of dense stuff between us and space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of studies about this. Google: active radiation shield.</p>
<p>There are several problems to overcome. It should be an extremely strong magnetic field, typically they propose 4 Tm or more. The effects of such strong magnetic fields on human health have not been thoroughly studied. Usually they propose coils arranged in such way that most of the magnetic field surrounds the spacecraft while in the inside they (almost) cancel out.</p>
<p>In order to achieve such a field you need superconductors. Keeping them cold in space isn't easy. As magnets attract each other they could produce crushing forces on the spacecraft. And if anything goes wrong (one of them getting its temperature out of range) things could fail catastrophically.</p>
<p>The main advantage is that they would be way less massive than a passive shield (i.e. a thick wall of a shielding material). An active shield could be launched with a realistic budget an probably support a two year long human mission with a an acceptable dose under current standards for astronauts (500 mSv per year and 1000 mSv per career).</p>
<p>However, due to the possibility of catastrophic failure, space agencies look at these things with suspicion. Generally speaking passive techniques are more reliable, and radiation shields are no exception. When you weigh the cons of each hypothesis, the probability that astronauts develop a cancer due to radiation and the probability that the die because the spacecraft was crushed... it isn't an easy trade-off. Keep in mind that a shield wouldn't really &quot;save&quot; them from radiation, it would just reduce the dose, and the numbers acceptable for astronauts are way higher than those for radiation exposed workers on Earth. The energies of cosmic rays are just too high to be safe from them.</p>
<p>Certainly more research is needed.</p>
<p>Magnetic fields have no effect against EM radiation. Fortunately that's not a concern in space, most of the radiation is from charged particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh man the first ELI5 I can answer! I'm a pastry cook and I love chocolate!</p>
<p>So technically the true chocolate classifications are white, milk, and dark. If there is a chocolate labeled &quot;extra dark&quot;, it's just an extra marketing term. (Semi-sweet is a subclass of dark because it does not contain milk)</p>
<p>The main ingredients in chocolate are chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, sugar, milk solids and dairy fat (for the sake of the ELI5 we'll just call these &quot;milk&quot;), flavoring, and lecithin. The flavor is usually vanilla and is in almost all chocolate, so we're going to ignore it. Lecithin is an emulsifier (which means it's the thing that helps keep the chocolate smooth) and is in almost all chocolate, so we'll ignore it. NOTE: in this context, chocolate liquor is <em>not</em> alcohol. It is the name for the paste that is made from ground cocoa beans. I know that's kind of confusing, but just roll with it. </p>
<p>So the ingredients that vary widely between the classifications are: chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, milk, and sugar.</p>
<p>White chocolate contains: cocoa butter, milk, and sugar.</p>
<p>Milk chocolate contains: chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, milk, and sugar.</p>
<p>Dark chocolate contains, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, and sugar</p>
<p>That is the simplest explanation for what the differences are, and if you're happy with that then stop reading and go eat chocolate. But I will expand on what the percentages you see on chocolate packages mean.</p>
<p>If you eat two different brands of high quality chocolate, both labeled as 70%, you would probably notice that they taste very different. Why is that?</p>
<p>The percentage on packages is the percentage of the actual cocoa bean that is in the product. So a dark chocolate at 70% is made with 70% cocoa bean and then 30% other ingredients (in this case sugar, vanilla, and lecithin). A 45% milk chocolate is made of 45% cocoa bean and 55% other ingredients (sugar, milk, vanilla, and lecithin).</p>
<p>Okay so if they contain the same amount of bean why do they taste so different? Well, part of it can be the variety of bean and the roasting process, but that's more into the nuanced flavors(fruity, nutty, caramel, etc). The biggest factor in the actual intensity of the chocolate flavor is that processed cocoa beans have two components. Remember above? <em>Chocolate liquor</em> and <em>cocoa butter</em>.</p>
<p>So a 70% chocolate might have 45% chocolate liquor and 25% cocoa butter. OR it might be 60% chocolate liquor and 10% cocoa butter. Either way it's labeled as 70% chocolate. A higher percentage of chocolate liquor will give you a more intense chocolate flavor. So basically, a cheaper chocolate can taste better than an expensive chocolate if it has a higher content of chocolate liquor.</p>
<p>Lemme know if you want any more info or fun facts about chocolate! I'm off to go see Thor: Ragnarok, so I'll check back later.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy crap you guys. When I left, OPs post literally had like 200 upvotes and I was like, &quot;Cool, the few people that read this will know some new stuff!&quot; I never expected to see so many responses! I'll have to get back on tomorrow and respond to more of you. It's almost 1am and I need to go to sleep for now.</p>

The darker the chocolate, the more cocoa and less sugar and other filler it has.  The darkest of chocolates are around 80% cocoa.  As the chocolate gets lighter, more sugar and additional ingredients are added.  If I remember correctly, Hershey at one point was no longer able to call their products chocolate because they did not contain the defined amount of cocoa butter.

<p>-Milk chocolate must contain milk. You can even have dark milk chocolate.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are actually legal definitions set out by the FDA as to what constitutes different kinds of chocolate.  And as a chocolate scientist (yes, that is actually my job) these are things I work with every day when I'm formulating new products.</p>
<p>Milk chocolate must contain at least 10% of what we call chocolate mass (which is cocoa beans that are ground into paste) and 12% of milk solids with 3.39% milk fat.  So essentially, milk chocolate has to have a milk component and a chocolate mass component.  The rest of the chocolate is made up of sugar and cocoa butter.  Cocoa butter is the fat portion that is extracted from the ground up cocoa beans.  </p>
<p>Dark and extra dark are actually not terms that have legal definitions.  They are used primarily for marketing purposes.  However, semisweet and bittersweet ARE legal terms that actually have the same definition.  </p>
<p>Semisweet and Bittersweet chocolate must have at least 35% chocolate mass and no more than 12% of milk solids (having any milk in it is purely optional though).  </p>
<p>Bittersweet is often used when talking about a chocolate that contains more than 50% chocolate mass, but usually once you start making chocolate with that much chocolate mass in it, you just start referring to the cacao content.  Ex. Ghirardelli has a really popular 72% cacao chocolate square (in the red wrapper) and they have an 86% cacao chocolate (called like intense dark or something).  </p>
<p>It's also really helpful to remember that the more chocolate mass you add to a chocolate the less sugar is in it.  That is why &quot;darker&quot; chocolates are more bitter.  If a chocolate is 72% cacao, it is ~ 28% sugar.  If it has 86% cacao, it has ~ 14% sugar.</p>
<p>Chocolate is quite literally my life, so if you have follow-ups, I am here for it.  </p>
<p>Source: real life chocolate scientist.  If you buy chocolate at a grocery store, you have probably eaten my chocolate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: No unless the brain is still developing.</p>
<p>I just got my degree in Psychology and can answer this in terms of brain development.
Permanent loss of vision has not been observed in adults, as u/Moorgan17 stated earlier. Permanent loss of vision has been seen however in young animals. A study was conducted years ago where one of a kitten's eyes was stitched up pretty much right from birth. I believe the eye was kept closed for about a year (at least a couple of months, but I'll double check that). When the eye was opened back up again, the kitten was permanently blind in that eye. I'll try find then start and link it. I'm on mobile right now.</p>
<p>This has to do with the Occam's razor effect that developing brains have. This behaviour transcends species and basically means &quot;If you're not using it, get rid of it&quot;. It's a way of the brain not putting effort into something that doesn't work anymore. It's even been shown that the part of the brain associated with the loss of sight ends up working on some other part of the body (kind of like how blind people have slightly heightened other senses). This is known as brain plasticity.</p>
<p>Side note: brain plasticity also works in the opposite way. A young girl had half of her brain removed in an attempt to relieve her of her constant seizures. This left the young girl paralyzed on one half of her body and with several cognitive difficulties too. Over time, however, the half of the brain that was left began to compensate for the lack of brain mass and she began to regain movement in the side of her body affected by the surgery, her language and other cognitive skills. </p>
<p>Basically brains are cool. </p>
<p>Edit: a video on Jody, the girl with half a brain <a href="https://youtu.be/VaDlLD97CLM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/VaDlLD97CLM</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: for those interested in the kitten study, see Hubel, D. H. &amp; Wiesel, T. N. (1964). Effects of Monocular Deprivation in Kittens</p>
<p>As it turns out, the kittens' eyes were sutured for only a few weeks, not even months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The blind have been proven to develop some form of echo location with practice, and further study has shown that the visual cortex is partially activated during such exercises. So in not seeing for a year, your vision won’t change when you go back to it, you may just build neural pathways to “see” sound in some capacity as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
