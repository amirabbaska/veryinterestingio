		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's how the &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; is billed but that's not what it does.</p>
<p>Just to differentiate - the Obama &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; has nothing to do with what is known as the &quot;Fiduciary Rule&quot; - which the Fiduciary Standard is frequently confused for.  If your money is in an IRA account (or any managed account), whoever is managing it has a fiduciary duty to you to act only in your best interest.  This duty precedes the &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; in question and again has nothing to do with it.  In fact the &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; hasn't even come into force yet.</p>
<p>The &quot;Fiduciary Standard&quot; only affects IRA accounts.</p>
<p>IRAs are a &quot;self&quot; managed retirement account.  In essence they are little more than a normal investment account that gets preferential tax treatment in exchange for having some restrictions placed on how you can take the money out.  Now I put &quot;self&quot; in quotations because most people just use a stock broker or other financial adviser to actually invest their money rather than picking their investments themselves.  As a self managed investment portfolio, IRA brokers use a commission model where they make a commission on every investment that the IRA makes.  </p>
<p>But these commissions aren't the same across different investment types.  The example cited by the Obama administration is that commissions on bonds are usually much lower than commissions on stocks.</p>
<p>What the Fiduciary Standard does is to prevent IRA brokers from investing money into a security solely on the basis of the commission paid.  That sounds great in principle, but in reality it creates a presumption that if an IRA broker invests money into anything other than the lowest commission security that they have done so in violation of the rule.  An IRA broker can rebut that presumption, but nobody wants to take on the risk for doing so.</p>
<p>The workaround that most companies have come up with for this is client disclosure and approval - every time your IRA broker wants to make an investment, they will have to send you something detailing the investment they want to make along with an explanation of the lowest commission alternative and then get your approval.  This creates a tremendous amount of extra work for your IRA broker, and so most of the big IRA investment companies are switching small to mid sized clients onto generic, unmanaged flat fee based accounts.</p>
<p>Since the rule was designed to help small to medium sized IRA clients obtain access to higher quality financial advice, moving those clients onto unmanaged accounts is counterproductive at best.</p>
<p>The rule doesn't really impact large managed accounts where most brokers are going to be giving their clients a call every couple of weeks anyways, and it doesn't impact unmanaged accounts at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of good debate in this thread, but I will add:</p>
<p>Right wing politics likes to portray every single issue as something every single voter should take total responsibility for. Sounds great! Right? </p>
<p>It's.. not.</p>
<p>Are you a heart surgeon?</p>
<p>Are you an accountant?</p>
<p>Are you a veterinarian?</p>
<p>Are you an auto mechanic?</p>
<p>Are you chef?</p>
<p>Odds are you can't answer yes to all of these. </p>
<p>What you can do, is express your <em>intentions</em> and let <em>their expertise</em> -- that you are paying for -- guide your actions. That's why we take our cars to mechanics and we go to the doctor. They spend years learning something so that we don't have to. Now, what happens if your mechanic says you need to do X beacuse it costs 10,000 whereas Y would cost 1,000 and give you the same or better result. You'd be pretty pissed off. The mechanic has now acted <em>against</em> your best interests because it is <em>in their best interest</em> to do so.</p>
<p>Why the regulation? Because you as a consumer may not be equipped to know the difference.</p>
<p>Capitalism works great when the solution is what works best for everyone. However, often times it is better for the capitalist to work against their customer, and do so by lying, tricking, or concealing data to do so. Or, in the case of financial planners, by doing things obscure and hard to track so that they do better for themselves at the expense of their client.</p>
<p>Regulations help this quandary, by providing guidance and legal remedy if you pay someone to do something and they work against you for their own benefit. </p>
<p>Right wingers want to make you responsible, because you should know better or something. But how can anyone know everything about every job?</p>
<p>You can't. It's not possible. A well regulated economy protects the consumer and allows honest business to thrive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>More specifically, the Wall Street firms and brokers say they are concerned the new regulations will prohibit them from charging commissions, even though Ms. Borzi has said commissions will be permitted.</p>
<p>“We think they won’t adequately allow for commission-based accounts and therefore investors will be hurt,” said Ira Hammerman, general counsel for Sifma. “It’s like, ‘Just trust me. We will work it out.' ”</p>
<p>Fiduciaries under Erisa, as it’s written now, cannot be paid in ways that would pose a conflict of interest. But the way brokers and insurance agents are compensated often contains potential conflicts: a broker might receive a higher commission for recommending one investment over another. And arrangements known as revenue sharing, where mutual fund companies share a portion of their revenue with the brokerage firm selling the fund, also provide opportunities for conflicts. Fund companies that pay more, experts said, might get a spot on the firm’s list of recommended funds.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI13: The Thalamus is the brains stimulus filter. it decides what stimuli are important enough to be processed. The humming of electricity, the feeling of your underwear against your butt, and the smell of wet dog in your house are ignored. Your thalamus has determined that these things are not dangerous and you can ignore them. A siren passing in the distance, a bomb going off, or a bright flashing light will attract your attention because it is different and considered important.
When you are asleep, your thalamus works the same way but on a more lenient system. Some stimuli might wake you up but if it isnt important enough you will fall back asleep without even remembering (a light turning on in the hallway or a dog barking). Others might keep you up for hours (a door slam, gun shot or the smell of smoke). It all depends on the type of stimulation and how important your thalamus decides it is for you to be awake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we sleep, we are inhibiting loads of different parts of the brain, so a stronger stimulus is required to activate them. </p>
<p>Think of it like this - when we are awake there is a copper wire between the auditory centre of the brain and the higher centres of our brain that process and understand this auditory information and then respond to it. Copper is a very conductive metal, so even a very small voltage will mean that electricity passes through this circuit. </p>
<p>When we go to sleep, this copper wire is switched out with a lead wire. Now lead can still conduct electricity, but it is much less conductive than copper. This means that a much higher voltage is required to get any activity in the circuit. Standard, background sounds of the night are unlikely to provide a big enough voltage to get a current to run though the wire. A really loud sound, however, will provide enough voltage and will wake us up. Other sounds that have very strong associations in our memory, e.g. our ringtone, alarm tone or a doorbell, may also provide enough voltage in the circuit even if they're a bit quieter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The RAS (reticular activating system) which is actually a diffuse network. </p>
<p>It responds to all the senses except for smell. One time I had a college student ask me if the RAS didnt respond to smell how someone would wake up when they were given ammonia to smell (a common way of trying to wake an unconscious person) - the answer is they arent waking due to the smell but because ammonia irritates the mucosa of the nasal passages. </p>
<p>The RAS distinguishes between things important to good survival and things not. So if you move to a lake and there are ducks quacking all night, they may keep you up a few nights but soon you will learn to filter and tune them out and sleep right through the quacking.</p>
<p>it is also why if you suddenly start dating someone who drives a specific car you will suddenly see that make of car EVERYWHERE. Because you are interested in breeding with them, passing on DNA and its important to survival - you will notice things related to your sexual partner.</p>
<p>What is important to me is that we filter things related to success.</p>
<p>I wrote a small self-published book of true stories designed to help condition a persons RAS to filter in things for success, and filter out things for failure. </p>
<p>There are always opportunities to succeed or fail around us and some people notice the opportunities and some notice the opportunities to fail.  </p>
<p>The stories are designed to change the filter a person has to success. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

To supplement, it should be noted that even if you don't wake up, the quality of your sleep is thought to be affected if you're exposed to high intensity and irregular noises. Living near an airport, for instance, is thought to increase your risk of a cardiovascular disease even if you say that you don't mind it or enjoy it or whatever. </p>

<p>Many galaxies - such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud" target="_blank">Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)</a> have no obvious centre.</p>
<p>The LMC has many high-energy sources. Some are probably neutron stars, and some may be black holes. There is no exceptional mass in the LMC centre. Although the LMC is clearly a first-class galaxy, it's not a classic spiral.</p>
<p>Large Spiral Galaxies all have something very massive at the centre. And because they have billions of stars, it's very likely that the thing in the middle is a black hole.</p>
<p>So: Globular clusters and elliptical galaxies: Often not.</p>
<p>Large spiral galaxies: Almost always.</p>
<p>But there are many, many very weird galaxies out there.</p>
<p>Be careful of general rules. We didn't know that galaxies existed until the <del>1950</del>s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)" target="_blank">1920s</a>  - thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/themeaningofhaste" target="_blank">/u/themeaningofhaste</a> Black holes were controversial <del>20</del>30 years ago.</p>

The larger a star is, the faster it burns itself out. As the universe is over 13 billion years old, all of the largest objects in the universe are black holes, not stars.</p>
<p>All massive galaxies are believed to have supermassive black holes at their core; whether or not they all do is as yet unknown. One problem is that black holes cannot be easily detected without seeing objects fall into them and get ripped apart; a supermassive black hole without matter falling into it can only be detected by its gravity, which can be difficult at extreme distances.</p>
<p>Smaller galaxies may not have supermassive black holes at their core; while some appear to, we haven't found any in others, so they may not be a universal feature of all galaxies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You mentioned your involvement in the development of solar sails for micro payloads to be sent to nearby stars at nearly the speed of light. I was wondering about how the development of this technology is progressing and your thoughts on the timescale this could be achieved by and the impact it could have. </p>
<p>As a follow up question, with the growing problems on Earth, how important is space exploration for the future of mankind?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally juries have two choices, Guilty or not guilty. There is an assumption that for you to be presented to the courts that an incident has taken place and it is generally taken that the jury needs to get <strong>beyond reasonable doubt</strong> of your guilt. </p>
<p>There is no general definition of beyond reasonable doubt, because what is reasonable is different from one person to the next.</p>
<p>For example, you're found in a room with a baseball bat and a broken vase. We are trying ascertaining whether you are guilty of breaking the vase. </p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence is presented that you were in the room, witnesses say they saw you go in the room. They heard the bat swing, they heard the vase crash to the floor and smash.  </li>
</ul>
<p>From this information, you could reasonably be found guilty, you had the means (baseball bat) and opportunity (you were in the room). To Joe Average, you hit or knocked the vase over when swinging the bat. At this stage, with this infomation, it could be reasonable to find you Guilty.</p>
<p>You defence team comes along and add further information including:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Your cat was also in the room and she is very scared of baseball bats swinging through the air, she tends to scramble when scared and it was the cat that knocked over the vase. Witnesses are able to confirm that the cat was present.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now in my mind, as the jury, I think you are guilty. And without the presentation of the defence I would find you guilty. But because of the evidence that the cat was in the room, I can't be completely sure that it wasn't the cat. Now because I now have reasonable doubt and I now can't move beyond that, I need to find you not guilty. I still think you did it, I don't think you are innocent. For all I know you either hit the vase or caused the cat to knock over the vase, so I don't think you are innocent so i find you 'Not Guilty', because I can't move beyond what's reasonable and find you guilty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's precisely because you're presumed innocent until proven guilty that you're found not guilty.</p>
<p>The burden of proof is on the prosecutor to prove you're guilty. If they fail to prove you're guilty, it doesn't mean you're innocent. It means <strong>they could not prove you did it</strong> which means you're not guilty. </p>
<p>Let's pretend there's a oreo cookie jar in a room with 2 children Tom &amp; Bob. Tom always does the right thing and doesn't like ores. Bob always lies and loves oreos. Let's pretend Bob ate the cookies while nobody was watching. If you came back into the room, you suspect Bob did it. Tom says Bob did it. Bob says Tom did it. It was probably Bob but you can't prove it. It's unlikely but possible that Tom lied (reasonable doubt). Since it's innocent until proven guilty, Bob would be found not guilty. He's not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but he's also not innocent. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food for thought:</p>
<p>in Latin, guilty can be translated &quot;nocens&quot;
and not guilty is: &quot;innocens&quot;</p>
<p>The expression you are mentioning comes a French dude, Jean Lemoine, and he suggested: &quot;item quilibet praesumitur innocens nisi probetur nocens&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone is presumed innocent if not approved to be guilty&quot;</p>
<p>you see the problem there, the latin word &quot;innocens&quot; made it into English. The other, &quot;nocens&quot; not so much. English has its own version with &quot;guilt&quot; from Old English &quot;gylt&quot;</p>
<p>In German, neither word made it. So, &quot;innocens&quot; is just &quot;unschuldig&quot; (literally: not guilty) and &quot;nocens&quot; would be &quot;schuldig&quot; (guilty). So, if you translate the same expression from Latin into German, and then from German into English, it would be &quot;Not guilty until proven guilty&quot;</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, your question is just an English thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a lot less strictly defined that one might imagine. Every team is different, but the general breakdowns are:</p>
<p>Studios provide resources (locations, gear, access to people) and financing. The waters are muddied substantially when they insist on creative control to go with said financing and additional resources.</p>
<p>Producers handle the logistics of actually getting the thing off the ground. They will (with outsourcing where necessary) generally get everything going. Hire the right people, set up the meetings. They're like the manager of the shoot. Their job is to make sure everything is ready to go for everyone ELSE to do their jobs. Kinda like how a music producer might get two or more musicians, some writers and a really great recording studio to all collaborate on a track... they produce it. They got everyone together.</p>
<p>Directors are the person at the helm of the creative ship. They work within constraints set by the producer and the big money people, but they are there to make sure a cohesive vision and style get stuck to.</p>
<p>Sometimes directors also produce and visa versa. Sometimes they exec-produce their own produce their own projects too. It's a pretty hazily defined job spec and literally can change on every project.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally when making a movie, the Studio has the money.  They're paying for everything, own and/or rent the equipment.  They lose the money or make the money.  This is not to be confused with a distributor, who makes sure that the movie gets to places where people can see it.</p>
<p>The Director is in charge of the &quot;artistic vision&quot; of the movie by determining what goes into the film.  They pick the shots that the DP or cameraperson uses.  They coax the right performance from the actors.  They interpret the screenplay.   They have the &quot;glamorous&quot; job.  There are different types of directors who handle other responsibilities, but that isn't important now.</p>
<p>The Producer, that's the fun job.  And by fun, I mean aggravating, stressful, insane, frantic, and psychotic.  The producer's job is to make sure that the Director can do their job with the least amount of stress possible while balancing the needs of the Studio.  They are in charge of every aspect of the film, from location scouting to catering to hiring the staff and actors.  A large movie will have multiple producers, and department heads that report to these producers.</p>
<p>It's a similar breakdown for TV shows and other media, but in those fields, the Director is less important for artistic vision.  That's where the Show Runner comes in.  They're usually a Producer/Director hybrid who is in charge of the overall story, while a different Director is brought in for each episode.  There is a lot of work that goes in to all of these jobs for a movie, but the Director has a harder job week to week than the Producers or Studio.  Think of it like this:  For a TV show like Doctor Who, the Producers put together a budget per show for the season, and a budget for the whole season.  Some sets and locations are going to be used several times throughout the year to save time.  The Producers and Show Runners put together the story arcs, and pick Directors for each episode, while they give the Studio the budget.  The Studio gives the Producers the money, equipment, and access they need while the Production Staff gets to work making things work for the whole season.  The Writers will write the episodes, about 1 per week, and the first few Directors will get started on the setup.  They'll work with and fight with the Producers on what can and can't be done per episode, then the Director will spend a month working on their pre-production, and about a week shooting the episode.  The next Director follows along a week later, and so on and so on, until the end of the season.  After each episode is shot, it goes to Post-Production for editing, effects, and other stuff.</p>
<p>I've done some limited work with all three of these spots, and my favorite of them was where the action was.  It's a flippant answer, but I enjoyed the stress and panic of doing it all.  I enjoyed having to crunch the numbers to see if we could afford to shoot in the abandoned bank, or if we'd need to rewrite the script to omit an overly expensive scene.  I loved making the production schedule, breaking down everything into logical blocks.  If we had a house for a day and needed to shoot five scenes at different times of the year, how do we do it?  What differences in the characters and location need to be tracked?  Do we REALLY need the Bentley for this shot, or will the Caddy work?  For directing, I loved the fact that I was making people give me the reactions I want for the shot, and that anything goes.  They're like puppets with pulses.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I should begin with the disclaimer that I'm not an expert in the subject. That being said, I do have a very strong interest in geopolitics and can hopefully provide a half-decent answer until someone better educated comes along. Of the top of my head, I can think of three potential reasons for why Oman is relatively stable compared to other Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<p>First, most Muslim states (in the Middle East and elsewhere) are either predominately Shia or Sunni. Oman is the one exception to this, as it is primarily Ibadi. As such, it has largely stayed out of Shia-Sunni conflicts.</p>
<p>Second, it has a relatively diverse economy, which means that it is more stable than if it was solely based on oil. You can also see this is the UAE (particularly in Dubai) and other areas of MENA with a diversified economy.</p>
<p>Third, I think that your original premise is based on a flawed assumption. You said that it's in the middle of chaos, but it isn't. Oman borders 3 other states: KSA, Yemen, and the UAE. Of these, Yemen is the only one that is currently undergoing significant strife. Compared to other parts of the Arab world (Somalia, Palestine, Iraq), the Gulf States (with the exception of Iraq) are relatively stable and prosperous.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also not an Oman expert, but I have a reasonable grasp of Middle Eastern geopolitics. </p>
<p>/u/entropydecreaser has made some good points: Oman's economy is relatively stable and its geographic position is advantageous- away from major lines of conflict in the region. It is a long way from one end of the Arabian Peninsula to the other, and Oman have no reason to get themselves too closely involved with what is happening over a thousand miles northwest. Oman is also tucked away behind the 'empty quarter', the largest sand desert in the world, which makes external interference, particularly military action, extremely difficult. </p>
<p>I would say that the major factor, though (in my opinion) is the fact that Oman has existed as an entity for centuries. Almost no ME states preexist the 20th century and even those which can claim to, such as Egypt or arguably Iran, have been shaped by colonialism and revolution over the past hundred years or so. It is in stark contrast, therefore, that Oman have not only been free of colonial domination for over 250 years, but at one point had a sizeable empire of their own.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Oman has been entirely free of conflict or upheaval (it has not), but it is a far more 'natural' state than those created by colonial powers in the Levant, and they have a degree of institutional continuity through the monarchy that is unmatched in the Middle East. This is in stark contrast to those states created by treaty in the early 20th century, which have been highly unstable since, and because of, their drawing on the map. </p>
<p>Obviously I may be corrected my someone with more expertise, but that would be my take on the question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I put a web cam on my indoor hydroponic garden for a few months to take a time lapse. It was scary how much plants like mint explode outwards and wrap around everything around it. The plants also move to a rhythm like a beating heart, rising up, and relaxing down at regular intervals in time with day and night cycles of the lamps. </p>
<p>The way that plants move is actually kind of cool. They use hydraulics! An increase in pressure forces movement over time much like squeezing a tube of toothpaste causes it to move. Not all plants follow the sun exactly but some do orient themselves east or west in order to maximize their exposure throughout the day. Other plants are shade loving and avoid direct sunlight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was playing some catch the other day with a friend of mine. He would run off down the field, and I would throw the ball, and 90% of the time it was an accurate throw to him. The other 10% was due to wind difference, so I would adjust the throw and make it to him. All of that is done automatically in our brains, and it works pretty fast. </p>
<p>Now, why is it that when we see the same situation, but on paper, it takes time to calculate all of that information. Is it because our brains see the actual numbers compared to real world events that are happening right there? Or shouldn't our brain be able to pick that information and automatically translate it, as if it were happening right there? </p>
<p>Edit: fixed wording. But man, this blew up, and got a lot of great responses for this. Initially had it marked as physics, but I see it got changed to psychology. Very interesting. Thanks for all that took time, and made the explanation better for me! </p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Physicist Seville Chapman proposed a model to explain how players manage the path of a fly ball so that  they arrive to intercept it at just the right time. His theory, called Optical Acceleration Cancellation (OAC), used the acceleration of the ball through the vision field as a guide for player movement.</p>
<p>As a fielder watches the ball rise, he moves either forward or backwards so that the ball moves at a constant speed through his field of vision. If he moves too far forward, the ball will rise faster and may eventually fly over his head. If he takes too many steps back, the ball will appear to rise slower and will drop in front of him. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here focus on the fact that most of the free porn out there are either samplers or low quality amateur work. However, the proliferation of these tube sites with an indigestible mountain of freely available porn points towards other factors as well.</p>
<p>Why doesn't the porn industry crack down on copyright issues as hard as Hollywood? To get to the root of this issue, we have to think about the role of a movie/film versus that of porn.</p>
<p>Let's first agree that both pornos and blockbuster films are scarce goods. They are limited, and they have some value to consumers. The point I want to make is that porn is commoditized; movies are not. What I mean here is that, for an average consumer of porn, it doesn't matter if they are going to watch Lusty Milfs 5 or Busty Soccer Moms 7; they're just going to pick the one that's most easily available to them. On the other hand, movie goers definitely care if they are watching Star Wars versus Star Trek.</p>
<p>There a variety of reasons for this, but the net result is the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pornos are commodities, and they are priced at commodity prices. Within a certain porn genre, all else being equal, one film is more or less indistinguishable from another.</li>
<li>Movies are hard to commoditize. Even within the same genre, you'll be hard-pressed to convince someone bent on watching the new Star Wars movie to settle for Star Trek, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are certain exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fans of a certain porn actor/actress will have a stickier (heh) preference towards certain films, and to them, they are not indistinguishable from other films.</li>
<li>Certain genres of movie films are nearly commoditized. For example, people who go for one rom-com probably wouldn't mind if they were told that they had to settle for another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, there are two sets of dynamics we need to look at. First, we need to discuss what the outcome of this type of market is; next, we need to discuss why this is the way things are.</p>
<h3>So what if Porn is a commodity good?</h3>
<p>Well, since porn (especially within a specific genre) is more or less indistinguishable from other porn, they undergo heavy competition. In particular, the competitive nature of the market tend to push their price down towards a nearly-optimal commodity price. That is, porn in its current form tend to be lowly-valued and directly selling porn (in the current state of affairs) is a low-margin affair. This can be seen not only by the proliferation of cheap studio access passes ($1 a month specials are pushing it these days), but also by the fact that most of the porn that are consumed costs absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>Therefore, since porn is valued so cheaply, it's actually very inefficient to sell them directly. Instead, porn producers and distributors have realized that selling the attention of users of their pages to interested advertisers actually captures higher revenues. This is why you see some of the most clever ad-blocker workarounds on these porn sites; that's where they get most of their revenues from, even the more reputable sites.</p>
<p>In addition, because producing porn is a low-margin affair itself, there's really no reason to spend a lot of money towards a high-production film. As a result, the porno landscape is dominated by near-amateur level work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because block-buster films cannot be commoditized, they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are much pricier, and they</li>
<li>Tend to be higher production value, because in order to price their films at a higher price, they need to give some justification that their goods are higher quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, companies like Hulu and Netflix are trying to create revenue by commoditizing the movie/film sector, so our perceptions may change in the future. Additionally, porn wasn't always a commodity. When distribution cost (the problem of getting a porn film to the hands of a consumer) was a significant bottle-neck, they couldn't be sold at a commodity price because their supply was much more limited than today.</p>
<h3>So what changed?</h3>
<p>The internet. Let's look at the major way in which porn and films were consumed before the rise of the internet. Blockbuster movies were usually viewed in a movie theater; porn usually in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>Once internet speed and bandwidth were fast/large enough, it was able to &quot;commoditize&quot; (here, improve the efficiency, hence lowering the price of) the distribution of movies to your home. Porn was hit hard by this innovation, but movies were still more or less something that you still had to watch in theater.</p>
<p>Because the porn industry was suddenly able to streamline their supply-chain, porn-sites started popping up. This lowered the barrier of entry into the porn industry, because now you don't have to negotiate deals with brick-n-mortar Adult XXX Videomax store fronts. You just need a website.</p>
<p>With the main distribution bottle-neck solved, content started to flood the internet. As a result of the increase of the supply, its price dropped significantly. As a result, the internet commoditized porn and made it a relatively cheap (discounting opportunity cost) venture to go into.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyways, other digitizable goods that were/are commoditized by the internet includes video games, music, news, journals, and to a certain extent, movies and television shows. For each one of these goods, you'll often find a similar content pathway. You have way more green-lit Steam games than what has been stocked at Game Stop; Spotify has more music than you can fit on an iPod; etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pornhub, youporn, redtube, and most other main porn websites are all owned by the same company, MindGeek, that owns major porn production cimpanies such as Babes, Brazzers, etc. It is basically a monopoly of producers and distributors, which means that the movies are uploaded directly as they are produced, since the views end up as revenue for the company either way.</p>
<p>Many others producers also upload incomplete videos to these websites in hopes of attracting premium customers. it's the equivalent of handing out movie trailers to cinemas, but the trailers themselves are usually enough to satisfy most viewers.</p>
<p>Since they can't stream in cinemas and the rental industry doesn't pay ad well, the production of online videos is prominent in the industry; that also makes it easier to pirate, and it is difficult to win lawsuits against a large company such as mindgeek so I doubt people would try. You also have a steady production of free videos like amateur porn.</p>
<p>You can find many regular movies online for free, it's just that they are lower quality or not protected by copyright. The movies that are nkt readily available are the ones produced by huge distributors, who make their money off official sales in cinema and dvd stores. </p>
<p>Also, With porn, the demand for higher quality is lower, and the production process is easier (budget and time wise) so there are a lot more movies being produced on a regular basis. You could probably make 100 movies in the time it takes to plan out and film a blockbuster, no bureaucracy to stop the process in its tracks, and the budget is minimal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that most of the free porn out there is either amateur porn (which costs almost nothing to make), free samples from a pay site, or pirated.</p>
<p>Think about it this way. Literally anyone with a camera can make a serviceable porno for literally or almost nothing, but even a half-decent independent movie takes at least a couple hundred thousand dollars to make. Usually millions.</p>
<p>So naturally, there are going to be more porno movies than regular movies to begin with.</p>
<p>Since it costs so much less to make, you could potentially fill an ad-supported site with thousands of user-made videos, free samples from pay sites, or straight-up pirated porn (especially on sites that allow user uploads, since you get plausible deniability) for little or no cost, and then collect all that sweet ad revenue.</p>
<p>To do that with a movie site, you'd have to either pay to make the movie, or pay to license the movie. Which could cost you more than it costs to upload thousands of amateur porno clips. But you'd still only have one movie! So it would be very hard to do it 100% on ad revenue. Since a movie is much longer (two hours +) than a typical porn clip (5-20 minutes), your bandwidth costs per user are also much higher. Especially if, you know, they finish browsing early.</p>
<p>It's also the reason why YouTube is FULL of people talking about their opinions into their webcams but only has a handful of properly free ad-supported (not pirated) movies. Any moron with a mic and a camera can become a YouTuber, but making even a shitty movie requires a budget and at least basic film-making skills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the problem is you are comparing Pornhub with Hollywood when you should be comparing Pornhub with youtube. </p>
<p>Youtube is full of free content made by people who just wanted to make something and put it out there or to rake in a little revenue from ads / merchandise / exposure. It's also a dumping ground of stuff that nobody owns the rights to anymore (or the people who do don't care to challenge anyone for it). </p>
<p>Porn sites are the same thing: amatuer videos made by people who just wanted to make something, or companies uploading shortened clips of their professional stuff for exposure and advertising reasons. When you see professional stuff on these sites it's either a clip of a much larger video uploaded for the reasons I stated before, a movie made by a company that doesn't exist anymore (porn companies come and go like the tides) or doesn't have the resources to constantly challenge pirate uploads, or a pirate upload nobody has caught yet (many porn sites aren't as helpful with fulfilling take-down requests as youtube is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hope this helps a little but I watched an interview with this crazy porn recruiter once. The man claimed to be Ron Jeremy's cousin and I feel that might have been one of his trust-inducing lines though he did look a bit like Jeremy. His 'job' was waiting at the Hollywood bus station and recruiting witless new 'actresses' into the porn business.</p>
<p>Anyways, he explained porn in such ELI5 ways. He simply explained that in fact they are totally aware that 99% of porn viewers actually do not care about the topic, theme, fetish (or no fetish). Typical guy would just as easily watch &quot;Spanking Lesbians part 76&quot; as he'd watch 'Shaved Juggs' <em>and</em> that they (porn makers) they know full well 99% will pay the lowest price or watch free.. whatever is quickly available. </p>
<p>But wait.. see, he explains, the money is totally in that tiny 1% fraction. All the money. 99% of the cash comes from a tiny little group. Obsessed, niche-market infatuated 'fetish' kink people. </p>
<p>So what they do is make &quot;Lactating Jugs parts 1-110&quot; because they will barely make a penny from the 99% of viewers who are totally satisfied seeing ANY Jugs. They are a 'wash', a neutral, nothing either way.</p>
<p>BUT holy hell.. whoever is the 1% (or.0001%) he explains are psychofans. Yes, they will watch the free episodes but more importantly if they are who signs up for the mailing lists, notifications of new episodes, the exclusive 'lactating jugs VIP memberships' and they will drive across LA in rush hour to be the very first to stand in line paying $59.99 for the new Blu-Ray release of Lac-Jugs 111. Oh and hoarding 110 previous DVDs and Blu-rays like they were made of gold. </p>
<p>In a real way, they actually want to make 99% of their movies available for free HOPING that big free net catches 1% who will then gladly pay a lot of money for the 1% of movies they hold back as pay-only for a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
