		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory may not be <em>completely</em> understood but the basic understanding of it is there. Essentially, memory is just associations between neurons firing at the same time. </p>
<p>The saying in neurology is &quot;Neurons that fire together, wire together.&quot; What this means is let's say you smell smoke and hear someone says &quot;I smell the campfire&quot; and your eyes take in the imagine of a campfire. <strong>The following neurons are firing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The neurons in your olfactory part of your brain that register the smoke smell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optical neurons recognizing the visual pattern of a roaring fire</p>
</li>
<li>Neurons in the temporal lobes that heard the vocal words &quot;<em>I smell campfire&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Those three sets of neurons all fired at the same time and now have a faint connection with each other. Now if just one of them fires (e.g. You smell smoke) it will trigger the other two sets of neurons and you'll think the word <em>campfire</em> and get the mental image of it.</p>
<p>Repeated exposures help build stronger and stronger connections and make the &quot;memory&quot; more concrete. If someone always says &quot;<em>Hello, my name is Bob!&quot;</em> every time you see their face, you're going to very quickly associate their name with their face. Everything you know as memory is just associations between neurons that wired together because they fired together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurons, the cells that make up your brain, have an input and an output. The input is the output from other neurons. They're all interconnected, and that creates a huge network! Inputs and outputs are electrical signals: there either <em>is</em> a signal, or there <em>isn't</em>. If a neuron receives an input of 1, meaning the connected neuron <em>fired</em>, then this neuron might also fire. But that depends on the chemical composition of the neuron. This is really complex. If the chemical composition inside a neuron requires a lot of connected neurons to fire before it fires, it has a high threshold. When it only requires one or a few neurons to fire, it has a low threshold. This chemical composition can change, thus altering the neuron's threshold. This is how memories are made! When a memory is created, some neurons will have their thresholds lower, and some will have their thresholds higher. Let's say you see the color blue. Photo (light) receptors in your retina fire when they come into contact with blue light. At the same time, neurons in your ear hear the word &quot;blue.&quot; An association can form over time between the color perceived and the word heard by altering the chemical compositions of neurons!</p>
<p>This is obviously an extreme simplification of how the brain works (it is extremely complicated, and I don't know nearly enough to do this question justice), and the other comments are right: how memories are made and stored is still an active area of research, but we know this is how it works on a chemical level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>That is why we cannot even definitively say why we need to sleep. We know the brain needs it. We have theories that sleep has to do with storing and processing memories, but on a physical level we cannot even tell you why you need to sleep. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Declaring bankruptcy is seeking legal protection from your creditors (people you owe money to). As far as personal bankruptcies go, chapter 7 is what people generally think of when they bankruptcy. The courts allow you to discharge your unsecured debts (credit cards, medical bills, personal/ payday loans, civil lawsuits, repossessed vehicles, foreclosed real estate, etc). The entire process takes a few months to be discharged and you also have to income qualify- if you make more than the median income in your state you would have to pay back some portion of your debts. You can only do this once every eight years, it will bring down your credit score as you have demonstrated that you were unable to pay back your debts and creditors in the future might not want to lend to you or only will at a higher interest rate. </p>
<p>A chapter 13 is a bit different and can deal with other debts as well as unsecured. You would file this if you make too much for a chapter 7, if you are behind on a financed vehicle/ real estate that you want to keep, if you have a lot of back taxes to pay off or to freeze student loans. A monthly payment would be determined based on which of those debts are being dealt with, how much the debts are and also on your income. You would make this payment to a bankruptcy trustee for 3-5 years and your unsecured creditors would receive a percentage of their debts, secured creditors receive 100% (generally). You would be discharged of any unpaid debts at the end of the bankruptcy. </p>
<p>This is an overview of the type I'd give to a person seeking information about filing. Source: legal assistant to a bankruptcy attorney. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the <a href="https://redd.it/jerb3" target="_blank">previous thread</a> - this is a great ELI5 version </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like you're Five: On the day you get your allowance, you buy a bag of candy. The next day, you want more candy, but you spent your allowance, so you ask your brother if you can borrow his allowance, and pay him back with your next allowance. You buy another bag of candy. The next day you ask your sister if you can borrow her allowance, and promise to pay her back when you get your allowance. You buy another bag of candy.</p>
<p>When you finally get your allowance, you realise you're in trouble - you can't pay your brother and your sister. You get so worried about it that you go buy a bag of candy instead. When you get home, you get in a big fight with your brother and sister about it.</p>
<p>When your Mom asks what you're fighting about, your brother and sister tell her that you borrowed money and you won't give it back. She asks you why not, and you say that you spent all of the money on candy, and you don't have any money left. She sighs, and makes you give all the candy you have left to your brother and sister. They want to know when they get their money back, and she tells them the money is gone, and they need to stop fighting with you and forgive you. They say that that isn't fair, and she says that it really isn't, and that they should remember this the next time you ask them for money.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy is a highly nuanced area of the law. With that in mind, I provide the following answers in <em>very</em> ELI5 terms.</p>
<p>Let's first make a distinction between &quot;bankruptcy&quot; and &quot;solvency.&quot; The terms &quot;bankrupt&quot; and &quot;insolvent&quot; are often used interchangeably in common discussion, but they are entirely different (albeit related) legal concepts. &quot;Solvency&quot; refers to a person's/company's ability to pay his or her debts. If you are unable to pay your debts as they come due, you are &quot;insolvent.&quot; &quot;Bankruptcy&quot; specifically means the legal proceedings in which an insolvent debtor pays, reorganizes, and/or discharges its debts.</p>
<p>So in any bankruptcy proceeding, you have a debtor (the bankrupt party) and (usually) <em>several</em> creditors to whom the debtor is indebted. The problem is that the debtor has no way to pay back the creditors. Bankruptcy provides an orderly, judicially-administered process by which the debtor partially satisfies and/or reorganizes its debt. In very general terms, bankruptcy seeks to maximize the recovery for creditors in a way that protects the debtor from being constantly mired in an unending cycle of lawsuits and debt collection. Without bankruptcy, creditors would essentially race one another to the courthouse to try to get as big a piece of the debtor's remaining assets as possible. This would create situations where a debtor's credit card company (for example) could get a 100% recovery on the debtor's credit card debt, while the debtor's mortgage lender (who is owed way more money) gets nothing.</p>
<p>As you note, there are several chapters of bankruptcy, which include:</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Liquidation - In this chapter, a debtor's assets are liquidated (auctioned off for cash) and the proceeds are divvied up among the creditors. In the context of an individual person's bankruptcy, there are several carve-outs (&quot;exemptions&quot;) for property that they get to keep, in spite of their debts. If an individual debtor obeys the rules of the bankruptcy court (e.g., doesn't try to hide assets), he'll get a &quot;discharge,&quot; which means that (most of) his debts are wiped clean at the end of the proceedings. If the debtor is a company, ALL of its assets are sold and it essentially dies.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, Municipal Bankruptcy - A rather uncommon type of case, chapter 9 cases involve municipal institutions that have become insolvent. It permits the reorganization of their debts <em>kind of</em> like a Chapter 11 below.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, Reorganization - In these cases, the debtor (usually a business) still has a lot of value and income. It just needs a little help to pay its bills. In a chapter 11, the goal is to come up with a &quot;plan&quot; that reorganizes the terms of the debtor's debt. If a plan is successfully confirmed, it becomes the new deal between the debtor and the creditors going forward.</p>
<p>Chapter 12, Farmers and Fisherfolk - This is essentially a specific type of Chapter 13 bankruptcy (below) available to farmers, fishermen and the like. These are kind of uniquely positioned debtors because these are often blue collar jobs that require very high capital commitments.</p>
<p>Chapter 13, Reorganization - Available only for individual persons who meet specific debt requirements, these are quicker and easier proceedings that permit an individual to reorganize his debts.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, International Bankruptcy - Chapter 15 permits creditors or debtors in a foreign bankruptcy proceeding to obtain certain bankruptcy relief in the U.S.</p>
<p>So that's it in <em>very</em> broad strokes. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>File for bankruptcy in bankruptcy court. Follow all the correct rules and procedures. Judge bangs gavel. Makes debt disappear.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 is for throwing in the towel. You sell your assets, except those assets which are exempt. The proceeds are divided among your creditors. You get any change leftover. There won't be any change leftover. All of your debts, except for certain kinds like student loans or debts that you got because you hurt someone go away.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 is for hitching up to the plow. You agree to work for 3 or 4 or 5 years and some amount of your proceeds go towards your creditors. At the end, all of your debts, except for the same kind mentioned above, go away.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 is for reorganization. Businesses with a ton of assets who got too far in debt to dig themselves out can do this. The creditors may take over the company, or you may get to keep it. It depends on what you can bring in and what everyone, including the court, agrees to.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 is like Chapter 13, but for farmers.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 is like Chapter 11, but for cities.</p>

Due to increasing influence by religious fundamentalist minorities, he feels empowered to systematically dismantle first the military, then the courts, then the remaining legal obstacles that would stop his religious backers from maintaining power.</p>
<p>Since he has largely succeeded in these acts, he has now managed to reach the most basic layer of the civilian legal system in Turkey - its constitution. To legitimize his actions and ensure that there cannot be a legal counter-revolution against him and his religious fundamentalist backers, he is rewriting chunks of the constitution to effectively outlaw his opposition or actions they would wish to take to under mine him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different amendments being voted on by the general public. some good, some complicated and some downright terrible. The good and complicated ones are however only there for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>The whole thing boils down to a power grab by Turkey's current president Tayyip Erdogan, in essence he is trying to make the role of president significantly more powerful by taking power away from other branches of government and giving it to the President(himself). </p>
<p>These changes are purportedly in response to last years failed coup. They are generally supported by the ruling AKP party and opposed by everyone else. The AKP says they are needed to fight terrorism and future coup attempts.</p>
<p>Now a little history. Turkey has a long history of coups, but a little different to what you may expect. Coups in Turkey are generally carried out by the military when the government tries to subvert democracy and in general becomes too tyrannical. So these coups are generally carried out to preserve democracy and secularism. This is odd to say the least if you know anything about coups.</p>
<p>TL;DR Over the past few years Erdogan and the AKP have become increasingly authoritarian. There was a failed coup attempt in 2016, this has been used as further justification to crack down on civil liberties, free speech and the press. There is a constitutional referendum planned with the general aim of giving the president more power in 2017.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biologist here.  Some of the other answers hit around the reason, but none that I see yet tell the whole story.</p>
<p>First, you have to understand how traits arise.  Mutations happen in the DNA of animals.  If the mutation helps, it spreads.  If it hurts, it doesn't.  But the mutation has to actually <em>happen</em> in the first place.  A mutation to make slight changes is more likely than one that creates a whole new thing out of nothing.</p>
<p>So, early vertebrates breath using gills, getting oxygen from the water.  They also have nostrils, and these are used for smelling chemicals in the water.  In some fish, these nostrils connect to the roof of the mouth, so the fish can smell what it's eating.</p>
<p>Eventually, some fish move into shallow, stagnant waters. There's not a lot of oxygen there, so they start gulping air at the surface.  Goldfish do this today, even. It works a little bit even if all you have is gills.  Some fish progress to swallowing air down into the gut, which is highly vascularized and can take in oxygen even better.  Some then develop pouches off the gut...which wind up being lungs.  So eventually these fish are gulping down air to their lungs, but some also take air in through those nostrils, which remember connect to the roof of the mouth/throat.  That way they don't have to stick their whole head out of the water to take in air, just the tip of the snout.</p>
<p>Now some fish eventually wind up transitioning into tetrapods, aka land animals.  These just carry along the system that existed before, breathing through mouth and nostrils, but modifying it to be ever more efficient.  So why don't they sprout a bunch more holes all over their body to take air directly to the lungs?  They never have the chance, because a) mutations that cause holes all over the body leading to the lungs just aren't likely  b) they'd probably kill an animal outright if they <em>did</em> happen and c) even if they weren't deadly, it's unlikely they'd work better than the fine-tuned preexisting nose-and-mouth system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Openings to the body create other issues, one being the maintenance of a sterile environment inside the body.  All of them can be pathways for infection to enter the body.  The respiratory &quot;tree&quot; is lined with cilia that move mucus up to the throat, then it is swallowed into the stomach, where stomach acid kill any bacteria.</p>
<p>Also, having a single airway allows us to use the air for speech generation (larynx), which has been vital in the development of human culture, but also important for almost all chordates.  Having some dead space in the respiratory tree also allows for the air to be warmed as we inhale and for decreasing respiratory water losses due to evaporation.  Consider also that we use the same upper airway system (well, the oropharynx anyway) for eating and drinking, which minimizes the number of openings to the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Morning guys! I just had a nice spacey-breakfast and read your replies! Thanks!
So for some reason I thought that objects accelerating in space would continue to accelerate, turns out this isn't the case (unless they are being propelled infinitely). Which made me think that there must be tonnes of asteroids that have been accelerating through space (without being acted upon by another object) for billions of years and must be travelling at near light speed...scary thought. </p>
<p>So from what I can understand from your replies, this isn't the case. For example, if debris flies out from an exploding star it's acceleration will only continue as long as that explosion, than it will stop accelerating and continue at that constant speed forever or until acted upon by something else (gravity from a nearby star or planet etc) where it then may speed up or slow down. </p>
<p>I also now understand that to continue accelerating it would require more and more energy as the mass of the object increases with the speed, thus the FTL ship conundrum. </p>
<p>Good luck explaining that to a five year old ;)</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a meteorologist so it's hard to answer this sort of thing. There doesn't seem to be much published on the question. It is just worth noting that thunderstorms are typically quite large — 15 miles in diameter or so. Even very large nuclear explosions have relatively small fireballs compared to that (the 100 Mt Tsar Bomba would have had a 10 mile diameter fireball; whereas a 10 Mt weapon fireball is only 4 miles in diameter — both of those are extremely large weapons). There are going to be complicated relationships with the clouds above; blast waves can reflect off of clouds and temperature inversions, which can under some circumstances increase their range on the ground, in some cases reduce them. Under some circumstances you can <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/11/15/how-to-make-an-atomic-thunderstorm/" target="_blank">actually create a thunderstorm with a nuclear blast</a> (and it's been done).</p>
<p>So this isn't an answer — it's more of a &quot;it's complicated, it probably would require serious study&quot; sort of thing. I'm not sure it <em>has</em> been studied. The effects of nuclear weapons on very large storm systems (e.g. hurricanes) would be negligible — the systems are just too large relative to the size of the bomb that would interact with them. For smaller systems, it's definitely the case that the detonations can affect the local weather, but I'm not sure how easy it is to predict what would happen in any given situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an international development/education class I took in grad school, the professor put it like this: there's positive peace and negative peace. Negative peace just means that there isn't an active, armed conflict right this moment. That doesn't necessarily mean that people are secure or that social problems are being dealt with or that the threat of future conflict isn't there. It just means that there aren't bombs exploding around you or soldiers shooting people. Positive peace is when society actively works to solve social ills (which often exacerbate or cause conflict) and people feel secure. </p>
<p>Or to put it another way, it's like being not-sick and being healthy. If you just don't have cancer or pneumonia or the flu right now, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're healthy or there isn't anything medically wrong that could become a worse problem later. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a &quot;peace scientist&quot; we conventionally think of peace in terms of the absence of conflict.  This is largely because we conventionally study the &quot;correlates of war&quot;, or, the factors that lead or do not lead to peace, the most influential factor typically being the regime types of two states.  Consider the democratic peace, which typically holds that two states that are democratic do not go to war with one another. That does not tell you about whether the two states have peaceful relations, but rather, just do not go to war with one another. </p>
<p>Consider the enduring rivalry of India and Pakistan.  While the two states have not gone to war recently, one can hardly call their relationship peaceful.  It is in a stalemate, where truth be told, war could occur at any point in time should the two states determine that commitments they previously agreed to were now not credible.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, consider the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.  They haven't been at war in a while, but, they've transitioned into a period of positive relations marked by common affinity, partnership, and peacetime military cooperation.   </p>
<p>For an extensive answer, see &quot;The Puzzle of Peace&quot; by Goertz, Diehl, and Balas.  This is a new approach to understanding what we often refer to as &quot;positive peace&quot; (peace) in addition to &quot;negative peace&quot; (peace in absence of war).  In the peace science tradition, we are just revisiting the idea of positive peace, which has largely been neglected since the 1950s and 1960s.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I offer a Christian answer?  Jesus talked about both sides of it.  </p>
<p>In favor of peace, he often talked about living at peace, having peace, and getting that peace from him.  If you believe what he preached and live it, one way to sum it up is to say that you'll have eternal peace because he's made everything right between you and God for all eternity.  So, if all eternity is settled, the little bit of time (in comparison to eternity) you have on Earth should be indicative of that peace and security.  John 16:33 is one verse that relates to this.</p>
<p>But, he also said he didn't come to bring peace, but division (or even a sword).  This points out the division that will occur within families and between friends when the principles that Jesus preaches come into conflict with some deeply-held or practiced values such as self-preservation, pride, safety, greed.  I've seen this first-hand when Christian missionaries to foreign (sometimes hostile) countries face severe opposition from parents who accuse them of neglect of their grandchildren who the missionaries take into less-safe cultures.  Matthew 10:34-39 talks about this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to determine which company owns which IP address. When you use a VPN your IP is changed from the one you are using with your ISP to the one you are using with your VPN.</p>
<p>If  your vpn provider own their own pool of up addresses then it's easy to just block all the ip's belonging to that company.</p>
<p>If your a smaller company and you are using your providers IP address pool then you are going to have to explain why you need so many IP's (IPv4 addresses are scarece these days, my provider charges me a premium for them basically so I only use what I need) or why you need to change them so often. That can you look very unfavourable and they might just drop you as a company completely. This game has already been played with email spam. So providers are always wondering why you want to change your servers IPs so often.</p>
<p>Now IPv6 have a huge address space, but people like NetFlix will just blacklist the block of IPv6 addresses you have instead of just the single address (something very similar happened on Wikipedia recently, a single troll (we presume) was using T-mobile to vandalise Wikipedia, after a number of warnings and the like they just blocked the entire block of IPv6 addresses customers use to connect to the net from editing content on Wiki).</p>
<p>NetFlix are contractually obliged to region lock certain content. So looking for patterns such as a large amount of content being served to a small range of IPs with many different logins looks fishy (if that's not a residential ISP) can flag those addresses for closer inspection, and then you wonder &quot;Why does this server siting in a datacenter login as 50 different NetFlix users and consume a fuck ton of content compared to the average user?&quot; Just block it and get the owner of the IP to come to you and ask for it to be unblocked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The way it works is you connect to the VPN and all your Internet traffic goes to that VPN, who then forwards it on your behalf, just like your home router. Instead of your ISP seeing all the IP addresses you connect to and sites seeing your IP address when you connect, they will see only the unidentifying VPN IP, which is why they are &quot;anonymous&quot;. Most VPN providers have a set range of IP addresses. If your ISP or a site like Netflix can figure out these ranges (not really difficult), they know you are connected to a VPN. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are saying just IP address, but there's so much more that Netflix is able to do to detect VPN:</p>
<p>The big one, and most reliable way to tell is packet size. When you send any information over the internet, network equipment like routers break it up into small pieces called packets. Most networking equipment maintains the same size of packet when sending over the internet. Because VPNs need to add information to every packet, they automatically break up your actual packets into smaller than usual chunks to leave room for their own information. Netflix looks for this smaller chunk size. </p>
<p>Typical VPN users tend to be more security and privacy concious than other users. Therefore, they have a high likelyhood of installing browser extensions such as ghostery, donottrack, adblock, and similar. They can build a fingerprint of these users, because they have enough of them. </p>
<p>It really isn't packet size, fingerprint, or IP range that they use, but rather a combination of all of them. Netflix and other large internet companies have so many users that the data they can collect and use from them is incredibly accurate. They have a complex system of algorithms that look at all the data and determine if you're a VPN user or not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There could be many reasons for content not being available in a specific region. A few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>The content owner wants you to get the content in another way (popular for sporting events where the content provider will do a local blackout to increase game attendance numbers)</li>
<li>Monopoly; a conflicting provider has signed an exclusive deal with your area that bars them from allowing other vendors</li>
<li>The business environment is such that the content provider is refusing to do business in that area for a number of reasons.</li>
<li>The content distributor doesn't have the rights to distribute this content in that region. (Ex. Netflix goes to Disney and wants to purchase the exclusive rights to distribute Disney content throughout Europe. Amazon comes along and goes to Disney and Disney says no can do about Europe, you're still free to distribute in other areas but Netflix owns distribution rights in Europe)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure there are others. Also number 4 is probably most likely for where you know they have the content but just don't show in your region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see any answers that were satisfying to me. </p>
<p>Region locks on film and TV come from funding of movies and regional requirements.</p>
<p>An independent movie distributor has a very limited area they can serve. It takes real local knowledge to know how well a movie will do, to have the local marketing connections, etc. </p>
<p>These independent movie distributors buy only the region they actually know. So a small distributor might buy movies for only the Benelux region (actually exists, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg). Now if NetFlix or anyone else wants that movie in Benelux, it has to be licensed from that small distributor.</p>
<p>With over 300 regions around the world, you would imagine this is complex, you would be correct.</p>
<p>Movies are made this way because movies are expensive to make, and each region is only a small portion of the overall value for the movie.</p>
<p>This has lead to other complications. Certain regions, like India, have a long process to have a movie approved for distribution. By separating India out from the rest of the world that delay only affects India. Other regions have language requirements. The US actually has accessibility requirements that every movie have English subtitles.</p>
<p>All these local rules make it very hard to release a movie worldwide. Just look at the backlash even Disney experienced because Beauty and the Beast has a &quot;gay moment&quot; that is not allowed in Malaysia.</p>
<p>We are seeing normalization of the rules. The EU has been debating for a couple years now forcing all of the EU to be one region for distribution. This change is a subject of heavy debate within the film and television industry. If you imagine those debates are complex, once again you would be correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
