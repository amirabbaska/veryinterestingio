		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called &quot;tight money&quot;.  Inflation and interest rates are inversely proportional to each other in the short term.   If a country's inflation is too high, a central bank will often raise interest rates in an attempt to keep inflation under control.  The tradeoff is that higher interest rates will slow the economy causing unemployment.</p>
<p>Argentina's inflation rate is way too high, though.  Very high inflation is very problematic in the long term because people start to <em>expect</em> the price increases and it they become baked in (they won't necessarily be associated with low unemployment anymore).  Interest rates of 40% are an extremely drastic measure to try and lower inflation down there.  Its no surprise that this interest rate is causing jaw-dropping headlines in the news this week.</p>
<p>A useful example in the United States is the tight money policy that Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve implemented in the late 70s and early 80s.  The US had high inflation at the time -- over 10% some years.  That inflation had persisted for several years and had become 'baked into' the economy.  It stopped being associated with high growth and low interest rates.  This 70s period of high inflation, high interest rates, and fairly high unemployment was called 'stagflation'.  Anyhow, Volcker implemented 'tight money', raising interest rates up to 20%.  This caused a sharp and drastic recession.  Unemployment went up to 11% as interest rates made it hard to invest in the economy.  Inflation came way down, though.  Then the Fed spend the next several years slowly lowering interest rates while making sure that inflation was not coming back.  This led to the 1980s economic boom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great responses here but not exactly in ELI5 terms, so I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>When we say that a currency is crashing, we mean it's losing value. In other words, your money today will be able to buy stuff today than tomorrow. This is called inflation. </p>
<p>To illustrate this, imagine having a basket of goods. This basket represents an entire economy's output in a year. This theoretical basket, this year, might cost $100. One year from now, this <em>same</em> basket costs 110, or 10% more than last year. Now let's assume that you made the same amount of money as you did last year. That means that your money can now buy <em>less</em> than it did last year. This is inflation, and Argentina's inflation rate is so high, that the money in their pockets is worth less and less each day. How does this happen? Well, lots of reasons. Mainly, it has to do with how much money is flowing in an economy and how fast. Central banks (the Federal Reserve, or &quot;The Fed&quot; in the US) can, to an extent, take money out or put money into an economy. More money = more spending = higher prices, and vice versa. </p>
<p>But Argentina is messing with interest rates? Why? Remember, more spending = higher prices; less spending = lower prices. So let's think. If interest rates are high, people are more inclined to put their money into savings accounts, because they will be paid interest for keeping their money in the bank. If people are saving more money, then they must be spending less. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if rates are low, people have less incentive to save. Now, perhaps, they have a bigger incentive to take out a loan for a new car or house because loans are more affordable. So, by Argentina raising interest rates, they are now creating a pretty big incentive for people to save their money and minimize their spending. As businesses begin to sell less and less product, they are ultimately forced to lower the prices of their goods so that they can actually stay in business. Higher rates = less spending and lower inflation. </p>
<p>I'm glad to elaborate a bit more if anyone actually reads this and cares enough to ask! I like to think I'm at least a little qualified after tutoring economics for 3 years. There's a ton of other factors at play here but this is my best (and first) attempt at an ELI5. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People often talk about the economy “speeding up” or “slowing down.”  The idea is that when people have lots of money, they spend it more freely.  With more money changing hands and more money in people’s wallets, stores feel free to raise their prices and people think less about their purchases.  </p>
<p>Think about it this way:  If you have $20 to buy food for a day, you will probably buy nice things to eat.  But if you only have $2 to buy a day’s food, you will probably think carefully about how you want to spend it, and you are probably going to be eating Ramen noodles.</p>
<p>So more money = more spending = rising inflation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, less money = less spending = slowing inflation.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for interest rates?  Bank lending and debt is one way governments control how much money is in circulation.  The idea is that if interest rates increase, people will be less interested in borrowing.  If people borrow less, they will have less money, and we already talked about what happens then.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the country’s economy is stagnant and everyone is pinching their pennies, the government might decrease interest rates to make borrowing more attractive, and try to get the economy “sped up” by injecting more cash into the system by offering easy credit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The real answer to this question is that dolphins rely on their echolocation almost exclusively. They have eyes, and they can see, but they are practically vestigial at this point. Many dolphins actually lose their eyes due to infection and trauma and it really doesn't affect their behavior much. So whether their vision is slightly blurry through air is kinda a moot point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The refractive index of the lens in your eye as well as the fluid inside and on the surface of your eye all interact to give you a focused image. Air has a refractive index of 1, and water is higher at 1.333. This means that light passes through air differently than water. Human eyes are best adapted to see in air, while fish eyes (and dolphins etc.) are adapted to water, so while we can’t say for sure what that looks like to them since we don’t know what their normal vision looks like, it’s possible that they have some accommodation in their neural processing or eye anatomy that helps with the difference but most likely yes, it would be blurrier, or at least look differently, than underwater. </p>
<p>Edit: turns out dolphins can’t see that well underwater or in air as they primarily use echolocation. So most likely it’s blurry everywhere. Thanks /u/MyDogHatesYou !</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins have good vision above AND below the water.  Stop thinking that basic optics and refraction is going to answer it for you, let's turn to some dolphin science, instead.</p>
<p>There is a LOT of misinformation floating around in these answers, here are some corrections and things to keep in mind about dolphin vision and sonar.  (background: I lived with several research dolphins, grad school with the scientists who published this research, but I'm in a rush at work so message back if y'all can't find the papers or want more info?)</p>
<p>As discovered at the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory, back in the 80's, dolphin eyes can physically change the shape of the pupil.  It goes from a circle, like we have, to two slits, formed by the center portion squeezing together, so you end up with a sort of horseshoe or U shape, where the two ends of the U are now the only slits where light enter above water.  So, below water, circle shape and everything is in focus.  Above water, pinhole camera from the sides of the U, and so the light is bent and is now IN FOCUS again. Almost all eye doctors prior to the work in the 80's had done corneal examinations, looking at eyes from dead dolphins, and never had seen that horseshoe happen because they didn't know to look for it.  </p>
<p>Sonar- it IS amazing, but unless you're talking about river dolphins, calling the eyes vestigial is a stretch.  Some folks mentioned that in theory, it should work above and below water because blah, blah blah.  Don't listen to that, it doesn't work above water.  Have you ever had someone shout at you while you were underwater in a pool?  Just barely hear it, yeah?  Something like 90% plus of the sound is bouncing right off the surface, because there's such a density difference between air and water it reflects, bounces right off.  Now, it's important to know that dolphin echolocation is sound, produced via air sacs and vibrations, that are designed to propagate in water.  The melon of cetaceans is amazing, consisting of dense bands of lipids and connective tissue, allowing them to squeeze it, focus sound, and more.  But that banding of lipids actually goes from density closer to air to density closer to water, so that the sounds is funneled forward in a cone and is able to flow into the water with a great amount of efficiency compared to if we were to just yell under water.  SO, reverse that, put the dolphin above water.  WHOOPS, now all the melon magic is working against you, that sound that has density shifted to flow into water just hit air.  Any reflections coming back, same thing, it's all backwards with the wrong density/air interface touching the melon instead of water.  At every mismatch between water/air, take another 90% or more of the sound away.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: I've worked with a neurobiologist that studies teleost vision, not cetaceans.</p>
<p>So, the diffraction of light is very different in water than in air, hence the infamous broken straw illusion.  That contributes to the blurriness you notice underwater.  The structure of eyes is therefore variable due to these different constraints.  Our cornea does most of the work of diffraction, with the lens making adjustments to assist.  In humans, the cornea is rounder and the lens is flatter and farther from the retina than you would typically see in fish.  While I've never had the chance to examine any cetacean specimen, the cursory online search I did for their eye structure suggests a reversion to similar aquatic adaptations.</p>
<p>However, there's more to consider than the gross structure.  Photoreceptor density changes how clear an image will appear (think low-res v. HD).  Crosstalk and integration of these cells can also affect image clarity.  There is also a concept called &quot;circles of confusion&quot; that examines the smallest region that can effectively be resolved.  In effect, a wider field of view has to fit more into smaller areas, so the points of reflected and diffracted light get smaller as well, removing some of the fuzziness, but consequently making long-distance vision basically meaningless.  (This is not to say that real fish eyes cannot see distance, the term &quot;fish eye lens&quot; arose because of the shape of the lens compared to a fish eye, and not so much how we presumed fish actually see.)</p>
<p>What all of this means is that dolphins can absolutely see above water, and with what is likely an acceptable amount of clarity.  However, the resolution is likely hampered compared to in their natural environment, but clearly not enough to stop them performing tricks or spying on people swimming in the ocean.  I'd assume the difference in their vision in air is comparable to our vision in water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only speak to the field that I work in (Dentistry) and how it relates to that but the general tenets of what I am about to state.</p>
<p>In dentistry, generally speaking, dentists understand and agree that in a healthy adult, we really only need  a course of 3 days-worth of antibiotics (assuming it is something along the lines of amoxicillin 750 mg every 12 hours let's say) before a treatment like a root canal or after extraction is performed. </p>
<p>However, we always say that it is necessary to have (aprox.) 7 days worth of antibiotics after an extraction (For example) due to the fact that, for example the open wound left by the socket in a post-operatory case,  is prone to infection of  the many rapidly colonizing agents of the oral cavity (Ex: Streptococcus sanguis), especially if there is a pre-existing condition but even in a healthy individual can become infected very easily if oral hygiene is poor and depending on diet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>since finishing early could allow resistant survivors to reproduce and cause an antibiotic-resistant infection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In dentistry that is almost never a concern.</p>
<p>Streptococcus mutans and sanguis for example, two of the primary sources of infecto-contageous colonization have an extremely low incidence of being induced into becoming a resistant strain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a reason that topical antibiotics can be used only as needed? Wouldn't using them in this way enable antibiotic resistance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that is two-fold.</p>
<p>One is that topical antibiotics function directly through raw absorption.</p>
<p>Antibiotics like , again, amoxicillin, have a fairly lengthy pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics  and excretion process compared to raw topical substances. In simple terms, they have to be metabolized by the body in several steps, first to reach the liver, then to be broken down and disseminated where they will achieve their proper function. It requires a far more roundabout method of distribution, is the point.</p>
<p>Once again, I cannot speak to other disciplines in the field of medicine, but in dentistry, a full 7-day set of antibiotic is more to do with preventative measures than antibiotic resistance.... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you swallow antibiotics it is usually to get rid of an infection inside your body that is hard to see. So the prescription is basically a calculated gamble to how much is needed to kill the problem. There is a risk that one may not have cleared the problem when only half of the prescription has been used and although one might feel better the problem is actually not gone and could rise again making the patient sick again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Antibiotics kill the weak strains first and strongest ones last. If you don’t eradicate them all right away you are left with only the stronger ones. Sure that is a danger to you specifically, but it’s putting those close to you, and the potential entire world at a bit of a greater risk each time.  </p>
<p>If your body learns to fight it and you feel fine that great! But say you cough on someone, they don’t catch what you have, they catch a strain that is harder to fight off</p>
<p>Or even more frightening: bacteria is known to share resistances cross species. If a strain in your body develops resistant to an antibiotic it could give that resistance to an entirely different disease. (This mixing often happens inside a mosquito that has bitten a few people)</p>
<p>Antibiotic misuse is what is causing things like the malaria epidemic.  We have a cure for what people are suffering from now, but it won’t be released to public use until a even stronger backup is created. We can only treat people with weaker solutions so a even stronger disease doesn’t  emerge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Ant tending aphids</p>
<p>Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants they eat, eating the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship. These dairying ants milk the aphids by stroking them with their antennae.[b][61] Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.[62]</p>
<p>Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus)[63] manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.[61]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, because the most important part of domestication is control of breeding. Training a single wolf to be docile isn't a sustainable strategy, you've got to pick the two most docile wolves and breed them together to make an even more docile animal. Repeat a few thousand times and you've got dogs. </p>
<p>This applies to every farm and draft animal we've domesticated - they were selectively bred for traits that humans found desirable in a deliberate process that involved critical thinking, long term planning, and the ability to control the animals being domesticated. </p>
<p>There are animals that have critical thinking and long term planning abilities - crows, whales, pigs, and primates to name a few - but none of them have been seen attempting to interfere in the breeding of other species. </p>
<p>Even the ants/aphids combination seems more like mutualism than true domestication because the ants stumbled onto the arrangement by accident and don't breed the aphids or make incremental improvements in their control and use of them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that we're not talking about an invasive species, wasps are absolutely essential to an ecosystem. The same applies to hornets, which are actually a type of wasp in the family Vespidae. Here are some of the many ecological roles they play: </p>
<p><strong>Pollination.</strong> Many species of wasps are pollinators that are absolutely vital for flowering plants. Many plants have symbiotic relationships with wasps, and some even depend on wasps for their existence. Probably the most famous examples are fig wasps in the family Agaonidae, which coevolved with certain kinds of fig trees. So without wasps, we would lose many species of plants. </p>
<p><strong>Predation.</strong> Many kinds of wasps (such as hornets, yellowjackets, and spider wasps) are predators that eat other insects/arachnids like spiders, beetles, and caterpillars. Since a lot of these destroy plants and other organisms, this predation serves as an important control that helps balance their numbers in order keep an ecosystem healthy and diverse. Some wasps even eat other wasps, which helps keep their own numbers in control.</p>
<p><strong>Parasitism</strong>. In addition to being predators, some wasps are also parasites that feed on other insects. As described above, this has all of the same benefits for keeping the levels of other insects in balance. (For example, <em>Encarsia formosa</em> is used as pest control on tomato plants). </p>
<p>So if we destroyed all wasps in their native habitat, we would see a rise in many insect populations, a decrease in many plant populations, and things would not be looking so good for the ecosystem as a whole. Wasps can be annoying, but they're absolutely vital to our ecosystems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees, or at least the honeybee that you're probably thinking of, are not essential to the ecosystem in North America. </p>
<p>They are in fact an imported agricultural species that make life better for humans. If every European honey bee in North America were to drop dead tomorrow, flora would take a hit, as they have displaced native pollinators all across the country. In the long run, however, native ecosystems would survive; it's human agriculture that would fail in spectacular fashion. </p>
<p>The wasps, hornets, birds, and other things are pollinators in their own right. Native flora evolved along with those creatures to succeed just fine without the honey bee.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other species of native bee that fit into their own ecosystem niche. In particular, when you see news articles about bees being placed on the endangered species list, that refers to several types indigenous to the Hawaiian islands that are under threat. They, however, are not the honey bee that you see buzzing around responsible for agricultural pollination on the mainland.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically, the first spiders were venomous burrowing critters. They most likely had a mucus like secretion that helped form and hold the walls of their homes.</p>
<p>Over time this mucus ended up helping to incapacitate prey which placed a naturally selective pressure on those that used it offensively in addition to constructively.</p>
<p>Over even MORE time (millions of years, likely) those secretions became more refined and the spiders could use it as a soggy kind of net by dragging it around the top of low grass or plants.</p>
<p>Eventually it moved from there to the refined sticky silk we all know and love today.</p>
<p>Mind you, we don't have a fossil record of any of this, but many smart people have independently told me that this is the most likely evolutionary route taken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flowering plants and pollinating insects, such as bees, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221300256X" target="_blank">co-evolved somewhen between 140-110 million years ago</a>.</p>
<p>There are several different main categories of large plant, gymnosperms and angiosperms.  Gymnosperms came before angiosperms and are &quot;non-flowering&quot;  they include conifers, cycads, and ancient lineages such as ginkos and podocapus.  These plants generally pollinate by wind, dumping immense loads of pollen into the air and letting the wind carry it to the female receptacles on other plants, or self-pollinating in some cases.  Gymnosperms evolved around 320 million years ago, with indications that the lineage was emerging around 380 million years ago.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/808.full?rss=1" target="_blank">there <em>may</em> be evidence of animal pollination already taking place in gymnosperms</a> as early as 320 to 300 million years ago.  One line of evidence for this is pollen grains that appear to be too large to be wind transported.</p>
<p>Angiosperms are the flowering plants and the first true ones evolved around 160 million years ao, but split from gymnosperms long before that, around 245-200 million years go.  Flowering plants didn't become widespread until around 120 million years ago, which is right when we see the evidence of co-evolution in the first research paper linked above.  This suggests that the pairing of insect pollinators with flowering plants was vital to their success in spreading across the planet.</p>
<p>That still leaves a gap of some 40 million years, but there is evidence to suggest that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260766/" target="_blank"><em>Lichnomesopsyche gloriae</em> fly had already adapted to drink nutritious 'ovulate fluids'</a> from gymnosperm reproductive organs (can't really call it nectar since they're not technically flowers) and made an easy switch over to angiosperms when they evolved 160 million years ago.  So, from the very beginning it appears that there was a potential insect pollinator waiting in the wings to take advantage of a new niche, possibly many different ones.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that despite insects being the most well known pollinators (not just bees, but flies, mosquitoes, beetles, moths, butterflies, etc, etc) many <em>other</em> animals also pollinate flowers, including birds, bats, monkeys, marsupials, lemurs, bears, rabbits, deer, rodents, and, importantly for this discussion, reptiles.</p>
<p>Lizards, especially <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0028825X.1987.10410078" target="_blank">geckos and skinks can play an important role in pollinating plants</a>.  This is seen in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241579/" target="_blank">various places around the world</a>.  This suggests there were certainly other animal pollination vectors potentially available for early flowering plants, especially if some of these non-arthropod animals were already taking advantage of the nutrients available in gymnosperm reproductive bodies.</p>
<p>And there is, of course, still wind pollination and self pollination, but it seems that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534702025405" target="_blank">wind pollination for flowering plants may have evolved after animal pollination</a>.  Wind pollination requires both wind and a relatively dry climate, part of the reason why it's not seen very often in wet tropical forests.</p>
<p>TL/DR:  there were already species pre-adapted to pollinate flowering plants when they evolved and there was a rapid co-evolution of flowing plants and insect pollinators, as well as potential non-insect pollinators present.</p>

<p>There are types of plants that can pollinate themselves or use the wind to carry their pollen to other plants. In the same vein, there  are other insects that can pollinate plants other than bees, but again this depends on the ecosystem. </p>
<p>Honey bees themselves are a little percentage of pollinator insects. As a matter of fact, they are actually an invasive species that intrude on the other pollinators. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Initially most plants either basically copyed itself like grass. or put massive amounts of pollen in the air. But over millennia plants slowly evolved to use animals to help them reproduce, either through hitchhiking (seeds with spikes to stick to fur) or pollination. </p>
<p>Eventually those that cloned themselves lost prevalence as disease is easily transmitted by genetically indistinct plants and often a single infection can wipe out a species. And without rapid entropic transportation they dominate only a single area they are adapted for and exclusively for. </p>
<p>Those that spread pollen on the wind have to use massive amounts of energy to create large amounts of pollen otherwise there is almost no chance of reproduction as wind is chaotic and can sometimes be slow for weeks. And to do this they must go through cycles of storing energy, growing going dormant, spreading pollen
Using remanding energy to grow and regain their leaves. The use of sexual reproduction allows for greater distance traveled and because the plants are farther away they are less related and create greater genetically diverse offspring but require routine weather they have evolved to work with and a sudden change can ruin their lifecycle.</p>
<p>A few spicies of plants had a animal take a liking to them (often for food) but in the process carry the pollen to hopefully another of the plant. These plants slowly evolved to create less pollen and instead put more sugar into their nectar to attack insects as these animals as small enough to notice and access the nectar but fast enough to travel great distances  and because the bugs were small they didn’t kill the plants.</p>
<p>Centuries later Europeans brought bees around the world as they use the nectar to create honey that lasts and is more nutrient dense than raw nectar useful for rearing young that happens to be edible for humans. Eventually we helped bee colonies to grow and overtake the numerous pollenating insects leading to the initial lack of genetic diversity that caused asexual reproducers to lose prevalence!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Many plants also clone themselves and drop &quot;baby&quot; plants beneath them. Sometimes roots and stems can break off and grow new plants. Sometimes they send out vines that take root somewhere else. And as others said, even for flowering plants, anything that contacts both flowers can pollinate it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An excellent question.  Thank you for asking.  Wind pollination, for starters, which is how non-angiosperms (ferns and gymnosperms, ie cycads, pines, cypress trees) tend to be pollinated.  At least among vascular plants.  Many mosses, as I understand it, tend to rely on water droplets to get their spores from one sex to the other.  But a number of plants are self fertile.</p>
<p>It's actually probable that the flowers evolved first.  It's important to note that many don't attract bees at all: one of the the most basal angiosperms, so basal it's neither a monocot or a dicot, Magnolia, attract carrion beetles as pollinators by smelling [to them] like rotting meat, a tactic used by a number of other plant families, too.  However, showier flowers tend to attract a wider diversity of pollinators, like bees, flies, butterflies, moths, or even bats.  Some flowers have developed nectaries to further encourage pollinators to come down.  A little weed that pops up in North America, <em>Linaria canadensis</em>, Canadian Toad Flax, dusts the head of pollinators that land on its petals.  A personal favorite flower, the Bee Orchid is self fertile (and prefers to reproduce that way), but its flowers often attracts male bees in overlapping territories by emitting scents that smell like a female bee's pheromones -- the bee gets tricked with a pseudo-sexual reward, but it's another way of attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Bees, though, seem to have evolved from wasps that got a taste for nectar.  They and other things were already attracted to the flower, but the nectaries drove the evolution of an entire lineage of specialized pollinators.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

As described in the article, time crystals change their state when &quot;exposed to an electromagnetic pulse&quot;. Since minerals like Quartz also change state when exposed to a electromagnetic pulse, how are they different? Is it just the arrangement of the molecules in the crystal that are different? or is it purely the result of the state change that is different? Does anyone know if the two are linked in some way(the piezo and time crystal effect)?</p></div></div>

<p>Alright. Poop talk. Here we go.</p>
<p>Most animals are vegetarian. Lots of fiber. Often their poop forms fecal balls that gently cascade out of the animals anus like some kind of zen pebble garden fountain. Occasionally they get sick, have diarrhea, etc. That stuff stains their fur and irritates their butt. No fun. </p>
<p>Some of us are carnivores. Carnivore poop is many magnitudes grosser than vegetarian poop. That's why you can skitter across a field full of little goat raisinettes with little to no effect, but your cat can clear the room dropping a single turd. Carnivores can make up for some of the lack of roughage by eating the fur and sinew of its prey as well as ingestion of its own fur through grooming. This helps give the poops form as a protein rich diet tends to less like string cheese and more like go-gurt.  </p>
<p>We are omniverous, eating whatever tripe the food lobby puts in front of us. Some of us are better about eating roughage, vegetables, etc than others. But often we eat high protein, high carbohydrate diets which means that a lot of people are experiencing the Jackson Pollock shits.</p>
<p>The last element of the deuce equation is that we're bipedal with well developed gluteal muscles that encroach on the anal playing field. It's like trying to play field hockey in a back alley. You can do it, but you're gonna hit the walls a lot. Quadripeds have a different muscle orientation where their muscle mass is to the side rather than directly behind. We can bypass this anatomic hurdle by doing the deep squat. This brings the gluteals to the lateral and clears the airfield for the bombs to drop. But when you sit on the toilet like a nut on a Hershey bar, looking up cat videos on your phone, your butt cheeks are squeezed together and you can't help but to paint the walls. Furthermore, the commercial block is almost over so you're trying to eject that turd with magnum cannon force all the while reflexively clenching your puckerino, something akin to putting your thumb over the head of the hose and spraying your sister when she's trying to look cool sunbathing with her friends.</p>
<p>So if you're getting a flair in your <del>darier</del> derrière (thank you /u/Lee_Troyer), eat your veggies, cop a proper squat and relax the cracks. It'll save you the trouble of having to give yourself a tongue bath.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow. This got a response for something casually typed out while I was feeding my daughter dairy products. Thank you all for your kind words and for those of you who gelded me, why would you do that? I needed those. But seriously, thank you.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Word to the wise - if you know as much about shit as I do, you're either a proctologist or a veterinarian and I don't do people. So yes, I know the difference between gilding and gelding. Just a little veterinarian humor. Typically my time spent on reddit is making jokes to myself deemed too subtle to be funny (case in point). Guess I get it right every once in a while though.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: For those who are emphatically pointing out, sometimes with troubling enthusiasm, that many mammals prolapse their anus, I will just say that there are few cases where legitimate prolapse is not a disease state. Some critters have an increased laxity in the connective tissue stabilizing their rectums but at most I would say that this allows for protrusion, not true prolapse. If somebody has a source on physiologic prolapse, I'd be more than interested to give it a look. As for us, if you're constipated, eat a poor diet, don't drink enough water AND are in a hurry to get off the throne, then you too can experience the joys of rectal prolapse. But you might also pull an Elvis so I wouldn't recommend it.</p>
<p>As for cows, yes, they have the tendencies to undercook their pies leaving them shloppy half-baked piles. As an aside, baked the rest of the way in the sun, they can act as a worthwhile stand in for a frisbee if you're in a pinch. The upper digestive tract of a cow holds A LOT of water - upwards of 50 gallons or so. The moisture is both a robust ecosystem for the little buggies that break down the fibrous plant material they eat as well as a mechanical means of softening and breaking apart plant material. The result is that while they have other parts of their forestomach that specialize in retaining that water, a lot of it gets mixed with the end product and it keeps their cow bombs on the soft-serve side of the equation. That doesn't even take into account the fact that the housing conditions of cattle are akin to a daycare and that diarrhea from intestinal pathogens is a frequent occurrence. </p>
<p>FINAL EDIT: What started with me feeding my kid before my first cup of coffee is ending with me feeding my kid. I'm signing off for the night, but sincerely thanks to all of you. I've gotten a lot of seemingly heartfelt compliments today, something I can really use right now, and it's been a profound joy knowing that I was able to give the bulk of you a chuckle or 2 while you were finishing up your number 2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
