Dissolved chemicals or particulates will remain, so if you boil brown water it'll still be brown. If whatever is making the water brown happens to be a toxin drinking the boiled water is still inadvisable.</p>
<p>However, you can use boiling the water to clean it. Catch the steam, let it condense and have some clean water.</p>
<p>We don't do that generally because it's a rather arduous process and it consumes a lot of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Anything dissolved or suspended in the water, eg. micro-plastics, salt, lead, bleach, will not be removed and will be left behind in a higher concentration after boiling.  Water has to be <strong>distilled</strong> for it to be cleaned of other contaminants.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Pharmaceutical processing there's steam, and <em>sterile steam</em>.  The two are not synonymous.  You may have a processing system that is sanitized, generally free of microbial contamination and expected not to encourage growth to a reasonable limit.  Things like shampoo, and lotion are made under sanitary conditions.  Food is processed under a sanitary standard also.</p>
<p>However, take that steam up to 130C and filter at .2 micron to remove solids and now you have <em>Sterile Steam</em>.  This is generally assumed to be statistically free of pathogens, although there's a large and ugly formula with exponents to predict just how free something is.</p>
<p>You can actually filter something to sterility also, and often this is the prefered method in pharmaceuticals.  You may have a material that is heat sensitive, or not easily heat treated.  You filter it through a 0.2 micron filter and it removes viruses, bacteria, and solid contaminants.  </p>
<p>So if your goal is to clean water, the easiest way is to filter it.  This will take suspended contaminants out.  If your goal is to sterilize it, you need to heat it to 130C for at least 23 minutes and for good measure filter it (0.2 micron)before you heat it. </p>
<p>Purifying it is a different matter because different chemistry takes different steps.  Things like RO and Ionic bed treatment will do most of it.  But &quot;pure&quot; is a mater of specifying it also.  There's a diffrence between 99.9% pure and 99.999%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, boiling water doesn't clean it: it kills many disease causing bacteria. Their dead bacteria bodies are still in the water.</p>
<p>In fact, a large number of bacteria survive the heat just fine. Some &quot;sporify&quot; - basically go dormant until conditions don't suck as bad.</p>
<p>Any other contaminants will still be in the water. Heck, you'll probably add some from whatever container you used to boil the water.</p>
<p>There are some really fancy filters that can filter things down to the molecular scale. And of course, there is distilling (turning the water to vapor and then condensing it back to water). Neither of these processes will give you 100 percent pure water though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

All of these animals had been domesticated in the Old World and most of them were also carriers of disease. Most of the deadly diseases come from animals, a disease does NOT want to kill its host, unless it thinks its host is a totally different animal, in which case, oops.</p>
<p>Compared to that plethora of animal diversity in an Old World backyard, they had just the llama in the New World. Yeah, go figure. The Old World children contracted the diseases when they were small and resilient to the high temperature fevers the diseases subjected them to, making them immune from future attacks via immune system memory. When the Old World people came about, they brought the animals with them as well, as well as numerous other articles made out of those animals. We're also talking about a period of time where people in the Old World didn't bathe out of fear of catching some waterborne disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In presence of gravity the space dimension is stretched. Similar is the case with time (because they are directly correlated even though they are still their own individual dimensions), time also gets stretched (more accurately, curved) in presence of gravity. In other words, time runs slower in presence of gravity. The more gravity you have, the slower time passes.  (Also like others have stated, like many things in science we know the how, but we don't know the why. We don't even know <em>what gravity is</em>, so let that sink in. I mean gravity is effect mass has on space time, but I'm not an astrophysicist so I'm not sure if there's more to it than that.)</p>
<p>Now here's a bit more in depth example that a 5 year old may be able to understand:</p>
<p>Time as anything different than dimensional is a kind of illusion, as it is relative to where the observer is in the universe in respect to objects with mass. If I'm on earth, I'm perceiving time as being normal. If there is a second earth somewhere far away with let's say, a black hole close to it, the person on that earth will perceive time just the same as the person on earth one perceives it. But in actuality, earth number two has that large gravitational mass of a black hole close enough to it that the gravity of the black hole is affecting earth two by the bending of space time that happens with large amounts of mass that results in gravity. Since space and time are one and the same, the bending of this space via gravity is also bending time. The more bent spacetime is, the slower time goes relative to the observer. So earth two is going way slower in time relative to the viewer on earth one. Two hours could go by on earth two which could amount to ten years on earth one. Neither earth will feel a difference as each observer feels time going at a constant speed, but if each observer visits each other's planets, they will see how much time has differentiated from the beginning of the test. This doesn't mean that if we find a planet where time moves slower that we can live longer, as humans there will still have their normal age limit, it just means that relative to the other earth that has different levels of gravity acting on it time dilates drastically from each observers relative point in the universe.</p>
<p>Also, for your second part, it is impossible to know what existed before the Big Bang, and so scientists leave it at that. Most scientists go with the fact that time and space started at the Big Bang and there was nothing before that, because there is simply no way of knowing what was before. (Unless we get into theoretical physics of there being multiple universes that this one stemmed out of, but that's all purely philosophical at this point.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant no matter what frame of referance you use. This is the reason time slows down when you start going close to the speed of light. Its complicated math but simply if you are going 1/2 the speed of light and shine a torch forward you see that photon shoot off forward at the speed of light, but for somone stationary they too see it travel at the speed of light not speed of light + the 1/2 speed of light your traveling at.</p>
<p>Now when light moves through space it is affected by gravity the same as everything else. If you had an infinity flat &quot;Earth&quot; and shot a photon horizontally it would fall at 9.81m/s^2 and hit the ground</p>
<p>This is where the explination gets tricky as you have to try and visualize space time as dimensional. Which is hard. But if you have seen these images of a flat &quot;space-time&quot; grid with a planet plonked on there bending the space-time grid down and distorting it with its gravity.</p>
<p>Now a photon travels allong the lines of this grid. Without the planet there it takes 1year to travel 1 light year easy.</p>
<p>But when the grid bends the photon as above follows this bent space-time grid. But the distance is longer due to the planets gravity.</p>
<p><a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d6269a3e09aa1583a89cb28280c6e8f0" target="_blank">This is what im trying to describe</a></p>
<p>An observer in the gravity of the planet the photon will still take 1 year to travel the 1 light year, but to the outside observer due to the curve and the fact light in a vacuum always travels at the same speed, it will take longer. This means light and therefore time must have been slowed by gravity.</p>
<p>In reality its not actually curved but thats the issue with trying to visualize time as a dimensional thing its hard to describe without a wall of math!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully, this is a pretty good answer:</p>
<p>Time as we understand it - a smooth flow of &quot;before&quot; events into &quot;after&quot; events doesn't actually exist. There's no one &quot;time&quot; that flows at a constant rate forward.</p>
<p>INSTEAD time as we understand it is just the progression of interactions - which sounds like the same thing, but strangely enough, is different. Unlike things like Temperature and Mass, which don't change too much, time changes a lot.</p>
<p>The passage of time, as we understand it, is limited by a variable called <em>c.</em> Usually this is called the speed of light, but that's not totally accurate. What <em>c</em> really is, is the speed of CAUSALITY - the rate at which any event or object is capable of causing any other event. <em>c</em> is the speed at which the universe can talk to itself. Anything that has no mass - like light in a vacuum - will always travel at <em>c</em> but nothing else can do this.</p>
<p>Now, mass has the property of stretching space out, like a bowling ball being dropped in the middle of a stretched out blanket, being held at its four corners. The result of this is that it takes more &quot;time&quot; comparatively to get from point a to point b - even for things travelling at the rate of <em>c.</em></p>
<p>The result is that the rate of change is slower in higher mass systems. A photon in a system with a total mass of 2 travels &quot;slower&quot; than a photon in a system with a mass of 1 - 1 and 2 being arbitrary weights here.</p>
<p>But because the rate of our observation from any perspective is based on the rate of our own brain's processing, which slows down or speeds up based on our surroundings, the rate of change in OUR surroundings will always seem the same - it will always appear that it's the rest of the universe, and not us, that is speeding up or slowing down.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So Einstein asked the question - what does a photon look like if you are also travelling at light speed beside it? If you travel beside a car going 60 miles per hour at the same speed, the car will appear to be at rest. If you travel 60 and another car is in the oncoming direction travelling 60, you can also say that your car appears to be at rest while the other car approaches at 120. This is relativity of velocity.</p>
<p>With light it's different. You can travel half light speed and set off beside a photon, but the photon will still accelerate at light-speed away from you, not half.  Even if you travel 99.9999% of light speed, it will always accelerate away from you at 100% light speed, unlike other relative motion. The effects of time dilation are more apparent the closer to light speed a body reaches. Technically walking in your house gives you a very miniscule effect, but it's pretty much unmeasurable. The astronauts with the most time spent in orbit will be something like 7 seconds &quot;younger&quot; than they would have been if they stayed on Earth. </p>
<p>Now, your question was about gravity. Einstein also figured out that a gravitational force exerted on a body is indistinguishable from a body travelling with the same force. You always hear that Earth's gravitational force is -9.8m/s^2, meaning all things on Earth's surface are being pushed down onto the ground at that rate of acceleration. Someone travelling 9.8m/s^2 has the same effect as standing on Earth's surface.</p>
<p>When you talk about black holes, huge planets and stars, their gravitational effect is also huge, which can make time dialation apparent. While the movie Interstellar took some liberties with certain things, it got that part correct; if you were near a supermassive blackhole with huge gravity, you <em>would</em> experience time dialation due to the forces acting on you mimicking what we think of as &quot;ordinary&quot; acceleration. i.e. moving from point A to point B in space and not just orbiting a massive body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You have fears of regret, exposing yourself, being vulnerable by opening up puts you at risk being wrong and embarrassing yourself.</p>
<p>With children, the risk is nearly zero. Kids are below us as adults, we are just better than they are and it's not hard to be confident in that. They might be smart even for their age, but they will never be our level until they invest a few more years learning as they should.</p>
<p>With adults, you're vulnerable to being proven wrong or being viewed as the bad guy. We all have different fears that take priority in conversation, for you it might not be fear of being wrong but saying the wrong things, who knows. Adults are our competition, our competition , who we are compared to when judging where we are in life. As social creatures, no matter how ridiculous this all is to us on paper, some of us are just wired to care a bit more than we should.</p>
<p>Work on your confidence and suddenly talking to a higher level of &quot;competition&quot; will suddenly be less overwhelming. Learn to forgive your imperfectness and to observe other's flaws.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<pre><code>(8) Personal information. The term “personal information” means individually identifiable information about an individual collected online, including—
  (A) a first and last name;
  (B) a home or other physical address including street name and name of a city or town;
  (C) an e-mail address;
  (D) a telephone number;
  (E) a Social Security number;

  (G) information concerning the child or the parents of that child that the website collects online from the child and combines with an identifier described in this paragraph.</code></pre>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say Timmy is wandering around the mall. Timmy visits the google store. The google store has a shower at the exit that paints everyone's arm a different color based on what they do in the store and what the google store knows about them. The google store can't paint Timmy's name on his arm, but they are allowed to color men differently then women. There's actually 1000 different colors based on how old you are, gender, and interests. Timmy is welcome to clean his arm, but most people don't because the coloring is not very noticeable. </p>
<p>Now Timmy walks into the amazon store. Because Timmy went first to the google store, amazon knows Timmy's age, gender, and interests simply by seeing the color of his arm. Amazon knows Timmy is between 12 and male and lives in a Chicago suburb based solely on the color of his arm! Timmy browses in the amazon store for a shaving kit and some football jerseys for his local football team. The amazon store also paints peoples feet when they leave the store. Amazon has 1,000,000 different colors depending on what a person's interests are or what their actions are. Just like google, amazon can't paint the person's name (even though they know the name) but can paint enough information that is even more useful. Amazon can even claim that they don't know that Timmy was 12 when asked, because no one knows for sure how much they know about google's coloring scheme.</p>
<p>Now Timmy walks around the mall for a while, and gets a different body part painted after exiting each store. Each store isn't allowed to paint Timmy's name or super specific information, but each store probably knows Timmy's name and can definitely paint a pretty good picture of Timmy based on his activity in the amazon store or the google store or any other store like the yahoo store or the credit card store or the facebook score. Each store can plausibly claim that they didn't know Timmy's age or name when he walked in or when they painted him (even though they do).</p>
<p>In real life, there's paint stores too who help all the stores in the mall paint colors that help them and make sure that each company that uses the whole painting thing benefits by working together. And help provide all the stores in the mall with scanners that help identify all the members who walk into the store and information about them so they can serve Timmy better.</p>
<p>There's also a way for Timmy to clean himself before he enters into each store, so that no one really knows what he has been up to. However, because the paint doesn't really tell anyone anything that compromises Timmy's identity, its probably in Timmy's best interest to not stay clean so that all the stores in the mall can serve Timmy better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the words of Robert Zubrin, head of the Mars society. </p>
<p>Question: Could you go over the why for going to Mars? </p>
<p>Dr. Zubrin: As I see it, there are three reasons why Mars should be the goal of our space program: and in short, it’s because Mars is where the science is, it’s where the challenge is, and it’s where the future is.</p>
<p>It’s where the science is because Mars was once a warm and wet planet, it had liquid water on its surface for more than a billion years, which was about 5 times as long as it took life to appear on Earth after there was liquid water on here, so if the theory is correct that life is a natural development from chemistry, where if you have liquid water, various elements and enough time, life should have appeared on Mars even if it subsequently went extinct, and if we can go to Mars and find fossils of past life, we would have proven that the development of life is a general phenomenon in the universe. Or if go to Mars and find plenty of evidence of past bodies of water but no evidence of fossils or the development of life, then we can say that the development of life from chemistry is not sort of a natural process that occurs with high probability but includes some freak chance and we could be alone in the universe. Furthermore if we can go to Mars and drill, because there’s liquid water underground on Mars, reach the ground water, there could be life there now. And if we can get hold of that and look at it and examine its biological structure and biochemistry we could find out if life as it exists on Mars is the same as Earth life because all Earth life at the biochemical level is the same—we all use the same amino acids, the same method of replicating and transmitting information, RNA and DNA, all that---is that what life has to be, or could life be very different from that? Are we what life is, or are we just one example drawn from a much vaster tapestry of possibilities? This is real science, this is fundamental questions that thinking men and women wondered about for thousands of years, the role of life in the universe. This is very different from going to the moon and dating craters in order to produce enough data to get a credible paper to publish in the journal of geophysical research and get tenure, okay? This is you know hypothesis driven, critical science. This is the real thing. </p>
<p>Second, the challenge. I think societies are like individuals, we grow when we challenge ourselves, we stagnate when we do not. A humans to Mars program would be tremendously bracing challenge for our society, it would be tremendously productive particularly amount youth. Humans to Mars program would say to every kid in school today, “Learn your science and you could be an explorer of a new world.” We’d get millions of scientists, engineers, and inventors, technological entrepreneurs, doctors, medical researchers out of that, and the intellectual capital from that would enormously benefit us. It would dwarf the cost of the program. </p>
<p>And then finally, it’s the future. Mars is the closest planet that has on it all the resources needed to support life and therefore civilization. If we do what we can do in our time—we establish that little Plymouth rock settlement on Mars—then 500 years from now, there’ll be new branches of human civilization on Mars and I believe throughout nearby interstellar space, but you know, look: I ask any American what happened in 1492? They’ll tell me, “Well Columbus sailed in 1492,” and that is correct, he did. But that is not the only thing that happened in 1492. In 1492, England and France signed a peace treaty. In 1492, the Borgias took over the papacy. In 1492, Lorenzo De’Medici, the richest man in the world, died. Okay? A lot of things happened, if there had been newspapers in 1492, which there weren’t, but if there had, those would have been the headlines, not this Italian weaver’s son taking a bunch of ships and sailing off to nowhere, okay? But Columbus is what we remember, not the Borgias taking over the papacy. Well, 500 years from now, people are not going to remember which faction came out on top in Iraq, or Syria, or whatever, and who was in and who was out and you know….but they will remember what we do to make their civilization possible, okay? </p>
<p>So this is the most important thing we could do, the most important thing we could do in this time, and if you have it in your power to do something great and important and wonderful, then you should. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars has an atmosphere that somewhat protects against space debris like micro meteorites, and the moon has no protection at all. The solar system is full of dust and sand sized particles and the Earth and Moon frequently pass through these regions; they are what cause the frequent meteor showers seen throughout the year. However on Earth they burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere, but on the Moon they would be like bullets raining down randomly. Any long term colony on the Moon would need to be under ground for the protection of critical infrastructure and colonists. </p>
<p>There is also a possibility of terraforming Mars through the work of colonies over centuries. The Moon lacks the materials and the gravity for an atmosphere. </p>
<p>Eventually we will likely use the Moon as a launch platform for our space program because of it's lower gravity well and the presence of water in some of the craters for fuel. That is a very long way off though. </p>
<p>It's inevitable that we will branch out into space when it becomes economically viable. The first country or company to bring an iron rich asteroid into Earth orbit, and find a profitable way of mining it, is going to make so much money, it will be like a gold rush. Imagine what would happen if SpaceX took possession of a small asteroid with a trillion dollars worth of iron on it. Every enterprise on Earth would be racing to do the same. Once space becomes profitable, jobs, then people, then colonists will follow in it's wake just like discovering The Americas did 500 years ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Mars has a stronger gravity which means people can stay for longer(or even forever) without their bones getting weaker/breaking/other biological problems.</li>
<li>Mars has an atmosphere and, as thin as it may be, it still protects against radiation from space. The moon's atmosphere barely exists.</li>
<li>Mars has icy polar caps which can be very useful for obtaining water on a new colony. The Moon has no ice.</li>
<li>Mars may have once had a magnetic field similar to Earth and if we can find a cause for why it stopped, we may in the distant future be able to &quot;fix it&quot;. The moon has no metal core.</li>
<li>Mars is a lot less researched than the Moon and, as such, a space colony there may be more valuable.</li>
<li>Mars is on an independent orbit compared to the Moon and, as such, having a self-sustaining colony on Mars means that humanity can survive even if the Earth gets wiped out.</li>
<li>It's not like we don't have the technology to do either mission, our space agencies just need more funding and time to do their thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I don't understand is the complete disinterest in colonising Venus. If you get up about 100km above the ground it's one of the most Earth-like environments we've ever found outside our planet:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a gravity very close to that of Earth(around 0.9g) which means that humans can stay there indefinitely</li>
<li>The atmospheric pressure at that height is around 1 atm</li>
<li>Temperatures there are almost constantly about 50 degrees Celsius due to the runaway greenhouse effect on the surface.</li>
<li>Venus is closer to Earth than Mars and it's a lot easier to send extra stuff there.</li>
<li>To paraphrase another user's comment: wouldn't airships on Venus be really neat?</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest issues are that the atmosphere is very acidic and the need for an airship. The good thing about those is that it's really easy to test them on Earth and if we can make a self-sustaining airship society here then it should also work there. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ5KV3rzuag" target="_blank">Wonderful video on the topic...</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compared to the moon, mars is more habitable for human settlement. It has a larger atmosphere (albeit not much), a higher gravitational pull, and places where water could be found and extracted.</p>
<p>The moon is pretty close to us, but it has no atmosphere, a weak magnetic field and about 1/6 the gravitational pull of earth. That makes long term settlement pretty challenging as it's fairly hostile to our way of life. The moon would make a perfect location for a space station similar to the ISS though.</p>
<p>Weak gravity means less thrust is required for lift off and landing. The moon also has some materials on its surface that are great sources of energy (such as helium-3). The lack of atmosphere is perfect for astronomy, and astronauts wouldn't have to worry about keeping the moon in orbit. It's not going anywhere anytime soon. The moon's just plain better than a low orbit space station.</p>
<p>Another reason for Mars is that it's more of a stepping stone than anything else. If we can get people there then we can get people anywhere in the solar system with a relatively trivial amount of extra engineering. A successful trip to mars could be the spark needed to inspire more space travel for humanity in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2Mu8qfVb5I" target="_blank">Dr Robert Zubrin: &quot;Why should we go to Mars?&quot;</a></p>
<p>There's very little science to be done on the Moon, at least in comparison to Mars, and it's not very habitable.</p>
<p>It does have resources that could be mined, most importantly water (which can be electrolysed and used as rocket fuel). Lunar mining could be the foundation for a larger space economy, and that is being explored (e.g. ULA's <a href="http://cislunar1000.com/" target="_blank">CisLunar-1000</a>). However, this does not require a human presence on the lunar surface. Establishing a semi-permanent habitat on the lunar surface would likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars and accomplish very little.</p>
<p>Consider the ISS, by comparison. It's extremely impressive, but most of its research could have been done at less cost on purpose-built satellites. The notable exception is studying the effect of microgravity on humans. It, along with the Space Shuttle, have been a huge money sink for the past four decades, and in the mean time no human has even left Earth orbit.</p>
<p>Mars might be the more difficult target, but it is a serious prospect for long-term habitation and its prospects for scientific research are very compelling. The greatest concern of people such as Dr Zubrin, I think, is that if we continue sinking enormous amounts of time and money into lesser missions that look impressive but accomplish little, then we might eventually lose our appetite for space exploration and never actually reach Mars.</p>
<p>Other proposals that arguably fall in the &quot;impressive but costly and not really useful&quot; category are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_Redirect_Mission" target="_blank">Asteroid Redirect Mission</a> (which has now been cancelled) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Habitat" target="_blank">Deep Space Habitat</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Note that not all boomerangs are designed to return, and they were originally used as hunting sticks, carefully balanced to fly straight at prey.  A bad hunting stick would curve one way or another, and become more of a toy than a tool.

<p>There is a humped side (an airfoil like the top of an airplane wing). That side faces to your left. When you throw, that side sees ever so slightly more lift. As it flies, the lift produced on the inner facing face, pulls it toward the center of a large circle just like gravity pulls the orbiting moon toward the earth as it tries to fly past. The result is circular motion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A boomerang is a wing that spins through the air. The side of the boomerang that is spinning in the direction of flight would have air moving faster over that part of it, while the side spinning backwards from the direction of flight would have less air moving over it, and create less lift. The difference in lift causes it to bank and turn just like the plane example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
