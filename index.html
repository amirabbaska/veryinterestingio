<p>In the infinite primes proof, you multiply all of the primes together and add 1, which creates a new prime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect. The number you produce is not necessarily a new prime. For example: 2*3*5*7*11*13+1=59*509. </p>
<p>Instead, any prime that divides this number cannot be any of the primes that you originally multiplied together. The way the proof then works is you take the first n primes p<em><em>1</em></em>,...,p<em><em>n</em></em>, multiply them together to get N=p<em><em>1</em></em>p<em><em>2</em></em>...p<em><em>n</em></em>. Because N+1 is a number bigger than 1, it follows that some prime p divides N+1. This prime cannot be any of the original primes p<em><em>1</em></em>,...,p<em><em>n</em></em>, because otherwise p would divide N and N+1, and so it would have to be the case that p divides 1, which can't happen. Therefore, any prime that divides N+1 is not on the original list of primes. Hence there are infinitely many primes.</p>
<p>If you could factor numbers efficiently, then you could use these numbers to find primes. But it is easier to find primes than it is to factor so this isn't a good route.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If this is so, we can take the product of those n primes, and add 1. This new number has none of the n primes as a factor, so is either a new prime number, or is composite with new primes as a factors.</p>
<p>As in u/functor7 's example, notice we got a composite number, but new primes from that number.  </p>
<p>In our case, generating new primes this way does not work, because we already know there to be infinite primes. Thus taking the product any finite amount of them and adding 1 wont necessarily give us a new prime, and since determining if a number is prime is the entirety of the complexity, it is not a useful method.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>If you multiply a bunch of primes and add one, you aren't guaranteed to get a prime, you're just guaranteed to get a number with a prime factor you didn't have before. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you only knew about the prime numbers 3 and 5, you couldn't deduce that 3x5+1 = 16 was prime. All you'd know was that if you could factorise 16, you'd find a new prime number, neither 3 nor 5. </p>
<p>Secondly, and much less important:</p>
<ul>
<li>even if in some strange universe you DID get a new prime by multiplying existing primes and adding 1, you'd only be able to find a few primes that way. Each new number would have <em>twice as many digits</em> as the previous record; even if you turned the whole earth into silicon wafers for memory chips, you wouldn't be able to write down more than about a hundred such numbers. </li>

<p>People always talk about &quot;finding&quot; new primes</p>

<p>Finding new primes is not a problem. Computers are finding new primes constantly for cryptography applications. I don't know how many new primes are discovered daily, but it's got to be in the millions. And these newly discovered primes are used to generate RSA keys and then discarded, likely never to be seen again. There is no shortage of primes.</p>
<p>What you hear about are things like finding very very large primes, or primes of some special form (or usually both at the same time). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number" target="_blank">At this moment, the largest known prime is 2^74,207,281 - 1. This is a number with roughly 24 million digits.</a> This number is orders of magnitude of orders of magnitude larger than the primes with practical cryptographic applications, and the hunt for primes of this size requires more specialized techniques and technology than those which generate your every-day run-of-the-mill 100 digit primes. But I think a common misconception is that each time we discover a new largest known prime, that implies we know all the primes below it. It does not. If my math is right, the largest prime above should be around the 5*10^(22000000)th prime -- that is, the approximate number of primes below that prime is a 5 followed by 22 million zeros. This is orders of magnitude more primes than there are atoms in the universe. So we will never ever have a list of all the primes up to the largest known one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is that asparagus contains a natural chemical aptly named asparagusic acid. This acid is broken down by the body into sulfur-containing compounds. Those sulfur compounds smell. This is the same reason rotten eggs smell. And once made, the breakdown products end up in your urine. Because they are highly volatile, they make it into the air as you pee, and float on up your nose!</p>
<p>I don't know exactly why it shows up so quickly, but my best guess is just that the smelly compounds are made from asparagusic acid very quickly, as soon as you begin digesting the asparagus. </p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-asparagus-makes-your-urine-smell-49961252/" target="_blank">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-asparagus-makes-your-urine-smell-49961252/</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are something like 500 genes that contribute to the ability to smell that &quot;asparagus pee&quot; smell. Only roughly 50% of people have the necessary genes for it, meaning only about half of all people can smell it. There is some debate to this; some scientists think certain people don't produce the smell itself, however I can say from personal experience that I always smell it, while my wife never smells it, regardless of who is the pee-er.</p>
<p>The cause of the distinct smell is sulfur, as the byproduct of the digestion of asparagus is a bunch of sulfur-based chemicals. The chemicals are volatile, which means they have a low vapor point where they can get into the air and therefore be detected by human noses. While they are locked in the asparagus, they are not volatile and so we don't smell them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's an inheritable gene that some people have that includes a specific enzyme that can break down the acid in asparagus (C4H6O2S2). This acid, when broken down, smells.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong in &quot;asparagus pee&quot;, as it's not toxic. It simply is unpleasant.</p>

<p>Aluminum is a fantastic thermal conductor. This characteristic means that when you apply heat to a given area, it quickly dissipates. This is why it takes so much energy to weld aluminum, despite its low melting temperature. You're basically pumping energy in faster than you're losing it. </p>
<p>Aluminum also just doesn't flow very well. It's kind of goopy.</p>
<p>Other particulars like contamination, oxidation, anodizing, etc, makes everything even trickier. Most people prefer steel because it's just way way easier to deal with. </p>

Aluminum also has higher thermal conductivity and a low melting point alowing it to be easily burned through. If aluminum is anodized it becomes even more diificult to weld. Welding aluminum is not more difficult, just different and requires some experience.

<p>The main problems is its oxide, which melts at a significantly higher temperature than the base metal and forms instantly in air. making it super easy to over heat the base metal into a liquid while it appears solid due to the thin oxide holding keeping the shape. then once the oxide breaks the base metal pours out onto the floor. </p>
<p>This issue is solved by using AC or DC Reverse polarity to break up the oxide, good shielding and a bit of technique.<br />
With GMAW (mig) a special feeder is needed. With GTAW (tig) it is the same equipment normally but a different movement.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really know what dark matter is.</p>
<p>The prevailing hypothesis is that it's some kind of particle that only interacts gravitationally (well, for the most part). If that's the case, then yes, black holes should definitely be able to swallow that stuff up.</p>
<p>Under that same assumption, it should be noted that dark matter will probably not form an accretion disk, nor would it care about an existing accretion disk. So dark matter particles would just describe conic curves around the black hole. If the curves happen to intersect the event horizon, the particles will be captured. Otherwise no capture will occur. (with some corrections to those trajectories due to general relativity)</p>
<hr />
<p>If it turns out that dark matter is not particulate stuff, then all of the above does not apply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make a homemade cookie, you need a handful of common ingredients.  Butter, sugar, flour.  You don't need preservatives because the cookies will be made and eaten within days.  You don't need color agents because you don't care about consistency, or the way they look (to a degree, of course.  No one wants a gray cookie)  You're not worried about shelf life, or maintaining the texture and flavor inside of a plastic package filled with nitrogen gas.  Once the cookies are made, you're not going to need to worried about temperature abuse (going from hot to cold to hot).  So, all of these things, plus others such as flavor and sourcing, bring a unique-ish pre-packaged soft baked cookie to your grocery shelf.  </p>
<p>Food Scientists-more specifically grain and bakery scientists- have to use ingredients that you normally wouldn't find or use in your own home in order to deliver a consistent product that lasts for a decent amount of time.  These ingredients preserve flavor, texture, color, etc. but, they also impart their own flavor, even if it is barely noticeable.  And a lot of the time they don't have a taste but they kind of do have a taste, almost bitter if you taste enough at once, but if you take and combine a few of these in very small amounts, you CAN get an off-flavor that is kind of bitter.  The scientists hope you don't notice by adding a shit ton of sugar, but we can tell....  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Preservatives are added to the mixture to allow for a longer shelf life. That's likely what you're tasting.</p>
<p>You may have even randomly stumbled upon several brands that use the same facilities to produce their foods. This would mean similar production methods, which could mean similar additives or even similar recipes that the common baker uses in their facility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, yes - and some of them are the same diseases, too! Malaria-infected mosquitoes actually suffer fitness costs from carrying the malaria parasite, which would mean that we could consider malaria to be a disease of mosquitoes as well as a disease of humans (or rather, that <em>Plasmodium</em> is a disease-causing pathogen in both animals). <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07924259.1999.9652703" target="_blank">This study</a> showed that infected mosquitoes had about half as many offspring as noninfected mosquitoes, and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/13/5580.short" target="_blank">this study</a> showed that mosquitoes genetically manipulated to be resistant to the parasite performed <em>better than normal mosquitoes</em> when feeding on infected prey. (Which, by the way, is potentially good news if we want to control malaria through this increasingly talked-about method.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But the path to understand why mosquitoes <em>don't</em> get sick has been very fascinating and though not mosquitoes per se the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded for figuring out a main mechanism.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference" target="_blank">RNA interference</a> is very basically an innate way cells can silence genes they don't like.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to note that humans don't get diseases from mosquitos directly, those would be classified as zoonotic diseases that affect both humans and non-humans. Mosquitos are a transmission vector between humans. We don't get infected by diseases that started from mosquitos, so it's not really a proper basis for the original question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>After the sun has risen, the spider has gotten all the food he expects to catch from this web, has had a good meal, and has stashed any extra in a safe place.</p>
<p>Now you come along and destroy his webs. No big thing, mealtime is over, he's well fed and happy.</p>
<p>Next night, he spins his web to catch another breakfast.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Spider has gotten use out of it, it's a good spot, so doesn't care if it got destroyed during the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Sydney and the Golden Orb Weaver is an endemic web spider. They can give you a painful bite, but do so rarely and they like to set up shop outside nocturnal light sources like windows and doors. </p>
<p>The Golden Orb Weaver grows really big - bird for scale:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/LyMY1Qo" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/LyMY1Qo</a></p>
<p>So, when you walk into one of these webs, a passionate and vigorous spider dance begins.  </p>
<p>What's my point? Well, because they frequently set up in pathways, I'm often destroying their webs and I notice that they almost always rebuild their webs higher or in an offset position afterwards. So, my observation is, some spiders do move their web, if you destroy the original. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Since you park your car in the same place every day, the wind is always in the same place, so it's a good spot for the spider's prey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
