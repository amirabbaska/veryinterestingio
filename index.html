<p>One thing that the super rich do that you and I can't is they borrow against their money to finance their lifestyles, often for their entire lives and only settling when they die. This allows them to keep 100% of their money invested earning a greater return than the interest rate on their loans....this is free money in their pockets.</p>
<p>I only have some millions but I have taken advantage of similar things to a much smaller extent. I can't borrow to pay everyday bills against my investments, but I was able to borrow to finance a house in a way that would make most people think I was being financially insane. In 2010 I got a balloon ARM at 1.8%. This was on a house I could have paid cash for without problem. </p>
<p>It's paid off - leaving my money in the market and making the minimum payments until the time when the interest rate exceeded the market returns (and it hasn't happened yet). If the market turns bear or the interest rate goes too high I simply pay the thing off. I'm up about 150k on this transaction.</p>
<p>That's how the rich pay for things. They borrow money they don't need to borrow at terms you and I could never get. They settle up when they die (or lose all their money). Or they just sell stock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

By automating the trading, it makes it easier to avoid perception or accusation of insider trading, nor signal anything about company prospects. So somebody like Bezos might sell 10k shares every month on the last trading day of the month, or something along those lines. They might also make other sales, too, but have to ensure they follow trading &quot;quiet periods&quot; and such when they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I teach a chemistry lab where we do the Winkler method test for dissolved oxygen in water. Part of that process involved vigorously shaking a completely full glass bottle to break up and dissolve a precipitate that forms during one of the steps. If you shake the bottle straight up and down (like a shake weight), very little happens. If you hold the bottle at arms length and rapidly rotate your wrist back and forth (your tricep or underarm fat should be flapping away) you will create a vortex inside the bottle and will rapidly mix the contents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it's completely filled such that there's no air, the bottle is completely rigid, theres no particulate, and <em>you don't rotate it</em> the water will effectively be like a rigid body and not move at all. You need some kind of force differential to get things to move relative to one another, and assuming the fluid to be incompressible it's sort of like shaking a cylinder of solid metal. </p>
<p>If you apply angular momentum though, the fluid wants to stay at rest, but the other fluid is driven by friction, and you create a shear stress in the fluid. Unlike a solid, a fluid deforms in the presence of any shear stress. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You could test this yourself. Fill a bottle with water, then use a long eyedropper or something to carefully put a teensy drop of food coloring down somewhere in the water. The dye will probably start to diffuse on its own, but if you quickly seal and shake the bottle, you should see the dye get agitated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Filled a water bottle until it was so full only surface tension kept the water from spilling.  Let it sit on the counter for a minute to settle and let bubbles rise out of it.  Added one drop blue food coloring, and then put the cap on, which had water in it as well just to try to avoid catching any air (it might have done nothing but pour out when I put it on).</p>
<p>Shook the bottle vigorously.  Surprisingly little happened.  The blue started to spread, sure, but not much.  10 seconds of shaking and the blue was still only halfway down the bottle.  I tried to only shake up and down, no rotation and no turning the bottle upside down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like the answer will be no but, as is inevitable with the real world, it's probably &quot;a bit, mostly&quot;. This would be a good chance for some experimentation. Try doing this with two bottles of water, one completely full and one with an air gap, and put a small amount of food colouring in each. You should be able to tell how much movement there is from how quickly the food colouring mixes. </p>
<p>Edit: also, what u/Overunderrated said about angular momentum. You could try different methods of shaking (up and down/twisting) and see if you can measure how much difference if would make.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, crocodiles have a false palate to avoid too much water in, but they still swallow amounts of water (they don't wait for the food or even their mouth to drain before swallowing). Think of when you eat meat in broth or soup. As for sharks and if they would ask if humans eat air, it's actually true. We ingest air which is why we burp, especially when eating fast (it's not all stomach gases like cows and methane). Moms have to make babies burp because they ingest air, and if people want to force a burp, you need to swallow air.</p>
<p>In fact we also get water from food. It depends on the food content because some food needs water to be digested, but there are some desert rodents that get all their water from the food they eat (seeds, insects etc). The point is that food and water consumption are not separate. <del>There</del> The body doesn't go into &quot;food mode&quot; then &quot;water mode&quot;, but our digestive systems separate them.</p>
<p>Edit1: There/The</p>
<p>Edit2: To clarify about 'water burps', that was to explain the comments about 'eating air' in humans. Adding much more detail, trying to keep it Eli5:</p>
<p>Crocodiles, as humans, could get water into their lungs when eating. Humans avoid this when swallowing, when our tongue and other muscles close the way to the thrachea (airway) while letting food and water into the oesophagus (let's say 'foodway'), but we can still breathe while chewing. Crocodiles, as OP asked, need to bite underwater which would mean water getting into their lungs. That's why they have the palatal valve, like a trapdoor, but it actually closes both airway and foodway. This helps while biting (they don't chew, they break off chunks small enough to swallow), but they need to get out of the water to open the palatal valve and swallow. Bonus fact, they have a special tube from the nostrils to the airway, letting them breathe even with the palatal valve closed, like a snorkel. They can close their nostrils when swimming.</p>
<p>Sharks of course don't breathe air, and they don't have lungs. They get oxygen by getting water though their mouth  (and spiracle, a hole behind the eyes) and filtering the oxygen then throwing water out through the gills. They actually need water getting into their mouth to survive and many species need to move to help this. When they eat they just take water in as usual, and some goes to their stomach, becoming part of what they digest and then expel. Like others said, <a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/water-h2o-life/life-in-water/surviving-in-salt-water/" target="_blank">urea in sharks keeps water concentration in their body balances with the sea water so they don't need to 'drink' as other fish do</a>. If we keep talking about water burps then these would be when they expel water through their gills, although sharks can vomit and even turn their stomach inside out to clear it (you can search shark stomach eversion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Once an alligator captures something, it will hold it in its mouth and drag it underwater to drown it. It must then get back above water to swallow it -- otherwise, the alligator's stomach and lungs would fill with water. Using its incredibly powerful jaws (which are able to exert up to 2,000 PSI), an alligator will break bones or crush shells (in the case of turtles) to create a chunk of flesh that can fit down its throat. Then it will raise its head, open the palatal valve and swallow the piece whole. An alligator can digest anything it swallows -- muscle, bone, cartilage, etc. are all digested completely.&quot;</p>
<p>So just like mammals can't inhale a bunch of water without drowning, neither can gators. They keep they're throat closed while underwater and come up to swallow their prey without getting a mouthful of water. As far as Sharks and predatory fish, I'm assuming they swallow water all the time.</p>

Most fish have to drink large amounts of water to make up for what they lose to the salinity of the ocean.  Bony fish drink a lot and their kidneys are powerhouses that remove the excess salt.  </p>
<p>Sharks instead generate a lot of urea throughout their body which counterbalances the salt in the ocean water.  The urea (and other chemicals) make their tissues nearly as salty as the ocean.  They also excrete salt using a gland in their rectum - a similar gland appears in birds and some reptiles around their eyes, nostril or mouth.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They are both electromagnetic waves with frequencies around 2.4GHz. Your microwave door should in principle block inside radiation from the magnetron from escaping but there can be some leaks. And since the amplitude of the these waves is much higher than the ones emitted by your router antennae, if you are near your functioning microwave oven, you may experience packet drop or total loss of WiFi connection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a number of factors at work here. Microwave ovens are powered by a vacuum tube called a magnetron. It uses a magnetic field to cause electrons to excite cavities that resonate at a frequency near 2.4 ghz. They could be made to resonate at other frequencies, but that specific one is called an ISM band and is not supposed to be used for communication, but rather a trash space to place things that do what a microwave does, such as heating food using microwave energy. Over time it became a kind of free-for-all and data (and video, audio, remote controls, and so forth) transmitters appeared on the band as well because you did not require a license to transmit there.</p>
<p>So the magnetron is a radio frequency generator, inside a box. If you do the math, the box doesn't ever have 100% isolation, even at -60 dB of isolation, 1 milliwatt still escapes the device and is radiated. This assumes a good seal, properly designed cavity, no damage to the unit or manufacturing defects. In fact, there was a phenomenon called &quot;Perytons&quot; and it was thought they came from outer space. Turns out that sensitive radio-telescopes could hear the burst of microwave energy as the door was opened on a microwave oven before the magnetron had stopped. For real! </p>
<p>Wifi devices are limited in power output and sometimes cannot overcome the signal generated by the oven, and thus the access point cannot hear you. However, Wifi is built on ethernet and the OSI networking stack. Rather than fail instantly, the &quot;connection&quot; between you and the access point is fictional. Your devices will just try sending over and over again until the AP acknowledges receipt of the transmission. The AP doesn't really know if your phone is there or not, it can only wait for the acknowledging reply to its transmissions, and vice versa. There can be 99% packet loss but the few packets that get through are enough to convince the phone that the wireless network is still out there listening for it.</p>
<p>As another poster commented, the magnetron isn't tightly controlled in frequency as a proper radio transmitter would be. It can drift in frequency to the limits of how the cavities in the devices will resonate. So, statistically it will output more power at 2.4 ghz than say at 2.3 or 2.5 ghz, but you never know where the peak of the output shall be. Early ovens took the 110v AC wave from the mains power and applied only a half-wave rectification, leading to the magnetron pulsing on and off at a 60hz rate. This was enough of a gap that clever wifi devices could expect the gap as the negative AC cycle approached, and attempt to slot their packet in that small window. This technique is only effective if there are gaps. Modern ovens run off an inverter which generates a constant DC high voltage to power the magnetron and thus there are no gaps to fit packets in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It wandered all over the place ROUGHLY within 2400-2483 MHz. My oven is equipped with a turntable, and I noticed that the frequency pattern repeated with each rotation of the food. Apparently, the magnetron's frequency output is dependent on the specific instantaneous absorption of the energy by the food being heated.
The frequency range of 2400-2483 MHz is called ISM which means Industrial, Scientific, and Medical-so basically any unlicenced device such as WiFi, ovens, phones, baby monitors, etc may use the frequencies.  There is no guarantee that the devices usinng ISM won't harm each other's operation. For assured interference-free operation of wireless devices...

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally, my time to shine. I work on RF design for WiFi and can answer your questions.</p>
<p>Older WiFi routers operate in the 2.4GHz band, the same band as your microwave oven. Newer WiFi uses 5.0GHz band is much better for a variety of reasons, so highly recommend you upgrade to 5.0GHz when you can afford to.</p>
<p>Each WiFi channel uses a different frequency range (channel) of the  2.4 band. WiFi channel 1 operates between 2.402GHz and 2.422GHz, channel 6 between 2.427GHz and 2.447GHz, and channel 11 between 2.452GHz and 2.472GHz. They actually reach a bit past these limits, but not enough to matter. Notice these channels have only 0.005GHz separation. That's why you should only ever use channels 1, 6, 11 unless you know what you are doing.</p>
<p>WiFi signals are transmitted in milliwatts. The amount you're allowed to transmit depends on country, channel, and whether you're inside or outside. Typical inside routers transmit around 22dBm which is 0.150 watts. That's <em>very</em> low power. By the time the signal reaches your laptop about 10 feet away, the power drops to -50dBm or 0.00000001 watts. And if you're 30 feet away you might get as low as -70dBm or 0.0000000001 watts.</p>
<p>Your microwave oven creates ~ 1000 watts of energy in the 2.4GHz band. It's also a broad band that covers most of the 2.4GHz spectrum, easily affecting all WiFi channels simultaneously. To keep the energy inside the oven there is shielding but the shielding does <em>not</em> stop all the energy. It only attenuates (reduces) the energy. Typical oven doors have a wire mesh that attenuates 1  part in 1 billion, or 0.000000001 times the energy. But if you figure that out about 0.0000001 watts are escaping. This is very low power  and not enough to hurt you, but it's still 1000s times stronger than your WiFi signal. </p>
<p>To your WiFi laptop, it's like something suddenly shouting over the conversation. WiFi talks at a whisper and the microwave oven, even with shielding, is like a fog horn. This is called &quot;noise&quot; and it prevents the WiFi conversation from being understood.</p>
<p>You can fix this by upgrading your router to 5.0GHz which is better for so many reasons I can barely begin to describe, but the most obvious being that your microwave oven will no longer break your WiFi.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwave ovens heat food by generating strong radio waves in the 2.4GHz band.  This is the same band traditionally used for Wifi signals (newer Wifi can optionally use 5GHz instead) and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Why the same band?  Because there are government-enforced regulations about what radio frequencies are allowed to be used for what purposes, and 2.4GHz has always been a band that is allowed to be used without any license, by ordinary consumer equipment.  It doesn't travel particularly far and won't significantly interfere with people more than say 100m (300 feet) away.  And you're not going to disrupt the important frequencies that any scientific or government agencies use, any aviation or hospital equipment, and so on.</p>
<p>But wait you say - my microwave is generating the same type of radio waves as my wifi router?  Why doesn't my wifi router give me cancer?</p>
<p>Firstly, the microwaves generated by microwave ovens and wifi routers won't give you cancer.  They are classed as non-ionizing radiation, along with the frequencies used by TV, radio and mobile phones.  The type of radiation that can give you cancer are in the UV range, including X-rays, gamma rays and ultraviolet light.  Microwaves are simply a subset of radio waves that are relatively high in frequency, but lower than visible light and the cancer-causing frequencies beyond that.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reason your food heats up in a microwave oven is that the microwaves are of a high energy level (much higher than cellphones or wifi), and concentrated and reflected in a small space, contained by a metal cage.
These radio waves excite the molecules in the water in your food and warm them up.  If your microwave door came off while it was on, the radio waves would just escape into the atmosphere, and since it was no longer contained and reflected inwards into a small space, the energy would not be concentrated enough to warm you up very much.  It just wouldn't work.  It would however significantly interfere with your wifi and bluetooth (and that of all your neighbours).</p>
<p>The metal cage around the microwave should prevent radio waves from escaping, but since the levels inside the microwave are so high and the faraday cage effect of microwave ovens isn't perfect, a small amount is likely to escape which is what can interfere with your wifi or bluetooth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not entirely qualified to answer this, so please correct me if I'm wrong and I hope someone answers you more in depth.</p>
<p>You need to keep in mind that collapsing a quantum state is done with respect to a basis, but that doesn't mean that you create the  state out of nowhere, the system already is in a given state, which will be the result of whatever calculation/gates you've done, and that is the &quot;correct&quot; state, the task is solved through the interaction of quantum states, no collapsing involved! So what you need to do is read out the final state the system is at after all calculations have been done.</p>
<p>As to how that's done, it depends on the  system and what is used as qubits, there's spin qubits, qubits made of pollarized light etc.</p>
<p>Usually you just need to use the tools and measurements available to you in the experimental set-up  to try to find out information about the state of the system.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to using electrons spins as qubits,  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9701055.pdf" target="_blank">Loss &amp; Divicenzo</a> proposed getting the electrons into a quantum dot with a given set of magnetic properties so that it would be influenced by the electron spin, and then you would measure the magnetization of the whole dot. Similarly, you can measure the current that flows through the system which is usually heavily affected by the spin state of the electrons, or the charge distribution, and figure out what state the system must be in for that to happen.</p>
<p>So, generally from what I know, you don't just simply collapse the system by measuring it directly, you just create an experimental set-up where by measuring properties of the system, you can reverse engineer the quantum state it is in.</p>
<p>Again, the in depth explanation about how that's done would depend on what is being used as qubits, how the computer is designed etc, there's tons of papers that focus on understanding how different qubit states affect physical measurable properties of the systems just to help create different trustworthy read-out options.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I too am not really qualified to answer, but I have some experience with atoms in optical cavities which is essentially qubits interacting which each other.</p>
<p>Reading out qubits is not really different from reading out normal bits but instad of 1 and 0, qubits contain a linear superposition a|0&gt; + b|1&gt; which essentially means, if you read out a bit with that state, you will read a &quot;0&quot; with a probability |a²| and a 1 with a probability |&quot;b²&quot;|</p>
<p>There's not more to it than that.</p>
<p>I don't know anything anything about quantum algorithms, but in general they will probably deliver a result with cubits in states that are 1|0&gt;  + 0|1&gt;  (or  0|0&gt;  + 1|1&gt; )
Which means you have a 100% probability of reading &quot;0&quot;  (or 1 for the case in brackets).</p>
<p>If for some reason a quantum algorithm results in a specific qubit superposition with specific a and b values, then to obtain those a an b values, you literally have to repeat your algorithm and use some statistics.
There are some complications with that because a and b are complex numbers. So you can know the magnitude but not the phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earthquakes produce and travel via both <strong>P</strong>ressure waves (bits of earth pushing on each other) ans <strong>S</strong>hear waves (bits of earth sliding past each other and dragging other bits).</p>
<p>If you imagine a solid, you can push on one bit and have another bit move, or you can drag one bit and have another bit move. Solids allow both P- and S- waves to propagate.</p>
<p>If you imagine a liquid, if you push on it another bit will move, but if you slide your finger over the surface, other bits won't move. Liquids propagate P-waves, but not S-waves.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are messy and produce both P and S waves. So when an Earthquake occurs on one side of the planet, you listen on the other side and you will detect P-waves quickly, and S waves much later (if at all). The reason for the difference is that pressure waves can travel through the middle of the earth, but shear waves can't - they either go the long way around the outside through the solid crust, or simply dissipate before making it, which suggests that the middle of the earth must be a liquid as something is blocking S-waves.</p>
<p>However, if you're not on the exact other side of the planet and maybe only a quarter of the way around, and you listen very carefully, you will actually detect <em>two</em> sets of Pressure waves, not one. What gives? Well, the second set of pressure waves is coming after the first set, so it must have traveled further and gone via a different path. The different path means the P-wave must have reflected of something, and we have deduced that this something must be a large solid within the liquid.</p>
<p>So the fact that in some places you get P- but not S- waves means there must be a liquid under the solid crust, and the fact that if you listen at the right spot you get a second P- wave means there must be another solid under the liquid</p>
<p>edit: (I didn't see you asked about the mantle) If you monitor the P-waves carefully, very near an Earthquake you will also get a second set, this time quite soon after the first. In fact, too soon for the second set to have reflected off the inner core. This is because the second set is both reflecting and refracting as it travels; the refraction means there must be a change in density and the reflection means it must be sudden (the mantle). There are a few refractions - one at the top of the mantle, another ~600km down - which means there are different density layers and that is why we divide into upper and lower mantle. It's thought that the difference in mantle is that at higher pressures, the rock crystals form into denser arrangements (hence lower mantle is denser). Beyond that, we don't know much about the lower mantle compared to the upper mantle (which is easy to measure refraction more accurately) and the core (easy to measure the sudden change in how P and S waves propagate)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Shockwaves travel at a speed that is dependant on the material it is traveling through. The more dense a material is, the faster the shockwave travels.</p>
<p>Air: ~1131 feet/second</p>
<p>Water: ~4900 feet/second</p>
<p>Iron: ~16800 feet/second</p>
<p>If the earth were made of just one substance with the same density throughout, it would be easy to calculate the exact time a shockwave would arrive at any point around the globe. If it doesn't arrive at that exact time it means the earth is made of different materials and/or materials with different densities.</p>
<p>Scientists have measured the exact speed of shockwave propagation in pure elements, minerals, conglomerate materials (solid mixtures) and everything else they could test. Using some pretty complex math and the actual arrival times of shockwaves from various places on the planet, a very good idea can be formed of what our planet is made of and what it looks like inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We can turn it up 3000% higher than what we do allowing us to see 20000 ft deep. When earthquakes happen and the devices are planted we can see about 50000 ft deep and this is with equipment a small company has so Im sure the government and larger companies have much stronger and better technology that could let them see far deeper allowing them to see much farther into the earth. Now I don't know how if this is something they actually use determine anything related to the post but to me it seems like it would be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example, a shock wave will not only change speed, but will change direction or even bounce off the interface between two layers depending on the angle of incidence and the densities involved (see Snell's law). These scientists can then extrapolate where these layers are delineated based on the places where the shock waves emerge on the surface of the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really fall asleep so much as we fade asleep, and scientifically speaking, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where wakefulness ends and sleep begins. The process of sleep starts before you're in bed, even. As you get towards the end of the day or your usual sleep time, your body temperature starts to drop, hormone levels change to get your body ready for sleep, you start to feel a bit drowsy. When you get into bed, your brain starts to take in less and less external information and your brain activity slows, shifting from active and awake beta and gamma waves to slower alpha wave to even slower theta waves. Heart rate and breathing rate slows but your muscles are still somewhat active. This is considered the first stage of sleep, NREM 1. What's interesting is that if you woke someone up in NREM 1 sleep, they may not recognize that they were asleep. In the next stage, NREM 2, you would see theta brain waves with sleep spindles and K-complexes. Your muscle activity drop and you are nearing the point where you are unaware of the outside world. This is the point where someone would be considered fully asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sleep-wake cycle is complex, and is regulated by multiple neurological circuits and neurochemicals. Serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine, noradrenaline, and hypocretin maintain the waking state. The onset of sleep is controlled by the sleep drive, which steadily increases while you are awake, as well as circadian rhythm fluctuations. As for actually falling asleep, sleep-promoting neurons in the anterior hypothalamus release the neurotransmitter GABA and inhibit the wake-promoting regions in the hypothalamus and brainstem, generating slow wave sleep (SWS). During REM sleep, regions in the brainstem typically inhibited while awake or SWS become active. The now active cholinergic neurons in the brainstem activate the thalamus which in turn increases the firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex; dreams result. Finally, sleep-promoting substances that accumulate in the brain while awake gradually increase the sleep drive by stimulating sleep-promoting neurons (Murillo-Rodriguez, Et al., 2009). How these sleep-promoting substances are accumulated and destroyed is also complex, involving feedback loops of transcription factors and other proteins, endogenous chemicals and signaling cascades that act at the genetic and cellular level. This transcriptional regulation pathway is thought to be responsible for circadian rhythm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The bladder is a muscular bag and it is not difficult to imagine that a bag of muscle will have difficulty contracting till its internal volume is zero. </p>
<p>The amount of urine left after peeing is called the PVR or postvoid residual urine (voiding being the technical word for peeing), and we know it is a thing because researchers have catheterized subjects after peeing and measured the amount left. Nowadays we can show there is urine left behind after voiding much more comfortably, using ultrasound. A PVR of less than 100ml may be quite normal.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/alesserweevil answered this pretty well. One thing to add is that incomplete emptying can be a problem. As was mentioned, a normal PVR (Post Void Residual AKA amount left in your bladder after you pee) should be &lt; 100 ccs. It can be very near zero. Anywhere in that range is generally fine. If your PVR is significantly higher, it can be signs of bladder problems, urethra problems or spinal cord dysfunction to name a few issues.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: your bladder tries to get rid of everything, but somewhere between 0 and 100ccs of urine are usually left behind. Significantly more than that = medical problem.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
