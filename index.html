		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation" target="_blank">Semantic satiation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The explanation for the phenomenon is that, in the cortex, verbal repetition repeatedly arouses a specific neural pattern that corresponds to the meaning of the word. Rapid repetition makes both the peripheral sensorimotor activity and central neural activation fire repeatedly. This is known to cause reactive inhibition, hence a reduction in the intensity of the activity with each repetition. Jakobovits James (1962) calls this conclusion the beginning of &quot;experimental neurosemantics&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In eli5 terms our brains can't keep interpreting the same stimulus at the same intensity because it gets tired. And that's when things get weird. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Porn is still big business, though certainly not as big as it was. I managed a porn store for a few years about 4 years ago... and before I worked there, I thought the same... who is buying/renting these movies? As it turns out, lots of people. At least half our business was movies. </p>
<p>I often asked our regulars, who I got to know a bit, why they were in 3 times a week getting movies when free porn of any variety one could want is available for free on the internet. Some were old guys who didn't &quot;get&quot; the internet (some of the old guys were still on VHS tapes, which we had very few, as DVD players were too modern and scary). Some of them were guys who were afraid their wives would find out if they looked it up on their computer, so they snuck DVD's in to watch when the family wasn't around. The rest were typically younger guys who would rent about 5 DVD's at a time, take them home, and rip them onto their computers as part of their collection. </p>
<p>Even still, I don't really get it. I would think you would learn to use the internet and clear your history as opposed to wasting 100's of dollars a year on something you could get for free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Think of rural areas that have slower internet speeds or older porn buyers who aren't tech savvy enough to get online, let alone stream video.</p>
<p>It's a dying market but it's still there. In northern Texas right before the Oklahoma border, there are two big porn shops because Oklahoma's laws are too strict and it's popular with truckers

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays people don't pay for online porn.</p>
<p>They pay for all the &quot;luxuries&quot; and extra's from guaranteed hd videos, fast stream/dl, ad free to knowing you're surfing on a secured website that won't have 15 popups appear ect...</p>
<p>But one of the most important thing: being able to find what the client wants fast and in a reliable manner.</p>
<p>A new performer joins the porn scene of your particular studio ? You'll be the first to know about it.</p>
<p>You want a video to fulfill your specific fetish ? You'll get a proper filtered list in just a few clicks.</p>
<p>You want to know if a certain performer released new material ? You won't have to stalk their social media (if they have any) and search multiple website for confirmation... or wait X amount of time to find a &quot;pirated&quot; version of it...</p>
<p>Now despite all that there's always exceptions to the rule, there's some performers who don't offer the package above because they decide to not sign with a larger studio or to go independent and do their own solo thing.</p>
<p>Yet are able to make a living by having a few &quot;love fools&quot; who will spend ridiculous amount of money trough donations or tiered program a la kickstarter just for a signed picture or shoutout on a video.</p>
<p>However if you've ever been on streaming websites non related to porn that shouldn't come to you as a surprise as some people are already willing to do that just for people streaming themselves playing games, cook, paint ect. </p>
<p>Anyway i'm derailing here, the point being people rarely pay for porn anymore for what's happening in front of the camera but rather for how they get to experience it from pre- to post masturbation.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong everyone has a preferred performer but at the end of the day they can and will get replaced, sadly some believe that their genitalia are made of gold and hence are vividly against &quot;free&quot; porn and often end up quitting partially because of it but that's another story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Paying for pornography will usually grant more feature length films. However, there are also websites that offer full length films for free. I think porn will always be a big business since people have fetishes and will always love sex.

<p>To combat this at work, I wear slip on dress shoes and take them off under my desk while sitting there, which allows my feet to breathe and stay dry, and thus warm. They slip on easily enough they most people never notice. When I ride motorcycles long distance I'll be riding 20 hours a day or more. Obviously removing my boots would be practical or safe, so I use anti-monkey butt powder between my toes, dri-max socks, and gore-tex boots. I've found this combination to work the best for me, but it is expensive. At home I wear real sheep fur lined slippers. So warm and cozy and they breathe, unlike the synthetic lined ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To build on what others have said, your brain cares a lot more about it's core temperature than the temperature of your fingers and toes. Other than sweating when too warm, or shivering when too cold, the primary method the brain uses to regulate your temperature is by deciding how much heat to lose through your extremities.</p>
<p>Think of your hands and feet like radiators. There is a lot of surface area and they are usually in contact with the floor or with surfaces you are holding, so if you are too warm your body will send lots of blood to your hands and feet and they will feel really warm because they are purposefully radiating away lots of extra heat your body is trying to get rid of. (After you do a lot of exercise, feel how warm your hands or feet are, they are probably burning hot).  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, when you are too cold, your body restricts the amount of heat it sends to your toes and hands because (1) those appendages can handle cold temperatures a lot better than your internal organs, and (2) your brain knows heat that goes that far away from your core will just be lost right away because your hands and feet are exposed to the elements so it's not worth &quot;wasting&quot; heat trying to keep them warm.</p>
<p>What's my point with all of this? <strong>If you have cold feet, it's because your body is colder than it wants to be, not because your feet themselves are cold.</strong> Don't worry about warming up your feet directly, that will help, but so will just putting an extra blanket over your body and raising your overall temperature. It's impossible to have cold feet while feeling hot in the rest of your body. Put on and extra sweater or blanket, then your core temperature goes up and your feet will warm themselves up real quick as your body shunts it's excess heat out to your toes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America#Origin" target="_blank">a good explanation from Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that a part of the Americas has a linguistic affinity with the Romance cultures as a whole can be traced back to the 1830s, in the writing of the French Saint-Simonian Michel Chevalier, who postulated that this part of the Americas was inhabited by people of a &quot;Latin race&quot;, and that it could, therefore, ally itself with &quot;Latin Europe&quot; in a struggle with &quot;Teutonic Europe&quot;, &quot;Anglo-Saxon America&quot; and &quot;Slavic Europe&quot;. A further investigation of the concept of Latin America is by Michel Gobat in the American Historical Review.</p>
<p>The idea was later taken up by Latin American intellectuals and political leaders of the mid- and late-nineteenth century, who no longer looked to Spain or Portugal as cultural models, but rather to France. The term was first used in Paris in an 1856 conference by the Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao and the same year by the Colombian writer José María Torres Caicedo in his poem &quot;Two Americas&quot;.</p>
<p>The term Latin America was supported by the French Empire of Napoleon III during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude Anglophone countries. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install Maximilian of Habsburg as emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. This term was also used in 1861 by French scholars in La revue des races Latines, a magazine dedicated to the Pan-Latinism movement.</p>

<p>I hope you don't mind me overstretching a little bit, I'll try coming with as few concise questions as possible.</p>
<p>A) What are your thoughts on possible living-quarters alternatives on Mars, which one would you say is the most likely to be picked eventually and why? I remember some alternatives about flying there some sort of inflatable quarters to be pre-deployed before manned missions, some dome-building too. As of me, I think that building underground to avoid the radiation without need of much insulation would be best, but digging on Mars could be tricky.</p>
<p>B) If consulted about the use of nuclear energy in a future human settlement in Mars, given the risks it involves vs the benefits in energy surplus &amp; fuel replacement ratio, what would be your call?</p>
<p>C) Do you see an eventual Mars settlement as a sort of scientific &quot;human heritage&quot; like Antarctica or would you consider practical economic benefits for a colonization as a sort of investment or entrepreneurship?* </p>
<p>Thanks a lot for this AMA, im eager to read responses on other questions too! :)</p>
<hr />
<p>* <em>I remember reading somewhere about the factibility of setting a sort of &quot;solar system trade&quot;, where Mars would work as base of operations for mining the Asteroid Belt (due to sheer proximity) &amp; for further space exploration due to lower gravity (lower take-off costs), while exporting valuable minerals back to earth, in exchange for things not possible to produce on Mars, or prohibitively expensive to do so there.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>ELI5: How the US Congress was able to stall Obama's nomination for late Justice Scalia's place on the Supreme court?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The constitution requires the Senate to give confirm the President's nominee. However, it doesn't set any other requirements- it doesn't say it has to be done by a certain time, or at all. There's also no repurcussions, other than if voters decide to change how they vote over it.</p>
<p>The Senate was Republican last year, meaning they could refuse to hold a hearing. It's up for debate as philosophy whether stalling counts as  &quot;and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate&quot;, since stalling kind of isn't a yes/no advice. Practically speaking, it doesn't matter, since there's no way to contest it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would keep Congress from stalling the next president's nomination for Supreme Court?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends. If nothing changes, there's nothing preventing Democrats from filibustering the nomination. However, Republicans could threaten to retaliate by eliminating the filibuster (which is basically tradition, there's no legal requirement to keep it). A filibuster requires 2/3 vote, but if it's eliminated, they only need a majority.</p>
<p>If Democrats do filibuster, it's seen as fairly likely that R's will get rid of the filibuster, and put in a different conservative candidate anyway. Even if they want to keep the filibuster, it's wildly accepted that it would be political suicide to let it go for 4 years.</p>
<p>aside:
Comments implying it's common/normal are poppycock. Whether you agree with the delay of Merrick Garland, it's historically unprecedented and a very big change in precedent. /u/Delehal posted a nice list in the comments. Quite frankly,&quot;letting the people choose&quot; doesn't even make sense, since President Obama was elected.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>I derped, as several commenters mentioned, cloture is only 60 votes.Don't post late at night, kids!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The President gets to suggest supreme court judges, and the senate needs to approve or reject them.  It is widely considered a &quot;perk&quot; of being president that you get to pick the supreme court judges because it is hard for the seante to vote against a qualified candidate for blatantly political reasons.  So generally speaking the President's &quot;suggestion&quot; ends up getting Senate approval.</p>
<p>This time however there were a couple of pretty big twists.</p>
<p>First The vacancy opened up in Obama's last year in an 8 year term when he had appointed several supreme court justices already.  This last year is an odd time because the next president is running for election and its pretty rare for anything major politically to be done by the &quot;lame duck&quot; president.</p>
<p>Second the vacancy was an arch conservative.  It is one thing to fill the seat of a swing vote with someone on your side, its one thing to fill the seat of a conservative with another conservative or a liberal with another liberal.  But Obama was going to be FLIPPING a seat.  on a court that is 5-4 splitting frequently.  THIS WAS HUGE.</p>
<p>Third Obama had suffered a series of painful electoral defeats and had lost control of the senate.  </p>
<p>Fourth during his terms Obama had systematically ruined his relationship with the Republican senators.  He used the &quot;nuclear option&quot; for judicial appointments, he made &quot;treaties&quot; that didn't get senate approval as constitutionally required, he didn't have any give and take to him like Bill Clinton or Bush did.  There was no bipartisanship and that really was as much his doing as anyone else's.</p>
<p>Fifth, everyone thought Hillary would win.</p>
<p>So ordinarily you can't vote against a supreme court candidate for blatantly political reasons because it looks bad.  But suddenly Republicans could just not bring the matter up for consideration (because they were in control), and argue that because it was the end of Obama's term and new people were running, it was appropriate to leave it to them.  And since everyone thought Hillary would win... no one was really all that pissed off about it.  </p>
<p>Turns out trump won.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Math is nothing more than a set of definitions. That is to say: it is completely <em>a priori</em>; you don't need experiences of the world to prove claims.</p>
<p>Whatever 1 may be, I define 2 as being 1+1. If I then define 4 as 2+2, it follows undoubtedly that 4 also equals 1+1+1+1.</p>
<p>If I then define 3 as being equal to 1+1+1, it follows just as certainly that 3 also equals 1+2, and that 4 equals 2+1+1 and 3+1.</p>
<p>The real questions are: what is 1, and what is +? That is to say: math is an exercise of <em>deductive</em> reasoning: we first establish rules, we then establish input, and then we follow the lead and see where it goes (deduction).</p>
<p>More technically put:</p>
<p>If we experience a lot of facts (&quot;I've only ever seen white swans&quot;) and from that (falsely) conclude a general rule (&quot;All swans are white&quot;), then we have <em>induced</em> this general rule from a collection of facts. (This is faulty because generalisations are faulty by default, but that's a story for another time.)</p>
<p>Maths does not do this: it would require experiences. Instead of <em>inducing</em>, what Maths does is assume <em>axioms</em>—it assumes general rules arbitrarily, and works with those until better axioms are provided (this is a department of philosophy, incidentally, called logic, and logicians spend lifetimes (dis)proving axioms of maths).</p>
<p>From these axioms (such as the definition of +, the definition of 1, and the fact that 1+1=2, etc.), all else follows. All you have to do is follow the lead.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Maths is <em>a priori</em>, and thus does not work based on experiences but rather on arbitrary definitions called <em>axioms</em>, from which you <em>deduce</em> the next steps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminded me of a post on r/math where a question was posed on whether there was a case where 2+2=5. </p>
<p>There was an answer that I found brilliant in a way that it really conveyed that math is,as people already pointed out in this thread, just a set of definitions upon which we agree in order to better understand the behaviour and the relations within our surroundings. Maybe you should tackle your students' imagination with something similar.</p>
<p>Quoting the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let 2 := | | | because it has two gaps in it, and + be concatenation.</p>
<p>Then 2 + 2 = | | | | | |, which has five gaps.</p>
<p>Therefore, 2 + 2 = 5.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Mormons.</p>
<p>Why? Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints believe that they can be baptized on behalf of their deceased relatives. Part of that process involves meticulously documenting who has proxy baptisms done for them so that nobody gets doubled up on. Like most Christians, they believe that Jesus will be back soon and He's going to help them make sure they don't miss anybody.</p>
<p>How? As part of that ambitious effort to essentially map out the entire human family tree, resources like the above mentioned serve as searchable archives of public records such as birth, death and marriage certificates as well as census records. Many of these records exist in hand-written form only. To deal with this huge barrier, all of the documents are scanned into a database and volunteers from around the world (mostly Mormon) painstakingly type out the image text so it can be digitally searchable.</p>
<p>TLDR: Mostly Mormons do it, some are employed by those websites, many are just volunteer enthusiasts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As Nick Knight explains for The Independent, your autonomic nervous system - the overarching system that controls other nervous systems like the sympathetic nervous system - kicks into gear, and causes a bunch of different reactions inside your body depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>This is the same system that controls your 'fight or flight' response along with other unconscious body functions like digestion. When this system switches to hyper mode, it first sends out oxygen all over your body to make it easier for you to punch something in the face, or run away in the opposite direction to safety.</p>
<p>To spread oxygen to all of your muscles, your body must first breathe it in. In an effort to take in more air, the nervous system tells the glottis - the opening in your throat that ushers air into lungs without taking food with it - to stay open for as long as possible. In other words, your throat opens wider than normal because a bigger opening means more air.</p>
<p>You don’t actually feel your glottis opening wide. If you did, everyday life would feel awfully strange. What you do feel, though, is muscle tension caused by your body trying to keep your glottis open even when you swallow.</p>
<p>Normally, when you aren’t crying, your glottis opens and closes when you swallow all day long. This ensures that food and spit go one way and air goes the other, with no mix-ups in between.</p>
<p>But, when you cry or are on the verge of crying, your glottis is trying to stay open, but gets forced close every time you swallow. This tension messes with the muscles in your throat, giving the sensation of a lump.</p>
<p>The lump feeling is actually referred to as globus sensation, and it happens to everyone in these stressful situations. Normally, this feeling dissipates quickly once you calm down and your glottis goes back to functioning like it used to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called a &quot;globus sensation&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact cause of globus sensation is uncertain. Some specialists believe that it is due to a problem with the co-ordination of the muscles involved in swallowing. Many muscles are involved in swallowing and they need to tense and relax in the correct sequence for swallowing to occur normally. In someone with globus sensation, when they try to swallow saliva, some of the swallowing muscles may not relax fully and so the sensation of a lump in the throat occurs. However, when food is swallowed, the food stimulates the muscles in a different way and normal muscle relaxation occurs.</p>
