<p><em>The Secret Life of Dust</em> by Hannah Holmes</p>

<p>Some see dust as dull and useless stuff. But in the hands of author Hannah Holmes, it becomes a dazzling and mysterious force; Dust, we discover, built the planet we walk upon. And it tinkers with the weather and spices the air we breathe. Billions of tons of it rise annually into the air--the dust of deserts and forgotten kings mixing with volcanic ash, sea salt, leaf fragments, scales from butterfly wings, shreds of T-shirts, and fireplace soot. Eventually, though, all this dust must settle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dust is any free floating particulate matter, usually mineral or clay carried on the wind but it could also come from paper and clothing. However the majority of the dust in most households is not dust at all, it's dander which is a collection of dead skin cells, hair, and the stuff our bodies cast off through daily activities. </p>
<p>Your skin is constantly growing and old dead cells are shed every time we move, scratch, touch something, etc. The dead cells are very small and float freely in air currents until settling on your un-used copy of Battlefield Earth. </p>
<p>The dust outside and in the wind is usually from dirt and sand but what is dirt exactly? What is clay is another good question and the answer is metals, silicates, and minerals. Much of the clay you find outdoors is made up of things like  aluminum compounds and silica. Sand is usually made up of ground up minerals. And of course soil is dirt that also contains organic matter like decaying plant and insect matter, compost, manure, etc. </p>
<p>When  an area has a good covering of plants and dense root systems and plant coverage dust is kept to a minimum because the roots of all those plants act like a net that holds the top soil together. When land is cleared though it exposes the top soil to the elements and the wind can carry it for thousands of miles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any content that Netflix licenses/purchases from a third party, those shows follow industry standards of 23 min / half hour and 42 min / hour run times.  However, any show that Netflix funds and produces can vary in length.  They have no standard run times for their original series, so while shows can go up to the 30 min / 60 min limit, they allow the show the time it needs in order to complete the story.  This is why run times of Netflix shows can vary by 7-10 mins from episode to episode (on an hour show).</p>
<p>Source:  Producer for Netflix shows</p>
<p>Edit: Whoa, I step out for a 30 minute meeting and this goes wild.  Yes, there are many levels of producer, but, fortunately for me, I am at the &quot;coffee-receiving&quot; level - for the record, I almost entirely get my own coffee.  I work on Netflix original documentary series, but also had a position on Master of None.  </p>
<p>Edit 2:  For clarity, I work in post-production, not development, so I'm not the source for pitch meetings, auditions, or in with the development team.  RIP Inbox.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mistake you're making is assuming there's an advantage to using up &quot;the full 30 minutes&quot;. Why is there an advantage to using a round number? Why use more time if you <em>don't need it</em>?      </p>
<p>One thing you might notice is times on Netflix shows can vary quite substantially. As an example, the latest episodes of House of Cards run from 42 to 57 minutes long. Traditional TV shows won't vary that wildly because each episode needs to fit snugly into the commercial slots. To illustrate, every recent episode of The Simpsons is either <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/episodes?season=28&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_28" target="_blank">21 or 22 minutes long</a>     </p>
<p>Since they don't have to weave in commercials, Netflix <em>wants</em> their creative staff to be free of formatting constraints. It gives the writers, directors and editors more freedom because they don't have to pad or cut scenes for set runtimes. They get to tell the story however they feel is best. Netflix feels this allows for higher quality programming.     </p>
<p>When you understand what they're going for, you see that &quot;using the full 30 minutes&quot; isn't more freedom - it's just a new time constraint, something they want to avoid.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While other have pointed out that actual original Netflix shows do often vary in length; it's also important to note there is some element of the production/post production systems that are already in place that influence the running time:</p>
<p>Shows have to be shot </p>
<ul>
<li>there are already models on how to budget for and shoot a 40-50 minute program including pages per day to hit in a typical 5 day schedule, union rules (so many unions are represented on a shooting set!) and facilities limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shows have to be edited </p>
<ul>
<li>again models on how to budget for editorial, online and color correction, sound editing and mixing already exist.  When you have varying running time for episodes far outside these existing workflows you often encounter overages or might even have trouble fitting you show into the workdays of your vendors (and again union rules that mandate professionals be booked on a daily or weekly basis that don't allow much wiggle to add a half day to finish that extra 12 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<p>So as much as it can vary; the whole production and post production world is largely ruled by scheduling and budgeting; and those are often based on numbers and workflows very much based on the typical commercial television running time ballpark so it can be a bit difficult to stray too far...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other reasons given, there's also the considerations of cost and form.</p>
<p>Increasing episode length by 50% is obviously more expensive than not doing that, and there's nothing saying that a longer episode is inherently better.  TV shows aren't hour or half hour long episodes cut down to 42 or 23 minutes, they're written to be that long and have been for a long time.  A lot of shows will keep being made that way because that's how they've been made for decades and the people making them aren't freshly hired out of college by Netflix, they've been in the business for years.</p>
<p>Oftentimes Netflix original shows will stray from exactly hitting TV time because they can, but they aren't going to dramatically change the episode length on a whim.</p>
<p>There's also a lot to be said for creating within limits.  Letting a creator go completely wild often ends in, well, the Star Wars prequels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You get the full year's worth of radiation.</p>
<p>From an outside point of view, we see that time is dilated and the astronaut is moving very slowly inside their spaceship. But we see the spaceship take a full year to reach its destination, and gets hit by all this radiation along the way.</p>
<p>From the astronaut's point of view, there is another effect - length contraction. From their point of view, the reason it only takes an hour to reach the destination is because the distance has shrunk down by a huge amount. So, from the astronaut's point of view, they still have to move through the same amount of &quot;stuff&quot; - interstellar gas, radiation, whatever - it's just that this &quot;stuff&quot; is packed really close together, and the astronaut hits it all really quickly.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not all that simple - you have to deal with redshift and all that - but it does often work out that length contraction and time dilation basically cancel out, and that can allow different reference frames to not contradict each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Radiation engineer here.</p>
<p>The entire premise of this is a bit flawed, in multiple ways, because it assumes the constancy of things that are in fact variable.</p>
<p>What radiation is, at its core, is moving particles. In outer space, this is mostly ultra-high-energy protons and gamma-rays.  Now, when you're going at almost light speed, you run into an effect where protons that are hitting you head-on are now hitting you with <em>much much</em> more energy, and those hitting you from behind are now being outrun.  Gamma-rays have a similar issue, but instead of changing speed so they'll be outrun (they travel constantly at c in all reference frames), they'll be blue-shifted and red-shifted.  Red-shifted enough, and those gamma-rays won't have enough energy to do anything to you. Blue-shifted enough, they're not going to give you way more dose than they would if you weren't moving so fast.</p>
<p>So &quot;cosmic radiation&quot; is not constant, and &quot;one hour's worth of cosmic radiation&quot; is not a meaningful unit.</p>
<p>Secondly, you assume that time is something that is absolutely comparable.  That it is either &quot;one year <em>or</em> one hour&quot;, and that it can't be &quot;one year <em>and</em> one hour&quot;.  Just because something is &quot;one year&quot; when looked at one way, in no way shape or form precludes it from being &quot;one hour&quot; when looked at another way.</p>
<p>So to answer your question--You get one hour (spaceship time) of cosmic radiation, but the cosmic radiation you get is not &quot;normal&quot; cosmic radiation, but heavily shifted in various directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Presuming the astronaut has been inside the ship for the duration of its travel, how does it make sense that his time would have been an hour and not a year? Time taken to travel a light year at c = one year. Where's the hours coming from? I understand time dilation with relation to speed/space, but this questions doesn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>HOW this works is a bit more interesting, your eye lens is flexible, (even though you might have thought it was hard in that cow eyeball you dissected in high school) and is able to change shape by consciously or unconsciously changing the muscles in your eye. A rounder lens is able to focus on closer objects, as seen <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GKYvQgW.jpg" target="_blank">here:</a> and a flatter lens is able to focus on things that are further away as seen <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sIVIL54.jpg" target="_blank">here:</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with the how. How this happens is that the lense in the eye is soft. It's shape and therefor its focal point (focus) can be changed by muscles in the eye. The more the lense is squeezed by these muscles the thicker and more convex it becomes, reducing the focal distance. </p>
<p>When looking at something, the brain judges the distance to the object you wanna focus on and adjusts the muscles around the lense to put that object into focus. The focus point has to be just right for this to work. If its too close OR too far away the image won't be sharp and vision will be blurry. </p>
<p>As for why vision sometimes goes blurry, there are lots of possible reasons, but I'll go over a few. One is simply tiredness, your brain is tired and can't quite controll its muscles. Your limbs feel heavy, you can't keep you eyelids from closing, this affects the muscles around your lense as well. </p>
<p>One other reason is you're under the effect of some kind of substance. This might be alcohol, medication or narcotics. It's really too general to get into to as every substance causes different reactions in the body. Some prevent the muscles from contracting correctly while others distrupt the brains vision centre (located in the back of the head).</p>
<p>Muscle fatigue might be the cause of blurriness. You've spent too long reading or staring at a monitor too close to your eyes. Just like most other muscles the ones around your lense can get tired, when they are it's harder to get them to do what you want. </p>
<p>Tears or water directly infront of the eye. This is a topic of how light bends in different materials and that question has been asked before, with people giving far better explenations than I every could.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To some extent it is muscular and when you get tired, so your eye controlling muscle will slack or need a more conscious effort to focus. I know someone who experiences a struggle to focus / blurry vision when he is having a bad day, due to <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Myasthenia-gravis/Pages/Introduction.aspx" target="_blank">myasthenia gravis</a> which is a condition affecting muscle tone in the face. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the keys to ventriloquism is speaking without moving the lips (the others being movement of the puppet and the puppet's mouth at the right time).</p>
<p>The tricky parts in ventriloquism are labial consonants, or consonants that involve the lips. These include </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bilabial stops (both lips pressed together) such as &quot;b&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;p&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>labiodental fricatives (blowing air between the upper teeth against the lower lip) such as &quot;f&quot; and &quot;v&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bilabial fricatives (blowing air between the lips) such as &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot; in some Spanish words (non-existent in English)</p>
</li>
<li>linguolabial stops (pressing the tongue against the upper lip) and linguolabial fricatives (blowing air between the tongue and upper lip) - non-existent in most languages</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess ventriloquism is difficult in languages with a lot of labial consonants and easy in languages with few or no labial consonants. I don't have a full answer but [Wikipedia] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant</a>) lists the following languages that have no labial consonants: Tlingit, Eyak (both Na-Dené), Wichita (Caddoan), and the Iroquoian languages except Cherokee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't really have a full answer, but even in English, certain sounds are modified in ventriloquism to allow them to be pronounced without moving the lips. That's part of why the dummy always speaks in such funny voices (the other part is, well, funny voices). Like apparently, the &quot;m&quot; is really pronounced more like an &quot;n&quot; (because you don't have to close your lips to do an &quot;n&quot;), but if you say it in the right way and it's obvious from context, the listener doesn't notice.</p>
<p>I'd imagine as long as you come up with good techniques for the difficult sounds, almost any language can be spoken without visibly moving your mouth. Perhaps some languages have more frequent lip-sounds, like &quot;b&quot; &quot;v&quot; &quot;m&quot; etc., so I suppose they'd be harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say the premise of the question is legitimate, but maybe just not posed in the most fitting manner, such as the ends of the emotional spectrum being exaggerated for point making but resulted in a loss of relativity. </p>
<p>Simplified, the question would read, &quot;Why does human memory tend to recall or focus on negative emotions over positive ones?&quot; This is not only a legitimate question, but an accurate assessment. </p>
<p>We are negative beings, by nature. Humans are fundamentally equipped with adaptation traits. This means constantly looking (even subconsciously) for ways to improve; never being truly and completely content. We always instinctively want to have more, go further, be better. In this, our brain finds ways to improve, which requires realizing and focusing on &quot;shortfalls&quot;. That carries over to emotion. Negative events or circumstances tend to be recognized earlier and more vividly; they stand out for evaluation, often times getting cataloged as a warning, then we adapt our emotional behavior. When positive things happen, we accept them, but rarely do our minds flare up in a &quot;from now on let's do THAT&quot; sense. Positives do not excite our animalistic instincts. They do not cause our evolutionary core to pay attention to them. So, our brains will forever put a highlight on each bad experience, and it will remain more significant in our subconscious than many successes throughout our lives, affecting our emotions, moods, mental states, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mania is the psychiatric opposite to depression, it both can last for a long time <em>and</em> cause massive havoc in people's lives even faster than most depression would. Where depressed people get stuck in the thoughts about negative consequences, manic people don't see consequences at all. If it's fun, it's done. (strongly simplified, it varies a lot) </p>
<p>Shopping sprees are very common. No regard for how much debt is amassed. Often people in mania aren't suspicious either, they happily give things away to anyone, or try the weirdest suggestions without any regard for their safety. </p>
<p>During a mania things are awesome, but like depressive episodes, they don't last for ever, and coming back to the smoking ruins of one's life is harsh.</p>
<p>That full throttle, unaware mania is relatively rare. Way more commonly people are aware that something is weird, but they have a hard time controlling themselves. Fighting to control urges to do things that will ultimately hurt someone is as hard as trying to get things done when the brain just doesn't want to cooperate at all. You know well what you <em>should</em> do, but the brain just won't let you.</p>
<p>That happy emotions don't last is a security measure, shared between many animals, not just humans. </p>
<p>The &quot;happy&quot; is just long enough to register as such, and then it's gone, motivating the critter to go and look for another thing that will cause the sensation.</p>
<p>If it lasted longer, life wouldn't work out very well. If the bliss lasted for ever, people would eat one bite of cake and then starve because there's no urge to repeat the experience. Critters would be easy prey if sex left them high for hours. </p>
<p>Positive emotions create strong motivation. The memory of that tree with the delicious fruit last year will be a strong enough lure, to search for it again this year, see if the pleasant experience can be repeated. </p>
<p>Negative emotions better be stronger and even more memorable because bad things can get critters killed. Better be <em>too</em> afraid of the world, than not enough. Missing out a crop of fruit, oh well, happens, there's other food. Missing the snake on the trail can be a mistake you only make once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Reason 1: Big sound. The big delays and reverbs make it sound huge without having the whole Gospel Choir. U2 pioneered this sound for the mainstream. When you are doing the whole hands in the air thing having a huge sound really puts you in the emotional state for it all.</p>
<p>Reason 2. Worship music seems to follow mainstream by quite a number of years. Hillsong Young and Free for example is far from the U2 approach and has much more of an electronic sound. </p>
<p>Reason 3. Vocal lines all need to be easy enough to join in with after at most one listen. This isn't unique to U2 but it is a feature of popular music. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Edge's sound is heavily modified with delay and reverb pedals. His extreme use of them set U2 apart from other bands. U2 has a very mainstream  clean sound in order to make them relevant and approachable.
Churches have very large rooms surrounded in stone. This caused a lot of natural reverb, so composers who wrote songs with long sustained notes had success with church music because it did not create unwanted dissonance, but instead the reverberations resonated with the notes currently being played. eventually this became the aesthetic associated with churches.
Heavily distorted guitar sounds angry, while cleaner guitar sounds much more calm. Christian Rock combined the reverb aesthetic with popular music, preferring influences that use clean tones for a calm but positive energy.
TLDR U2 was more interested in heavily altering the guitar through effects pedals but provided a similar energy to past successes  in order to appeal to a wide audience. Christian Rock artists used a similar aesthetic because it is similar to both traditional church music and popular music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Everyone in pop music is trying to ride the gravy train - take styles from something original and reuse them to get popularity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things led up to this. </p>
<p>First, it's been considered that one way to resolve the issue of information loss in black holes is that the information isn't encoded in the volume of the hole, but the area. That is to say, small fluctuations in the event horizon- the surface- of the black hole carry all of the information for the entire hole. The rationale for this is somewhat involved, and hard to explain &quot;ELI5&quot;, but... a black hole is as much information as you can cram into a given space. That concept &quot;as much information as you can cram into a particular space&quot; has a name, &quot;Bekenstein bound&quot;. That bound is defined by the <em>square</em> of the radius of any region, not the <em>cube</em>... that means the area, and not the volume of a region defines it's total entropic capacity.</p>
<p>So... if that's the case it's argued by some, since that's true of any region (not just black holes), maybe the universe itself is composed of information encoded on a 2D boundary, not within a 3D volume. In essence, we'd be like a soap bubble, rather than a softball. </p>
<p>It doesn't <em>really</em> matter to you and I and our daily lives though; it doesn't imply some kind of unreality or ephemeral nature to things. All it says is that our perception of three dimensions is only valid on the macroscopic scales and very low energy levels we live our lives at. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this one is a case of over-interpretation of scientific language by laypeople. Colloquially we use the term &quot;hologram&quot; to refer to some form of 3d image or illusion without substance such as the ones on credit cards or 3d displays. Which leads to these &quot;uuuh, is our world just a simulation?&quot; type ideas.</p>
<p>To a physicist it just means: some physical property inside this volume can be determined/reproduced by what happens on its surface. Somewhat similar to how I can determine the trajectory of a thrown object by only knowing its velocity and position at a single point in time. That doesn't imply that the remainder of the trajectory is &quot;just a simulation&quot; or &quot;not real&quot;.</p>
<p>The connection between these two terms is of course that you can use the physicists idea of hologram to produce a hologram in the 3d picture sense. This is due to wave phenomena such as light but also sound having exactly this property. If you can capture the wave field on some 2d surface surrounding a volume you can reconstruct what the wave field inside the volume looks like. Classic holograms work exactly like this. You bounce a laser off an object and bring it to interference with a reference laser beam and record the resulting interference pattern on a photographic plate. Which is like a fingerprint of the wave field. If you then shine only the reference beam back at the recorded pattern it reproduces the original wave field which our eyes interpret as an image of the object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Those are flat, 2-dimensional surfaces, but they are able to create a 3-D image when we look at it.  The idea is the same with a holographic universe: the universe would really be 2-dimensional, it just encodes information in a way that makes it appear 3-dimensional.</p>
<p>TLDR: The universe is one big flat credit card hologram sticker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) is excellent at breaking up organic deposits such as grease, oils, mildew, mould, soap scum, etc... It's a staple in glass, mirror, and window cleaners.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a powerful disinfectant and organic solvent. Although it can be used as a household cleaning solution, it's not commonly used as such. Rubbing alcohol can be used to disinfect and clean things like needles, knives, jewelry, electronic contacts, etc.. It's more aggressive at breaking up deposits than aqueous ammonia but it's also harsher and more expensive. Rubbing alcohol is also flammable and evaporates quickly. As such, it's not a very ideal surface cleaner. However, it can be used to clean areas which cannot normally be washed or rinsed, such as cleaning spilled soda out from between the keys on a keyboard, where leaving little to no residue is desirable.</p>
<p>Rubbing alcohol is outstanding at cleaning finished metal such as stainless steel and chrome because it easily removes fingerprints and oily deposits. It's also great at removing marker and crayon from painted walls and restoring whiteboards.</p>
<p>Chlorine bleach is an extremely powerful and extremely cheap disinfectant. It's not a cleaner; it's used to kill virtually everything microbial in nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bleach is a disinfectant and should only be applied after the surfaces have already been cleaned.</p>
<p>Eg: to clean a bathroom floor, first you go over and putty knife any large sticky objects, then sweep it, then mop with soap and hot water.  Then mop it with bleach and water and leave the floor to air dry for about 15 mins.</p>
<p>Alcohol, due do it's lack of surface tension, is great for creeping into narrow gaps and edges because it just creeps its way into tight spaces.  I keep it in a spray bottle to disinfect food stuff, like wine and beer making supplies.</p>
<p>Ammonia is great on glass, but I mostly use white vinegar, either picking (7%) or cleaning (10%) over the standard 5% for food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>The explanation for the phenomenon is that, in the cortex, verbal repetition repeatedly arouses a specific neural pattern that corresponds to the meaning of the word. Rapid repetition makes both the peripheral sensorimotor activity and central neural activation fire repeatedly. This is known to cause reactive inhibition, hence a reduction in the intensity of the activity with each repetition. Jakobovits James (1962) calls this conclusion the beginning of &quot;experimental neurosemantics&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In eli5 terms our brains can't keep interpreting the same stimulus at the same intensity because it gets tired. And that's when things get weird. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
