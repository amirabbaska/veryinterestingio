<blockquote>
<p>Researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington investigated how marine mammals’ tissues—specifically, fat deposits in the jaws of toothed whales that are used in echolocation—absorb nitrogen gas, one of the gases that contributes to the bends. They found that the makeup of the fat affected how much nitrogen gas dissolves in it—and that different species had different fat compositions.</p>
<p>Once, scientists thought that diving sea creatures like the elusive, deep-diving Cuvier’s beaked whale were resistant to the bends, but mounting evidence suggests that this may not be entirely true.</p>
<p>In 2002, international navy sonar exercises were linked to a mass stranding of 14 whales in the Canary islands. The whales had gas bubbles in their tissues, a sign of decompression sickness.</p>

What I've always heard is that they don't get the bends because since they only go down with the air in their lungs, there isn't an excess of nitrogen to go into their blood to form bubbles. Basically, the nitrogen in their lungs just comes back out of their bloodstream into their lungs instead of being trapped since they aren't constantly breathing in new air leading to an excess of nitrogen to be dissolved in their blood. Seems like the same logic would apply to whales and dolphins. They only go down with their lungs worth of air so it just comes out of their blood back into their lungs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Air is mostly nitrogen and when this gets released at depth, the nitrogen bubbles get into your bloodstream. It takes time for these to dissipate as you ascend, which is why you ascend slowly when on compressed air. If you take a big breath of normal pressure air and then drive super deep, you can ascend at whatever rate you want.</p>
<p>This is why free divers can swim upwards incredibly fast with their huge monofin after their speed descents - besides the fact that they have to in order not to drown...</p>
<p>By the way, they call it the bends because when it happens, the nitrogen bubbles get trapped in people's joints, causing them much pain when bending the joints. IE: &quot;the bends&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To answer more generally, the particle you get at the end when combining quarks depends on more than just the quark content. It also depends on spin, as above, and also something weird known as &quot;isospin&quot;. Some nucleons and delta baryons have the same quark content, but they have different spin.

<p>Actually, this is not quite correct.  The exterior layers of neutron stars are composed of (neutron-rich) nuclei and free electrons.  This outer layer is called the <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v7/30" target="_blank">crust</a>.  Only deeper in the interior of neutron stars do the higher pressures make free neutrons stable.</p>
<p>Since the surface of a neutron star will always be composed of &quot;regular&quot; nuclei and electrons, you never get a direct view of the sea of free neutrons in the interior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Now imagine you expand the shell even more, so that it has the same radius as Earth's orbit. Now the total output of the sun is divided among a <em>very</em> large area, so each individual area is not receiving nearly as much energy.

<p>It is simply due to distance. The same happens with a light source on Earth: the light from a light bulb diminishes with distance because as distance from the light source increases, the light gets spread out over a larger area so that light intensity per unit of surface area (m^2) decreases.  For every doubling of the distance, the intensity decreases with factor 4. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The power radiated by a star is evenly distributed over that surface.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no concept of 'more hydrating'. Why? Because hydrating means provide your body with water, and it happens either way whether you're drinking bottled water, sea water or even piss. It's just marketing language. </p>
<p>However, sports drinks come in various electrolyte concentrations that can help your body depending on when you want to drink:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>hypotonic drinks have a lower electrolyte concentration than your blood. Since the electrolyte concentration in the cells is higher than the blood/sports drink and water always flows to the compartment with the highest salt concentration (osmosis), the water goes into the cells and the body is most efficiently hydrated. Hypotonic drinks work the best before an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isotonic drinks have the same electrolyte concentration as the blood, which is ideal during/after exercise. You want to replace the fluids/electrolytes that you've lost by sweating. Most of the time isotonic drinks also contain carbohydrates to provide the body some extra fuel and absorb the electrolytes more efficiently (electrolyte/water transport channels in the small intestine work better in presence of glucose).</p>
</li>
<li>hypertonic drinks contain high glucose/high electrolytes(/protein). The goal isn't necessarily rehydrating the body, but replenish glycogen stores (a form of glucose stores in muscle tissue) and electrolyte levels. Works best after an intense workout.</li>
</ul>

When explaining the human body as simplistic as possible you can't have anything right, people forget it's an ELI5 and sometimes you have to leave certain parts out in order to make the subject comprehensive for someone who doesn't know much about the human body. If you want an explanation that covers everything I suggest you should post a question over at r/askscience or r/physiology. There are simply too many different systems in the body that interact/counteract with each other depending how healthy the body is and/or the state of the body during rest/exercise. But I'll try to adress the most common responses here (still in ELI5). Sorry for formatting or spelling, I'm on mobile. Also, English is my third language.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is Gatorade/Powerade/G-Fuel hypo-, iso-, or hypertonic? It depends what kind of drink you buy, each brand has specialized sports drinks series designed for your type of exercise and preferred moment of hydration in the flavor that you like. By the way, tonicity refers to the sodium concentration in the beverage, not the glucose content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dehydration vs. hypovolemia vs. hypernatremia. Dehydration is when the total body water (cells, blood, spaces between cells) is less than normal. Hypovolemia is when the blood volume is less than normal (about 5L). Hypernatremia is when the salt concentration in the blood is higher than normal. Some simple examples: you just donated blood? Hypovolemia. Exercised for a long period in the heat without drinking? Dehydration and possible hypernatremia. Did you drink a 2 liters of sea water? Hypernatremia and hypervolemia. They all trigger thirst response, but the underlying mechanisms are different.
Make sure you drink 1.5-2 liters of water per day to keep your body hydrated and filter out unwanted chemicals whether you're exercising or not regardless of outside temperatures. Don't chug it all in once but drink it throughout the day. If you're thirsty, it's already too late. Check your pee: if it's clear, you're good to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>point of hypotonic beverages (and water). The premise is that the hypotonic water flows into the cells, plus you're overfilling your cardiovascular system. When exercising, water leaves the blood compartment first due to sweating before 'using' the water that in in the cells. This acts like a sort of buffer before you feel the effects of hypernatremia. That's the marketing part, but you could drink water as well. You don't have to go to the store to buy this stuff and it's saves you money.
<em>But you're overfilling the system! Don't the kidneys filter excess water out of the system?</em> Yes they do. The primary jobs of the kidneys are regulating blood pressure and sodium content, filtering metabolites out of the blood etc. First response is: 'Fuck! Sodium concentration is too low, too much water and the blood pressure is too high!' What happens is that the kidneys excrete water, but don't <strong>re</strong>absorb while retaining electrolyes. Result: pissing. But not during exercise. During exercise the sympathetic nervous system activity is elevated (responsible for fight/flight), causing the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This cascade is designed to prevent blood pressure from dropping too low by releasing agents in the blood stream that cause the arteries to constrict and the kidneys to recollect more water that already has been excreted. An example of the power this system can be found in people with heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure), where the sympathetic nervous system is overactive all the time, and the RAAS as well.
<em>But how can you properly exercise when all the arteries are constricted? Shouldn't the arteries to the exercising muscles stay open to provide blood?</em> Yes they do, it's a process called functional sympatholysis and is a phenomenon where the local environment overrides the sympathetic signals coming from the body. This enables the main arteries to the exercising muscles to dilate under influence of local nitric oxide (NO) release. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>best cure for a hangover? There is no cure, only prevention. Alternate between water and your preferred alcoholic beverage of choice as much as possible. Alcohol counteracts the effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the kidneys, also known as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which makes you pee more than you drink. Drink 1-2 glasses of water before you go to sleep. Don't expect miracles the next morning but the headache should be a bit more bearable.</p>
</li>
<li>better explanation of the point of adding glucose and sodium to drinks. When you're healthy, it doesn't matter how you ingest sodium, glucose and water. The body is capable of transporting sodium ions through the intestinal border, causing water to follow it. But drinking tap water or water without added electrolytes also works well. Another way to get water into the body is the so called GLUT transporter. It is a protein that transports glucose and sodium from the gut into the body, causing the water to follow. This protein never fails and is one of the reasons why sports drinks also contain glucose, in addition to flavor and provide a bit of extra energy. For diarrhea, IV rehydration works the best but an oral rehydration solution is the next best alternative. It's super rich in electrolytes and glucose, and if you don't have it in your arsenal when you're sick you can make one yourself as well. Sports drinks also help as a last resort but they don't have the stopping power that ORS has. If you want to know more about this topic, u/Dex2Dex can provide a more detailed answer down below.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No no. All of these posts are missing the main reason why glucose and sodium are added to rehydrating drinks.</p>
<p>Its not just about osmotic gradients. It's about glucose and sodium channels being coupled with the gates that allow water absorption in your GI tract. (By coupled I mean triggering one will trigger the other.) If you want to maximize absorption of water after whatever balance your body thinks it has achieved you facilitate the process by adding glucose and sodium to activate these coupled transport gates. That is why WHO rehydration packs have these additives... otherwise if it was purely about osmotic gradients you wouldnt need glucose, only salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But it's not a special ingredient or any of that salt electrolyte bullshit. Consuming chia seeds that have been soaked in water overnight will continuously keep you hydrated throuought the day. The seeds are covered my a membrane that, when soaked, it expands and absorbs. They can hold 10 times their weight in water. And after consuming, as your body digests the seeds, the membranes slowly absorb into your system releasing all the water that has been absorbed. They keep you more hydrated than anything else and give you incredible energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone with DI, allow me to explain. Diabetes insipidus is an issue with your kidneys (or nerves) having problems flushing out electrolytes in the right concentration. Essentially, you urinate more than you should and excrete more water than you should. In my case, I take electrolytes to retain water. Without something with electrolytes, such as just plain water, I excrete 90% of the fluids within 30 minutes of drinking. Because your body needs these electrolytes to function and to hold water, an electrolyte balance must be maintained. Hydration without electrolytes in the case of DI leads to severe dehydration, as your body can't hold water without the right electrolytes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Thats why salt makes you thirsty. So those drinks arent giving you any more hydratiom than water, but simply allowing the water you take it to hydrate your more efficiently. Usually sports drinks are intended to be consumed along with additional water to better support an active body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg yolks are incredible emulsifiers; they help fat-based and water-based substances form finer blends. If you took a (pasteurized) raw egg yolk and added to it your salad dressing of oil and vinegar, you'd find that the the whole thing would form a creamy suspension that would stay together for a while. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the egg white are basically water and protein, which as /u/mb34i said can do some pretty impressive tricks. The bonus is that the fat in the yolks, and the water in the whites already have an emulsifier in the yolk; the egg is a complete kit to emulsify itself and anything else. An omelette, or scrambled eggs, is just such an emulsion, cooked. On its own, the white can also be whipped up into a tight froth and used to add air and volume to something that would otherwise not be raised, such as meringue, souffle, or mousse. </p>
<p>When you add all of those things and use them in different combinations, you have the reason for eggs popularity in cuisine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg whites specifically are pretty unique in that it's largely made up of protein, but it's not all bunched up and stiff. When you heat it, the water evaporates and the proteins stiffen up. That's why you use eggs so often in baking; it's like the glue that keeps baked goods together.</p>
<p>The yolks, however, are mostly fat, so it's usually used when you are looking for more flavors or for an egg wash to make baked goods shiny.</p>
<p>And of course there are many recipes that call for eggs just for the sake of having them; many people like the taste and texture. I personally don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Details: </p>
<p>What is smoke? It's soot, and carbon compounds, tar, aerosols, un burned fuel, and other components of incomplete combustion. When a fire burns brightly and hotly, it efficiently combines oxygen with carbon to make carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and with hydrogen to make water vapor. </p>
<p>If all of the hydrocarbons and organic material being burned are done so cleanly, then there is very little smoke and instead an almost pure reaction resulting in carbon dioxide and  water which are odorless and transparent gases. IE not smoke. </p>
<p>When a flame is extinguished but there is still a lot of latent heat, the process of burning is snuffed out resulting in incomplete transformation into the water and carbon dioxide, leading to incomplete compounds which create the soot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking like putting water on it to put it out,  it's a lot of steam from the water. Otherwise a fire is a chemical reaction. The heat breaks it down into other chemicals. Always H2O and CO2, and then whatever else the material is made out of. Which is why when you use a lighter or BBQ you don't get a lot, if any smoke. The fuel is made of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. If it has, say zinc, that isn't a part of CO2 or H2O, so you are seeing the zinc. But also in early and late stages, the fire is not enough to keep up the full reaction, so that smoke is actually the tree it self. Very fine particles, the sap being turned to gas, etc. Firm that reason the smoke is very dangerous. Not only is it flammable, but since it's all spread out it has a higher surface area, and is even more so flamable. Almost to the point if explosion. You can see this in flower mill, or sawdust catching fire. Or the mythbusters episode when they blew up coffee creamer. Or in the case of a fire/smoke a flash over or back draft. Watch a video on YouTube of that and you can see the smoke itself is burning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>You can approximate this at home by taking one of those styrofoam coolers and filling it with (filtered then boiled then cooled to room temp) water, and then placing it (without the lid) into your freezer. It will freeze from the top down, and will force any impurities into the remaining liquid water, like a Clinebell in reverse. When about 2/3 of the water is frozen, remove the block of ice. It should be almost perfectly clear. Discard the remaining water, which will look dirty beyond belief.

<p>In an ice cube tray or an ice maker in a residential freezer, cups are filled with water and frozen. The air is frozen in with it. This is why sometimes the ice tastes bad: whatever odors are in the air in your freezer are being frozen in with the ice.</p>

When the layer of ice on top reaches the desired thickness, (which may take 24 hours or more), remove it from the freezer and cut it into cubes. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7CuaIt9.jpg" target="_blank">my cubes</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tend to disagree with the premise of this ELI5 on the whole. Specifically, I believe there may be a stigma about the goal of 'getting drunk' in certain groups, but there are certainly those who 'party hard' for the sake of being drunk as a group. Age has nothing to do with it. I've been out with 40 somethings that party harder than I can handle. And frankly - That's ok. As long as they aren't a public nuisance or a danger to themselves/others... have fun!</p>
<p>Cultures also vary. Someone mentioned pulling out a joint at a party of kids - it has a stigma associated with it in some circles for the same reason that (at least today) smoking cigarettes around kids has a stigma. But there are also groups who don't care about that either...</p>
<p>I also think that lumping all recreational drugs into a singular 'getting high' and separating out alcohol as a different state (i.e., 'drunk') does a disservice to the positive aspects of certain drugs. Caffeine, for example, is a drug that is almost universally socially accepted. The 'wakefulness' is its high, and the impacts on productivity are dramatically positive, and there are (as with all things) some negative aspects that have to be considered on an individual basis. But we don't see headlines about the epidemic of coffee addicts in this country, because on the whole we perceive it as a positive thing. </p>
<p>I think another perspective I disagree with are the comments on the 'historical societal value' of alcohol vs. other drugs. While there is going to be some fundamental truth to the fact that the flavor and experience of drinking an alcoholic beverage is inextricably linked to culinary culture, I think comments like that seem to dismiss the appreciation that cultures have had in history for those 'other recreational drugs'. There are numerous accounts of creative people who have found themselves better able to find that sense of 'flow' when they've smoked pot. Some liken it to the ancient greeks 'muses', and there are many ancient historical references to the use of cannabis in Greece (<del>Bacchus</del> (thanks /u/Hixhen) Dionysus knew how to party - yo.)</p>
<p>It might also help to separate out unproductive 'stoners' from 'marijuana enthusiasts' because that distinction is lost on most people, who seem to lump the two together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting drunk is the goal, just as getting high is. The only difference is that there's a level above drunk when you take it too far, which is getting wasted, which is not the goal (usually). With alcohol, people are searching for that perfect level where you lower your inhibitions, it's easier to socialize, everything seems very fun and you're still in control of yourself for the most part. When you take it too far, it becomes decidedly un-fun and downright dangerous, which isn't something that happens with weed. When you smoke too much weed you just kind of &quot;green out&quot; or &quot;get couched&quot; but it's really not dangerous to your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like drinking culture encourages getting drunk, just like stoners get high. Then you have the regular drinkers and medical or occasional tokers who consume responsibly and would place that stigma on those who over-indulge. I'll assume that is what you actually meant.</p>
<p>With getting drunk, the likelihood of a negative event is much greater (bodily harm, embarrassing or immoral acts, drunk tank, etc). That is why we placed more stigma around that than the dude who got too high and fell asleep on the couch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I belong to neither culture, but I have been drunk and I have been high. </p>
<p>Every time I get drunk, the situation varies. Most times, say like 80%  I get super happy, super outgoing, and become just a generally jolly guy. Say about 17% of the time, I get super emotional, crying, laughing, crying more, yadda yadda. Then say about 3% of the time I get angry and mean. This is rare, and generally it's based on some stimuli, like the time my ex picked a fight with me that led to her being my ex. </p>
<p>Now, every time I've gotten high, the same thing has happened: I get super mellow, have a brief moment of panic, then I get mellow again, and I enter a chill mode. I've never gotten angry, I've never gotten sad, it's always basically been chill. </p>
<p>I've hung out with people you could say are part of drinking culture.  For some of them, the end goal is to get drunk. For most though, it's just to get buzzed. I've also known people who just like to drink a beer or some type of liquor for the taste. </p>
<p>I don't know if this is what you were looking for but I hope it helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

During his first 100, he created a madhouse of policy change, bill drafting, signing, and law shifts in the nation. It was considered so intense that it became common place to measure the first 100 days of newer presidents against it. While we no longer compare to FDR for the 100 day rule, it's generally believed that the first 100 can give us insight into what might be the new norm. If they can hold their promises, unify, or in some sad cases. Divide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The effective time that a president can actually govern is a lot shorter than most people think it is.</p>
<p>Congress is elected every 2 years, and they are fairly unlikely to actually get anything done in the year before an election (since everyone's focus is on campaigning, no one wants to take direction from the president during this time).  So your second year is basically toast.  The last year you are running for reelection, so it's toast too.  You only really get your first and third years to do shit.</p>
<p>So the president starts January 21st as their first full day.  Congress is basically useless after December 31st, but nothing happens over Christmas so let's make it Dec 1st. And you lose August since that's Congress's summer break.  So you only really get 9 months in that first year.  </p>
<p>So when it comes down to it, the number 100 is selected basically brutally but it's around 1/3 of your total effective time in the first 2 years.  It's long enough that you should have had time to build your government and get your people confirmed, then move on to the most important parts of making legislation. </p>
<p>In a normal (nontrump) world, legislation is a LONG process.  You start it by proposing a bill, then there's endless debate and amendments before the damn thing actually gets voted on.  For big plans, this can take a long time.  Obamacare took something like 18 months.  So if a president wants to make something happen in their first term, they REALLY need to have already started on it within that first 100 days.</p>
<p>So while the actual 100 number is somewhat arbitrary, having a measuring point for a new president is actually quite useful.</p>
<p>As for why it's not shorter, it takes a few months to get the confirmations through with.  So making it something like 60 days does not have much time for the president to turn their attention to legislation.  Longer might make sense, but really a president does not get very much time and if you make it longer you start to get away from their &quot;beginning&quot; of the presidency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My 2 cents here, there's a book out out by the Harvard Business Review called &quot;The First 90 Days&quot; that is a good reference for those moving into a new (management) role in a company. The very first line in the book, &quot;The president of the United States gets 100 days to prove himself; you get 90.&quot; It goes on to assert that success within those first few months can go a long way in setting the stage for later success or failure. Part of that onboarding period is when you build your team, start developing and aligning your strategy with how things actually work, earn some early successes, etc. So while the 100 days number may be arbitrary, the concept of &quot;early wins&quot; should not be a foreign concept to a businessperson.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
