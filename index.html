		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it's true that the core reason Facebook shares lives and connects people is to make money, I'd like to instead address something I see underlying the question. I interpret your question as wondering why Facebook is making public a conversation that you observe or interpret to be private (or at the very least personal). The answer is that your friends are having a conversation in a public place. Your friends are opting to make this conversation public. It's true that Facebook thinks that this might be of some interest to you, and your friends do too. When we post on Facebook on someone's wall or comment on their posts, we do so in a public forum (not totally unlike Reddit or other forums and aggregates). Keep in mind that Facebook has a private message service where interactions are not shared with other parties.</p>
<p>Once your buddies are willing to share their conversation out loud and in public, Facebook is more than willing to leverage it to engineer your attention. Others have pointed out that the more connections you have on FB the more likely you are to engage with the service. The more you engage, the more ads you see. </p>
<p>edit: Just to add one more thing: to some degree by opting to have this conversation in public they are all but inviting others to join in. Or at the very least to observe. While your particular manners may preclude you from jumping in uninvited, I would say that those manners do not always extend to public forums... or ever to public forums.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two components to your question. First is why fusion is possible in the Sun's core, second is why our fusion reactors need to run at much higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The second question is easier to answer, so I'll go for that one first.</p>
<p>The Sun actually produces so little power by volume that it would be completely impractical to reproduce the conditions of the Sun's core in a fusion reactor, <em>even if we could somehow do so</em> (we can't, because containing plasma at such pressures would be incredibly difficult and dangerous). The Sun is producing a lot of energy because it's so huge, but the actual power release per volume is only about a quarter of human resting metabolism.</p>
<p>You would literally get four times more thermal power out of a regular, resting person, than you could out of a human-sized chunk of solar core material.</p>
<p>So reproducing the Sun's core would make even a reactor of gargantuan size produce very little power. You'd quite literally need a star-sized reactor for a significant power output... and we already have that (albeit at 1 AU distance). What we need for practical fusion reactors is a significantly higher energy density, and for technical reasons, that involves a much higher temperature to get the fusion yield higher.</p>
<p>The explanation on why fusion can occur in the Sun and other stars requires a longer explanation, which has to go a bit deeper into those technical reasons.</p>
<p>Fusion is what happens when two light atomic nuclei collide hard enough that they overcome their electrical repulsion, come into &quot;contact&quot; with each other, and discover that forming one large nucleus is energetically more favourable than existing as separate nuclei. So they merge, and release some high energy photons, and sometimes some leftover particles are also ejected. For example, when tritium and deuterium nuclei come together like this, they form one helium nucleus, and one leftover neutron is ejected.</p>
<p>The more detailed reason as to why this happens is that there is a force called strong interaction, which is incredibly powerful at short ranges and is the main thing responsible for holding together not only protons and neutrons within atomic nuclei, but actually it is the force that binds together the quarks that form the protons and neutrons themselves. When two nuclei approach each other, they are strongly repelled from each other by the electric force (often called the Coulomb barrier), <em>but</em> if they get close enough, then the incredibly strong nuclear force will overcome the repulsion and bind the nuclei together. And sometimes eject something. Depends on the reaction.</p>
<p>This is actually also why the amount of neutrons increases along with the protons as you go up the periodic table of elements - with protons alone, the electric repulsion is not strong enough to hold the nucleus together, and you need neutrons to increase the strong interaction while not contributing to the electric force. So, the neutrons act as a glue that holds large nuclei together - but only up to a certain point. After the number of protons reaches a certain amount, the sheer size of the nucleus becomes so large that the strong interaction provided by the increased neutrons can no longer hold it together, and the nucleus becomes unstable. This means it will at some point eject something in order to reach a more stable configuration; this is called radioactive decay, and the ejected something are what radioactivity is. This is also the reason why, say, Uranium-238 is much less radioactive than Uranium-235; the three additional neutrons make the nucleus it more stable... But I digress. Back to fusion.</p>
<p>Obviously, fusion doesn't happen easily, as evidenced by our existence. There are two main barriers in the way of fusion reactions happening. The first one is obviously that atomic nuclei are normally bound with electrons around them, forming actual atoms. The first thing you need to do is to get rid of the electrons entirely, which is something called ionization. This is done by heating the gas so much that the atoms shed their electrons by collisions with each other, and the high heat keeps them from re-binding into atoms.</p>
<p>So now you have a plasma with free atomic nuclei surrounded by a free electron soup, hopefully contained in some way because otherwise it's going to just expand and cool off almost immediately.</p>
<p>But this alone is not enough. Since atomic nuclei consist of positively charged protons, and neutrons with no charge at all, they are strongly repelled from each other by the electric force. So getting them to come into &quot;contact&quot; with each other is very hard, and that means they have to collide very violently in order to defeat the energy barrier created by their electric fields.</p>
<p>However, if you increase the collision energy high enough - over the Coulomb barrier - the collisions will eventually bring the two nuclei close enough that the attractive force of the strong interaction overcomes the repulsive force of positive electric charges, and fusion can occur.</p>
<p>Actually it turns out that fusion occurs at significantly lower collision energies than expected simply by naïve analysis based only on the relative strengths of electric repulsion and strong nuclear attraction, but it is still a good basic summary of the problem. The reason for the lower energy requirement in reality is due to quantum physics: The nuclei basically have a certain probability of quantum tunneling through the energy barrier, achieving a closer proximity to each other than classical physics predicts, which means that <em>sometimes</em>, even at &quot;too low&quot; energies, fusion will still occur. And if that distance is small enough for the strong interaction to take the wheel... well, fusion happens. And it turns out that this process is actually significant enough to be a big deal for stellar fusion, as the temperature and pressure withing the cores of stars is just too low to break the Coulomb barrier.</p>
<p>Regardless of the minutia of how the nuclear fusion is achieved, the important thing to realize here is that as far as particle collisions are concerned, pressure and temperature are kind of interchangeable. Increasing the temperature makes the collisions more high-energy, but increasing the pressure means there's more of them happening. More collisions happening means you'll get more quantum tunneling going on, and thus you start getting some fusion out of this mess even though you're too low to break the Coulomb barrier.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Sun's core is compressed by the gravity of all the mass of the Sun itself around it. The density itself is actually surprisingly low, &quot;only&quot; about 160 times the density of water (160000 kg/m^3). It's still way more dense than any element we can handle in solid form - depleted uranium, for example, is about 19,050 kg/m^3 in density, which is only about 1/8th of the density of the Sun's core, but it's still a number we can understand well enough. A litre of the Sun's core would weigh 160 kg, though. This density, at 15 million degrees temperature, is enough to bring a great number of protons to a close proximity to each other, which increases the chances of the quantum tunneling happening through sheer statistical probability. And there was light.</p>
<p>By contrast, the plasma densities we can achieve are pretty much limited by how strong a magnetic field we can produce, and compared to gravitationally compressed plasma, it's not actually all that high. We can achieve very high pressures in small scale, like with a diamond anvil (high enough to allegedly turn hydrogen into a metallic phase), but containing fully ionized plasma at such pressures and at large scales would quite likely be impossible. And like explained in the short explanation, even if we <em>could</em> do it, it would not actually help make a useful reactor, so increasing the temperature is probably the only way we can do it.</p>
<p>Basically, if we want a high enough fusion yield out of the plasma to actually cover the expenses of running it, we simply cannot rely on the quantum tunneling, we <em>have</em> to break the Coulomb barrier. If we can do that consistently, and with a good fusion yield, then the thermal energy yield should be quite substantially more than it took to run the reactor (heating the plasma to fusion temperatures and containing it during the reaction), but so far it's proven to be rather an extreme technical challenge to get a net yield of energy out of it. Aside from thermonuclear bombs, of course, but those are not very practical for energy production...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>15 million kelvin is only 1.2 keV, the fusion barrier between two protons is about 500 keV. The only possible way fusion can happen in the sun at all is by one proton tunneling through this energy barrier. Tunneling is slow. It only happens in large quantities in the sun because there's a lot of hydrogen there. Tunneling in the lab would be a very rare event because we just don't have enough material.</p>
<p>I see a lot of replies here which kinda skirt around the issue. This is the most accurate answer there is. As a side note, your number of 100 million degrees in the lab is 861 keV. The Coulomb barrier for tritium on deuterium is only ~450 keV. So 100+ million <em>is</em> enough energy for the reaction to occur without tunneling.</p>

At the center of the magnetic needle is a cup, and that cup rests on a support needle.  You have to hold the compass level, so that the needle can swing freely.  If you are off-level, the needle will jam or drag on the housing. Essentially, compasses only works in a single plane.  However, in the microgravity environment of Earth orbit, there is nothing to keep the magnetic needle from drifting off of the support needle and jamming against the housing.  There is no way to hold it so that the needle is constrained to pivot on the support needle.  So, you will not get accurate results.</p>
<p>However, if you just let a bar magnet float free, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_uKt2i2jvc" target="_blank">like they did on the International Space Station</a>, it will align itself with the strongest magnetic field.

<p>1- Ship compasses, which are designed to rotate freely in all directions, allowing the compass to maintain a fairly accurate (minus shaking) bearing even in rough seas (this solves the issue of trying to keep the compass level enough to have it spin properly when you're ascending/descending waves). This sort of compass would point along the strongest magnetic field in it's local area (so in the ISS it would point north, unless you brought a stronger magnet nearer)</p>
<ol>
<li>Electric compasses, which function in many different ways, but generally do the same thing as type 1, just without using a free swiveling magnet. Ergo they would direct you to the strongest local magnetic attraction. One benefit of these is that they can function under much lower strengths. Therefore they could point along the suns magnetic field, or even the galactic field if you took them out of the solar system</li>

<p>I went from that straight to unemployment while looking for any civilian job. If I wasn't charismatic and able to talk my way into work when I really need to, I'd be homeless as well.</p>

<p>Many of these comments are somewhat right, but a big piece of the puzzle is missing.  Yes, PTSD sucks ass, but most of us manage/channel/and/or don't have it.  Most vets haven't seen combat, contrary to some of these posts.  The worst a lot of people have seen/heard is a mortar impact.  The training, while getting better (IMHO. I received a lot of &quot;life experience credits&quot; for a Bachelor's coming from a combat MOS), still has a lot of catching up to do as pointed out.  It is <em>extremely</em> hard to adjust to civ life after being in for some people, especially after multiple tours overseas.  This is where I believe the missing piece is. Institutionalization.  Having such routine, discipline, and structure attached to everything is difficult to part from.  Going from that to being able to grow your freedom beard (or, should I say &quot;allowed&quot; to emphasize the point) is kind of mind blowing.  Purpose and duty to mundane and boring AF is a brutal change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here's a couple pro-tips for vets.</p>
<p>Have you ever signed for anything (of course you have) then you &quot;successfully managed and maintained equipment valued at (whatever cost...HMMWVs are about a quarter million bucks BTW)&quot;</p>
<p>Ever had to teach a class (you probably did) then you've &quot;successfully trained and prepared x number of personnel&quot;</p>
<p>Ever lead a detail or held a leadership position? Then you &quot;supervised x number of employees&quot;</p>
<p>Shit like that.</p>
<p>I put all this crap on my resume and got a job before my terminal leave was even over so I think I'm decent at spinning the army crap into relateable BS.  Then when you get the job work your ass off, civilians are fucking lazy and everyone is used to that so if you actually fucking work you're automatically in the top percentage of quality employees</p>
<p>Edit:  if anyone wants, inbox me and I'll help you spin your military shit into something real too</p>
<p>And another pro-tip for like everyone...print your resume on different color paper.  Like a subtle difference than plain white, nothing crazy but when there's a stack and the guy sees one that's slightly more blue or whatever he might pull it out first.. which is good</p>

<p>I was wondering, do these ever truly go to zero? I realize it's most likely similar to cutting something in half over and over again trying to get to zero mass, but at SOME point you hit subatomic particles and can't get anywhere.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just going expand on the zero part, but you can answer this question just by saying that the energy eventually leaves and normalizes the system (whatever that normal state is). But going to zero actually means something else, you can think of all systems, and how you measure values from those systems in the following way:</p>
<p>Depending on which model you are working with, the average measurement can APPROACH zero. If you take for example energy in a system, lets say KE, then your average measurement can be zero. By the nature of riemann sums and the fundamental theorem of calculus, you know that you are taking the sum of parts. The parts are never zero, but their sums can be. The measurements reflect some sum. If you are ever able to measure a part independently, you would never get a 0 measurement within a system (unless it is relative to it self). Even if its completely ordered with no entropy (an impossible system even at abs 0). By the nature of measurements, it would be a force relative to something. None of our current models allow it to be zero. Only in theory can a non-summed zero measure exist. In practice, that zero measurement would be relative to another force, and thus explicitly non-zero.</p>
<p>We thus only know the part up to the smallest measurement, and breaking it down any further is theoretical. You pick your model and based on that model you can take a measurement and break it down into the smallest defined possibility for that model. In simplest terms, if you find that the KE of a 2 particle system is some arbitrary value 4. If your model for this system predicts equal distribution of energy between particles  then you can use that to do &quot;math&quot; on the measurement of &quot;4&quot; and arrive at 2 per particle (although you never measured that 2, you measured its sum). Similarly, now with that value of 2 you can use a model for that one particle and arrive at how the KE is distributed within the particle etc etc.</p>
<p>Engineers that do signal processing for example use Fourier analysis to break down signal wave forms into their fundamentals based on knowns, measurements  and theory. Each step allows you to get further. However, once you move beyond measurements of parts, you are basically breaking down the sums using the model for that system. Its really powerful. It might not be the &quot;true value&quot; but it is consistent if the model you apply is consistent. So our smallest calculated value can be non-real but still be a defined consistent output. Weirdly enough, this calculated value can be 0. But the measurements leading up to it can never be zero. Or if you prefer, it can also be said as ~ there is no way to measure something unless it is relative to another thing, even if that thing is a purely theoretical value. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conservation of energy says if you put some energy into a system, it either stays there, or crosses the boundary again somehow, but you got that energy somewhere else, and it certainly still exists <em>somewhere</em>.  In most of the situations you'll encounter, it will leave the system as heat after being damped out by some resistance, or friction, or some such.</p>
<p>I had a professor who liked to say &quot;Models have limitations; stupidity does not.&quot;  When you calculate the differential equations, you're modeling the system.  You're excluding dozens of damping mechanics and higher order terms that contribute to the system's operation.  In your example, you have already considered damping - this is not a sink, but a radiator of energy via heat.  You're essentially transforming displacement energy into heat via friction.  Oscillation requires energy!</p>
<p>Using a different example, an LC tank circuit would theoretically appear to oscillate forever at its natural frequency after being charged, but in reality any inductor or capacitor you used to build it would also include equivalent series resistance, and parasitic components that are generally not accounted for by a simple 'L' and 'C'.  The unaccounted for resistances would dissipate the energy as heat, which is then transferred across the boundary of the system to the environment.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  That punch has been an unnoticeable part of our common experience since you damped it out in your muscles and radiated the heat through your skin to the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A lot of data is low bandwidth.  A lot of data is carried on wires or can be shifted to wires and have only short distances covered by wireless.    There's directional methods, too, where antenna polarization is used to send separate signals on the same carrier frequency, as was done (and still is) on satellites.  </p>
<p>The  spectrum keeps getting bigger, and more efficient, too.   Digital signal processing (DSP) lets us put thousands of digital carriers on a single signal, and signals can co-exist on the same frequency using spread spectrum techniques.  </p>
<p>A lot depends on a lot, so to get better responses, maybe expand your question a little?  What's your concern?  Did you read somewhere that we're running out of spectrum?   Or is this just a general question?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We won't ever run out of space on the radio frequency spectrum, per se.  Instead, the radio frequency spectrum, or parts of it, will become over-saturated with signals.  Over-saturation causes the fidelity of the signals to decrease - i.e. what is received matches what was sent less and less.</p>
<p>There is a band of frequencies where this has sort of happened and there are a TON of things that are done to work around it.  That band of frequencies is around 2.4 GHZ which can be used without a license.  Here's just a few of the things in that band: </p>
<ul>
<li>Microwave ovens</li>
<li>Wireless Home Phones</li>
<li>Wifi</li>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we can't see radio signals, the best way to visualize everything is to think of light.  A basic radio signal is like an incandescent light bulb - casting light in all directions a short distance.  Saturation would be like having too many light bulbs on in one place.</p>
<p>One method of dealing with saturation is shielding.  Microwave ovens so that it can cook your food better.  In our light analogy, this would be like putting the light bulb in a room so that we can see the light when in the room but not outside the room.</p>
<p>Another method is limiting power to what is needed.  Your wireless home phone only needs to work within the confines of your home.  Your bluetooth devices only needs to work within the confines of your person.  For both devices, the power is set to work well in the expected range and that's it.  In the light analogy, this would be like having a dimmer switch so that you can adjust the amount of light to what you need and no more.</p>
<p>Modulation of frequency, amplitude, and/or phase.  Wifi makes use of all these type of modulation.  When the signal is good (little/no interference), it can combine these to deliver information faster.  When the signal is not a good (minor/major interference), it can use these to deliver information with more fidelity.  The reason these method can work better with interference is because the signal is encoded in the modulation rather than the radio wave itself.  In our light analogy, this would be like everyone having white flashlights and using colored flashlights for communication.</p>
<p>Directional transmission is another way of handling saturation.  Cell phone towers typically have 3 directional antennas that each cover 120 degrees.  The main reason to do this was to handle 3 times the signal with each tower.  The other reason was that directional antennas can transmit further because they are more focused.  In our light analogy, this would be like using flashlights instead of incandescent bulbs or lasers instead of flashlights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question, because in the U.S. we are about to have a major restructuring of the band of frequencies between 600 and 698 MHz, mandated by Congress. This affects primarily television broadcasters and wireless microphone users. What is most likely to happen is that more efficient digital technologies will be developed &amp; used for each type of service, meaning each type of service used (individual tv channels, microphones, etc) will require a significantly smaller slice of spectrum than prior technologies. For instance, wireless mic manufacturer Shure has developed a technology that will allow you to run 47 (wow!) digital wireless microphones in just 6 MHz of radio spectrum. That's an impossible number-vs-spectrum with traditional analog wireless microphones. The trade-off is distance: it's short-range, i.e. ~30 meters, IIRC. But that's plenty for most applications. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What doping does in those systems is create conditions under which a junction between two semiconductors can be made to conduct electricity. In other words, it can be switched between a zero state, or a one state. But without the doping, the materials used, like silicon, are semiconductors on their own. Being a semiconductor means simply that the electrons living inside those materials can never have certain values of their energy. Imagine they can have any value between 0 and 1 (in some unit of energy), or any value between 2 and 3, but they can't have values between 1 and 2. That part of the energy spectrum is known as the energy gap. Basically, if you put electrons in all states from 0 to 1, you cannot put another one in a state of energy 1.0001, for example. The next available energy for that extra electron is 2, so you have to provide one entire unit of energy to bring that electron into your material.</p>
<p>That's precisely what happens when you transport electricity: you connect metallic cables to your sample, and you apply a voltage to bring electrons from your battery, through one cable, into the sample, then out through the other cable and back to the battery. But if you need to provide 1 unit of energy, and your battery can only provide, say, half a unit, then you cannot bring electrons into the sample (there are no states for those energies!), and current can't pass through it. That's what being a semiconductor is all about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't necessarily have to be doped. Doping allows the creation of diodes, certain types of transistors and devices. A semiconductor is defined by having a specific bandgap. Insulators are materials that have a large separation between the valence and conduction band so it would be difficult for electrons to get excited and move into the conduction band. Conductors usually have lots of electrons in the conduction band and the valence band can overlap the conduction band meaning it'll easily be conductive. For semiconductor it's somewhere in between and a few electrons can reach the conduction band.
The most basic is semiconductor is silicon based and you can manipulate its behavior by adding dopants such as in the diode or silicon mosfet.
One example is a transistor that doesn't have to use doped material is a Gallium Nitride High electron mobility transistor (HEMT). Essentially you have a small layer of AlGaN on top of GaN and due to the lattice mismatch it causes a stress on the interface which causes a piezoelectric polarization thereby creating a 2 dimensional electron gas channel like with regular silicon mosfets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semiconductors are simply materials which <em>can</em> be doped to make Electronic Devices based off of those materials. Usually doping(in Silicon based devices) involves using Silicon which has been laced with impurities to produce the pn junctions you speak of. Silicon by itself is an intrinsic semiconductor and it's not capable of being used as is in devices. </p>
<p>Nowadays, for MOSFETs(Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), we use Compound Semiconductors which are made out of different materials altogether. For example Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is used because it can give us better conduction characteristics and produce faster devices. Another one, as has been pointed out below is AlGaN(Aluminum Gallium Nitride) which is used in cases where we need extremely high mobility (speed of movement) of electrons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that MOSFETs form the basis of Very Large Scale Integrated circuits which are the basis of chip fabrication technology today.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be an intrinsic semiconductor?</p>
<p>You can take a pure silicon wafer and it's still considered a semiconductor. Mostly this regular silicon can't be used as it is because we need a charge imbalance to induce current flow. This is done by doping two pieces of silicon and joining them to form the pn junction you talked about. I hope the internal process of doping is something you've understood well already.</p>
<p>A device with only 1 pn junction is a diode. We can alter the doping concentrations of the p and n type substrates (surfaces) to produce different devices. For example Zener diodes use imbalances in doping concentrations to produce the reverse breakdown characteristics they use to control voltage.</p>
<p>We can keep adding these junctions and tweaking their doping to form more intricate and useful devices. A common purpose device with 2 pn junctions is a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). An SCR(silicon controlled rectifier) is a device which has 3 pn junctions. These are old devices compared to the technology we have today. I'm currently doing my undergrad in Ee so these are the devices I'm mostly familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can short-pay a company.  I worked for a firm that installed, tested and serviced security systems, fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, etc.  We regularly had some of our regular customers contest bills and simply not pay if they weren't satisfied with the service, install or testing... and because they were regular customers who otherwise had contracts for testing and installs... we let them short-change certain things at their discretion because it meant keeping them for other projects in the long term. </p>
<p>We could have taken them to small claims court and gotten our money... we could have reclaimed our installed items... we could have put a lien on their property... but in the long run we made more by letting some things slide, giving discounts, and keeping them happy - because we got to keep their other projects and contracts.</p>
<p>This was also terribly frustrating because the most ignorant, assholish, objectively douche-baggiest people in the tri-state area got five fingered discounts on tons of stuff while good customers paid their bills in full. </p>
<p>So you, as a consumer, could short change your service providers  so long as they don't have the balls to call you out on it and so long as they value your long-term patronage more-so than your short-term short-changing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course it works the other way around!  The only difference is that a business' ability to charge you late fees is governed by the terms of service you agree to, and your ability to charge them &quot;late fees&quot; is governed by contract law.  </p>
<p>I had UPS automatically charge me a brokerage fee of about $1500 on an item I self-cleared and picked up the depot.  </p>
<p>It took them 6 months to return the money to me.  After the first month of getting no where by calling and escalating, I served them with a notice of claim for the $1500 plus interest at 1.5% monthly after the first 30 days (industry standard).  </p>
<p>3 days before the small claims trial date I got a call from someone at UPS offering me the $1500.  I told them I want interest and my filing fee, or we go to court.  They put me on hold for about 5 minutes, and then came back asked me where I wanted the settlement agreement and cheque couriered to.  </p>
<p>Usually businesses can get away with not paying late fees on their mistakes because customers don't take a business like approach to keeping records.<br />
If a business kept their credit ledger on post-it notes by the phone, they wouldn't be collecting much interest on their overdue accounts either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Used to run a computer repair company. If this was a thing it would have killed us. Repair were often late because of unforeseen circumstances. Best possible intentions, skilled staff, great suppliers. Airtight workflow. Even with all that in place shit happens that you have no control over. That's why t&amp;c is a must. The way it works from a business perspective is, if you have to spend more time on a repair, you are losing money anyway. The reason is because your labour resource is tied up on costs that can't be recouped by the charges and that resource then is not available to work on something that would earn. It's just the cost of doing business, and is factored in. However, if you put additional 'fines' on this systemically, one of two things would have to happen. 1 the business would not be profitable any longer and have to close. Or, 2, the business would have to raise their charges on all services to cover the shortfall, and I'm talking by a lot. In the first instance, everyone loses, because no service. In the second instance, consumers lose because it costs them a fuck ton more money for the same thing UNLESS there is a problem. So if you see where this is going, in the problem scenario the customer might end up only having to pay what they would have paid anyway in the system where the fines didn't exist, while all the other customers are paying via additional fees for getting work done on time. Either way you look at it it's unsustainable because the money has to come from somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
