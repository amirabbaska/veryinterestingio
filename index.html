With how we currently probe high energy regimes, there is a fundamental limit to the energies we can obtain from collisions, related to accelerator designs (including size). But it is, pedantically, a technological limitation, because the science doesn't say &quot;the only way to test string theory is to use your current understanding of accelerator physics to build a very large accelerator,&quot; rather it says &quot;if you want to avoid building a very large accelerator, you need a breakthrough in how you probe very high energy regimes.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a &quot;technical&quot; limitation in the sense that there's no reason why we couldn't build one that big. </p>
<p>But, although this is an often-made claim, it's really a quite misleading one. It's based on the idea that there's a certain &quot;characteristic&quot; energy scale associated with string theory, and in order to <em>directly</em> test string theory, we need to create particles of this energy, which requires a ridiculously large particle accelerator. These claims are true, but they are not the whole story.</p>
<p>Think about it like this. Suppose you have a ruler. Let's say this ruler is only accurate to 1mm. That is, you can't use it to measure distances smaller than 1mm. Any measurement that falls between two different mm marks, you round to the closest mark. </p>
<p>With this ruler, you can never measure something smaller than 1mm. Even if you try to do something clever, like make a lot of measurements and average them together to get a really accurate measurement, it won't work, because you always rounded to the closest 1mm mark.</p>
<p>This means that, with this ruler, you can never <em>directly</em> measure distances smaller than 1mm. This does not mean, however, that you can not use the ruler to <em>indirectly</em> measure distances smaller than 1mm.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you have a microscope that magnifies an image by a factor of 1000. You could then pick something that's smaller than 1mm, magnify it by 1000 using the microscope, measure the magnified image, and then divide that length by 1000. This allows the ruler to indirectly measure distances much smaller than it can directly measure.</p>
<p>There are lots of other ways you can come up with to use this ruler to indirectly measure very small distances.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are lots of indirect predictions of string theory that do not require enormous particle accelerators. In fact, there are so many of these predictions, and they are so structured, that pretty much all string theorists at this point are convinced in its correctness. (Mostly, the problem is in getting the theory to make predictions of the specific quantities you'd like to study, which is hard because the theory is complicated.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, something I actually have a response for! Someone with 6 years of Jesuit schooling here, and I actually posed this exact question in a Theology class:
The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The concept of marriage in its most basic sense is that you are wedding this person to help them live a better life as their partner. However, since the purpose of heaven is to be infinitely close to God, any bonds or attachments to people you have on Earth are basically null. Your husband/wife would be someone you view fondly and had a close relationship with, but they would no longer be your wife/husband.</p>
<p>I don't really agree with all this, but I'm not going to insert personal opinion here. Hope this explanation helps!</p>
<p>Edit: removed the part saying &quot;The reason for this is explained as 'it would be a distraction from why you're there.'&quot;</p>
<p>/u/_Silly<em>Wizard</em> offered a better explanation, saying that instead of remembering people fondly, it's more akin to everyone is married in the sense that there is perfect unity with God.</p>
<p>Edit 2: figured it would be more credible if I actually included some sources. Here's a passage from the Catechism on the issue:</p>
<p>1618 Christ is the center of all Christian life. The bond with him takes precedence over all other bonds, familial or social.113 From the very beginning of the Church there have been men and women who have renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he goes, to be intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to please him, and to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is coming.114 Christ himself has invited certain persons to follow him in this way of life, of which he remains the model:</p>
<p>&quot;For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.&quot;115</p>
<p>Edit 3: To all the atheists arguing in the comment string below, keep in mind that just because someone is speaking on religious doctrine, it doesn't mean they're trying to 'biblethump' or 'spew nonsense'. Regardless of God's existence, you CANNOT dismiss that faith is historically integrated into culture, and the texts still provide profound lenses through which you can view the world. Stop acting like bloody conspiracy theorists and saying that everyone involved in the church is colluding to create some massive smokescreen. Religion has been around for tens of thousands of years--basically since humans started keeping a written language. And you think that you're some intellectual crusader who's saying &quot;Gods not real bro.&quot; for the first time? Congratulations! There's no God! Now good luck wishing away the millennia of texts, scriptures, parables, and doctrines that he created.</p>
<p>Real? That will always be debated.
Impactful and crucial to understanding western civilization? Abso-fuckin'-lutely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far, everyone has given a religious reason from a passage of Scripture about Jesus's comments on the afterlife (an answer to a trick question he was asked by some Sadducees, members of a Jewish sect that didn't believe in an afterlife).</p>
<p>But that's not the real reason for the wording of the marriage vows. It has to do with the fact that you are free to remarry if your spouse dies.</p>
<p>The exact wording of the vow varies according to the denomination, but here's one version used by the United Methodist Church (in the form of a question from the pastor to the couple):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you have this woman/man to be your wife/husband, to live together in holy marriage? Will you love her/him, comfort her/him, honor, and keep her/him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, be faithful to her/him as long as you both shall live?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from the context, it's all about living together with your spouse and being faithful to them; but obviously, that only applies if you're both still alive. If you die, your spouse can hardly &quot;comfort&quot; you, or &quot;keep&quot; you &quot;in sickness and in health&quot; -- how would that even work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, in the Bible there was a similar question posed to Jesus himself. Some of the religious leaders of the Jewish community at the time asked Jesus if a woman had 7 husbands that all died before she did, who would be her husband in heaven. Jesus' response (boiled down) was that we would be &quot;like the angels.&quot; Though there is debate as to what that actually means, the implication is that we would have no relationships like that in heaven and that we would only he interested in our worship of God.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised (unless I missed it) no one pointed out the purely pragmatic reason for &quot;'til death do us part&quot;: until recently, death at young age was common, so the vows needed to clarify that the surviving spouse can remarry, have kids with a new spouse, etc. So a more precise if inelegant vow would thus be &quot;'til the death of one of us parts us, at which point the survivor may remarry.&quot;</p>
<p>Point being, the clause isn't a theological one about &quot;when you die, you're no longer married&quot; but rather a pragmatic one about &quot;when one of you dies, the other may remarry.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we believe that marriages performed in the temple do transcend this life. This is made possible by the sealing keys. For example, when Jesus gave these keys to the apostles he said &quot;whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot; (Matt 18:18 KJV) </p>
<p>In lieu of the words &quot;Til death us do part&quot; we opt for the phrase &quot;For time and all eternity&quot; in Temple marriages. </p>
<p>That being said, many Christian religions do not believe in marriage after this life because of Matt 22:23-30. In these verses the Sadducees (who don't believe in the resurrection) are trying to bait Jesus by asking him a question about a woman who has been married 7 times, to 7 brothers . They ask which of the brothers shall be her husband in the afterlife, to which Jesus responds, &quot;Ye do err... for in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>He is not directly answering their question, but explains that they do not understand the question themselves (Matt 22:29-33). Still many people get caught up on the line about not being given in marriage during the resurrection. So it really comes down to this: did Jesus mean what he said literally and does it apply to all marriages? Or did he give an oversimplified answer to men who were not ready or willing to listen? This is still being debated by many Christian scholars. </p>
<p>Edit1: grammar </p>
<p>Edit2: Matt 16:19 is the verse where Jesus gives the keys specifically to the apostle John. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is said that since uranium's half-life is in the billions of years, it isn't that radioactive.</p>
<p>This sounds hard for me to believe, as I thought uranium was very dangerous to handle. Is it true that uranium isn't that radioactive? That gloves are worn to protect the uranium, and not the human?</p>
<p>Also, is uranium oxide - which is what the pellets in the video are - the same as uranium in terms of safety?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uranium in its natural state is not particularly radioactive. U-238 is the most common isotope in Uranium ore. U-235, the more radioactive isotope used in enriched and weapons-grade uranium only accounts for about 0.7% of natural uranium ore. But even U-235 isn't terribly dangerous from a radiation standpoint. The larger concern when handling these materials is their inherent toxicity. For this reason they are always handled with gloves and similar protection. One would have to spend a long period of time in close proximity to a very large quantity of uranium in order to receive a dose of radiation that was any more notable than the typical background radiation we receive in everyday life.</p>
<p>The perception of uranium as highly radioactive and dangerous comes from two sources. First, it is often thought of interchangeably with plutonium in this regard. Pure plutonium is significantly more radioactive and thus should be handled with much greater care, but even then, I believe the principle concern is toxicity, not radioactivity. Secondly, and more importantly, irradiated nuclear fuel is <em>very</em> radioactive, and quite dangerous to interact with. This is probably what you're thinking of. Enriched uranium that has spent time as fuel in a nuclear reactor has undergone fission, and been bombarded with particles, all creating numerous other materials within the fuel that make it very radioactive. Spent fuel like this is what we refer to when we talk of &quot;nuclear waste&quot; and it <em>is</em> quite dangerous. This is the material that conjures up <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OY2y6NH0oKY/V5rQ1esJJ0I/AAAAAAAABDI/eW2kvO1r5gw238lfPQ_TQGvN1bl8BQbSwCLcB/s1600/homerrod.png" target="_blank">images of technicians</a> in bulky radiation suits, daintily holding on to glowing metal rods with a pair of tongs to avoid contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Don't fill your house with it. But it's not very radioactive. Handle it like you'd handle lead — wash your hands after touching it, don't vaporize it and breath it in, etc. Uranium oxide is just a convenient way to keep purified uranium — it is a chemical compound of uranium and oxygen.</p>
<p>Uranium ore, which is what you get out of the ground, is a mix of a lot of things including uranium daughter products that have been being produced for millions of years. Some of those are very toxic and radioactive indeed (e.g. radon and its daughter products, which include polonium). So uranium processing facilities (e.g., mills, which turn the ore into oxide), mines, and so forth need to have really careful ventilation and handling if you don't want people to be increasing their long-term chances for cancer. You don't want to build your home over uranium ores (or mine tailings) without checking for radon gas accumulation. Some of these effects are complicated and synergistic  — your chance of getting lung cancer from radon is pretty low by itself, but goes up dramatically if you smoke around the radon, for example (because you are dragging the particles deep into your lungs). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Alpha particles are very large so they can't really penetrate your outer layers of dead skin to damage living tissue. Just wash your hands afterward. It is a heavy metal, like lead, afterall.</p>
<p>As for the long half live = less radioactive part you should think of it like this. You have two materials. One with a half life of 2 seconds and one with a half life of 2 billions years. The short half life material would undergo the same amount of decay in 2 seconds as the long half life material would over 2 billion years.</p>
<p>Both materials will release the same amount of radioactive particles over their lifetime, but the short half life material will do so at a much MUCH shorter period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

We have unstable carbon-14 in the molecules of our body that can decay too! So the uranium in uranium oxide will decay at the rate of whatever isotope of uranium it is.</p>
<p>Uranium is pretty safe to handle yes. Enriched uranium is dangerous, because we've purified/concentrated/bred a certain isotope of uranium which is signifigantly more unstable. When uranium is used in a reactor or bomb, it's brought to critical mass-- where enough is packed into a space that the neutrons of their decays can hit other nuclei enough it causes a chain reaction that consumes a lot of the uranium nuclei. As you can imagine, this releases a LOT of radiation.</p>
<p>Edit: also the products of this fission, as others have mentioned, are generally unstable and both highly radioactive and toxic.</p>
<p>Bur uranium ore? There's not enough radiation released in a small time frame for it to be dangerous, except for maybe a LOT of it nearby over a long period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who work with uranium wear dosimiters and do daily radiation screening at work, to make sure they're not adversely exposed.</p>
<p>Decay rate, and hence the radioactivity produced, is inversely proportional to the isotope's half-life. The larger the half life, the smaller the instantaneous decay rate.</p>
<p>The only way there would be zero decay would be if the half life were infinitely long (i.e. a stable isotope.)</p>
<p>So despite it's long half life, uranium is still quite measureably radioactive. For example, Wilhelm Roentgen's famous discovery that uranium ore could expose a photographic plate even if the plate was wrapped in thick paper.</p>
<p>It's generally safe to handle because uranium's mode of decay is alpha particles. These have low penetrating power and are stopped by the outer layer of skin.  Furthermore, uranium dioxide is a rather inert ceramic compound</p>
<p>However alpha-emitting isotopes can still be very harmful if they're ingested, inhaled, or enter the bloodstream by some means. </p>
<p>That being said, the main way that water soluble uranium compounds are harmful is by believed to be ordinary heavy metal toxicity, due to the low decay rate. They cause damage to the liver and kidneys, or lungs if very fine uranium containing dust is inhaled. Inhaled uranium dust can cause lung cancer, on chronic exposure. This is a concern for people mining uranium.</p>
<p>Furthermore, uranium compounds don't easily cross the intestinal barrier into the bloodstream, so the danger from ingestion is low.</p>
<p>People handling uranium compounds typically wear dosimeters </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another explanation I have seen, not listed here, is that often shows are built around a single comedian---usually a guy.  Since, as <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/chris-pratt-only-got-well-written-roles-after-gaining-weight-a7467006.html" target="_blank">Chris Pratt noted</a>, male comedians tend to be more successful when they don't look too good, that means you get a lot of shows built around a relatively shlubby guy.  </p>
<p>But, that schlubby guy doesn't necessarily want to be paired with a schlubby lady---and the network certainly wants to add in sex appeal, appeal to female audiences, indications that the main character is in at least some ways enviable, etc...---they often end up paired with a more attractive woman. </p>
<p>I've always favored this explanation, since it accounts for why this is so common in the classic sitcom set-up, or the one's that follow it relatively closely (like the George and Jerry parts of Seinfeld), but is much, much less common in ensemble shows.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humor is built on inversion of expectations. It's been this way for thousands of years; Roman comedies had the clever slave and the hapless master. Did that mean the Romans think slaves were smarter than their masters? Of course not! It was funny because it was opposite of what the audience believed was true.</p>
<p>So the stupid husband and patient wife is an inversion of the expectation that the husband is the smart, hard-working one. Remember, even into the 80s, people still believed that women couldn't make it in the workplace.</p>
<p>There's obviously more to comedy than just a formula, but this is where the formula came from.</p>
<p>At this point, it's definitely a cliche, and the expectation has been bucked by society to the point where we're seeing competent husbands and dumb wives, too. Bob's Burgers is a prime example with Linda Belcher being the dumb one, and Bob being the competent one, but they both definitely have their redeeming features and flaws. It's not like Peter and Lois Griffin, where Peter's an incompetent boob. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This formula, as someone else noted, started over 60 years ago by Jackie Gleason himself. The fat stupid husband character is created by a fat comedian who is on some wish fulfillment journey of having a hot wife that puts up with his shit.
Going even further back this probably pull from the tradition of august and white-face clowns. Think David Space (white face) and Chris Farley (august). Every comedy duo has a straight-man and a goof. (Sometimes you get the edgy/depressing/weird character in there which could translate to tramp clowns.) Since the male comedians want the goofy spotlight and a hot leading lady we get this.<br />

<p>If I shoot one photon to an atom and the photon is absorbed, then, technically speaking, a shadow is cast. Even if the photon is deflected, a shadow is cast. However, a shadow is defined together with the light surrounding it. Our eyes need a few photons to reach our retina in order to see. It's a small number, we can see less than 10 photons already, I believe, but we can't see the shadow cast by one missing photon. And I don't think of any process that can cause a single atom to absorb a large number of photons all at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There is absence of light behind an atom, and a photon can't travel through an atom to our knowledge, so an atom is always casting a shadow parallel and anti-polar to the photon side of an atom, or photon is present. Otherwise it's just said to be in the dark.</p>

<p>One of the ways that the structure of a molecule is determine is called x-ray crystallography. In order to look at things on an atomic scale you have to use a wave length short enough so the light wave doesn't just loop right around the atom. If you use very short wave radiation ( x-rays ) the light reflects (technically refracts) off of the  atoms in a molecule leaving a disticnt refraction pattern which can then be used to determine where the atoms are in the crystal. </p>
<p>To me this is the cloest you can get to an &quot;atomic shadow&quot; per se. Now you cant measure a sigle atom using this method but i assume the same properties apply and if you shined x-rays on a single atom it would cast a &quot;pseudo-shadow&quot;. But what do i know maybe thats not accurate at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit 735: I tried writing a better ELI5 than the one I originally wrote. Added it below the original.</p>
<p>This is a favorite field of mine and also a difficult question to answer. I'll do my best, but I think I'll still leave you wanting.</p>
<p>Even though we have nerves that we know that are related to pain (called C fibers), the processing of the feeling we call pain is much more complex than that.</p>
<p>The brain and the spinal cord (the central nervous system) do all the processing of pain.</p>
<p>So what can cause a random pain for a few seconds? Here are two examples, there are many more.</p>
<p>A. A peripheral nerve (i.e, the one in the bottom of your foot) shooting while unprovoked or because of long term irritation.</p>
<p>B. A sensory nerve (unrelated to pain fibers) shoots an electrical current towards the brain. Because of wrong processing in the brain, the sensory input is perceived as pain.</p>
<p>So these are examples to the &quot;how&quot;. I feel that I cannot answer &quot;why&quot; with confidence.
There is a lot of research, and pain is something we are still trying to understand.</p>
<p>The guy in the next video is a leading researcher when it comes to pain, and he does a great job explaining it in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwd-wLdIHjs" target="_blank">TED talk</a>.</p>
<p>Hoped I helped a little bit, and sorry I couldn't give a more detail answer but my time is really short.</p>
<p><strong>Better ELI5 I think:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine there are roads all around the body, going from all of your body parts (hands, feet, nose, liver, and so on) to your head.</p>
<p>On those roads there are trucks, coming from the small towns to the main station (the head) to unload their boxes with some electronics and food for the grocery stores.</p>
<p>Now, in the delivery room in the main station there is a delivery guy, and he is busy as hell. He is trying to keep up with all that's going on, but he makes mistakes sometimes.</p>
<p>So sometimes, some boxes arrive not where they should be. So now, the local hotdog stand accidentally gets some new TVs, puts them on the grill and stinks the whole town.</p>
<p>Edit: formatting</p>
<p>Edit2: Trying to make things a bit clearer.</p>
<p>Edit3: It seems it's much more interesting to answer questions on reddit than do whatever I was supposed to be doing. Thank you for the challenging questions, and I'll do my best to answer what I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Until one day I caught influenza and complicated into pneumonia. Needed antibiotics, cortisone, etc... It weakened my immune system. The pain in my ribs got sharper and sharper until after a few days I looked at  my skin and realised I developed shingles on that one side of my ribs.

<p>It could be due to a phenomenon called &quot;referred pain&quot;. It occurs when sensory information comes to the spinal cord as coming from one location, but is interpreted by the brain as coming from another location.</p>
</li>
<li>This is applicable to only sharp fleeting chest pains and it is called Precordial Catch. It is a non-serious condition affecting the left side of the anterior wall of the chest. It is characterized by sharp chest pains, and usually affects children and adolescents, although it can occur, though less frequently, in adults. PCS manifests as a very intense, sharp pain, typically at the left side of the chest, generally in the cartilage between the bones of the sternum and rib cage, which is worse when taking breaths, or doing physical activity.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, It's because grapefruit contains compounds called furanocoumarins that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes; (mainly CYP3A4) which are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs (statins, anti platelets, antihistamines etc). Generally this causes them to hang around longer in higher concentrations, thus increasing the risk of adverse effects occurring. For example with a statin it'll increase the risk of liver side effects, myalgia and myositis. Other citrus fruits (limes, Seville oranges) can also cause this grapefruit reaction, and there are other foods that also contain furanocoumarins. It's a minefield! </p>
<p>EDIT: goodness me, this simple explanation really blew up. Bear in mind it is just that; an explanation kept deliberately easy to follow. If you're interested I'd suggest a good pharmacology textbook that can give you a footing in basic principles. I should also point out that CYP enzymes are pretty much contained in most tissues in the body, and whilst I was talking about liver inhibition of CYP3A4 it is located elsewhere. This is why it's not a simple linear explanation of inhibition will cause raised levels, or increased half lives.  I've also tried to reply to comments individually but I've been at work all day and am only getting a chance now. Also thank you to other awesome redditors who have contributed to further fleshing out my barebones answer, and correcting errors in other answers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So do not eat grapefruits or consume grapefruit products if you are on the pill.

<p>Also, most commonly prescribed antibiotics inhibit the effectiveness of the pill as well so use a second method of birth control while taking antibiotics! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So my oldass account is shadow banned then...? :( So I wrote all these responses for no reason? :(</p>
<p>The liver contains enzymes known as CYP P450. These enzymes change substances to another metabolite, which can then be extrected, either through the feces or the urine. Happens to almost any drug you take, happens to alcohol, etc etc.</p>
<p>Some drugs (prodrugs) are activated when the liver enzymes change them into another metabolite. Codeine for example is an inactive drug, which is then metabolized into morphine.</p>
<p>Other drugs become inactive when metabolized. Propranolol, a beta blocker, is an example of this.
There are many different CYP enzymes that metabolize different drugs. For example, CYP3A4 metabolizes a loooot of drugs, including the mentioned Propranolol.</p>
<p>Some of the contents of grapefruit (mostly furanocoumarin) inhibit the CYP P450 enzyme CYP3A4, making it less active.</p>
<p>So returning to the previous example, if you eat grapefruit and use propranolol, the most common beta blocker, you will not metabloze propranolol as fast, and thus you will have more of the active metabolize in the body, leading to higher effect of propranolol.</p>
<p>A more serious drug would be <del>tramadol</del> Simvastatin, which is metabolized to inactive drug by CYP3A4 - meaning you would have more active Simvastatin than intended if you ate grapefruit.</p>
<p>List of drugs that interact with CYP3A4: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4#CYP3A4_ligands" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4#CYP3A4_ligands</a></p>
<p>Correction: Tramadol is also metabolized by other CYP enzymes, and thus does not pose as serious a risk. A better example is the cholesterol reducing drug, Simvastatin. </p>
<p><strong>Edit: A lot of people are asking about specific drugs. I cannot give medical advice here, you'll have to ask your doctor if you are worried. Things to remember though: There are many CYP enzymes, some drugs are metabolized by several of them. Not all drugs are potentiated equally.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many drugs are broken down with the help of a an enzyme called CYP3A4 in the small intestine. Some substances in grapefruit juice can block the action of CYP3A4, so instead of being metabolized, more of the drug enters the bloodstream and stays in the body longer. This can result in dangerous levels of the drug in your body. Certain drugs have the opposite effect and are reduced in potency. Grapefruit is not the only fruit that can cause this reaction. Pomelos and Seville oranges can also cause this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currently studying some advanced economics, we call what other responders call &quot;social democracy&quot; a <em>&quot;mixed economy&quot;</em> and it's comparable to a Socialism Lite™. Unlike an economy such as the US where healthcare and prisons generate profit, an economic system like Canada's and some European countries is helpful, where healthcare is still paid for by the government but doesn't exactly need to make profit, because healthcare is for sick people to get better, not for money. While Socialism, and in turn Communism would compare more to what's called a &quot;planned economy&quot; with following countries like Cuba, and Venezuela, with strict food rations, giving all people basic needs without even thinking about profit.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Social democracy is Socialism Lite™, think Canada and Nordic Countries vs. Venezuela and Cuba</p>

This means the &quot;means of production&quot; can stay privately owned but the government intervenes where necessary to ensure fair competition, protection of workers rights, economic protection and support for the poor, things like that. There are varying flavors of it, some more socialist than others but key difference is that socialism is an economic system whereas social democracies are governments that enact some mixture of socialist and capitalist policies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL/DR; Capitalism + Socialism = Social Democracy. The difference between Socialism and Social Democracy is that Social Democracy has some features of capitalism (such as private ownership of factories).</p>
<hr />
<p>In Capitalism, when you go to work in a factory and make cars you do not own the cars that you are building. You are adding value to raw metals by shaping and assembling them, the car would not exist without your skill/time/labor, but you have no ownership of your work. You have no rights to the product of the factory because you are 'selling' your ownership of the product for 'wages.' The factory owner does no labor, but they own all the cars that you build and so they keep all the profits from sales and negotiate with you, separately, what your 'wages' should be.</p>
<p>In theory, the owners of factories will grow exceptionally rich and will be able to use that wealth to benefit society.</p>
<p>In Socialism, a person cannot own a factory because a factory requires many people in order to function. There may be managers who give directions, but there is no capitalist who simply reaps benefits from other people's work. In socialism, if you work in a factory then you own the thing you make. If many people help make a car, they share ownership of the car. When the car is sold, all workers share the profit equally with no money being siphoned off by landlords or factory owners. The money is also shared with society because society helps build that car (teachers, ditch diggers, and surfers are part of the economy that supports your industry).</p>
<p>In theory, socialism redistributes the wealth so that there is no economic inequality in society.</p>
<p>Socialism and Capitalism are <em>nearly opposite</em> economy policies. A social democracy is a <em>hybrid of capitalism and socialism,</em> with a few features of each of the extremes.</p>
<p>Social Democracy is capitalism. However, SD disagrees with Capitalism because it aims to prevent money from (overly) concentrating in the hands of elites. SD forces a (small) redistribution of wealth in order to keep the economy stable, such as universal health care or social security. SD says that governments should step in to make sure that privately owned businesses are not harming society or workers - so regulations, taxes, and bail-outs are acceptable government tools (BONUS: this is one reason the GOP hated Obama).</p>
<p>Social Democracy is socialism. However, SD disagrees with Socialism because it acknowledges private ownership of production and a limited role of government regulation. SD allows for inequality to exist within the economy, and only steps in when the inequality is dysfunctional or extreme. SD also fails to recognize the contributions of all of society so when income is redistributed it is not distributed equally to everyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since at least the early 90s, companies have been using &quot;slumping sales&quot; as a reason to lay off employees in the USA (especially), but also other countries.  Of course, the actual reason for this is automation, but saying you are laying off thousands of Americans to save money doesn't help your brand, so the press release blames slumping sales.</p>
<p>Recently, Coca Cola said they were laying off employees because people were drinking less sugary drinks, despite Coca Cola actually having increasing sales, because &quot;sugary drinks&quot; doesn't include their other markets like energy drinks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36376966" target="_blank">Foxconn Replaces 60,000 employees with Robots</a>  Foxconn is the manufacturer of Apple iPhones and many other electronics you or a family member own.</p>

<p>This is also a reason that things like Universal Basic Income or shortening the work week are brought up.   When a very small percentage of the population is needed to manufacture the entire world's demand of goods, you can really only fix the problem a few ways:</p>
<p>1) Accept the problem, eliminating the middle class, and having the vast majority of the population live in poverty.  Of course this means less people buying things and is a long-term terrible result for even the wealthy.</p>
<p>2) Decrease labor hours for everyone.  If the work week was decreased to 4 days, with over-time for salary employees, many jobs would be created.  </p>
<p>3) Universal Basic Income or other &quot;wealth redistribution&quot; plans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
