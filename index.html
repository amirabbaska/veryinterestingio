		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the existence of a magnetic monopole would imply the necessity of electric charge quantization -- the phenomenon that all electric charges are integer multiples of some fundamental charge, a property which is observed but for which we do not have a confirmed explanation.</p>
<p>Secondly, many unified theories imply the existence of monopoles.  So if you found a monopole, you could ask, if this is a unified theory monopole, what would it tell you about the unified theory?  The mass of the monopole would allow us to determine the energy scale at which unification occurs.  Also, in unified theories, the monopoles have a radius determined by the unification scale.</p>
<p>One last thing: The density of monopoles in the universe is related to the expansion rate of the universe and when that expansion occurred.  Inflation -- a period of rapid expansion -- appears to be needed in the context of grand unification, because otherwise there'd be a much higher density of monopoles and we should have seen some already.</p>
<p>BTW, you might be interested to read about Cabrera's experiment that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Searches_for_magnetic_monopoles" target="_blank">appeared to detect a magnetic monopole</a> in 1982, although since that signal never occurred again, it seems doubtful that one event was real.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that the connection between the existence of magnetic monopoles and quantization of electric charge was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Dirac.27s_quantization" target="_blank">realized by Dirac</a> in 1931. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Old English was written, it used a mixture of Latin letters and older runes. One of these runes was Wynn, which was used to represent the wound that w gives today:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn</a></p>
<p>That runes was sometimes replaced by the combination uu - a double u - for the same sound.</p>
<p>In german, the letter v changed in sound to be pronounced as f in most cases (it still is). In a few cases the v-sound was retained. To distinguish these cases, scribes began to write vv for these.</p>
<p>When printing was developed in what is today Germany (and to some extent Italy, but that is less relevant here), the printing press manufacturers made types for the letters that they had. Since the combination vv was very common, they made a letter for it - w. In most languages letter is called &quot;double-v&quot;.</p>
<p>These printing presses and the letters for them were exported everywhere, including to England. The English quickly realized that they didn't have types for all their letters, so they made do with what they had. Since English didn't have the w before printing, they simply reused that letter for the Wynn rune, which was missing. It is called &quot;double-u&quot; because it was also sometimes written as &quot;uu&quot;</p>
<p>Similar story for the letter Thorn, which was also missing when printing and became the &quot;th&quot; combination.</p>

To get around this, they doubled the U symbol to represent it. The following century, the &quot;uu&quot; digraph was replaced with the Ƿ (wynn) rune. This died out after a while and in the 11th century, the Norman (French) scribes reintroduced the &quot;uu&quot; digraph as a single, though jointed instead of curved, character, the &quot;w.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At one point, U and V were not regarded as different letters (and in fact, F, U, V, and Y are all ultimately derived from the same Phoenician letter). You may be familiar with this to some degree if you've ever seen a picture of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Arch.of.Titus-Inscription.jpg" target="_blank">a Roman inscription like this one</a>, whose first two lines read <em>senatus populusque romanus</em>. A holdover of this usage appears in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgari" target="_blank">branding of some Italian luxury products</a>. UU and VV, the ancestors of modern W, were similarly interchangeable. In Middle English (during the Middle Ages), the pointed V was used at the beginning of a word, while the round U was used elsewhere.</p>
<p>As time went on, English and other languages began assigning more discrete, well-defined roles to what started off as two visual representations of the same letter. By and large, V has become a consonant and U has become a vowel, but W is a bit of an odd case. The [w] sound it makes in English is a kind of consonant often referred to as a &quot;semivowel&quot;. In German, it is strictly a consonant (representing [v]). In Welsh, W is a vowel. It is also <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/w#Welsh" target="_blank">a word</a> in Welsh, and you can even put an accent mark over it, like in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C5%B5r" target="_blank">the Welsh word for 'water'</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you call it &quot;double-U&quot; or &quot;double-V&quot; varies from language to language. In upright type, it tends to have a pointed appearance, but in italics (as in cursive handwriting), many typefaces give it a more rounded look, a relic of when it was written <em>uu</em> in a calligraphic hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here, from UK. Excellent question! And one that I didn't know the answer to until actually went through it! I previously worked in a hospital in London when there was a large fire within the building, in the basement.</p>
<p>Although there was no fire actually within the operating theatres, it affected the ventilation system and smoke was entering the ORs.  The Clinical lead (head doctor of the hospital) informed all theatres that all operating to cease ASAP. </p>
<p>What ended up happening was: Those that were almost finished hurried up, those that had just started stopped, those that were literally half-way through just covered up as best they could (made it as a safe as possible, cover the wound etc) and the still-anaesthetised patient was wheeled to a &quot;pop-up&quot; ITU somewhere safe &amp; away from the smoke. </p>
<p>As it happened the fire was quickly brought under control, ventilation system was disabled and the few (1 or 2) patients that needed it went back to theatre the next day I think. </p>
<p>Although less than ideal patients can be kept anaesthetised for quite a while and could even be transferred to other hospitals if required (which is what I'd imagine you'd have to do if someone was actually on CPB (cardio-pulmonary bypass). Would be a massive pain in the arse logistically, but when there's a need these things get sorted. </p>
<p>There wasn't any cardiac at this hospital so that particular scenario wasn't encountered... </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many hospitals have their fire alarms set up in zones. So each wing/floor/area is its own zone. When the fire alarm is activated in a zone, either from a pull station or a detector, the audible alarm will only sound in the affected zone. It will also close all the fire doors in the area, which are held open by magnets. The fire department receives the activation and responds while hospital security will go to investigate if there is a fire. Hospital staff or the fire department can expand the activated areas as needed, and usually the rest hospital will be notified of a fire alarm somewhere in the hospital by an announcement for a &quot;Code Red.&quot; along with the area of the hospital that is affected. Because of this set up, its unlikely the surgical procedure would be impacted at all. Even if the activation was in the same zone, they would most likely continue as long as no flames or smoke were seen.</p>
<p>This may not be the set up in all hospitals, but has been in the ones I have worked with.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone in the hospital is taught race and pass before you even get to your station. Hospitals are built to compartmentalized fires so race:</p>
<p>R = Recuse &amp; remove anyone from immediate danger
A = activate alarm
C = Contain - close the doors, most systems do this for you these days
E = extinguish small fires or evacuate if in harms way</p>
<p>P = Pull
A = Aim
S = Squeeze
S = Sweep</p>
<p>You do not evacuate a hospital because a fire alarm is triggered. It is common to be triggered because of the lab and other departments. Like a high rise in a major city, unless immediate damaged presents itself you wait for instruction before evacuating. The only difference between a hospital and any other building is the design to compartmentalized the fire and not allow it to spread. Other buildings besides hospitals are erected this way but not your standard house or high rise due to cost.</p>
<p>You could ask what happens during surgery and a power outage. The simple answer is very expensive generators with flkywheels. You won't even see a blip in the lights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm on placement, hospitals are designed with this in mind using a concept called compartmentalisation. Each ward/section/area is a different 'compartment' separated by fire resistant walls and separated by fire doors with an estimated time of 60 minutes (i.e. They are theoretically able to withstand a direct flame for a total of 60 minutes). This both buys time for moving patients and limits damage caused in the event of a fire. </p>
<p>Therefore, throughout the hospital there are two fire alarm types:</p>
<p>1) Continuous: the compartment you are currently in contains a fire. In this event, if it is not a false alarm, measures may need to be taken in order to stabilise and move the patient into another compartment, in order to continue the surgery there. </p>
<p>2) Intermittent: a compartment adjacent to the one you are currently in contains the fire. I imagine in this case, the surgeons would attempt to continue with the operation in the assumption that they are not under any immediate threat, as in theory even in the event of a serious fire, their compartment will not be at risk for another 60 minutes, in which time emergency services will notify them of the very real danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger particles are absorbed by mucus and swept up the respiratory tract by what's called the ciliary elevator, a system of tiny hair-like projections of endothelial cells that beat upwards in unison to move things up and out of the lungs for exactly that purpose, where you will eventually cough it all out as phlegm.</p>
<p>Smaller particles are ingested by macrophages within the lungs and bronchi. The majority of this is essentially carbon soot, which our cells cannot metabolize, so it just builds up in the lungs as black <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/assets/gallery-images/_galleryThumbnail2x/pathology_anthracosis20x04.jpg" target="_blank">anthracotic pigment</a>. It looks gross and harmful under a microscope but it really doesn't do anything, it just sits there and gradually accumulates as you get older with no ill effects.</p>
<p>Other inhaled substances can have immediate cytotoxic effects on lung tissue, other local effects such as bronchodilation/constriction (asthma inhalers), or be absorbed into the blood for systemic effects (smoking, anesthetics), but it really depends on the substance. The majority of inhaled particles are handled as above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pollutants can mean many things but I'm going to assume you mean the pollution that accumulates around cities and populated areas (usually from traffic/factories etc).</p>
<p>Some gases do direct damage to your lungs and that is managed by the same inflammation and healing process that happens anywhere else in the body where there is injury. Other gases can be absorbed directly into blood plasma or hijack the haemoglobin and bond with that on your red blood cells. The gas will either pass out through your lungs or your kidneys will process it and you will excrete it through your urine.</p>
<p>Dust particles will normally get trapped in the cilia that lines from your nostrils to your lungs. The inside of your nose is somewhat convoluted to make the air more turbulent. This give dust particles more opportunity to get stuck to the mucous on the walls of your airways. The cilia will uniformly beat to move particles to the back of the throats where they are usually swallowed. Depending on amount of particles or other pathologies, sometimes your body will need to cough to move the mucous to the right place where it can be swallowed or spit out.</p>
<p>Sneezing is another way your body has of expelling foreign material. This is normally due to something stimulating mechanoreceptors in your nasal cavity causing a sneezing reflex. Interestingly, you do have some conscious control over the repression of sneezes due to the circuitry involved in sneezing.</p>
<p>Hope this answers your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had 4 sinus ops and it seems that my mucus membrane no longer works at all. I get the most horriffic headaches from strange things. Tamiya acrylic paint takes about 10 seconds, soldering 15 seconds, sawdust totally kills me and I can't deal with traffic because the exhaust fumes go straight up my nose. It always feels like there is a rope tied aroung my eyeballs pulling them together. I wash my sinusses with saline 2 or 3 times a day and it does help. I often wake up in the midddle of the night with a blinding headache and it seems that it is because my sinus cavities dry out. A desk fan or fan running while I sleep also gives me a headache very quickly. I really don't understand why air moving around me gives me such a headache. I've seriously considered getting a mask and an oxygen tank to be able to do the things I love (building scale models, electronics etc) Do you have any advice or thoughts on what I could do to make life easier. I am not trying to hijack the post, I just noticed that there is someone here that may offer some insight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been waiting for this moment my whole life.  Sleep Expert here.</p>
<p>The reason one does not feel pain while they sleep is because when you sleep, “most neurons in the brain stem immediately above the spinal cord, reduce or stop firing.” The brain stem is composed of the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain. The brain stem is in a way, a highway where the motor and sensory system passes through to the brain. Therefore, while awake, the nociceptors, which is a type of sensory neuron which is active when there is tissue damage, and is what causes the pain sensation, is traveling from the point of damage through the brain stem to the brain. So, while asleep, there is no brain stem connection to the brain from the sensory neurons, ergo no pain perception. You can think of it as connecting Christmas lights. When you connect one series of lights to a second series of lights, it will allow electricity to flow through both sets. If you disconnect the second series of lights, then the flow of electricity will only flow though the first series of lights. As opposed to 1998 when the undertaker slammed mankind through the hell in the cell on a 16 foot drop.

It was initially thought to be caused by the neurotransmitter glycine, but is now thought to be two types of GABA (also neurotransmitters). Basically, they effect the muscles, preventing movement during sleep. This is probably a large part of the answer you are seeking.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why should we?</p>
<p>Sleep is important, maintaining that bit of extra awareness of our comfort is taxing.  Consider obstructive sleep apnaea.  This is essentially your body occasionally just waking up just enough to move slightly and correct your neck's position so you can breathe clearly.  </p>
<p>But it's a serious sleep disorder that can cause all sorts of performances issues during the day.  And it's all caused by being minorly woken up due to a condition that would otherwise cause you to suffocate. </p>
<p>Now, with being unable to breathe, yes, we do wake up, readjust and don't die in our sleep.  But it has a huge toll, and a pretty obvious trigger.  Are we becoming hypoxic? Ok, then trigger something to rouse us a bit and gasp for breath.</p>
<p>If our body were to do that every time we got uncomfortable, first of all, it's much harder to define discomfort, especially stiffness that isn't obvious until you actually get out of bed.  Secondly, it would ruin our sleep quality almost every night. </p>
<p>So we fall asleep in a position that is comfortable when we fall asleep, and unless we have some other sleep issue, we don't move around too much when we sleep.  We wake up with minor aches maybe if we were in a weird position, but we walk it off.  </p>
<p>The alternative is to wake up constantly in the night and never sleep properly.  As someone who suffers from sleep quality issues, I would always take a better night's sleep over a few aches in the morning every time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your brain is in sleep mode and is not thinking through &quot;what is the most comfortable position I can sleep in that won't cause me pain when I wake up.&quot; Your body is just finding a position that feels good right now, and does it for you to deal with the consequences later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar engineer here. Let me explain some of this that's been covered by some people already.</p>
<p><strong>Why Not Solar In Deserts?</strong>
If we are talking a new array away from people, someone has to lay out all of the infrastructure for it to deliver power to the grid. At the same time, someone also needs to figure out how to shut it down when the largest source of power on that power grid fails because pumping electricity into a powered down grid can have disastrous results. This is typically solved in home solar with a fast disconnect, in which if power to the home stops the array ceases function to help the main power company in the area get things going again.</p>
<p>Next is maintenance on the panels. The thing about large constructions in remote areas or even out of the way spaces is that most companies that put something out there intend not to have to come back to it unless they absolutely have to. The issue with this and solar is panels may die, panels need cleaning, sun tracking mountings are expensive as fuck, and you'd have to pay for all the equipment and people to facilitate taking care of all this. The same fast disconnect isn't a great solution at this kind of scale either. Large power systems like this require a lot of extra engineering and planning and sometimes implementing solutions that don't even exist or cannot just be found off the shelf. (Gonna also drop that you'd have to landscape the desert unless you find a really nice flat spot and even then, you may want to have a leveler come through anyways.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a lot that needs to be managed that just aren't realistic to manage. At the same time, anyone who puts an array out somewhere needs a way to make money off it. They probably aren't going to be able to get the power company to pay for large sums of solar power without it being discounted a lot. After all, if I was a power company I don't need to buy power from someone else. The city may not because they are already getting power from the already existing grid owner. Leaving you only able to sell to new developments and offer power along side the power company to homeowners, at which point, why aren't you just an extension of the power company? And the power company does not have an industry interest in solar because fossil fuel is a bigger money industry. (This statement is wrong, check out /u/Halfway_Bayesian <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5woe50/eli5_why_cant_we_just_cover_a_proportion_of_the/decu3tf/" target="_blank">post</a>.) At the same time, your power needs to be as always available as a regular power company for emergencies and panels do not produce much at night.</p>
<p><strong>Future of Solar then?</strong>
I honestly think that the future of solar right now is in residential. Most homes can hold enough panels on their roof to offset all of their electrical costs and for a pretty fair price (about the cost of a car, between $10,000 to $40,000. Consider pricing is on average, $3.50 per watt on a panel.) I've seen in just the last two or three years alone panels going from 225w panels to 290w along side batteries and even solar shingles. The technology is improving fast and we will see a lot more of it in the next few years. However keep in mind too, not every place in the world is geographically suitable for solar power. Locations too far North and too far South won't get great benefits from solar power. Neither would a place that you could essentially call a forest. Solar I don't believe sells well in Canada or states and countries along the same latitude as Washington or Oregon state. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5woe50/eli5_why_cant_we_just_cover_a_proportion_of_the/dect48o/" target="_blank">Check out Huppie's post here.</a> where they discuss solar at these more northern latitudes, I learned something new.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, if you live in Utah with a good South facing roof, 8 modules of 290w are enough to offset 3,000-4,000 kWh of usage at your home. For a lot of small homes, this can be all you use for a year. A lot of solar companies offer their own maintenance services or even equipping an array with other necessities like &quot;critter cages&quot; to keep birds and squirrels out from under your panels. Otherwise, you may have a ton of fried birds under your panels. They get hot.</p>
<p><strong>Problems that Face Solar</strong>
The biggest issue with the solar industry for individuals is electrical companies because they are virtually untouchable. The reason is that they technically own the power grid and if the entire city depends on it, there is nothing that can really be done. A lot of power companies lobby to keep solar out as well. If you do some research, Nevada was a booming industry. Then Warren Buffet's Pacificorp, changed how solar customers pay their bill for having solar. Essentially, they put up a premium that brings your power bill to, still less than before, but not as much savings. On top of that, you're now also buying power from a solar company or paying for panels under a loan or lease. Pacificorp, claims that they lose millions of dollars per year on administrative fees and are recouping that cost from solar customers with this premium. Some electrical companies won't even allow residents they service to have a solar panel system.</p>
<p>There needs to be more policies for solar friendly developments and incentives for the industry. There are some, but there are also powers in the world that are cornering the market on power and do not want solar coming around because so far, solar companies are already undercutting profits from the grid owning electric company. I think there needs to be a lot more cooperation between power companies and solar companies rather than the electrical companies governing and restricting how power is being provided to consumers in an area.</p>
<p>Tldr: <strong>Solar panels require a lot of maintenance, the idea itself has a lot of business and municipal policy issues, and these same issues extend to the entire solar industry. Its much more feasible for residential solar to be happening for society as these same problems tend to be cheaper when costs can be levied on a private customer.</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So electricity. It needs to be moved and can only be used as generated without significant infrastructure. So lets just look at moving Electricity from Arizona to say Maine.</p>
<p>Line losses. Electricity needs to be at high voltages to move it. that is why AC won out over DC. Not because Tesla rocked and Edison was a jackwad, but because DC has a limited transmission range. Literally in the couple miles range. </p>
<p>So we need AC. Solar generally makes DC. So the DC needs to be put into a converter that makes the DC into AC. Because we live in reality and not theory or make-believe there will be losses in converting the DC to AC. </p>
<p>Also a line 100 miles (160 kilometres) at 765 kV carrying 1000 MW of power can have losses of 1.1% to 0.5%. A 345 kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%. So if we ran 765KV line from Arizona to Maine is like 2800 miles long. That is a considerable amount of losses. That comes out to about a 25% or better loss in the transmission of that power. </p>
<p>So to combine the losses in the generation and swap to AC and the line losses you end up losing a huge amount. Additionally at the beginning and the end you have to step up and then step down the voltages. That incurs more losses. So overall the losses from the Sun hitting the PV panels to someone turning on their TV in maine incurs a huge efficiency penalty.</p>
<p>So while the solar source is free, the transmission equipment, transformers, and all the other equipment is not. So now if you take the standard that solar runs at: about 10-25% and apply that and the losses you get huge generation numbers for what would need installed. 11 million MW hours of power were consumed. </p>
<p>So to math this 11,000,000 MWh of power needed. So we need to up the production to account for the losses. So let's divide that up into 365 days of use and 24 hours per day. That comes out to needing an average of 1255 MW of production. Now we add the losses we have to make up for. That comes out to 1794 MW of production. Then we have to throw in the Capacity factor of solar. The industry runs low compared to other power systems. But a plant in Arizona has been hitting 29% so we can use that. that means we need to start with 6185 MW of faceplate capacity. </p>
<p>And we need to be able to store that power. We haven't added storage in yet. Since the solar must be stored some place for when the sun is down. That will add in more losses and therefore more base capacity to meet the needs of the end user. </p>
<p>Agua Caliente is 84 MW of faceplate capacity on 2400 acres. So we need to multiple and we come up with 176,735 acres give or take. That is about 276 sq. miles of solar. </p>
<p>The problem is not with the production of solar electricity. The problem is with storing and moving the solar electricity. The other thing we have not talked about is maintaining grid stability. Thousands of small PV site feeding into a huge grid with nothing to anchor the grid will make it unstable. When a large industrial plant starts a bug line up or a aluminum recycler starts the induction heating process that load has to be absorbed and these small PV suppliers cant handle it. </p>
<p>There are vast engineering problems that need to be solved here. NO it is not impossible, but it needs to be looked at as a whole, not just little pieces. Too many people assume the only thing that needs power is homes and basic lighting and ignore the rest of the grid and the businesses and industry we have in this country. We need a grid they can rely on. The problems are solvable, but not by activists pushing their favorite flavor of solution or the neat product of the day. </p>
<p>Power walls are great. Except for all the drawbacks they have that we ignore. Solar is great except for some of the drawbacks. nuclear is great except for some of the drawbacks. </p>
<p>Ask your self why we are shutting down already operational and carbon free nuclear plants, but are willing to pay extra in taxes to build carbon free NEW renewables. It is stupid. And it ignores the facts of the grid and engineering. Solar cannot be used as abase load. And the technology for storage is more in its infancy than renewables are. And before we can really have any chance of renewables really supplying the whole of the grid, storage has to be solved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you're expecting to make money you need to deal with ongoing maintenance costs as well as the initial setup (even if initial setup is relatively cheap these days). And then you need to make they money back by selling the power, but what if the price of power goes down because you're providing it in such large amounts?</p>
<p>There are some practical concerns though.</p>
<p>Moving electricity is not free or completely efficient. Distributing power around an entire country ends up wasting a lot of it and requiring strong infrastructure and these problems would be even worse with one central source a far distance from where the power is used.</p>
<p>And what about nighttime? Storing electricity is a problem that has NOT been solved on the type of large scale such as &quot;powering a whole country&quot;. And solar panels on opposite sides of the world somehow covering for each other when one side is in the dark increases the problem of distribution even further. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye movement is controlled by a couple different mechanisms that are essentially reflex mediated. The first is saccadic movement. This is the fast, voluntary movement you use to 'lock onto' an object. The movement of the eye is so fast that there is a phenomenon called saccadic masking where the brain ignores visual input during the saccade to avoid blurring of the vision during eye movement. Yes, you go temporarily blind when you move your eyes with saccadic motion. Saccades are controlled by the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus allowing for fixation of the eyes on a point. Saccades can rotate the eye up to 500^o per second. </p>
<p>The next type of reflex/eye movement is called smooth pursuit. The exact neuronal circuitry for this is still up for debate, but we do know that the cerebral cortex, cerebelleum, and superior colliculus are involved. This eye movement allows you to track a moving object without the need for saccades. This reflex also requires input from the pre-frontal cortex, and is often suppressed under the effects of alcohol. This is why a sobriety test involves tracking a finger across the visual field; under the influence of alcohol the brain cannot perform smooth pursuit so the brain resorts to saccades, resulting in what looks like nystagmus. </p>
<p>The next type of eye reflex is the vestibular-occular reflex. This mechanism takes orientation/acceleration input from the inner ear and processes the data so that as your head moves, your eyes move in the opposite direction. This is why your vision doesn't jump around when you walk or move. You can try it by nodding your head up and down: your head moves, but your eyes move opposite, so the resulting visual image appears stationary. It even works with eyes closed.</p>
<p>So in summary, there are three main control mechanisms for eye movement, saccades, smooth pursuit, and the vestibulo-occular reflex. Saccades allow for precise fixation, smooth pursuit allows for tracking a moving object, and the V-O reflex reduces signal noise from head movement. </p>
<p>E: Thanks for the gold, really cool. I just got home and saw this, I'll try answer the unanswered questions.</p>
<p>Just a couple points of clarification: saccadic masking takes the blur out and replaces it with the end image after the saccade. You don't actually go blind, your brain still 'sees something'. This is why if you saccade onto the second hand of a clock it can seem to pause longer than a second. Apologies for the unclear wording above. And to everyone asking about 'why' vs 'how' these reflexes work/exist I'll just leave you with the words of <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=0h0m4s&amp;v=MO0r930Sn_8" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
