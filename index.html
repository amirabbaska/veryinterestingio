Due to the density they only travel a short distance before colliding with a particle and being absorbed. That energy is re-emitted (sometimes as multiple photons with less energy each) then re-absorbed by something else. That random process continues until an energy-excited particle near the surface finally releases a photon that escapes into space.</p>

This is only a part of the answer, and is  true in the radiative zone around the core. Above this, there is the convective come, where the energy is mainly transported by convection. The plasma in this region gets heated from below and starts rising to the surface, where it eventually releases its energy again as radiation.</p>

One might say &quot;it takes a million years for a photon to make it out of the Earth's core&quot; as well, or some other number, and it would make just as much sense. What is meant is that it takes that long for the thermal energy in the core to make its way to the surface. The predominant mechanism for thermal energy transfer inside the Sun is radiative but that doesn't mean that one single photon is bouncing around making its way to the surface. Rather, a photon will hit an atom or electron and accelerate it, then later that atom or electron will emit a photon and in that way the thermal energy from the core will eventually filter out to the surface, cooling off along the way though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I'll just add on the &quot;how do we know it's the exact same photon&quot; thing. Simple: we don't. Even more: we <em>can't</em> know it and the claim doesn't even make sense. Photons are bosons, which means that apart from a handful of obvious physical properties (energy, direction, polarization) they are <em>literally the same</em>, in the strongest possible meaning of the word. There is no way to distinguish photons with same quantum numbers. None, nada, the nature itself doesn't distinguish them, and we can prove it by studying their statistical properties. It's not some peculiarity of the photons, all quantum particles obey this law. For each one there is but a handful of parameters that distinguish them, and a part from that they are physically the same. An electron in your room isn't different in any sense from an electron inside the sun, they could swap places and nobody would ever notice. This manifests in the symmetry properties of solutions to the equations of quantum mechanics. For electrons (and other feemions) this leads to the Pauli exclusion principle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a delicate point about time translations in general relativity, which corresponds to a delicate point in the definition of energy. </p>
<p>As you might already have guessed, continuous transformation to a physical system correspond to a certain associated quantity (called a &quot;charge&quot;) that &quot;generates&quot; the transformation. If a transformation is a symmetry, then the corresponding &quot;charge&quot; is conserved, which is Noether's theorem.</p>
<p>Now, energy is <strong>defined</strong> as being the &quot;charge&quot; to time translation. But what are time translations, exactly?</p>
<p>Our current understanding of fundamental physics takes the form of a pair of interacting, but very distinct entities: the stage (spacetime) and the actors (&quot;matter&quot;). It's not a trivial fact that you can always separate spacetime from the things that move on it, and for example theories of quantum gravity such as string theory tend to blur this line. But as physics stands right now, they're two different things, and both of them are dynamical objects and evolve in time according to specific laws, the famous equations of motion (eom). So &quot;matter&quot; (in which I include everything that isn't gravity) has its system of eom, while the shape of spacetime (the <em>metric</em>) evolves according to <em>its</em> own eom, which are the Einstein field equations.</p>
<p>Note that these two eom are <em>coupled</em>. The eom of matter depends on the shape of spacetime, which affects the motion of particles for example, while the eom of spacetime depends on the matter content, which can create curvature.</p>
<p>Ok, now, back on track: you want to translate something in time; i.e. move all events so that they happen, idk, one second later. It seems completely natural that you should do this by translating <em>both</em> matter and spacetime. They are two physical, dynamical interacting subsystems, they are your physics. They should both be subject to the transformation. Is this always a symmetry? Yes. Both the eom of matter and the Einstein field equations do not depend in any way on what time it actually is, and nothing will actually change. So... let's call the associated charge <strong>the</strong> energy and it has to be conserved, and we're done, right?</p>
<p>That doesn't work. Here's why: if you move both spacetime and matter forward, say, 1 year, this is obviously entirely equivalent to keeping everything where (when?) it is, but assigning a time of 1 year less to all events. Imagine if we were to rewrite all books and all information so that dates are shifted back one year, 2017 -&gt; 2016 and so on. Would <em>anything</em> physically change? Not at all. Is this <em>really</em> a nontrivial transformation?</p>
<p>It's not. It's just a change of coordinates, because time t is just a coordinate on spacetime. And coordinates have no real meaning. That's a fundamental point of general relativity, actually. Since our transformation is dumb, the corresponding &quot;charge&quot; is also dumb: it's always zero*. This is why you sometimes hear of the <em>total</em> energy in the Universe being zero, and I'll clarify in a minute in which sense this is &quot;total&quot;. The point is this definition is almost completely pointless because what good is a physical quantity that is always zero no matter what happens to the system you care about, and what good is it to know that it is conserved (well, duh)?</p>
<p>That's why you actually define time translations in a slightly different way. You only translate matter, not spacetime. If you do it this way, then if the metric of spacetime does change in time, the same matter will find itself in a different shape of spacetime, and so this will not be a symmetry <em>unless</em> the specific shape of spacetime itself is time-translation invariant. In other words, you are acting only on the matter and its own eom, while the metric is more in the role of &quot;background&quot;; since the eom for matter does depend on the metric, it's not, with this philosophy, invariant under time translations. Note how delicate, in the interpretation of the sentence &quot;the laws of physics are/aren't invariant under time translations&quot; is what you actually call the laws of physics and what you call background. The charge associated to these transformation is energy (let's call it physical energy), and is the energy you're more familiar with. And it is not conserved if the metric of spacetime is not time-translation invariant, like in cosmological expansion.</p>
<p>But the &quot;stupid&quot; energy is useful because it gives us an interpretation of the &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;gained&quot; energy in expansion. The physical energy just defined does not include gravitational potential energy. In fact gravitational potential energy is associated to time-translating the metric. Thus the &quot;stupid&quot; energy being conserved just means that (physical energy of matter) + (gravitational potential energy) is conserved. It's not a particularly useful idea in terms of calculations, but it's the approximate physical interpretation you can give of this. So when CMB photons get redshifted by cosmological expansion, you can definitely answer the question &quot;where does the energy go&quot; with &quot;energy is not conserved, because the metric is not time-translation invariant, period&quot;, but you can actually equally well say &quot;it becomes gravitational potential energy of the photons. The other masses in the Universe are getting farther from the photon and so its gravitational potential increases.&quot;</p>
<p>Ok. With that out of the way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and you can generate infinite energy,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yes, you can. It's easy: put a spring with two endpoints a cosmologically-sized distance away. The spring will be stretched by dark energy and you will be able to extract work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>would it also invalidate the law that entropy always increases</p>
</blockquote>
<p>no, but that's really subtle. Gravitational phenomena are able to reduce entropy in a small subsystem but at the expense of creating a much larger amount of entropy in a larger subsystem. (I've talked about this in detail <a href="http://rantonels.github.io/gravity-entropy-and-life/" target="_blank">here</a>). Living beings (including humans) are also able to do the same thing.</p>
<p>The point is that to do this, you need to shed matter that should carry away the large entropy. The second law can <strong>never</strong> be violated (the possibility to create energy out of nothing does not actually help with that). If you need to continuously shed matter to decrease entropy, you're gonna have to get smaller and smaller, and at a certain point you will run out of matter. So there is simply no way to escape the heat death: at some point in the future, any existing structure, computational mechanism, or order of any sort will be dismantled.</p>
<p>* more precisely, it can also be a constant independent on the actual state of the Universe. But still equally pointless, and the rest of the reasoning is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Short summary:
You have the ability to control your tensor tympani muscle, which is used to control your cochlea in response to loud sounds. This creates a rushing, rumbling sound in your ear.  Some people can only do it with eyes closed, some for only a limited time. Some people experience a clicking sound before rumbling. It varies from person to person. I can do it by closing my eyes, opening my mouth wide, or just normally, but for a short time. </p>
<p>It is a very rare trait. Other ear rumblers can be found at r/earrumblersassemble </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: It is not possible.  </p>
<p>Longer Answer: Your identity getting stolen has a lot more to do with what the corporations and entities that have your information are doing with it than anything you are doing.  </p>
<p>Under a few specific circumstances, like say getting hacked and having health data stolen because you weren't following the law with regards to how it had to be handled, you can get in trouble for actions that will result in identity theft.  </p>
<p>But someone paying for LexisNexus data and then going out to steal your identity is probably one of the easiest ways. They already collected all the data that you need from public records ect. Unless it becomes illegal to traffic in data on people that can result in identity theft, its going to keep happening.</p>
<p>There are also a variety of other factors in play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies collect data that can be used to steal your identity, like your social insurance number, as a means of identifying you</li>
<li>There isn't any consequences to just covering up the fact you got hacked instead of disclosing it to people</li>
<li>If you do get hacked and a bunch of data stolen that lets other people steal identities, you aren't the person who deals with any repercussions, so no incentive to protect against it in the first place</li>
<li>Banks are the major fraud targets, and their &quot;solution&quot; to identity theft has typically been &quot;more of the same&quot; like asking additional questions about who you are on the phone ... which are frequently also stolen via the same methods thieves use now. Until some kind of two-factor authentication shows up that banks feel like integrating, no one else will follow suit</li>
<li>The &quot;Everyone else does it this way&quot; factor is really large in business. Its an excuse a lot of people hide behind for not having better processes in place, or just not collecting data they don't need in the first place</li>
<li>And if I recall, the terrorism laws after 2001 led to a proliferation of entities collecting Social Security Numbers, like clerks at CVS collecting them for those prepaid credit cards you can buy. This made it a lot easier to get ahold of them, and meant there were more places to find them, like the junky computer from 1993 CVS has in the back that has never been updated</li>

<p>2015</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Thursday revealed that 21.5 million people were swept up in a colossal breach of government computer systems that was far more damaging than initially thought, resulting in the theft of a vast trove of personal information, including Social Security numbers and some fingerprints.
Every person given a government background check for the last 15 years was probably affected, the Office of Personnel Management said in announcing the results of a forensic investigation of the episode, whose existence was known but not its sweeping toll.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May 26, 2015</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said on Tuesday there were about 200,000 attempts to illegally access tax information from February to May this year.
He said of those, about 100,000 were successful. The hackers used the &quot;get transcript&quot; application, which calls up information from previous returns, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2016</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In February, a seemingly rogue hacker targeted the FBI and DHS, publishing contact information for 20k and 9k employees, respectively, on Twitter. The hacker compromised the email of a DoJ employee, which gave him access to the information. One of NASA’s drones was allegedly hacked by the known hacktivist group Anonsec, and data on over 2,400 employees, along with flight log and aircraft videos were released. A 300-page zine was released, detailing the information and security failings of NASA. The hack was executed through brute-forcing an administrator’s SSH password left with a default password, which led to root access to three network-attached-storage devices. Lastly, the IRS was hacked in February and an estimated 700,000 social security numbers and other sensitive information was stolen, just months after its most recent hack in May of 2015 (not counting compromised information resulting from a lost flash drive in August 2015). The attack, which took advantage of the ‘Get Transcript’ program, allowing you to check your tax history, severely increased the risk of identity theft for all victims who had data compromised.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you should go to the source:  I've written 3 books about this starting in 1998 -- and all of these appear to be related to the same threads -- over 2 decades. </p>
<p>Here's a free copy of the latest book, &quot;The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal &amp; Free the Net&quot;, which we put up a few weeks ago because few, if anyone actually bothered to read how the calculations were done. They were based on the telco's annual reports, state filings, etc.-- and the data is based on 20 years of documentation-- Bruce Kushnick
<a href="http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/" target="_blank">http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/</a></p>
<p>I've been tracking the telco deployments of fiber optics since 1991 when they were announced as something called the Information Superhighway. The plan was to have America be the first fiber optic country -- and each phone company went to their state commissions and legislatures and got tax breaks and rate increases to fund these 'utility' network upgrades that were supposed to replace the existing copper wires with fiber optics -- starting in 1992. And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history &quot;The Unauthorized Bio&quot; with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking). I then released &quot;$200 Billion Broadband Scandal&quot; in 2005, which gave the details as by then more than 1/2 of America should have been completed -- but wasn't. And the mergers to make the companies larger were also supposed to bring broadband-- but didn't.
I updated the book in 2015 &quot;The Book of Broken Promises $400 Billion broadband Scandal and Free the Net&quot;, but realized that there were other scams along side this -- like manipulating the accounting. </p>
<p>We paid about 9 times for upgrades to fiber for home or schools and we got nothing to show for it -- about $4000-7000 per household (though it varies by state and telco). By 2017 it's over 1/2 trillion. </p>
<p>Finally, I note. These are not &quot;ISPs&quot;; they are state utility telecommunications companies that were able to take over the other businesses (like ISPs) thanks to the FCC under Mike Powell, now the head of the cable association. They got away with it because they could create a fake history that reporters and politicians kept repeating. No state has ever done a full audit of the monies collected in the name of broadband; no state ever went back and reduced rates or held the companies accountable. And no company ever 'outed' the other companies-- i.e., Verizon NJ never said that AT&amp;T California didn't do the upgrades. --that's because they all did it, more or less. I do note that Verizon at least rolled out some fiber. AT&amp;T pulled a bait and switch and deployed U-Verse over the aging copper wires (with a 'fiber node' within 1/2 mile from the location). </p>
<p>It's time to take them to court. period. We should go after the financial manipulations (cross-subsidies) where instead of doing the upgrades to fiber, they took the money and spent it everywhere else, like buying AOL or Time Warner (or overseas investments), etc. We should hold them accountable before this new FCC erases all of the laws and obligations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the agreement had no teeth, probably because it didn't define the problem in actual terms that could be acted upon in the case of failure.</p>
<p>Really, how would you want the contract written to require broadband for everyone? You can't require 100% coverage because my grandmother doesn't want it. You can't​ require everyone that wants it gets it because there is that guy in Alaska that lives 500 miles from his closest neighbor. You can try to say 80% of people who ask can get it, but what happens for those that can't get it? They can't get it because they are not in XYZ's coverage area. But they are asking because they are in nobody's coverage area, so what company puts them down as a no when none applies, who do you blame for not expanding? That metric doesn't work either.</p>
<p>The problem is the only concrete stuff you can do is tell them where to spend it, if that's on ”installing fiber&quot; then that's what they'll spend it on. But ISPs are constantly installing fiber, in fact that may be spending billions a year just to replace existing fiber, if you tell them you'll pay for it they'll just stop paying for installing fiber and let you pay, the money saved can be given out to shareholders. That of course is equivalent to just giving the money away, but there wasn't anything that said they can't​ do that.</p>
<p>So really it's a very hard problem to define, there can be some requirements on it, but they can't be tough, and that makes it just about equal to giving it away. If the government wanted their money spent on expanding access to specific markets they would of been required to tell the ISPs exactly what they want built and then maintained ownership of it, the way the power company where I live works. But that's government run ISPs, and everyone seems to hate that idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also helps to start in the 1980s with the history of how we got our current ISPs.</p>
<p>The TLDR version is:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation#Monopoly" target="_blank">AT&amp;T had a monopoly</a>.  They built a lot of their infrastructure via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain" target="_blank">eminent domain</a> law and taxpayer money, for the &quot;greater good.&quot;  As a business, using other people's money to grow is a good move.  The issue currently is ISPs don't want the government telling them what to do with the infrastructure.</p>
<p>See, in the 1980s all these other people wanted to get into the same business AT&amp;T had, but they didn't want to invest in building infrastructure when AT&amp;T already did, using eminent domain and tax money.  These other businesses argued that AT&amp;T having sole control over the lines was unfair, since taxes paid for some of it.  The government stepped in and said, &quot;sorry, Ma Bell, but you have to share.&quot;  Because of this we got a lot of ISPs that sprang up in a short amount of time, and until a few years ago all those ISPs were fighting for their own chunks of business.</p>
<p>Now we're stuck with a few large ISPs that control everything, just enough to the point of legally being able to say it's not a &quot;monopoly&quot; when for the most part people have no choice in their city for an ISP.</p>
<p>America has been sick of having no choice, and poor internet speeds, so the government has once again tried to encourage growth by using tax money as an incentive to expand.  </p>
<p>The problem is the ISPs are deathly afraid of expanding while the Net Neutrality laws exist because they don't want other small ISP startups coming along and using the infrastructure they're making.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is, the big ISPs don't want to expand with better fiber service anywhere unless they can control it, but they also won't pass up free tax money.  They take any free tax money they get from the government and then exploit loopholes from shoddy contracts to avoid actually expanding.  They invent excuses to avoid actually expanding.</p>
<p>Basically the ISPs have been holding internet infrastructure expansion hostage until the FCC rebrands them, because they don't want to be held accountable to governmental oversight.  They want to monopolize the new fiber system before they actually build it, and recently the FCC caved in to their demands.  </p>
<p>I'm not just regurgitating stuff I've read on the internet here.  I used to work for MCI, a company that wouldn't have existed if the FCC didn't break up Ma Bell in the 80s.</p>
<p>(<em>edit:</em> clarity)</p>
<p>(<em>edit:</em> Thanks for the Gold!  It's my very first one!  I'm deeply Humbled!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These figures seem to all be laid out by Bruce Kushnick, chairman of Teletruth and Director of the New Networks Institute, who also wrote the &quot;The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal and Free the Net&quot;. In his previous 2006 book named &quot;$200 Billion Broadband Scandal&quot;, which can be found at <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/61BF.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/61BF.pdf</a> as it seems to have been given in its entirety as a public comment, and as the ycombinator commenters point out, the author seems to arrive at the ~$200 billion figure based mainly on overcharging that the author figures should have been better regulated by the government.</p>
<p>I think where the confusion stems is from the line in blog for the new book which says: &quot;<em>America will have been charged about $400 billion</em>&quot;, which may have gotten confused as being entirely some form of subsidy or handout from the government while the author probably means the overcharging of each individual American customer plus the tax write-offs as per his 2006 book. Without seeing the book we can't be certain but given the author's very similar claims from his 2006 I would say it's a safe assumption.</p>
<p>As for why all this overcharging happened: it was not just the ISPs which were doing it. Computer technology in the home and office seriously exploded from around the 1980s and on at a pace that made it ripe for exploit as it was all so very new without nearly as many expectations and understanding as we have today. Part of that exploitation was monopolies that probably shouldn't have happened, including Microsoft which lost an important anti-trust case in 1998. The main argument seems to be that Internet, which is even replacing phone service in some parts and will do so even more then true 4G is fully rolled out, should be a well-regulated utility like phone service currently is in the US. Based on this notion we have the idea of the US government &quot;letting&quot; the companies have all this money from the American people.</p>

A sidereal day is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to rotate by 360°, and is indeed 23h56m4s.  A solar day is the interval between two successive instances of the Sun crossing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_\(astronomy\)" target="_blank">local meridian</a>.  Since the Earth moves by roughly 1° around the Sun each day, the Earth has to rotate by roughly 361° for the Sun to cross the local meridian.  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sidereal_day_\(prograde\).png" target="_blank">this image</a>, sidereal time is the difference between the blue circles labelled &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, where solar time is the difference between the blue circles labelled &quot;1&quot; and &quot;3&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's how long it takes for a 360° rotation of the earth. Since it's also revolving around the sun it requires more than a 360° turn for the same point to be facing the sun again. Therefore, a &quot;day&quot; as we know it is more than 360° and a lot closer to 24 hours than your estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 4 minute discrepency is our position relative to the stars, not the sun.  We measure days by the sun, not the stars.</p>
<p>So, one day is 1440 minutes.  One orbit is 365.25 days.  So every time we've completed one <em>solar</em> day - that is, the sun has returned to the same relative position it started in, we've moved further 1/365.25° in our orbit.  Leaving the stars 1440/365.25 minutes out of place - 3.94 minutes.</p>
<p>This &quot;discrepency&quot; doesn't need to be accounted for, because once it's happened 365.25 times, the stars are back where they started.</p>
<p>The leap year accounts for that 0.25 in our 365.25 day orbit.  So you can see where 4*0.25 becomes simple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, 23h25m4s is the length of a <em>sideral day</em>, which is the time it takes to face the same direction relevant to an object outside the solar system (such as the galactic center). A solar day (the time it takes for the sun to reach the same angle in the sky) is about 24 hours (give or take a few seconds on certain days, considering the earth moves at different speeds at different parts of its ellipse).</p>
<p>Leap years are a different kettle of fish. You see, the speed at which the earth rotates, and the speed at which it revolves around the sun are not connected, and the solar year is 365d5h48m46s (which is 11m14s less than 365.25 days) so we accumulate nearly a quarter of a day (to be specific, 24.219907407407407407407407407407%) per year, which would mean over time, our calendar would slip and we'd end up with summer in the northern hemisphere for christmas! over the course of 100 years, autumn would begin to creep into august, and spring into January, as the seasons shifted over by 24 days. So, we could add an extra day ever 4 years to fix it right? However, since the solar year is 11m14s shorter than that .25, we're now shifting 11m14s a year in the other direction. in 128 years, we'd be one day off. So we do better by NOT including an extra day on years divisible by 100. But we also knew we could do better, so we made an exception to that rule: If the year was divisible by 400 it WOULD be a Leap Year. Now it will take 3300 years to diverge for the calendar year and solar year to converge by a single day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your math is off, we add add the lap day because the solar year is actually about 365 1/4 days, we add the extra day every 4 years to account for that. We actually had to change it a while back to account for the fact that its slightly less the 365 1/4 </p>
<p>Heres a better explanation...</p>
<p>The exact length of a solar year is actually 11 minutes and 14 seconds less than 365 ¼ days. That means that even if you add a leap day every four years, the calendar would still overshoot the solar year by a little bit—11 minutes and 14 seconds per year. These minutes and seconds really start to add up: after 128 years, the calendar would gain an entire extra day. So, the leap year rule, &quot;add a leap year every four years&quot; was a good rule, but not good enough!</p>
<p>Calendar Correction, Part II</p>
<p>To rectify the situation, the creators of our calendar (the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582) decided to omit leap years three times every four hundred years. This would shorten the calendar every so often and rid it of the annual excess of 11 minutes and 14 seconds. So in addition to the rule that a leap year occurs every four years, a new rule was added: a century year is not a leap year unless it is evenly divisible by 400. This rule manages to eliminate three leap years every few hundred years.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an organisation in place called the GS1. It is a non-profit based in Belgium which, among other things, coordinates the use of bar-codes on whole industries and cross-industries scale.</p>
<p>The most common standard in place is the International Article Number (or sometimes European Article Number). It has a number of fixed format that all go like this:</p>
<p>-n digits for country code<br />
-n digits for a unique manufacturer code<br />
-n digits for a unique product code<br />
-n digits for checking purposes when scanning the code</p>
<p>So every business goes through the GS1 to get a manufacturer code that is unique and not in use by another company. Then the manufacturer can decide on any product code itself (within the specifications of the standard).</p>
<p>Edit:format
Edit 2: Since this seems to get a bit of interest. I'll add a few things that have been mentioned in other comments and also address the last part of the original question. </p>
<p>EAN is the most used standard in the world, but other exists as well, some codes are also made to no particular standards. I used this as an example fitting to give OP an answer. </p>
<p>Registering with the GS1 does cost money.  </p>
<p>A bar code is just, well, a code, what is printed underneath a barcode is the entirety of the information. 12-13 digits long numbers are used in the most popular standards. Since the last digit is usually used as a check digit, it only leaves 11 or 12 digits to convey information. That is far too small a volume of information to carry things like brand,model etc.<br />
In the example of a cashier's terminal at a department store, the Point Of Sale software receives a code from the scanner and looks it up in its database where all the relevant info is stored under the bar code number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I should dispell a few MYTHS about GS1 as someone who works in the industry. I realise I'm a little late to the party but whatever.</p>
<p>Because GS1 aren't the non-profit do gooding angels some people seem to think they are</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>GS1 is NOT the only legal legitimate option for purchasing - there are a number of barcodes that can and are bought and sold for a one-off cost rather than people having to pay on going fees and joining fees. These Barcodes are part of the GS1 system - but due to a mistake GS1 made back in the 90's, they have now been proven outside of GS1's control in court and can legally be sold by third parties for one off fees.</p>
<ul>
<li>GS1 would say they can't guarantee that these aren't used on multiple products. But they also can't guarantee this to any extent with the barcodes they supply directly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not for profit? - technically yes, although it's hard to see how they manage to somehow, spend all of this, if they are not paying massive salaries out to everyone involved. Cause they are quite clearly a money making machine. They don't release their books, so it's hard to know where their expenses are exactly. We do know that at least some of their resources in some countries are spent on people going into individual stores, searching for products not carrying GS1 Barcodes and calling up the owner to tell them that their barcode is illegitimate and that they need to sign up to GS1 immediately, start paying exorbitant fees every year and reprint their product packaging or print labels and manually stick them onto their products. - This despite the fact that these Barcodes have been proven in court already to be legitimate</p>
</li>
<li>Companies like Walmart require GS1 Barcodes to guarantee non-duplication of barcodes on multiple products - again GS1 can't guarantee that a company doesn't accidentally assign one barcode to 2 barcodes any more than other companies can. The reason Walmart doesn't accept other sellers barcodes is because large companies like this will sometimes allow GS1 to manage their barcode policy entirely. GS1 then of course decides that they should only accept GS1 Barcodes in order to maintain their virtual monopoly. There are also interesting occurrences of Senior Vice Presidents of Walmart appearing on the Board of Governors for GS1-US - this might actually explain some of these other expenses of theirs...</li>
</ol>
<p>So GS1 are kind of the devil in a lot of ways</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: &quot;GS1 Certified Bar-code Professional&quot; The only bar-codes that have any kind of intelligence built into them are those required by the FDA such as medical devices or some other deciding agency. Basically anything that falls under the medical device tax. Same goes for prescriptions and food. Things that are deemed not dangerous or not able to hurt you don't need to adhere to this standard. If you are selling pencils and rubber bands you can make your own internal barcode numbers that mean nothing to the outside world. Only you and your business know or care what they are. For example we make class III medical devices that fall under the FDA medical device tax. We need to create what is called a FDA UDI. UDI - Unique Device Identifier for each product falling under this tax, meaning it has to be unique for each and every scale that gets produced. For this we use a GTIN14 which is a longer barcode consisting of a (root)+xxx barcode number in which xxx always increments. There are certain applications identifiers that fall into the GTIN14 standard. (21) tells the scanner that the numbers that follow are batch or lot number. There are many many application identifiers and certain products require 1, 2, 3 or more identifiers based on which level the product falls under. The most dangerous products require the most identifiers such as expiration date, and among others. SO in our case we have our GS1 &quot;prefix&quot; we then add application identifier (gs1prefix(21)wo-1234xxx) so when any scanner that has the gs1 standard will read this correctly. The other side of the spectrum is the pencils and rubberbands, these products can use a simple EAN barcode that is the same.... 12345456671 for each and every pencil you sell. If you took that pencil and scanned it at a different store it may come up as a rubberband.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have posted about the GS1, but I wanted to address something else in your question! The barcode does encode one thing: the country it's marked for sale in.</p>
<p>UPC-12, which is just EAN13, is mostly used in the US. That's because the number for the US is 0, so we ignore the first digit, giving us UPC-12.</p>
<p>Other countries have different leading numbers, the first digit in an EAN tells you where the manufacturer/company getting the barcode is from. As another commenter pointed out, this doesn't tell you 100% where the company is selling their products, not does it tell you where it was made.</p>
<p>When barcodes where first being given out, companies could buy a whole block of barcodes, so the first part of the barcode would seem to match up with a company. This isn't true anymore - there's too many people that need barcodes. The first three digits of a barcode do tell you a little bit about the company, and you can get a company prefix, it just might be longer.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that you can print barcodes with whatever number you want - some of our suppliers don't purchase codes from GS1, and instead use a specially set aside internal use code, which are the prefixes 040-049.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many have noted about GS1, EAN, UPC, etc. (there's dozens more). These are all fine and dandy when they are used correctly by everyone. However, in many cases smaller companies will not entirely comply with these standards (tiny format differences). Think for example about butchers, bakeries, ... Often in these cases smaller barcodes are used and sometimes only contain a single number which identifies their internal product. The use of internal codes is perfectly fine, as this is also done within EAN codes (the last field), however, it often becomes an issue when these products are being sold to others. Different suppliers of a product (e.g. a 10kg bag of flour of a specific brand) sometimes provide a different barcode even though they are offering the exact same product. My point being, in theory, the standards are brilliant. In practice, not so much.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, this is the first time I can answer a Reddit question as an actual &quot;professional&quot;. I'm a prehistoric archeology student, so basically trying to figure out exactly that is (hopefully) my future job. The answer is, we really don't. <strong>A lot</strong> of what we 'know&quot; is conjecture, which is fancy talk for &quot;educated wild ass guess&quot;.<br />
But we obviously base our guesses on some evidence. The more evidence you have, and the more detailed it is, the better your reconstruction. Finding out all those details takes a lot of highly specialized skills. And that's where we &quot;archaeological scientists&quot; (as opposed to archaeologists) come in. Archaeologists paint the broad picture, we fill in the little blanks. </p>
<p>The amount and kind of evidence you have depends on location and age, but older doesn't necessarily mean less evidence. Here in Switzerland, the Neolithic is one of the best studied prehistoric ages whereas we know next to nothing about some parts of the pre-roman Iron Age. That's because many Neolithic settlements were built on lake shores or even in lakes. And waterlogged environments cause excellent  preservation of organic remains. Let's try a simple reconstruction of a Neolithic lake shore town so you see how we work and what kind of evidence we use.  </p>
<p>We find wooden remains from stilt houses, which allow dendro-dating, which is precise to a few years, sometimes even to a few months. So we know how the town looked, how many houses there were and how old they are. The patterns of stilts also allow us to reconstruct certain dimensions of the houses, size of the settlements and so on.<br />
Inside the houses, we find bones of livestock, charred grains and fruit seeds, so we know what the people ate. Sometimes, we can analyze the remains of fats from ceramic shards to tell if they've been used to store milk or cheese.<br />
We find tools, fishing hooks made from bones, axes made from stone, arrowheads made from flint, maybe loom weights, if we're really lucky also wheels, oars and so on. In very rare cases, we might even find fishing nets or fabrics. If we map certain remains, like animal bones, we might see patterns that could indicate a hierarchy. Pigs are usually food for &quot;richer&quot; people because pigs aren't really good for anything else. A cow you can use for milk or labor and eat it when it's old.
If we're lucky enough to find corresponding burials, we can find out even more. Bones can tell you what a person did for most of their lives. Did they carry heavy loads, were they mostly sitting (working on a loom), is there evidence for malnutrition, are there signs of past, non-fatal injury? Isotope analysis can tell us what they ate. The more &quot;carnivorous&quot; a human is, the higher a certain value of a stable carbon isotope. We can also compare different isotope ratios between bones and teeth to determine if a person might not have died in the same broad geographic region that they grew up in (migration).<br />
Finally, we can analyze pollen from lake sediments of the same age. With those, it's possible to reconstruct the landscape. For the Neolithic, for example, you will find loads of tree pollen and very few grass pollen, which tells us that there were no large, open pastures, so livestock was kept on wood pastures. </p>
<p>For pre-agricultural societies, it gets more difficult. Large paleolithic find complexes are rare because there were no towns (not strictly true but let's keep it simple) and there are almost no areas where conditions were stable enough for long enough to allow for preservation of delicate organic material. But we can still find out details. We find stone tools made from flint, we can usually tell if they've been used and how, we find the cut marks the tools left on animal bones. Unfortunately, we basically never find any organic material, so we don't really know anything about paleolithic clothing, tool mountings and so on.  What we do find are burials, and that fact alone tells us that whoever buried their dead there had some sort of abstract concept of an afterlife. Because if life just stops with death, there's little that's stopping you from just dumping the dead body into the next ditch. There are some buried skulls that clearly show that the person had lost their teeth long ago, which means the rest of the group had to care for them for months or even years, telling us something about social structures.  </p>
<p>In some very rare cases, you might make the find of the century which reveals details you couldn't possibly have discovered otherwise. For the Neolithic Europe, that find was Ötzi, an ice mummy found in Italy in 1991. Ötzi and the stuff he carried when he died helped us reconstruct Neolithic clothing, everyday accessories, general health and so on. Of course, the problem with such unique find is always that you can't be sure how representative they are of the general situation.</p>
<p>In summary, archaeology is similar to detective work on a crime scene several thousand years old. You will never know what <strong>exactly</strong> happened but if you know what to look for, you can start to paint a general picture. There are facts you can rely on but some blanks you'll always have to fill in with your creativity and &quot;gut feeling&quot;. The art then is to strike a good balance between seeing those ancient people as humans who functioned in similar way to you, and projecting too much of your worldview onto them. Some of your traits as a human are universal, some aren't.  If you find a concentration of flower pollen in a paleolithic dwelling, it's not absurd to assume that maybe the inhabitants picked some flowers and put them in their hut because they looked pretty. But if you find a man and a woman buried in the same grave, don't claim they were &quot;husband and wive&quot; just because that seems to make sense in <em>your</em> culture. </p>
<p>tldr: To find out what humans did before they could write down what they did, a bunch of lunatics will carefully sift through metric tons of mud and then make educated guesses based on what they found.</p>
<p>I know this was a super long reply but I get kinda excited if someone is interested in what I do \^\^ Keep in mind, this reply is rather Euro-centric. The archaeological situation and methods are different in other parts of the world although the general idea is the same.
If anyone wants to know more, just ask, I'd be happy to try and reply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can check out the research done on footprints. There are fossilized footprints. When Australian aborigines were asked about them they could fill in a large amount of detail about the group just from the footprints.</p>
<p>We do miss a huge amount. I do not think archeologists focus enough on rope building, or making nets, or snares, because these things perish.</p>
<p>There is a site in South Africa filled with fish bones. The sea was never that high. The fish were carried there for a fish fry. The fish live fairly deep. Someone stood on the shore and lured them in. There are puncture marks in the ribs. Someone speared these fish after they were lured in.</p>
<p>You can picture it. There is a party on the shore where the fishing is done. A group is catching the fish, stringing them up on a line or thin branch. After plenty of fish are caught they are carried up higher for the cooking.</p>
<p>There are caves in Africa with layers of deposits. The deep ones show that the caves are dens. There are many bones of prey animals including human ancestors with gnaw marks on them. The later layers have human skeletons intact, and many many prey animals with scrape marks from slicing the meat off with stone tools. There is evidence of hearths used for fires for a million years.</p>
<p>We do not know a lot of things. But there are remains of things in deposits of volcanic ash. The ash deposits built up over a million years. There is evidence of human ancestors traversing through this separated by that time.</p>
<p>Every fossil, every bit of bone, is intensely scrutinized and tested to get the maximum information. Isotope analysis is done which can determine the diet over a lifetime. </p>
<p>Humans have put their palms against cave walls for a long time, and blown colored dust over their hands. Individual hands can be picked out. Some had a broken finger which healed crookedly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like any other scientific or academic discipline - we follow the evidence.</p>
<p>This includes pottery and stone fragments (mostly tools), footprints, ancient drawings / glyphs / paintings (like you'd expect to find in a cave), and sometimes ancient structures (from burial sites, to megaliths, to temples and other settlements). Bones of course are also very important (both human/humaoid bones and animal bones with signs of human activity).</p>
<p>Some people also focus on geological evidence e.g. &quot;oh look, this desert used to be an ancient lake!&quot; This is a big part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Put all these together, and this gives you a pretty good idea of the kind of lifestyle these ancient people used to have. Ultimately, a lot of this is educated guesswork. Some things are just impossible to know with 100% certainty - but the more evidence you gather, the more support you get and the bigger the likelihood that this was how these people lived back then.</p>
<p>The biggest issue really (aside from lack of written records) is the lack of organic / biological matter, which leaves out a huge piece of the puzzle. This is because organic matter is the first to simply decompose - so it's super rare to find preserved biological matter.</p>
<p>Bones certainly go a long way to help, but these pale (in terms of information you can find out) in comparison to actual preserved bodies (as are sometimes found in ice, bogs, or sometimes mummified even today).</p>
<p>Also there is still a lot of study into cultural &quot;myths and legends&quot; to see if these are stories with any historical basis (albeit, often greatly exaggerated). The &quot;great flood&quot; is a particular one which is believed to have occurred (though that doesn't mean that there was a guy called Noah or anything like that).</p>
<p>Tl;dr - we look at all the available evidence, and draw (usually) educated conclusions based on this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Huge areas were flooded and traces of human habitation there are mostly lost...like Doggerland</p>
<p>&quot;The archaeological potential of the area had first been identified in the early 20th century, but interest intensified in 1931 when a fishing trawler operating east of the Wash dragged up a barbed antler point that was subsequently dated to a time when the area was tundra. Vessels have dragged up remains of mammoth, lion and other animals, as well as a few prehistoric tools and weapons&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Demodex is a parasite that is found on humans, and is called mange on dogs. A compromised immune system can cause an infestation, but usually our immune system is strong enough to kill them off before they become a problem. I think this may be a reason for those phantom bugs you feel. My dog had non contagious mange and he almost died before I was able to turn it around for him. He came from an unknown background, and even though I did DNA, I have no clue where all his health issue came from. He is almost full GS and has 17 % Great Dane- he is a handsome boy! Anyway that is how I learned about demodex.
