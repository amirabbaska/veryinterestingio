		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals do sit down and eat a meal together. Well carnivores do. Lions will eat in a group, strongest first. Zebras dont. Why? Its the nature of their 'prey'. As soon as humans started preying on animals far larger than a meal there would have been a subsequent need to collate the food, process it, then eat it as a community. You cant snack on a mammoth and even a decent sized deer is gonna keep a lot of people fed for a while, but only after its brought back to the community, butchered and (at some stage in time) a cooking process was installed. Given the opportunistic nature of hunter gathering I think a large amount of snacking went on, but as humans became more sophisticated hunters of animals larger than their immediate appetites then central meals become more important. If we'd evolved from Zebras we'd just sit at work in the office all day munching on grass snacks and there would be no need for a lunch break.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced. Reingestion is most common within the burrow between 8 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock in the evening, being carried out intermittently within that period.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doms is likely cause by microtears created during eccentric movements (studies found that concentric movements alone do not cause doms). Therefore it seems likely that a (or the) major cause of differentent amounts of doms are caused by how much someone emphasizes eccentric portions of lifts. This may also explain why leg day always causes the most soreness, as many of your major lower body muscles are placed under very high stress during the eccentric portion of the squat. </p>
<p>Other factors such as nutrition and hormonal levels, which influence how muscles are rebuilt, are probably other major factors as well, though afaik the specific mechanisms of doms and recovery are still unknown . </p>
<p>I also don't know why the delay varies from person to person, but it appears that continuing to do light exercise helps lessen soreness due to doms, so you may just be more sedentary when not st the gym </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is a weird thing.</p>
<p>But it only seems weird because we don't readily grasp everything that's going on at once. </p>
<p>DOMS is an interesting thing, because very rarely does our body <em>delay</em> feeling something. Adrenaline will delay certain senses for a short period of time (ie shock). A pregnant woman will delay releasing certain hormone doses (pictosin) until it's time to really push. Most everything else is processed as soon as it can.</p>
<p>First, we know that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alfred_Goldberg/publication/22014852_Effects_of_insulin_glucose_and_amino_acids_on_protein_turnover_in_rat_diaphragm/links/55b279ca08aed621ddfe0d38.pdf" target="_blank">insulin has a profound effect on muscle growth, preventing both degradation of already synthesized proteins and fueling further synthesis. Contrast this to just glucose, which will fuel synthesis but not help prevent degradation of current proteins</a>. Second, exercising <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henrik_Galbo/publication/20028956_Effect_of_physical_exercise_on_sensitivity_and_responsiveness_to_insulin_in_humans/links/560954fd08ae4d86bb11c60d.pdf" target="_blank">both makes insulin more effective, and can reduce insulin production by the pancreas for 48 hours</a>.</p>
<p>How does this fit with DOMS? Muscle Soreness is really just light pain - mild discomfort caused by disturbances in your nerves electro-chemical balance. We can readily expect that any type of tissue repair would produce such an effect, so the question then becomes 'why do certain exercises have different effect on people as to when their bodies enter a certain phase of tissue repair?'</p>
<p>I believe the answer lies in their insulin sensitivity. The more insulin sensitive the person, the quicker they hit DOMS because the effect of the new exercise both doesn't suppress their insulin production <em>as much</em> during the 48 hour period, nor do they become glucose starved in their bloodstream as a result of the insulin spike that happens immediately post exercise.</p>
<p>If you want to hit DOMS quicker, eat something that you know triggers an insulin response (and have carbs with it). If you want to push back DOMS, don't eat the things which trigger your insulin response. The difference in the length of delay is noticeable enough if you have a set schedule and keep good notes. You should also find that as you progress through your regimen, your time till soreness and period of soreness both decrease until they plateau at some steady state. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In some cases this vapor pressure is so low that you can safely treat an object (say a metal coin) as unchanging over years.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to the pressure and temperature of the substance.  Take a look at these phase diagrams:</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/700px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">Water</a></p>
<p><a href="https://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/co2_phase_diagram.gif" target="_blank">Carbon Dioxide</a></p>
<p>On the water diagram, look at the red line ~100kPa (1 atm).  This is the typical pressure we find on Earth.  Follow it along the x-axis (temperature) and you'll see the familiar solid until 0 C, liquid until 100 C.  Now if the pressure was slightly under 1 kPa, you'll see we hit a triple point, this is the temperature/pressure at which water will exist in all three phases at the same time.  Below that pressure, water sublimes, going directly from solid to gas.  You'll also notice water has a bunch of different solid forms, this is due to rearrangements in the crystalline structure of ice at different pressures/temperature.</p>
<p>On the CO2 diagram, you'll see at 1 atm, it sublimes from solid to gas.  We would need to put dry ice in a container pressurized  above 5.11 atm to get liquid CO2.</p>
<p>Phase diagrams are different for every single substance.  Pressure and temperature, along with intermolecular forces and such, will determine what phase a substance will be, and whether it is able to sublime or will pass through a liquid phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sublimation, and indeed any phase change, is determined by several intensive properties of the system, including temperature, pressure, and the molar density of the compound in each phase. The ultimate reason any phase change occurs is because the molecules can do work to move from one phase to another. This may seem like a somewhat cyclical definition, but in order to relate phase changes to thermodynamic quantities we need to start out simple.</p>
<p>The way we formally describe phase changes is through the quantity of chemical potential µ, AKA the amount of free energy per molecule. The formal definition of µ includes a term that is the &quot;standard&quot; free energy, a function of the temperature and pressure of the system, and a term that increases as density increases. </p>
<p>Now free energy is the amount of energy available to do work, i.e. the total energy minus the random thermal energy. We can think of a phase change as the phenomenon where molecules move from one phase with energy G to another phase of energy G', which takes an amount of G' – G work to accomplish. Phase changes occur spontaneously if the molecule can move to a lower, more stable state. G is just the macroscopic analogue of µ, so this is analogous to saying that molecules will move from a higher µ to a lower µ'. This is much like how gasses move from higher pressure to lower pressure, however µ is even more general since it accounts for pressure, temperature, and density. IIRC Josiah Gibbs (the guy who formalized all of this science) originally referred to µ is &quot;pressure of mass action&quot; or something like that, which I think is a good intuitive description.</p>
<p>So now I think the crux of your question is how can it be that you can skip liquid when sublimation occurs. Don't you have to step up through each phase of matter sequentially as you gain chemical potential? </p>
<p>The answer is no. If you have enough chemical potential then the matter will simply not be able to condense into liquid and will fly out straight into the gas phase. Note that pretty much every substance has a certain ranges of temperature and pressure at which it can sublimate. Even water. The important thing is that these occur at relatively lower <em>pressures</em> compared to your normal solid-liquid phase change. If pressure is low, then molecules have to do less work to change from solid to gas because they have fewer other gas molecules to push out of the way. If they don't have to do much work to make the phase change, then basically as soon as they have enough thermal energy to do the work, they will escape the solid phase. This is an entropically-driven process that is exactly the same as a going from liquid to gas or solid to liquid. Sublimation is a specific special case where it just so happens that so little work needs to be done by the solid phase molecules that when they do the work, its enough to shoot right past the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. </p>
<p>So thats the &quot;what causes&quot; part of your question. The &quot;why&quot; part of this answer is quite complex. The why depends specifically and critically on the chemical properties of the molecules themselves. These properties make their contribution to chemical potential in the &quot;standard&quot; term that I was talking about earlier. You can always increase µ by increasing density, but some compounds just intrinsically have lower µ than others. A good example is water vs. CO2. Water can engage in lots of H bonding interactions, which effectively hold the molecules together more strongly. This means they have lower overall chemical potential than say CO2 molecules, which cannot engage in H bonding and therefore can move around and do work more easily. So now if we think about solid CO2 and solid H2O at 1 atm and 30ºC, you would expect the CO2 to sublimate and the water to melt. The liquid water can grab other H2O molecules more easily with those sticky H bonds, but the CO2 is relatively weak, and so those molecules just shoot straight out into the gas phase.</p>
<p>Thats kind of a hand-wavey intuitive answer, but you could also solve for the boundary mathematically by assuming µ(solid) = µ(liquid) and µ(solid) = µ(gas). Chemical potentials are equal at phase boundaries, so solving these equations is how people figure out how to draw the lines on phase diagrams. You would find that at 1 atm, there are no human-scale thermodynamic solutions in which you could make µ(ice) = µ(liquid) for CO2. Solutions will only appear in excess of 5.1 atm, because at these higher pressures the gas molecules can't just fly off into the atmosphere. The atmosphere itself does enough work on the evaporating molecules to trap them in a condensed phase, i.e. liquid.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of answers here on the phase characteristics that substances show, but those just explain 'what' happens, not the intuition for the 'why' behind it, so lets take another approach.</p>
<p>For the purposes of building some insight, its actually better to think of matter as having only two distinct phases... bound and unbound. </p>
<p>An unconfined gas in in an unbound state, in that each gas molecule is essentially 'free' to move around without being 'bound' by other molecules.</p>
<p>On the other hand, solids and liquids are much better thought of as 'bound' states, where each molecule is held in a network of forces by other molecules around it that 'bind' it to them. </p>
<p>When looked at this way, solids and liquids are very similar, with the only difference that solids are bound rigidly whereas liquids are bound and therfore can't escape the liquid body, but can move around internally. In fact, it is even more deeper... For instance, if you start heating a mtal rod, long before it gets to melting point, it will start becoming soft and flexible, almost to the extent of a wet noodle. So molecules there ARE indeed moving around internally, just with more difficulty. And indeed, if you think about it, even in cold hard solids, many are malleable that you can hammer them to change shapes etc. </p>
<p>Further, solids themselves often have various other phase transitions before the phase transition to liquid state which we call melting. So in fact, melting is NOT all that special from a solid's point of view. For instance, water ice itself has various phases that it transitions through in colder/denser environments before it gets to the liquid phase. And in all of these cases, the same fundamental phenomenon is happening internally, in that the molecules are reorgnizing into a configuration that is most energetically stable at that given temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>Now regarding the 'bound' and 'unbound' stages, any molecule in a bound state that momentarily attains high enough energy will escape from the bound state to be unbound, and 'vaporize' into what we call gaseous stage. When this happens from liquids, we call it evaporation. When it happns from solids we call it sublimation, but it is the same phenomenon! Meaning that, there is always some 'vapor pressure' from these bound stages, whether it be some phase of solid, or liquid. </p>
<p>So looked at this way, the question is only about WHEN exactly the vapor pressure of a 'bound' stage reaches higher than the ambient pressure in that environment. If it is high enough when it is in a solid stage, then it will directly sublimate before/during any possible phase transition to liquid stage. </p>
<p>For instance, regular water ice has some 17 different solid phases, and for most of them, the only transition they can make is from one solid stage to another, but some 5 of those phases can transition into liquid phase, and some two of them can transition directly to gas phase, in some temperature and pressure conditions.</p>
<p>Caveat : Finally, its worth noting that although we talked of 'gas' being in fully unbound stage, of course there is some small amount of inter-molecular attraction there too, and this will become more relevant as we pack more and more molecules in a confined space at high pressure. If you keep reducing the effective intermolecular distance more and more in this way, eventually the behavior will become similar to liquids because practially they are no longer 'unbound' and this state is what we'd call reaching a super-critical fluid, where liquids and gas behavior merges, and there is only 'bound' behavior left.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One example of this is Ice losing it's mass to gas in the freezer over time.   Melting is a bulk phase change.   Liquids,  solids and gasses typically are related to the amount of energy of the substance.  When referring to a single molecule it's hard to say if it's liquid, solid or gas as easily.   If a single water molecule of an ice cube gains enough thermal energy to melt we wouldn't even notice it and would be very difficult to identify.  It would probably just re freeze by releasing that energy back into the cube or by some other process.  But we can see if a single molecule gains enough energy from the system to release itself from the cube.   It would then be a gas.  Effectively bypassing the &quot;liquid&quot;  phase. This of course brings up lots of technicalities like what is a gas or what is a liquid which I'm sure some people on here could elaborate on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that on average the poles do get less solar radiation than equatorial regions, but they still get quite a bit. </p>
<p>Wikipedia has a decently good description of the effect of the Earth's geometry on the variation in solar radiation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#Top_of_the_atmosphere" target="_blank">here</a>. The key result is summarized <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Insolation.png" target="_blank">in this diagram</a>. The top panel shows the total irradiance at the top of the atmosphere and the bottom shows how much light actually makes it to the surface. Now the top panel shows that the fact that the poles are always more angled away from the Earth-Sun axis, they get less power on average than the equatorial regions.</p>
<p>Still, to see if solar power is feasible in the arctic we should look at the bottom panel to get some real numbers. The second map shows that if on average you get about 200W/m^2 in say Brazil or the south US and about 100W/m^2 in some arctic regions. Now even 100W/m^2 is not <em>that</em> little. Moreover, these are yearly averages and as you point out in the case of the arctic, all of the radiation is concentrated during the summer. As a result, the actual numbers for the total irradiance during the summer would be even closer for say northern Canada and the the south US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, solar power is effective in the arctic summers. But the catch is that in the summers, northern latitudes don't need electricity. </p>
<p>Further south (but still above the equator,) solar power is golden. In the summer when it's hottest, you also get the most electricity for air conditioning and other daily demands. </p>
<p>But when you go further north, during the summers it might be between 60-80 degrees--the sort of day where you just open your door and use neither heat not cooling. </p>
<p>I live in southeast Alaska. I dearly want to install solar panels because my house is south-facing and gets blasted by sun. But I stop myself and do the math. </p>
<p>In the winters, I use $350/month in electricity to heat my home. But if I were to install solar panels on my roof (the half that gets sun at least) I would rake in $20-30 worth of solar power. Conversely, in the summer, my electric bills are ~$80, and solar power would generate $100+. So... When I don't NEED power, it's in abundance, and when I do need it, the sun provides less than 1/10th of what I use.</p>
<p>It just doesn't math out. Maybe in 10+ years the price of solar will come down enough to make this economical regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you keep it flat to the ground it won't get much power, but normally you make it face the sun. That said, the angle will mean it has more atmosphere to go through, so more light will be blocked. I'm not sure how big an effect that would make. In any case, the cost of building them in such a faraway place and sending the electricity so far will offset any gains. And it will be worthless in the Arctic winter, which is when you'd actually need power that far north.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly the universe is either finite or infinite, we don't know which.</p>
<p>If it's finite it either has borders or it doesn't, we don't know which.</p>
<p>You're assuming it has no borders. Meaning either it is infinite or it is finite but a closed loop. In other words the 3d shape of the universe curves through 4d space so that while the amount of space might be finite there is no edge.</p>
<p>If the universe is infinite then an object travelling forever in linear motion will just keep on getting further away.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite but unbounded then an object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but it depends on the topography. You might end up three feet to your initial left and draw out an infinite but never-repeating spiral. There are lots of ways <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/WhatIs/Infinity/Length-Area.shtml" target="_blank">to have an infinite curve on a finite plane</a></p>
<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded and topographically simple enough then yes object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but the object might not have enough time to do so. Even if the object is a photon it can only travel at the speed of light and the distance it has to travel is unknown but has to be at least many hundreds of billions of light years. And it is not guaranteed that the universe will last hundreds of billions of years.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded then the universe will probably end in a big crunch. How long this takes depends how big the universe is, but either way there probably isn't time to do a lap.</p>
<p>There's some theories that suggest that if there's enough dark energy in the universe then even if the universe is finite and unbounded the big crunch can still be avoided. So then we're racing against heat death. If the object is anything other than a photon it will decay within 10^100 years which might be enough time to do a lap of a small universe but nothing big, and even if its a photon it will decay (be annihilated) eventually.</p>
<p>Tl:dr depends how big and bendy your universe is but probably not.</p>
<p>Edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>thanks for gold</li>
<li>yes I meant topology, although I'm not 100% convinced that my usage of topography was totally wrong</li>
<li>I cheated/simplified a little by folding in the whole factor of if the universe is expanding and at what rate into the question of its infiniteness/shape but this doesn't make any substantive difference I can see to the answer to the question</li>
<li>Yes the universe probably is flat, and infinite/expanding so fast it is effectively infinite. But if that is the case then ops question becomes boring and trivial, so I'd rather explore some of the more interesting possibilities.</li>
<li>Thanks for all the comments, sorry I didn't reply to all of them but I tried to reply to most that weren't repeats. If I didn't reply to you it either means I missed you, I answered someone who was saying something similar, or your question had me so stumped I couldn't think of an answer.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a two-dimensional creature living in what it can only sense is a two-dimensional physical universe. What it cannot comprehend is that it actually lives on the surface of a massive three-dimensional sphere. It can never get to the center of its universe because the center is straight down, and up-and-down is a third physical dimension, one of which it is unable to comprehend because of its flat, two-dimensional nature. So, if it travels in a straight line (a great circle), it will return to the point of origin. And its universe is expanding, like a balloon blowing up. </p>
<p>I imagine the same is true of our universe, only with one extra dimension. We are three-dimensional beings living on the surface of a four+ dimensional universe (physicists posit that there are ten physical dimensions, but I have a hard time grokking it). So, if we travel in space in a single direction, we would also end up right back at Earth. And our universe is expanding with the center of expansion being along a dimension(s) of which we cannot conceive.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus mindfuck:</strong> As the two-dimensional creature's universe expands, the surface area of its universe increases. Each point on the sphere moves away from every other point on the sphere. New 2D space is created as the sphere expands. The same is true for our universe; as our three-dimensional universe expands, every point in space moves away from every other point, and new space is constantly being created.</p>
<p><strong>Super Bonus Mindfuck X-treme:</strong> &quot;Now&quot;...what you conceive of as the present moment...the center of your consciousness...is new time being created by the expansion of the universe in a similar way to how new space is being created.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If all we knew about the universe was that it has no boundaries, it would be impossible to answer your question. Maybe an object would return to its original starting place (if the universe is sufficiently small and doughnut or sphere like) or it would continue forever (if the universe is infinite).</p>
<p>But we do know more. Below I try to outline the logic best I can based on the evidence we have.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">We know, for example, that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.</a> So a star 90 billion lightyears away from us today will be further away in the future. </p>
<p>We also know the universe is a finite age: about 13.8 billion years. So a finite age, combined with a fixed speed of light means the universe <em>we can see</em> is definitely finite. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">It's the part of the universe from which light has had time to reach us in the last 13.8 billion years.</a> Since a point that was 13.8 billion lightyears away from us is now further away, due to expansion, the observable universe is wider than 13.8 billion lightyears. It's actually a sphere about 93 billion lightyears in diameter. </p>
<p>Finally, we know that, as best as we can measure, the curvature of space (as a <em>slice</em> of <em>spacetime</em>) is flat. Spacetime as a whole is curved, but a slice of space at a given time, on average over the whole universe that we can see is not. This tells us that the universe can have three shapes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Infinite and flat</li>
<li>The three-dimensional version of a doughnut, which can be flat (weirdly enough).</li>
<li>The three-dimensional version of a sphere, but <em>really</em> huge so that it looks flat to us. (Think about the surface of the Earth. From space it looks curved, but your bedroom looks flat.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of scenario 1, you travel forever. In the case of scenario 3, the universe is already too vast, a spaceship could not beat the expansion.</p>
<p>In the case of scenario 2, however, it might be possible for a spaceship going in a straight line to return to its original position. It would have to be traveling fast enough to beat the accelerating expansion of the universe, however. We know the radius of this torus must be larger than the observable universe because otherwise we'd see that stars on one side of the sky are the same as on  the other side of the sky. (Since tests of this have been done.) I don't have the numbers at the moment, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If most body parts are disproportionate, they fuck up your ability to do stuff like throw a spear or run from a predator. Stuff that would be important for early humans trying to stay alive and prove their worth as mates. If your dick is disproportionate, it doesn't impact those functions (unless it's just absurdly long, which is why there is an upper limit to what's possible), and for over 90% of human existence it didn't make a difference in your ability to have kids because it was the dudes who were the best at surviving who passed on their genes. Not the dudes who were the best at sex. Thus, we got a lot more variety in dicks than we got with most other body parts, because they didn't affect a dude's ability to not die or his ability to get laid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The variation is probably not as great as you may think, at least if you compare penis size to body mass, volume, or height. But aside from that, one of the biggest reasons for the variation of some traits - perhaps penis size, for instance - is a lack of, or very weak selection pressures. Although you may find some people to whom it matters, penis size really doesn't play a significant role at all when it comes to fitness. Evolutionarily speaking, fitness is defined as the ability of an organism to grow to maturity, reproduce, and have viable offspring. Penis size variation simply doesn't lead to that much variation in fitness. Even if there is a small number of annual births that occurred <em>only</em> because of penis size, the other factors affecting any one individual's reproductive fitness are likely making any selection for penis size rather insignificant.</p>
<p>This is why there seems to be such variation in height for modern males, particularly when compared globally. Male-female dichotomy for body size and canine size used to be significant, i.e. men used to be consistently significantly bigger than females, and had larger canines. This was when there was more male-male competition for mates, and more polygynous mating. You can still see this dichotomy in Gorillas and other of our ape relatives. After the move into modern times, selection pressures for large male body size and canine size were relaxed as things like weapons were invented and brain power became more important. As a result, the variation in male body size is quite large now, since the selection pressure has been relaxed, yet the genes for large bodies still exist in the population. Different ancestral human populations relaxed this selection pressure at different times, and so you can see more male-female dichotomy in certain groups of people than in others. Like how you see more variation in male body size in Northern Europeans than you do in East Asians. The Northern Europeans likely had to rely on larger bodies up until a more recent point in history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't that much variation. Or not as much as you'd think. From top Google result (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bju.13010/full" target="_blank">from a study of 15,000 men</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average erect penis length was 5.17 inches, or 13.12 centimeters. SD was 0.65 inches or 1.66 centimeters</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This translates to ~68% of men have length in the area of 4.52 to 5.82 inches.  ~16% are bigger than that, and ~16% are smaller than that. They created an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PHDnkcN.png" target="_blank">Nomogram </a> with their data.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Penises are a battleground. Just not for humans.</strong> tl;dr</p>
<p>Today I saw a math question tagged NSFW and a penis size question that is apparently family-friendly.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, I'd like to add a few notes to the excellent points raised by other posters. It's true that penis size in <em>humans</em> has not been selected for strongly, both because the size does not confer advantage, and because across its normal size range it does not confer a disadvantage.</p>
<p><em>But sex is what organisms live for</em>. Seriously. A living organism &quot;wants&quot; to spend the least amount of energy while passing along its genes most successfully.</p>
<p>So a lot of species out there <em>do</em> select for penises. Not just size but also function.</p>
<p>You hypothetical five-year-olds are in for a treat.</p>
<p><strong>Ducks</strong> [Slow-motion of duck penis](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch</a>? v=qwjEeI2SmiU) It's fast, it's corkscrewed, and it presented a <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/22/ballistic-penises-and-corkscrew-vaginas-the-sexual-battles-of-ducks/#.WGaD5RsrJEY" target="_blank">problem to researchers</a>. IIRC Dr. Brennan said that they switched to silicone fake vaginas because the glass vaginas would sometimes shatter.</p>
<p>And because ducks also need to fly, a lot of ducks lose weight after mating season by losing their penises. I lost my car keys this morning but it's hard to misplace a penis.</p>
<p><strong>Marine flatworms</strong> <em>Pseudobiceros bedfordi</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3xluIRh1Y" target="_blank">Penis fencing. En garde!</a> I love these guys. Hermaphrodites, chemosensing, lots of ovaries and a pair of penis-structures (stylets.) Making babies carries a necessary energy cost. Being a dad generally costs less, because dad can leave. Even in species that don't have parental care, laying eggs can be expensive. (Yes, this is a generalization, kids. You're five, I'm going to wave my hands a bit.)</p>
<p>When P. bedfordi meet, they rear up and each attempts to poke the other with a penis in a behavior termed &quot;fencing.&quot; If they make contact they will ejaculate onto the other's skin (syncytium, integument.) The ejaculator is male for today, the ejaculee is female. Sometimes they both hit home and play both roles.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter where the semen hits, because it will eat its way through the skin and the sperm will move toward one of the ovaries scattered throughout the body. These flatworms regenerate so the holes will be closed, but you can spot a newly expectant mom by her tattered appearance. Mom will soon lay fertile eggs.</p>
<p>But she has one more trick up her very strange sleeve. The ovaries are placed along her digestive canal. She recoups some of the energy cost by eating most of the semen.</p>
<p><strong>Cephalophods</strong> deserve special mention. These are squid, octopus, cuttlefish, argonaut, chambered nautilus. Their sperm are packaged into motile and mobile packets called &quot;spermatophores&quot; which burrow and move about like worms. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21834723" target="_blank">It can be a sushi hazard.</a> IIRC they're still not well understood. And anyhow they're delivered by a modified tentacle (hectocotylus) which, depending on the species, can be anything from an arm with a scoop shape and fewer suckers, all the way through a highly specialized bit that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonaut_\(animal\)?oldformat=true#Sexual_dimorphism_and_reproduction" target="_blank">detached and plugs the female's cavity.</a></p>
<p><strong>Speaking of plugs,</strong> there's a huge lot of adaptations designed to prevent sperm from leaking out of a female, or to prevent competitors from fertilizing a female, or to scrape out sperm deposited by a competitor who got there first.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of sneaky sex out there like the Midshipman fish type II male, and other kinds of reproductive strategies to make someone else bear the cost, like the varied shells of cuckoo eggs. There are also lots of other factors, such as how often do members of the species meet, like the angler fish, or whether their food supply has a boom and bust cycle.</p>
<p>I have to get some work done, but after a few beers I can go on for hours. It's even better with dry erase markers and a whiteboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Tombstones last longer than wooden crosses, but even stone erodes to illegibility. And how to convey the location of the stone to a mobile population (now globally)? Songs tend to last, but even they get fuzzy and changed. Carl Sagan sent out the planet's info on a disk made of gold because it doesn't corrode. But first someone's gotta find it, and then they have to understand the writing &amp; meaning. My favorite thought exercise is the real problem of warning people for the next 10,000 years not to dig up buried radioactive waste. How can you ever ensure the info will survive that long?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The entire point of burying the tomb somewhere in the desert was to prevent thieves from raiding it.  They were deliberately concealed to make it harder to tomb looters to find.  This is part of the reason King Tut's tomb was so valuable - it was literally the only tomb that hadn't already been robbed.</p>
<p>Also, something to keep in mind is that the Egyptian civilization lasted around 3100 years (if you measure it from Narmer to Cleopatra VII).  That is a <em>long damn time</em> and the average person of that period was not exactly renowned for their skills in literacy.</p>
<p>A few more points:</p>
<p>(1) Tut reigned around 1300 BC.  That makes him older than the Trojan War, and people are still arguing over whether <em>that</em> was even a real thing.</p>
<p>(2) Tut was not &quot;the most important thing to any Egyptian.&quot;  The only reason we remember him today was because his tomb was recovered intact.  Tut was not an important King.  Compared to other pharaohs, he was practically a footnote.  The average Egyptian peasant probably didn't know, or even <em>care</em>, who he was or where he was buried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>War.</p>
<p>Empires transitioning/collapsing/being sacked/etc. was kind of a huge problem back before the printing press was invented. Books (the #1 method of remembering shit until fairly recently) were painstaking, expensive, and extremely time-consuming to make. And even then, with so many scribes that could be working, you have to consider how a massive majority of the industry revolved around printing one thing and really one thing only: religious texts. So, a lot of things that they needed more copies of may have been put on the wayside while they met demand for churches and other important organizations. The fact that the church had a huge control over literature for a long period didn't help with maintaining consistency either.</p>
<p>So 'alchemy' and chemistry formulas, like the true composition of &quot;Greek Fire&quot;, blueprints and building secrets, medical procedures, agricultural works, etc. etc. that were handmade, hand-copied, hand-bound, and kept mostly all in one place (large scholarly libraries, which were not very common...) would get lost by fire, theft, smashed into the rubble, or deliberately destroyed in order to keep the information out of the belligerents' hands (which is sort of okay if the guy who wrote or provided for it was still alive, which may not always be true). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I was wondering about the failure mechanism of most of the drops. It seems like the drop weathered the bullet strike, but the force that it absorbed resulted in the tip of it breaking off somehow. Was this due to the transfer of force along the drop, or was it from it being suspended by the tip on the line and the bullet jostled it enough to cause it to break?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, volume is pretty easy.  Most of these bodies are roughly ellipsoid, so once you have a couple of basic dimensions, like major and minor radii, you can pretty easily calculate the volume.</p>
<p>Weight, on the other hand, is usually just a way to represent the mass of the object in terms easier for people to understand.  After all, these bodies are all in free fall, so their mass is the relevant metric.  This can be estimated by applying our general knowledge of the composition of celestial bodies, but it's also extremely common to measure the gravitational interactions between bodies to estimate their size - gravity is, after all, a product of mass.  When we describe a celestial body as &quot;weighing&quot; a certain amount, it's usually just what it would weigh in standard Earth gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given how far it is and how big it is in the sky we can find the volume of a star easily. It's just the volume of the sphere.</p>
<pre><code>
The mass of the star is a bit harder to find. Fortunately, stars lie in a (somewhat) narrow mass range depending on what type of star it is and what color it is (this is due to 5 very messy nested differential equations). If you are not familiar with the H-R graph, it plots the luminosity of a bunch of stars against its color. 

The actual calculation of the mass has a lot of assumptions and computational methods involved. Basically a main sequence star has three significant regions: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. The central density and temperature of the core is assumed to be at a density and temperature range where Hydrogen (or helium) fusion is allowed (which is surprisingly narrow). The radiative zone and the convective zones both have a cut-off point. Using surface temperature, luminosity and a bunch of complicated math, we can figure out the change in density in radius, which we can then find the mass because we know the volume.

Again, most people just use a simplication because it turns out for at least for stars *in the main sequence*, the mass of the stars pretty much determines "what color/size/brightness" they are. This means we can guess how massive the star is just by its color. It makes sense since the way stars form are pretty standardized, and most of the variables regarding their creation are pretty unchanged except for mass. Think of starmaking as a stellar "machine" with one adjustable "knob".

Unfortunately, a lot of the variables themselves within the equations are assumed, like the central density of the star and the cutoff points of the zones. That's why we have such a high uncertainty for stellar masses.

<p>It gets much easier if we have a star orbiting a &quot;standardized&quot; stellar object like a white dwarf, a neutron star or other &quot;stellar candles&quot;. This is because all we need to know about the system is the mass of the stellar object and its orbital mechanics. White dwarves and neutron stars are by &quot;design&quot; in a VERY narrow mass range. Their mass is also pretty easy to calculate, since they are usually elemental. We then use those stars to set &quot;standards&quot; for what each star of that specific color should be in the range of.</p>
