		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A compass is problematic, because they are designed to work with gravity.  At the center of the magnetic needle is a cup, and that cup rests on a support needle.  You have to hold the compass level, so that the needle can swing freely.  If you are off-level, the needle will jam or drag on the housing. Essentially, compasses only works in a single plane.  However, in the microgravity environment of Earth orbit, there is nothing to keep the magnetic needle from drifting off of the support needle and jamming against the housing.  There is no way to hold it so that the needle is constrained to pivot on the support needle.  So, you will not get accurate results.</p>
<p>However, if you just let a bar magnet float free, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_uKt2i2jvc" target="_blank">like they did on the International Space Station</a>, it will align itself with the strongest magnetic field.  In general, this will be the Earth's field unless a stronger magnet is closer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are talking about traditional compasses, and they're right as long as we limit ourselves to those types, but there's 2 types which are far more useful, especially if you want to bring them into space.</p>
<p>1- Ship compasses, which are designed to rotate freely in all directions, allowing the compass to maintain a fairly accurate (minus shaking) bearing even in rough seas (this solves the issue of trying to keep the compass level enough to have it spin properly when you're ascending/descending waves). This sort of compass would point along the strongest magnetic field in it's local area (so in the ISS it would point north, unless you brought a stronger magnet nearer)</p>
<ol>
<li>Electric compasses, which function in many different ways, but generally do the same thing as type 1, just without using a free swiveling magnet. Ergo they would direct you to the strongest local magnetic attraction. One benefit of these is that they can function under much lower strengths. Therefore they could point along the suns magnetic field, or even the galactic field if you took them out of the solar system</li>

If you were relatively close to Earth, it would still point to the North Pole.    If you approached another planet with a magnetic field (Mars, for example, does not have one) it would point in the direction of it's north pole.  If you weren't close enough to a planet, it would point to the Sun's north pole.  Get far enough away from our solar system and it would either point at the center of our galaxy, or spin aimlessly if the magnetic field generated by our galaxy isn't strong enough to attract it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Many of these comments are somewhat right, but a big piece of the puzzle is missing.  Yes, PTSD sucks ass, but most of us manage/channel/and/or don't have it.  Most vets haven't seen combat, contrary to some of these posts.  The worst a lot of people have seen/heard is a mortar impact.  The training, while getting better (IMHO. I received a lot of &quot;life experience credits&quot; for a Bachelor's coming from a combat MOS), still has a lot of catching up to do as pointed out.  It is <em>extremely</em> hard to adjust to civ life after being in for some people, especially after multiple tours overseas.  This is where I believe the missing piece is. Institutionalization.  Having such routine, discipline, and structure attached to everything is difficult to part from.  Going from that to being able to grow your freedom beard (or, should I say &quot;allowed&quot; to emphasize the point) is kind of mind blowing.  Purpose and duty to mundane and boring AF is a brutal change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here's a couple pro-tips for vets.</p>
<p>Have you ever signed for anything (of course you have) then you &quot;successfully managed and maintained equipment valued at (whatever cost...HMMWVs are about a quarter million bucks BTW)&quot;</p>
<p>Ever had to teach a class (you probably did) then you've &quot;successfully trained and prepared x number of personnel&quot;</p>
<p>Ever lead a detail or held a leadership position? Then you &quot;supervised x number of employees&quot;</p>
<p>Shit like that.</p>
<p>I put all this crap on my resume and got a job before my terminal leave was even over so I think I'm decent at spinning the army crap into relateable BS.  Then when you get the job work your ass off, civilians are fucking lazy and everyone is used to that so if you actually fucking work you're automatically in the top percentage of quality employees</p>
<p>Edit:  if anyone wants, inbox me and I'll help you spin your military shit into something real too</p>
<p>And another pro-tip for like everyone...print your resume on different color paper.  Like a subtle difference than plain white, nothing crazy but when there's a stack and the guy sees one that's slightly more blue or whatever he might pull it out first.. which is good</p>

Did a hitch in Air Force as avionics maintainer- and was told i needed to go back to school for four more years at cost of 80-90 thousand per and also pay for the Airframe and Powerplant Licence before i could touch an aircraft.Did second hitch in the Army as Combat Engineer/Diesel and Construction Maintainer- as was told the same crap upon exit even though i SPECIALIZED in construction equipment(CAT) i &quot;didn't know SH*T&quot; and would cost top much to train- pay my own way- and NO GI Bill wouldn't cover it all- so no good job- no schooling - GI Bill wasted- and here i sit doing what work i'm &quot;qualified&quot; for..... plumbing manufacturing- got my training records- cost Uncle Sam 800,000 plus for all that training- and i pull down less than 30k a year.

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider a simple system of a 1 degree of freedom spring-mass/damper oscillator. When solving the differential equation that represents the equation of motion, we often get results that decay to a limit of 0 due to an exponential--i.e. overdamping, underdamping, and critical damping.</p>
<p>I was wondering, do these ever truly go to zero? I realize it's most likely similar to cutting something in half over and over again trying to get to zero mass, but at SOME point you hit subatomic particles and can't get anywhere. So do we know of a point at which oscillations seem to stay at a constant value very near zero?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just going expand on the zero part, but you can answer this question just by saying that the energy eventually leaves and normalizes the system (whatever that normal state is). But going to zero actually means something else, you can think of all systems, and how you measure values from those systems in the following way:</p>
<p>Depending on which model you are working with, the average measurement can APPROACH zero. If you take for example energy in a system, lets say KE, then your average measurement can be zero. By the nature of riemann sums and the fundamental theorem of calculus, you know that you are taking the sum of parts. The parts are never zero, but their sums can be. The measurements reflect some sum. If you are ever able to measure a part independently, you would never get a 0 measurement within a system (unless it is relative to it self). Even if its completely ordered with no entropy (an impossible system even at abs 0). By the nature of measurements, it would be a force relative to something. None of our current models allow it to be zero. Only in theory can a non-summed zero measure exist. In practice, that zero measurement would be relative to another force, and thus explicitly non-zero.</p>
<p>We thus only know the part up to the smallest measurement, and breaking it down any further is theoretical. You pick your model and based on that model you can take a measurement and break it down into the smallest defined possibility for that model. In simplest terms, if you find that the KE of a 2 particle system is some arbitrary value 4. If your model for this system predicts equal distribution of energy between particles  then you can use that to do &quot;math&quot; on the measurement of &quot;4&quot; and arrive at 2 per particle (although you never measured that 2, you measured its sum). Similarly, now with that value of 2 you can use a model for that one particle and arrive at how the KE is distributed within the particle etc etc.</p>
<p>Engineers that do signal processing for example use Fourier analysis to break down signal wave forms into their fundamentals based on knowns, measurements  and theory. Each step allows you to get further. However, once you move beyond measurements of parts, you are basically breaking down the sums using the model for that system. Its really powerful. It might not be the &quot;true value&quot; but it is consistent if the model you apply is consistent. So our smallest calculated value can be non-real but still be a defined consistent output. Weirdly enough, this calculated value can be 0. But the measurements leading up to it can never be zero. Or if you prefer, it can also be said as ~ there is no way to measure something unless it is relative to another thing, even if that thing is a purely theoretical value. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conservation of energy says if you put some energy into a system, it either stays there, or crosses the boundary again somehow, but you got that energy somewhere else, and it certainly still exists <em>somewhere</em>.  In most of the situations you'll encounter, it will leave the system as heat after being damped out by some resistance, or friction, or some such.</p>
<p>I had a professor who liked to say &quot;Models have limitations; stupidity does not.&quot;  When you calculate the differential equations, you're modeling the system.  You're excluding dozens of damping mechanics and higher order terms that contribute to the system's operation.  In your example, you have already considered damping - this is not a sink, but a radiator of energy via heat.  You're essentially transforming displacement energy into heat via friction.  Oscillation requires energy!</p>
<p>Using a different example, an LC tank circuit would theoretically appear to oscillate forever at its natural frequency after being charged, but in reality any inductor or capacitor you used to build it would also include equivalent series resistance, and parasitic components that are generally not accounted for by a simple 'L' and 'C'.  The unaccounted for resistances would dissipate the energy as heat, which is then transferred across the boundary of the system to the environment.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  That punch has been an unnoticeable part of our common experience since you damped it out in your muscles and radiated the heat through your skin to the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

But certain <em>portions</em> of the spectrum, allocated by agreement to specific purposes can and do &quot;fill up&quot;.  In that case, new national and possibly international regulations have to be written to reallocate portions of the spectrum involved.</p>
<p>Each portion of the [Radio Frequency Spectrum] (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum</a>) from 3 Hz. to 3000 GHz.

<p>The drafting, revision and adoption of the Radio Regulations is the responsibility of the World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) of the ITU, meetings of which are typically held every three or four years, most recently in Geneva in 2012.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We would suffer congestion, that's all.  If it got  bad enough, we'd adjust something, as usual.  </p>
<p>Spectrum is sort of finite, but not all communications have to be wireless.  And because of propagation, a lot of spectrum can be geographically repeated....  we did this (and still do) with the AM radio and FM radio bands.  We did it with cellular radio in the AMPS mobile phone strategy.  </p>
<p>A lot of data is low bandwidth.  A lot of data is carried on wires or can be shifted to wires and have only short distances covered by wireless.    There's directional methods, too, where antenna polarization is used to send separate signals on the same carrier frequency, as was done (and still is) on satellites.  </p>
<p>The  spectrum keeps getting bigger, and more efficient, too.   Digital signal processing (DSP) lets us put thousands of digital carriers on a single signal, and signals can co-exist on the same frequency using spread spectrum techniques.  </p>
<p>A lot depends on a lot, so to get better responses, maybe expand your question a little?  What's your concern?  Did you read somewhere that we're running out of spectrum?   Or is this just a general question?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We won't ever run out of space on the radio frequency spectrum, per se.  Instead, the radio frequency spectrum, or parts of it, will become over-saturated with signals.  Over-saturation causes the fidelity of the signals to decrease - i.e. what is received matches what was sent less and less.</p>
<p>There is a band of frequencies where this has sort of happened and there are a TON of things that are done to work around it.  That band of frequencies is around 2.4 GHZ which can be used without a license.  Here's just a few of the things in that band: </p>
<ul>
<li>Microwave ovens</li>
<li>Wireless Home Phones</li>
<li>Wifi</li>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we can't see radio signals, the best way to visualize everything is to think of light.  A basic radio signal is like an incandescent light bulb - casting light in all directions a short distance.  Saturation would be like having too many light bulbs on in one place.</p>
<p>One method of dealing with saturation is shielding.  Microwave ovens so that it can cook your food better.  In our light analogy, this would be like putting the light bulb in a room so that we can see the light when in the room but not outside the room.</p>
<p>Another method is limiting power to what is needed.  Your wireless home phone only needs to work within the confines of your home.  Your bluetooth devices only needs to work within the confines of your person.  For both devices, the power is set to work well in the expected range and that's it.  In the light analogy, this would be like having a dimmer switch so that you can adjust the amount of light to what you need and no more.</p>
<p>Modulation of frequency, amplitude, and/or phase.  Wifi makes use of all these type of modulation.  When the signal is good (little/no interference), it can combine these to deliver information faster.  When the signal is not a good (minor/major interference), it can use these to deliver information with more fidelity.  The reason these method can work better with interference is because the signal is encoded in the modulation rather than the radio wave itself.  In our light analogy, this would be like everyone having white flashlights and using colored flashlights for communication.</p>
<p>Directional transmission is another way of handling saturation.  Cell phone towers typically have 3 directional antennas that each cover 120 degrees.  The main reason to do this was to handle 3 times the signal with each tower.  The other reason was that directional antennas can transmit further because they are more focused.  In our light analogy, this would be like using flashlights instead of incandescent bulbs or lasers instead of flashlights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question, because in the U.S. we are about to have a major restructuring of the band of frequencies between 600 and 698 MHz, mandated by Congress. This affects primarily television broadcasters and wireless microphone users. What is most likely to happen is that more efficient digital technologies will be developed &amp; used for each type of service, meaning each type of service used (individual tv channels, microphones, etc) will require a significantly smaller slice of spectrum than prior technologies. For instance, wireless mic manufacturer Shure has developed a technology that will allow you to run 47 (wow!) digital wireless microphones in just 6 MHz of radio spectrum. That's an impossible number-vs-spectrum with traditional analog wireless microphones. The trade-off is distance: it's short-range, i.e. ~30 meters, IIRC. But that's plenty for most applications. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What doping does in those systems is create conditions under which a junction between two semiconductors can be made to conduct electricity. In other words, it can be switched between a zero state, or a one state. But without the doping, the materials used, like silicon, are semiconductors on their own. Being a semiconductor means simply that the electrons living inside those materials can never have certain values of their energy. Imagine they can have any value between 0 and 1 (in some unit of energy), or any value between 2 and 3, but they can't have values between 1 and 2. That part of the energy spectrum is known as the energy gap. Basically, if you put electrons in all states from 0 to 1, you cannot put another one in a state of energy 1.0001, for example. The next available energy for that extra electron is 2, so you have to provide one entire unit of energy to bring that electron into your material.</p>
<p>That's precisely what happens when you transport electricity: you connect metallic cables to your sample, and you apply a voltage to bring electrons from your battery, through one cable, into the sample, then out through the other cable and back to the battery. But if you need to provide 1 unit of energy, and your battery can only provide, say, half a unit, then you cannot bring electrons into the sample (there are no states for those energies!), and current can't pass through it. That's what being a semiconductor is all about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't necessarily have to be doped. Doping allows the creation of diodes, certain types of transistors and devices. A semiconductor is defined by having a specific bandgap. Insulators are materials that have a large separation between the valence and conduction band so it would be difficult for electrons to get excited and move into the conduction band. Conductors usually have lots of electrons in the conduction band and the valence band can overlap the conduction band meaning it'll easily be conductive. For semiconductor it's somewhere in between and a few electrons can reach the conduction band.
The most basic is semiconductor is silicon based and you can manipulate its behavior by adding dopants such as in the diode or silicon mosfet.
One example is a transistor that doesn't have to use doped material is a Gallium Nitride High electron mobility transistor (HEMT). Essentially you have a small layer of AlGaN on top of GaN and due to the lattice mismatch it causes a stress on the interface which causes a piezoelectric polarization thereby creating a 2 dimensional electron gas channel like with regular silicon mosfets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semiconductors are simply materials which <em>can</em> be doped to make Electronic Devices based off of those materials. Usually doping(in Silicon based devices) involves using Silicon which has been laced with impurities to produce the pn junctions you speak of. Silicon by itself is an intrinsic semiconductor and it's not capable of being used as is in devices. </p>
<p>Nowadays, for MOSFETs(Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), we use Compound Semiconductors which are made out of different materials altogether. For example Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is used because it can give us better conduction characteristics and produce faster devices. Another one, as has been pointed out below is AlGaN(Aluminum Gallium Nitride) which is used in cases where we need extremely high mobility (speed of movement) of electrons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that MOSFETs form the basis of Very Large Scale Integrated circuits which are the basis of chip fabrication technology today.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be an intrinsic semiconductor?</p>
<p>You can take a pure silicon wafer and it's still considered a semiconductor. Mostly this regular silicon can't be used as it is because we need a charge imbalance to induce current flow. This is done by doping two pieces of silicon and joining them to form the pn junction you talked about. I hope the internal process of doping is something you've understood well already.</p>
<p>A device with only 1 pn junction is a diode. We can alter the doping concentrations of the p and n type substrates (surfaces) to produce different devices. For example Zener diodes use imbalances in doping concentrations to produce the reverse breakdown characteristics they use to control voltage.</p>
<p>We can keep adding these junctions and tweaking their doping to form more intricate and useful devices. A common purpose device with 2 pn junctions is a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). An SCR(silicon controlled rectifier) is a device which has 3 pn junctions. These are old devices compared to the technology we have today. I'm currently doing my undergrad in Ee so these are the devices I'm mostly familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We could have taken them to small claims court and gotten our money... we could have reclaimed our installed items... we could have put a lien on their property... but in the long run we made more by letting some things slide, giving discounts, and keeping them happy - because we got to keep their other projects and contracts.</p>
<p>This was also terribly frustrating because the most ignorant, assholish, objectively douche-baggiest people in the tri-state area got five fingered discounts on tons of stuff while good customers paid their bills in full. </p>

<p>It took them 6 months to return the money to me.  After the first month of getting no where by calling and escalating, I served them with a notice of claim for the $1500 plus interest at 1.5% monthly after the first 30 days (industry standard).  </p>
<p>3 days before the small claims trial date I got a call from someone at UPS offering me the $1500.  I told them I want interest and my filing fee, or we go to court.  They put me on hold for about 5 minutes, and then came back asked me where I wanted the settlement agreement and cheque couriered to.  </p>
<p>Usually businesses can get away with not paying late fees on their mistakes because customers don't take a business like approach to keeping records.<br />
If a business kept their credit ledger on post-it notes by the phone, they wouldn't be collecting much interest on their overdue accounts either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Used to run a computer repair company. If this was a thing it would have killed us. Repair were often late because of unforeseen circumstances. Best possible intentions, skilled staff, great suppliers. Airtight workflow. Even with all that in place shit happens that you have no control over. That's why t&amp;c is a must. The way it works from a business perspective is, if you have to spend more time on a repair, you are losing money anyway. The reason is because your labour resource is tied up on costs that can't be recouped by the charges and that resource then is not available to work on something that would earn. It's just the cost of doing business, and is factored in. However, if you put additional 'fines' on this systemically, one of two things would have to happen. 1 the business would not be profitable any longer and have to close. Or, 2, the business would have to raise their charges on all services to cover the shortfall, and I'm talking by a lot. In the first instance, everyone loses, because no service. In the second instance, consumers lose because it costs them a fuck ton more money for the same thing UNLESS there is a problem. So if you see where this is going, in the problem scenario the customer might end up only having to pay what they would have paid anyway in the system where the fines didn't exist, while all the other customers are paying via additional fees for getting work done on time. Either way you look at it it's unsustainable because the money has to come from somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regular matter is made of atoms. And every atom has a nucleus, made of protons and neutrons. Some nuclei are <em>unstable</em>, meaning that they decay. When a nucleus decays, it emits radiation.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of nuclear radiation. Some examples are alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, protons, neutrons, conversion electrons, fission fragments, clusters, and more. These are generally <em>ionizing</em> radiation, which means that the particles have enough energy to break chemical bonds or knock electrons out of atoms. This is the kind of radiation that can cause cancer. The radiation emitted by a phone or a WiFi router is <strong>not</strong> ionizing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is happening to our body when radiation gives us cancer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a very basic level, ionizing radiation damages your DNA. This causes mutations which can lead to cancer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we use radiation therapy to cure cancer when it also gives us cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ionizing radiation can be used to kill cells. If you point your beam of radiation at cancerous cell, it will kill them. We have sophisticated techniques to specifically target the cancerous tissue with beams of radiation. The treatment kills cancerous tissue while delivering a much smaller dose to the surrounding healthy tissue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It also seems a property of it is that you can't really stop it - it seems like putting up walls or barriers is not effective unless they are ridiculously thick, and even then it seems like we just do that because we don't really know what else to do and it's better than nothing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't stop radioactive nuclei from decaying, but you can certainly shield against radiation. Different types of radiation are easier to stop than others. For example, alpha particles are very easy to stop with a piece of paper, or even just a few inches of air. On the other hand, fast neutrons are much harder to stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit to /u/RobusEtCeleritas's nice coverage:</p>
<p>The reason some types of radiation are so penetrating is that those types have no electric charge, so they don't interact very often with matter.  This includes x-rays and gamma rays, which are just high-energy forms of light, and neutrons, which are one of the particles that make the nuclei of atoms.</p>
<p>To focus on the x-rays and gamma rays, while they don't interact very often with matter, when they do interact they tend to dump most of their energy into it at once.  So we just need to make the shielding thick enough so that most of the radiation will hit something.</p>
<p>As an example: for the high-energy x-rays used in radiation therapy, about 40 cm of concrete will stop 90% of x-rays.  Another 40 cm will beef that up to 99%, another 40 cm 99.9%, and so on.  Usually in radiation therapy vaults, the main shielding is concrete about 200 cm (6 feet) thick, which will stop 99.999% of the radiation, which is enough to make working outside the vaults quite safe.</p>
<p>This is all a very well-understood science, and experts such as Health Physicists and Medical Physicists exist to make sure radiation can be used safely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's start with nuclear radiation is neither bad nor good it simply is. </p>
<p>Radiation is a natural phenomenon that happens in the universe it powers the stars, and thus the plants and and all life on earth. </p>
<p>Radiation can come from many sources through natural decay, everything decays you me, the air, that rock over there everything. What that means is that some parts of the core of an atom called the nucleus breaks apart from the atom and escapes. This for most element doesn't happen very often, we however know that half of will decay in the same amount of time as the rest of it. </p>
<p>We consider something radioactive when it decays at a rate which is high. </p>
<p>What radiation is, is complicated. But as you assumed there are different types of radiation out there. </p>
<p>Let talk about the major different kinds of radiation. </p>
<p>Alpha radiation means a helium core (consisting of two protons and two neutrons) escapes a larger atom. Notice how I say the core because alpha particles have no electrons, and thus have a charge. </p>
<p>Beta radiation is a type of decay inside the protons or neutrons that release a electron (or a positron) and neutrino (elementary particle) in essence it what's happens when a neutron and proton change into one another they release a beta wave. </p>
<p>A Gamma ray is electromagnetic discharge from excited atoms coming back to normal States, they have very high energy. Gamma rays also tend to penetrate most objects they are the rays that the large walls are really protecting you from as almost anything can block an alpha ray and it takes very little to block a beta rays. </p>
<p>Now what does all this mean? It means that radiation comes from processes that are changing the core and thus element of an atom. When atoms changes into one another, they use fusion (two small make one big) or they fission (one big makes two small). It also means that these radiations at certain levels are capable of marking other atoms decay. </p>
<p>Now when we are talking about nuclear energy we are talking about controlling this decay. Because these things have a weird property, when you add all the mass from before the decay and then add up all the mass after they don't equal each other, some of the mass was turned into energy this energy is carried by the alpha, beta or gamma ray (and many times all three). We can use this energy to turns a magnet which creates electricity in a turbine. Basically we take elements that are already have a high rate of decay and then we send in some focused rays to cause them to start decaying enough that it creates a chain reaction of atoms splitting and there splitting parts being used to make more of the split and so on. </p>
<p>When we are talking about bombs we means we cause a lot of decay to happen as close to instantaneously as we can and thus making the release of energy high and explosive. We basically crush the particles so that they end up so compact they have no other choice but to run into each other, which causes the chain reaction in much more spectacular and less controlled form. </p>
<p>Radiation is dangerous because they can change the structures of other atoms, through enough radiation at a nuclear cell and some of the cells will start to have serious problem because the atoms and molecules will have changed structure, which means they won't act the way the cell wants them to anymore, they will decay. </p>
<p>One should mention nothing is going to make you or anything else more radioactive. You won't become suddenly start b OMG radioactive more because you experience radiation (the radiation may affect you in a certain way but not in that way), you are already giving off radiation just at a rate so small it doesn't matter. You however can become contaminated, meaning cover in a radioactive material (usually meaning in a fine dust or somehow soaked in it) you are not radioactive you are contaminated with radioactive elements. So no you won't start flowing and nor will anything else. </p>
<p>Now certain types of tissue for various reason are more affected than others and some are most affected by certain types of radiation rather than others.</p>
<p>This is much more complicated than this and is meant to be an introduction there are whole courses on the affects, causes and sources of just alpha radiation. And so a reddit post isn't exactly going to explain everything or truly explain it accurately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some nuclei are unstable, which means they have a probability of disintegrating, and thus some natural rate of disintegrating. When they disintegrate there tends to be energy &quot;left over&quot; which results in highly energetic decay products. If a nucleus is excited then it can release gamma rays (high energy photons) as it settles down. Or, the nucleus might emit a high energy electron (beta particle) or anti-electron (positron) in the decay. Or it might release an alpha particle, or a neutron, or a proton, or something else. <em>That</em> is radiation. Particles or photons &quot;radiating&quot; out of matter containing unstable nuclei.</p>
<p>Due to the extraordinary number of atoms in even mundane amounts of matter even an incredibly low probability of disintegration can translate to a rate of disintegrations and an amount of &quot;radiation&quot; generated that can range from merely detectable to hazardous. When a particle or photon of &quot;radiation&quot; hits other matter it can deposit its energy into an atom/molecule that it hits. This can ionize atoms (which is where it gains the name &quot;ionizing radiation&quot;), break atomic bonds, and effectively destroy molecules. Because organisms are based on molecular machinery and molecular media for genetic information storage the destruction of molecules can wreak havoc on the proper functioning of a cell.</p>
<p>Radiation can kill you outright by effectively killing enough of the cells in organs you need to live. It can also cause mutations across a huge number of cells, one of which might result in a cell becoming dangerously cancerous, which may or may not kill you years in the future. Non-lethal levels of radiation can also potentially be used beneficially. The basic concept is twofold. One is that by moving a radiation beam around it's possible to sweep it over healthy areas of the body (reducing the individual exposure levels there) while at the same time keeping it held on cancerous areas (increasing the exposure levels there). The other is that because cancerous cells are abnormal they are potentially more vulnerable to being killed through damage than healthy cells, so by damaging both it's hoped that the cancerous cells will be killed off while the healthy cells and organs will be able to recover (this is the same basic principle as chemotherapy, to some degree).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will probably be burried, but here it is.
I have a studio art degree from a public university with an emphasis in oils. I was in school just a few years ago.
When we began our photorealism classes, the professors taught us the  technique of copying pictures, detail for detail.
Painting from life and painting from image, are very different.
Now, I hope this captures the spirit of ELI5, because I havent studied the human eye or how image transfer works in the human brain.
We see in three dimensions, right? So when we look at a real life model we see every detail of the light against that three dimensional form. But to capture all of that in a TWO dimensional form is rather difficult. So I was taught to &quot;cheat&quot; at first. By painting from a photo, technology that didnt exist during the Renaissance, my eye is now translating a two dimensional figure into another two dimensional figure. Why this is easier for the human eye, I don't know. But from experience, it's definitely much easier to paint a convincingly photorealistic image from a picture over doing it from a real life person. </p>
<p>And in response to the comment about the paintings not necessarily looking photorealistic, and instead just looking like &quot;Renaissance&quot;...you're half right.</p>
<p>The masters of the Renaissance respected the human form and got as close to life-like as possible. Photorealism (a term coined much later, at the turn of the century) was the holy grail. It meant more money, the more life-like the commissions became. In their minds, there was nothing better than the natural human form, nothing more beautiful, save perhaps their paintings of it. But they also glorified the human form much like the Greeks did before them. So the human figure was made to look much more lavish, much more exquisite, than it really was. (Some masters admittedly added more musculature to their sculptures and paintings than was anatomically correct.) And there were many iterations of this concept, a noteable contributer being Sir Reubens (the one that painted his ladies nice, rosy, robust, and chubby.)
So yeah, it was supposed to look even more beautiful than the natural form, but photorealism was absolutely a goal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern artists can achieve photorealism because they are copying from photos.</p>
<p>Photographs are images captured by a device. The capabilities and settings on the device determine how the image will appear - change the settings slightly and you'll get a very different image. Therefore, a photograph is not explicit reality but a version of it captured in a certain moment, under certain conditions, at a certain angle, by a certain device with certain settings (selected by a human, which is why you should reconsider photos/video as a kind of objective reality in the first place - think about this when watching the news or Youtube).</p>
<p>Go outside and take a photo. Now look at the scene with your eye and compare it to the photo. You should be able to notice differences.</p>
<p>Now come back an hour later and look at the same scene with your eye. At minimum the light has changed, objects might have moved, cloud cover changed, etc.</p>
<p>Consider that creating a detailed painting takes many hours. </p>
<p>Consider that while the artist is working, the conditions of the scene will change.</p>
<p>Consider that when working from a photo, nothing changes. Even the conditions under which the artist views the photo itself do not change since we have the luxury of electronic artificial light.</p>
<p>When working from a photograph, the artist is copying a vision captured by a machine; when working from reality, the image produced is built directly from the impressions of a human without the mechanical middle-man.</p>
<p>So: which method represents reality more accurately as a <em>human perceives it</em>? Of course, the question itself only leads to more questions ;)</p>
<p>My background: I have a degree in fine arts and prefer to paint in oils. I use photographs as a reference for anatomy, proportion, colour but build the image according to whatever imagination inspired it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Don't forget as well that painter in that time was much more of a craft than an art - painters needed to earn enough to eat and sometimes that meant fudging things to suit the vanity of the subject/comissioner which necessarily adds some distortion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your comparison with trompe l'oeil masterpieces is not comparing like for like really. You can't compare a pencil drawing to oil painting as the medium affects the end result and oil paint is quite a thick viscous material that does not really lend itself to fine details in the way that a pencil or ballpoint does.</p>
<p>I also think the increase in realism over the centuries has two causes, one is that as technique improves the next &quot;great&quot; artist has to up their technique to be successful in the same way that Olympic records are broken for a more mundane example.</p>
<p>The second change is technology and scientific discovery, as human knowledge and technology changes human perception changes too.   As printing improved and photography appeared peoples perception of realism changed to match the level of detail these new techniques brought with them. For us in the modern age it is for example quite normal to think of a picture being made up of small dots or pixels but if someone were to think in that way in the 17th century would of been quite unique.</p>
<p>On another level it is debatable if level of detail equates to quality, a high level of detail at worst is only a indication of a certain level of craftsmanship and not a automatic indication of artistic merit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
