		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laundry gets clean via the <em>forcing of detergent water and rinse water through the fibers repeatedly</em>. Eventually a build up of minerals from water accumulates in and around fibers, trapping dirt inside. This interferes with the cleaning process, especially with hard water. Towels feel scratchy as a result, so you resort to adding fabric softener. Fabric softener can accumulate in fibers too. A cup of vinegar added to rinse water will help prevent mineral build up and keep your laundry soft. You might even want to allow the vinegar to agitate and mix well into the rinse water and soak everything for 30 minutes. Don't worry, any residual vinegar smell will be gone when the laundry is dry. A vinegar rinse will help inhibit the growth of mold and mildew, which is what you smell in the thrift store. Sunlight kills microbes, so try hanging your blankets outdoors in the sunshine before storing them away. Store in a old pillow case on a ventilated shelf or buy a bedding storage bag with a zip closure. Don't pack things too tightly in your closet or in a box. Ventilation is your friend. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know because pi is an irrational number. More to the point, we know it is not a rational number.</p>
<p>(warning, math ahead)</p>
<p>A rational number is one that can be represented as a ratio of two integers. For any repeating or terminating decimal out there, you can do a little math to express it as a ratio. </p>
<p>With a terminating decimal, it is pretty easy:</p>
<p>0.123 = 123/1000</p>
<p>Repeating decimals require a little algebra:</p>
<p>n = 0.123123...</p>
<p>1000n = 123.123123...</p>
<p>1000n - n = 999n = 123</p>
<p>n = 123/999 = 41/333</p>
<p>What does this have to do with pi? It means that either a) pi can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, or b) pi cannot be represented as a terminating or repeating decimal. If we can show there is no way to express pi as a ratio, the only remaining possibility is a nonrepeating decimal.</p>
<p>In 1761, this is exactly what Johann Heinrich Lambert did. Unfortunately, his proof, and others like it, require advanced math we'd rather not get into. Lucky for us, the proof that √2 is irrational is pretty straight forward:</p>
<p>assume a and b exist, such that a/b = √2, and a and b have no common factors</p>
<p>a^2 / b^2 = 2</p>
<p>a^2 = 2 * b^2</p>
<p>therefore a is even, and there exist a k such that a = 2k</p>
<p>(2 <em> k)^2 = 2 </em> b^2</p>
<p>4 <em> k^2 = 2 </em> b^2</p>
<p>2 * k^2 =  b^2</p>
<p>therefore b is also even</p>
<p>However, we assumed a and b had no common factors, so they cannot both be even. This contradicts our original assumption, which proves it must be false. There are no such number a and b, which means √2 cannot be represented as a repeating decimal and must be irrational.</p>
<p>EDIT:  By popular demand</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>rational numbers are the result of dividing one integer by another</li>
<li>the decimal places of a rational number either end, or repeat</li>
<li>you can show that pi (or e or √2) cannot be the result of dividing one integer by another</li>
<li>therefore, those numbers are not rational and do not end</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly, the first person to prove the existence of irrational numbers (by the &quot;square root of 2&quot; proof that appears several times in this thread) was Hippasus of Metapontum.  He was a Pythagorean, a group of cult-like philosophers and mathematicians who believed many crazy things (like, for example, that lentils were sacred).  One of their now-obviously-wrong beliefs was that all numbers could be written as the ratio of two integers.  </p>
<p>It's said that on a sea voyage, Hippasus began doodling on papyrus or whatever the heck ancient Greeks did their mathematical scribblings on, and in doing so, inadvertently proved that the square root of two could not be rational.  After sharing his discovery with his fellow Pythagoreans and shattering their worldview, they repaid him for his discovery by drowning him then and there.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible to prove this. It's easier with another irrational number, the square root of 2. Let's assume that it's rational. This means it can be written as a fraction (a/b) where the integers a and b have no factors in common (other than 1). Both a and b can be huge numbers, it doesn't matter for this.</p>
<p>sqrt(2) = a/b</p>
<p>2 = a^2 / b^2</p>
<p>2 * b^2 = a^2</p>
<p>So a^2 has a factor of 2 in it. The only way this can happen is if a has a factor of 2 in it, which means there is some some integer c were</p>
<p>a = 2*c</p>
<p>2 <em> b^2 = (2</em>c)^2 = 4 * c^2</p>
<p>b^2 = 2 * c^2</p>
<p>So, like we did for a, this means that b has a factor of 2, so for some integer d</p>
<p>b = 2*d</p>
<p>Going back to the start</p>
<p>sqrt(2) = a/b = 2c/2d = c/d</p>
<p>Obviously we could keep repeating this. This shows that the initial assumption was wrong, and there is no way to express sqrt(2) as a fraction. The only other choice is that sqrt(2) is irrational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not exactly a 5-year-old explanation, but hopefully someone who has seen high school trigonometry/calculus can get the gist of it.</p>
<p>We know pi is irrational (i.e. it isn't of the form a/b where a and b are whole numbers) because it was proved by Lambert in the 18th century; there are now many proofs known.  The proof is conceptually harder than the proof that sqrt(2) is irrational, so I disagree with others who have used that as their main example: the extra concept you need is that of limits.  However, if you are OK with basic calculus, the ideas are not super advanced.  What it comes down to is that we know how to approximate pi with rational numbers, but the nature of that approximation means that pi itself must be irrational.</p>
<p>pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, but that definition isn't how mathematicians typically work with pi.  If you want to understand the properties of a number, it's better to have some way of approaching it that is based on a formula involving whole numbers.  For example, pi is the smallest positive number x such that sin(x/2)=1.  This is useful because sin(x) has a nice series expansion:</p>
<p>sin(x) = x - (x^3) /3! + (x^5) /5! - (x^7) /7! + ...</p>
<p>What this means is if you plug in some value for x into that sum, and calculate just the first n terms, as n gets larger, you'll get a better and better approximation to sin(x).  So pi/2 is a number that you can plug into this formula and get closer and closer to 1.  The important thing is that we're expressing everything in terms of rational functions (everything you can get from x and whole numbers by adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing).</p>
<p>You can also get approximations to pi itself of this form.  There are other kinds of approximation as well, such as continued fraction expansions, but the concept is basically the same: you approximate the true function f(x) by a sequence of functions f1(x), f2(x), ... where each function is built out of x and whole numbers by applying basic arithmetic operations, and the way to get the next function from the previous functions is predictable and easy to describe.</p>
<p>OK, so you know how to approximate pi by rationals, or you know it's approximated by solutions to rational equations.  How does this help you show it's irrational?  The basic idea is the following: if you make a sequence of rational approximations to a rational number, one of two things happens: either you hit the number you are trying to approximate exactly, or your approximations are 'bad' in the sense that if the number you want is x/y and your approximation is a_n/b_n, then |x/y - a_n/b_n| is at least 1/yb_n, or to put it another way, the sequence |b_n(x/y)-a_n| is bounded away from zero (regardless of what x/y is).  So if you can show that you never hit the limit exactly, but your approximations are 'too good', then the limit has to be irrational.  (Or to put it another way: if you know the limit is rational, e.g. sin(pi/2)=1, then you can't have been making rational approximations to it, so the number you put in must have been irrational.)  This kind of approximation idea is often hiding in the details of the proof, but it's usually there in some form.</p>
<p>As a final remark: this isn't a recipe for proving your favourite number is irrational; simply having some sequence of rational approximations for your number isn't enough.  It requires some special insight into the number in question to find the kind of approximations that are 'too good', and in general it's very hard to tell if a number is irrational or not.  For instance, we know that pi and e are irrational (transcendental, even), but we don't even know if pi + e is rational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pi is derived from dividing the distance around a circle (circumference) by the distance across the circle (diameter). </p>
<p>If we take other shapes and do the same (divide distance around the object by distance across), we will get the following results:</p>
<p>Each side length = 1, each shape is regular (equal angles, equal sides)</p>
<p>Square (4 sides):
distance around = 4
distance across = 1.414.
4÷1.414 = 2.82</p>
<p>Hexagon (6 sides)
distance around = 6
distance across = 2
6÷2 = 3</p>
<p>Octagon  (8 sides)
Distance around = 8
Distance across = 2.414
8÷2.613 = 3.06</p>
<p>Decagon (10 sides)
Distance around = 10
Distance across = 3.236
10÷3.236 = 3.09</p>
<p>Notice the more sides a shape has, the closer the answer is to 3.14? By the time we get to a hundred sided shape, we already have the first three digits of pi written out:</p>
<p>100-gon (100 sides)
Distance around = 100
Distance across = 31.82
100÷31.82 = 3.14</p>
<p>If we had a million sided shape, its answer would be a good approximation of pi, but not as accurate as a billion sided shape, which is not as accurate as a trillion sided shape, etc, etc. Think of a circle as an infinitely sided shape, we cannot reach its infinite sides, so we cannot also reach pi, 3.415926. . .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The sleep-wake system works by making you more sleepy the longer you have been awake and less sleepy the longer you have been asleep. In your case you spent the same amount of time asleep, so this isn't a sleep-wake homeostasis problem. It's the circadian rhythm! Which uses melatonin and cortisol to boost you while your awake and help you stay asleep. Generally, because of this 2am-4am you are the most sleepy and 2pm-4pm is the second most sleepy time. However, if you are a night owls or a morning person the circadian rhythm can be shifted by an hour or two. Also, if you are a teenager or a young adult then the circadian rhythm is also different.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are not being formally charged you will get released where you can retain your own lawyer or go to the public defender's office (or equivalent).</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> being charged, you will get booked into jail. The phones are free to use until you get assigned a cell. You can try to find a free lawyer at this time but good luck, most require a judge's approval to become your court-appointed attorney, this phone call is usually to call family and bond companies to try and get bailed out of jail.</p>
<p>Once you go to a cell it's usually a temporary dorm until you go before a judge. If it's a misdemeanor charge you will see a judge pretty soon, if it's a felony, it can take up to 72 hours to see one. This is the point where you can request a court-appointed attorney, signing paperwork that basically says you can't afford an attorney.</p>
<p>After this, if you haven't been bailed out of jail yet, you will probably get moved to permanent classification; another dorm.</p>
<p>1 week - 1 month later (or longer) you will get mail delivered to your cell that has your court-appointed attorney's name, info, etc. If you have a felony charge and cannot bail out of jail, you will have to wait to be indicted (typically by a grand jury) to know when your pre-trial court date is. This can take anywhere from months to almost 2 years. I was in with a guy waiting to be indicted for 22 months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The following should only be interpreted to apply in Canada (in case the various &quot;In Canada,&quot; qualifications weren't enough)</p>
<p>In Canada, if you've been detained by Police and you invoke your right to a lawyer, the Police are obligated to &quot;immediately&quot; (which in application, generally means &quot;as soon as possible in the circumstances&quot;) provide you a reasonable oppurtunity to contact counsel.</p>
<p>Importantly, they're bound to hold off on questioning you further until you've been afforded this oppurtunity, barring exceptional exigent circumstances and investigative necessity.</p>
<p>If you're detained at a police station, this usually means the Police will place you in a designated private phone room with a phone book (sometimes ipads/tablets these days depending on the station). </p>
<p>In Canada, Police are also obligated to provide you with phone numbers for duty counsel, who are free on-call lawyers who provide limited immediate advice relevant to the circumstances of your arrest. Depending on what province you're in, this may be a &quot;1-800&quot; 24/7 hotline number or a list of lawyers which ought to be provided to you by police.</p>
<p>Depending on the time of your arrest, you may be on hold for anywhere from 10 to 20 or more minutes trying to get through to duty counsel, due to wait time on a 1 800 number or non-response from listed roster numbers. If you do not wish to waive your right, its important you are diligent and patient and stay on the line/keep calling numbers. </p>
<p>Cutting myself off before this verges into legal advice territory, if you do not understand your right to counsel, or wish to speak to a lawyer but are having difficulty getting in contact with one despite your best efforts, its important to communicate that to police in unequivocal terms. The police are not expected to read your mind, but where its clearly known to them that someone doesn't understand their rights or is having difficulty excercising those rights,  they are generally bound to make further reasonable efforts to discharge their informational and implementational duties under 10(b) of the Charter.</p>
<p>This may not make a difference in whether you're charged or not, but it can make a huge difference when you actually retain a lawyer to defend you on those charges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: you do not have to have an already retained lawyer to use this, but you are not actually asking for an appointment either.</p>
<p>In the US, the phrase, &quot;I'd like to talk to my attorney before we go any further,&quot; invokes your Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Police can no longer question you, and answers they elicit out of you can be excluded from evidence on the basis of a constitutional violation. BUT - you can waive your Sixth Amendment protections by volunteering information after you have requested to speak to an attorney.</p>
<p>Once you have invoked your Sixth Amendment right, it is up to you to call an attorney. If you don't already have an attorney, you can ask for a phone book. You can also call your spouse/mom/friend etc to secure an attorney for you. If you cannot afford an attorney, you can look for a pro bono (free) attorney, but that is unlikely. Otherwise, you must wait to be before the judge to ask for an appointed attorney. If you can afford it, you may be able to bond out before that.</p>
<p>If the police are not charging you with anything, you can always ask, &quot;I am under detention right now?&quot; if the answer is no, then you are free to leave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will speak from an Australian perspective. Here in NSW, at least for Indigenous Australians, police are required by law to call the 'Custody Notification Service', which puts you in touch with a lawyer once you are arrested, but <em>before</em> police ask to interview you. We [lawyers] ask certain questions of the police - the nature of the charges, whether the person is likely to be granted or refused police bail, and if refused police bail which court they will be attending. We then speak to the person charged and give them certain advice and answer any questions they may have at this point. Another law requires people refused bail to be brought before court as soon as possible - so on the weekend that is something called a Registrar, and during the week a Magistrate (a Judge in the lower-courts). We will have a lawyer there ready to represent them at their first court appearance.
For non-indigenous Australians, the system operates largely the same. If unrepresented at their first court appearance, the Magistrate will typically ask if the person would like a lawyer, at which point they can apply for a 'grant' (representation) from Legal Aid, a publicly funded defence-lawyer service.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I logically conclude that this process is a very crude way of what happened in the way we humans measure things like length, weight  etc.</p>
<p>But how can we be sure that the scales we measure today are actually accurate? if we can measure 0.5rm with 99% accuracy, then measuring 0.25rm might have even less accuracy, going all the way to 1*10^-[integer] rm.</p>

<p>Thank you for your current attempts of answering, but my question wasn't how can we be sure that a kilogram is a kilogram.
To clarify furthermore - How can we be sure that the most modern measurement device actually measures with a good enough precision and not with it's measurement fault being 50% of accuracy (50% of times or 50% of given value).</p></div></div>

On the industry or production side, measurement assurance can be achieved by verifying a tool meets the requirements to successfully measure the measurand, typically using what is called a &quot;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANOVA_gauge_R%26R" target="_blank">Gauge R and R</a>&quot;.
There are of course other methods. For instance, ASME and ASTM provide guidance and documentation on measuring tools and setups for a particular measurand so you can make sure your tool accuracy doesn't significantly contribute to the error.</p>
<p>In the calibration side of things, there is an industry set up to verify that tools are traceable back to the SI units through an appropriate governing body (NIST in the US, NFL in UK, lots of others...). There is strict documentation on verifying the tools accuracy, in the past a loophole in ANSI z540 allowed for a 4:1 Test Accuracy Ratio to be used meaning the calibration standard needed to be at least 4 times more accurate than the unit under test. This has given way with the hesitant adoption of ANSI z540.3 which now uses a 2% Probability of False Accept, which requires the lab to use the Measurement Uncertainty instead of Accuracy.</p>
<p>At any rate, there are strict guidelines in place to verify the tool is performing within its manufactured specifications.
With a properly calibrated tool, a proper measurement system, and possibly control charts and check samples, you can assure that your instrument does not contribute to the error in a significant way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically, it is through repeated measurements of the same object/event. Taking your example, I may measure an object and find that it is 0.75 redditmeters. If I am uncertain in my measuring tool's accuracy, I can measure the object multiple times–maybe I get 0.74, 0.745, and 0.78 redditmeters for my new measurements. I can then use statistics to compute a confidence interval around my measurements. In the above example, the 95% confidence interval would be: 0.75375 ± 0.018. </p>
<p>The interval is calculated using the mean and standard deviation from the 4 measurements. You may want to look into <em>measurement error</em> for more information.</p>

<p>I once had a client walk into our machine shop and ask for an aluminum part to be custom made within a millionth of an inch of the specified dimension. We agreed because we knew he couldn't measure that close. The part would change dimension more than that from the heat of his hand.</p>
<p>The simplest means of accurate measurement of something really small, like a few millionths of an inch, is an optical comparator. It basically projects an image of the small feature onto a large screen. We know the precise amplification. We can simply compare the shadow on the screen to a cardboard template made to the same proportions, and tell with excellent accuracy if the part feature is 2 millionths high or 5 millionths high. We can also tell if the angles on the part are within spec.</p>
<p>And there you have the most important phrase:  &quot;within spec&quot;. Measurement only has meaning relative to an expectation. </p>
<p>The front tube of the Hubble Telescope has a series of graphite rings of varying inside diameter. They are spaced a few inches apart. The function like a pinhole camera, causing the light entering the tube from different angles from the axis of the tube to be absorbed, never reaching the lens of the telescope. These all reduce noise in the images captured by Hubble. </p>
<p>So the accuracy of those images depends on doing the best we can with all the operational parameters we are faced with, and with the technologies at hand. </p>
<p>BTW, those graphite rings, or baffles, were machined along the inside diameter to a taper, such that they became translucent near the inside diameter. Does anyone here know why? We on the shop floor who did that grinding of the taper never learned why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ortho resident here.</p>
<p>Lets start with some anatomy. Like others have said, long bones have two parts, a cortex and a medullary canal. The cortex is the outside of the bone and is what is usually seen on X-rays. It contains cortical bone which is arranged in a way that it is very strong. This is where most of the bending and compressive strength of bone is and is what most of the shaft portion of long bones (femur, tibia, humerus, etc) are made of. The medullary canal contains a combination of bone marrow and what is called cancellous bone, which is bone that does not contribute as much to the strength of the long bone, but is important part of bone health.</p>
<p>We place a rod down the femur by taking advantage of the medullary canal. You can place a rod in the femur by going in from the top or the bottom of the femur. First a hole is drilled in line with with medullary canal either through the greater trochanter (the large bump at the top of the femur) or through the knee. This is all done under X-ray guidance (called fluoroscopy). We then line up the fracture fragments, place a long wire in the medullary canal and then ream. These reamers start out small and get larger. This helps remove any of that cancellous bone and medullary contents that would get in the way of the rod we place in. We ream until the reamers start to &quot;chatter&quot; on the cortical bone. We then place a rode slightly smaller than the final reamer down the canal. This is all done under imaging guidance through the hole in the bone we made at the top or the bottom of the femur. The rod is hammered to the appropriate depth. Finally screws are placed at the top and the bottom of the rod to hold it into place. These are placed perpendicular to the bone and the rod in order to &quot;lock it&quot; into place so it doesn't move up or down.</p>
<p>We do rodding or &quot;nailing&quot; of long bones because it does not require large incisions and it is what we call a load sharing construct so patients can weight bear the next day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First realize that the femur is a hollow bone with marrow at the center. That's why on x-ray it looks white/opaque on the outside and darker/grey on the inside.</p>
<p>By saying it's hollow however, I'm not implying it's weak. It's not.</p>
<p>So the first thing they do is ream out the marrow with... You guessed it! A reamer. The diameter of which is determined by the size of the rod they determined this particular femur needed.</p>
<p>The rod has &quot;serrations&quot; on either end that allow it to be hammered in but make the opposite movement difficult.</p>
<p>They then do this for the other side. Though to be honest, I've forgotten how they bring the opposite be ends of the fracture together....</p>
<p>The reamer is used with a guide &quot;wire&quot; (it's actually thicker than a wire) and lots and lots of x rays are taken to make sure the reamer stays on course and doesn't deviate from the marrow to the cortex (the thicker outer part I mentioned earlier).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I was a radiological tech for 10 years until recently, and was fortunate enough to assist with a few of these surgeries.  It is not a delicate procedure. They stretch, rotate, drill and hammer by whatever means to get the hardware placed correctly. Normally a representative from the manufacturer would assist the surgeon in placing the device because there are not many &quot;one size fits all&quot; implants, so the surgeries are similar but never identical.  I'm sure a tutorial could be retrieved from YouTube, but if it's accurate it will look pretty violent the first time you witness the procedure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are typical two entry points, the greater troch or the piriformis fossa (depending on the angle of the nail and the preference of the surgeon,) although they're are Supracondylar nails whose entry point is between the condyles in the middle of your knee, this is use when a fracture is way to distal for those other nails to cover. </p>
<p>You reduce the fracture a couple ways, a ball tip guide wire will help, each company has some sort of &quot;reducer&quot; which just looks like a long skinny finger, sometimes depending on the fracture pattern you need provisional fixation with small single cortical plates, most of the time using &quot;c-clamps&quot; to hold the fragments or a &quot;spiked ball pusher,&quot; or just something to push the fragments back into place and then clamp them while you ream is all you need. Nailing a fracture doesn't create absolute stability, for the most part it provides relative stability, patients will have weight and motion restrictions during the healing process. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space historian here. I’ve worked with some of the people behind the Veneras and asked them this exact question. I’ve got a few responses below, and, while they don’t provide a complete answer, do shed some light on what the Venera Creators were thinking.</p>
<p>At the time of the Venera landers, physicist Roald Sagdeev was serving as director of the Space Research Institute at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Essentially, he was THE man in charge of all lunar and planetary programs for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of my interview with him in 2010:</p>
<p><strong>3:56 What happened to the [Venera] ships after they stopped working? If we went there today, what would we find?</strong>
I think you will find that whatever is made of the metals, stayed there, and all the other things like plastic, everything else, melted since long ago because of the temperature.</p>
<p><strong>4:24 So you think the structure of the spacecraft would still be there.</strong>
Yeah I think structural will still be there.</p>
<p><strong>It just seems like over time the titanium hull would have slowly softened...</strong>
Probably you know, maybe somehow deformed, but I think it’s still it’s probably there.</p>
<p>And then Viktor Kerzhanovich was one of the people with a scientific experiment aboard the Venera landers. He had this to say in 2012:</p>
<p><strong>46:26 If we could go there to see what the landers were like, what would you expect?</strong>
Ah, I would say the same. If you open them up, of course melted, that’s all the welded connections… transistors will be burned, okay this is the thing that cannot tolerate four hundred sixty [Celsius] mechanically, but for rest? Too much hypothesis. But essentially... I don’t think that much will happen.</p>
<p><strong>47:32 Okay, so it’s not like it will have melted down into a puddle.</strong>
No no no, it will melt inside, of course some circuits will be melted inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Everything starts out going all different directions, but just by chance there is a net angular momentum, and as everything collides that's going different directions, they all cancel out and fall into the center. You're left with only things that sum up to the net angular momentum of the system that are close to the average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, it's primarily because the gas and dust that made up the solar system was spinning and flattened out into a disk.  The gravitational interaction between planetoids (baby planets) wasn't great enough to fling themselves very far away from the orbital plane.</p>
<p>OK, with that being said, it's not impossible for a planet to orbit perpendicular to the orbital plane.  We have many comets that do.  What you would need is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a small planet (Mercury to Earth sized) to interact with a huge planet (Jupiter or Saturn) very closely.  The big planet could fling the small planet in such a way as to be almost perpendicular to the orbital plane. If some other interactions occurred, it may eventually settle down into a stable orbit.</p>
</li>
<li>a small planet could be captured by the solar system.  Again, this would require interaction with a third body -- another small planet which could get flung out of the solar system or potentially a larger planet that could take some of the captured planet's energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with these two possibilities is that they are very statistically rare, so it's no surprise we don't see them in our solar system.  However, it's likely that this sort of thing has happened to some planetary system somewhere in our universe if not our galaxy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not really true that all planets must orbit in line with the orbital plane or even all in the same direction. Mercury for example has a 7 degree inclination to the orbital plane which is the largest of the terrestrial/gas planets.. The dwarf planet Eris has an orbital inclination of almost 45 degrees.  If you want an example of a planet that does exactly what you ask then I give you WASP-79 b which is one of a number of planets found with polar orbits.
<a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-79_b/" target="_blank">http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wasp-79_b/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is true that in general planets will be closely aligned to the orbital plane at close distances to the host star but further out the mechanism of net angular momentum is far weaker due to a reduced density of the protoplanetary disk. This means that perturbations in a particles orbit requires far less energy. perturbations can be caused by a distant (if you want to know the mathematics behind this check out the Kozai-Lidov mechanism). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond this stars can also capture so called rogue planets which can orbit in the opposite direction and at any inclination. Estimates suggest there are twice as many planets in our galaxy without a star as there are stars in the galaxy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our own solar system it is thought Triton was a rogue moon caught by Neptune due to it being in a retrograde orbit (the other way round). Neptune itself is more evidence that the general structure people think of with planetary motion is not the full story as it has very high obliquity (the angle of the planets rotation relative to some other rotation axis often the host star). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically orbits are crazy things and planets can be very surprising in their behaviour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I make wildlife documentaries. This is an answer that I cut and pasted from a previous thread. I can't really say too much about long lens stuff cos I specialise on invertebrates. But for them what you do is use a mixture of sets and wild shot footage. You have certain things that you can't film in a studio and other things that you can't film in the wild. </p>
<p>This is an example of the <a href="https://youtu.be/qX6d7fDbJp8" target="_blank">former</a></p>
<p>And this the <a href="https://youtu.be/obS9hlkbRXA" target="_blank">latter</a></p>
<p>Say you want footage of the inside of a nest. You won't be able to get this in the wild without disturbing the animal. So you need to construct a specially made tank that will allow them to be calm relaxed and go about with their normal behaviour, but also allow you to light it and get good camera angles.</p>
<p>The footage of the wasp in the tunnel in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ySwuQhruBo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">film illustrates</a> this. What I did was cut a sample tube in half, fill it with sand so it looked natural. Then stuck it to the side of an opti-White glass tank. Kept it in the dark till the wasp got used to using it, then once it had I just filmed away.</p>
<p>Another big thing is editing. You can use careful editing to make it look like the animal is seeing something that is not actually there. For example; the scene of the harvest mouse in Planet earth two, when it is being hunted by a barn owl. The mouse was almost certainly shot in a set and the owl in the wild. The two bits of footage were edited together to make it seem like the owl was hunting the mouse. When in reality they were probably shot days if not weeks apart. </p>
<p>Edit: I thought I would include a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjrEKGUcWUg&amp;t=" target="_blank">this video</a> which has a sort of making of bit at the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love this part:  Unqualified claim to be a medical doctor here.
Further unsubstantiated claim to treat these specific patients routinely.  Yet more outrageous claim to have specialized knowledge in this particular aspect of the problem and thus I am the sole perfect person to answer your question. Like you're 5 years old, I don't know.  Here is my $0.02...</p>
<p>There are the direct effects and the indirect effects of the drugs. The direct effects are the ones that cause damage to systems,  organs, tissues and cells.  The indirect effects are those that affect the whole human due to the behavior people engage in when they are high or trying to get high. </p>
<p>Direct effects of meth depend on how you use the drug. Snorting will lead to a bunch of problems with drying out your nose and throat, the muscles involved will get contracted and long term it causes erosion of the tissues. This leads to lesions of all sorts forming. Swallowing meth is probably the least damaging, but still over time will cause havoc in the mouth and throat. Smoking will cause lung damage and the traditional &quot;meth mouth&quot; by altering bacteria in the mouth and causing a drying effect which ruins enamel and causes teeth to decay faster.  The worst is shooting it directly into the bloodstream with a needle in a vein. This allows bacteria and other infectious things into the blood directly and causes abscesses and infection. The infections can range from simple to complex and routinely kills patients. Kidneys and livers fail all the time due to dehydration, toxic levels of crap for the liver to filter out and hepatitis is rampant.  Meth causes people to clench their muscles a lot and that causes little bits of muscle to die and the debris goes into the blood and can cause kidneys to fail trying to filter it out. Shooting is also the most potent way to get high and is a bad sign. Shooters have a hard time staying sober. </p>
<p>The effect of the drug in your bloodstream is that it reaches a lot of the cells in your body to some degree and each type of cell has it own reaction depending on if it can make use of the meth molecule. There are between 10 and 17 known and theorized receptors for the meth molecule and the density of the receptors on different cell types is an ongoing investigation. For the 5 year old it will suffice to say it causes a lot of trouble that becomes damage in the way the cells function over time. The damage accumulates and expands. Blood vessels constrict, causing decreased flow to and from tissues. Brain cells obviously let meth in, and in different areas of the brain, and at different rates with different effects. A common phenomenon is called de-arborization where the little connections between neurons in key areas of the brain get clipped due to the toxic effects of meth. Sort of like trimming the branches of a tree.  This leads to all sorts of damage but is mostly seen as early dementia.   Also there is neuron death which affects the ability to regulate mood. Meth has a large effect on dopamine in the brain (and everywhere else too) which causes people to hear voices, feel pleasure, get paranoid, want more.  Meth does affect connective tissue and causes fibroblasts (a cell that builds collagen and the matrix that it lives in in skin) to be more inefficient. Repair occurs slowly and healing takes longer.  This will make it look like the patient is aging faster. </p>
<p>The indirect effects are all the bad things people do to get high. The latest story I heard from a meth using patient was that he was in  a month long detox program (his 14th program over 10 years) and he and 2  people he met in the program decided to leave the program early. The patient called a friend he knew in high school and convinced the naive guy that he had graduated from the program and needed a ride. The friend picks up the 3 addicts and they go to his house with him and steal his car, his portable electronics and drive to a casino in the desert to get meth after selling the stuff at pawn shop or on the street. They stripped the car of stereo and battery, took a shit in the backseat and broke the key off in the ignition.  </p>
<p>Meth is very cheap and you can get really high for about $10-30 a day, but over time people wind up selling their bodies to get money. They &quot;hustle&quot; and hustle means a lot of things and they are all bad.  The effect of having sex with strangers for meth money is a lot of exposure to STDs and violence. The &quot;holed up in a motel being raped for 3 days&quot; stories I have heard are in the high 30s. Both men and women prostitute themselves to either gender for meth or money. </p>
<p>They don't bathe, they stay high for months, they don't eat, they live in squalor or on the streets. It is a very rough living and it erodes their humanity. What they do eat is sporadic and usually just caffeine, fat and sugar. They don't drink enough water ever.  All that hard living, bad diet, damage to body and soul shows up on their skin. They get skinny, their muscles waste away, they pick at their skin and get scabs, sometimes they get horrific acne.  It all ages them rapidly. </p>
<p>Opiates are another story, but kind of the same. I am feeling a little slimy talking about these things because there is a cost to hearing all these stories and it is that you carry the stories and horrors around in your head forever.   Suffice it to say there are similar effects from using heroin. Just different specifics. If you really want to know just ask. </p>
<p>I'm going to go shower now and go to bed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Mommy told you not to stay up late watching TV, but you do anyway. TV is great, why stop for bedtime? You watch one show, then another...and another and another. You're thirsty, but you don't want to miss the best part that's coming up. You're sleepy, but you want to see what's on next. Your eyes are dry as a bone from staring at the screen. You finally fall asleep in the early morning and awake a few short hours later to your mom telling you you're late for school. Your eyes are red with bags under them, your mouth is dry, and your tum-tum is growling because you have to skip breakfast in order to get to school. Everyone at school says you look like shit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of super sciencey answers here but let me give you a response from an experienced polysubstance addict. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You don't eat. Why waste money on food when I can just buy more dope and the food tastes shitty anyways. Also any calories you do consume are used to repair the massive damage you're doing to your nervous system. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't sleep. Fuck sleep. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You neither drink water nor brush your teeth. Dehydration is a biatch. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intravenous drug use puts a lot of nasty byproducts directly in your blood. Lots of strain on kidneys. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will invariably do stupid shit to obtain bruises, cuts, and rashes bc you're fucked up a lot. </p>
</li>
<li>You don't eat, sleep, or take care of yourself, and you're injecting god-knows-what straight into ya blood! </li>
</ol>
<p>As a note, this applies to people in heavy active addiction, the ones you see and say &quot;Damn they are on drugs&quot;  </p>
<p>Trust me, there are shitloads of people around you every day that smoke meth in the morning and do a shot of heroin at night but you will never know because they have made decisions to take care of their bodies so they don't become that stigma. </p>
<p>Source: still maintaining a 9-5 while smoking meth and shooting heroin daily after 4 years, never once been piss tested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a prescription medicine called desoxyn, <em>in which the active ingredient is methamphetamine</em>, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/comments/methamphetamine/desoxyn.html" target="_blank">here are some reviews from several patients on the drug</a> (it is usually reserved for patients who other medications do not work for them). Most prescription users of the drug, experience little to no consequences, on the other hand they actually experience very positive effects towards their conditions.</p>
<p>Here is another example of it's medicinal use: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584615000469" target="_blank">The neuroprotective potential of low-dose methamphetamine in preclinical models of stroke and traumatic brain injury</a></p>
<p>The risks associated with methamphetamine abuse come more from the <strong>dosage</strong> used (several hundred milligrams are consumed in recreational users vs. 5-30mg in prescribed dosages), the <strong>route of administration</strong> (abusers smoke the drug, prescription users take it orally), staying up for several days on the drug causes <strong>sleep deprivation</strong> that comes with it's own set of effects, and individuals with methamphetamine use problems <strong>disregard personal health and hygiene</strong> (i.e. stop brushing teeth, showering,etc).</p>
<p><strong>Those factors alone without the methamphetamine would still induce many of the issues associated with methamphetamine abuse.</strong> The fact that the drug is prescribed and a safe, useful medicine for some; supports the fact that <em>we need legitimate drug education globally to prevent the abuse of these drugs and promote safe usage to avoid serious consequences in drug users.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Meth abuse causes the destruction of tissues and blood vessels, inhibiting the body's ability to repair itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acne appears, sores take longer to heal, and the skin loses its luster and elasticity, making the user appear years, even decades older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor diet, tooth grinding and oral hygiene results in tooth decay and loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Meth mouth&quot; is characterized by broken, discolored and rotting teeth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The drug causes the salivary glands to dry out, which allows the mouth's acids to eat away at the tooth enamel, causing cavities.</p>
</li>
<li>Teeth are further damaged when users obsessively grind their teeth, binge on sugary food and drinks, and neglect to brush or floss for long periods of time.</li>
