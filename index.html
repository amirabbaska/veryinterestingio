They will also leave the battery with a very small amount of charge when the phone dies to prolong the battery life and keep the internal clock going too.</p>
<p>Basically, lithium batteries would overheat when left plugged in, which would cause damage to the battery over time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You charge a battery by forcing electricity through it backwards. So if you have a 12-volt car battery the alternater and charger and such can put up to 18 volts across the terminals. That extra 6 volts forces the electrons to go in the &quot;electrons come out here&quot; side of the battery.</p>
<p>Batteries work through chemistry. You take some stuff (usually metal) and make a sandwich of the stuff around some other stuff (usually some acid or alkali). The middle stuff dissolves the metals releasing electrons and pushing them one way or another.</p>
<p>So your car battery is a lead-acid battery, and your flashlight takes D-cells that used to be carbon/acid, but are now (something I don't remember)/alkaline. So that's what an &quot;alkaline battery&quot; is.</p>
<p>So some batteries, like lead-acid, are easy to charge because the chemestry is really easy to reverse. Other batteries are just about impossible to charge because it's like trying to un-burn a log. This second type is the normal batteries and alkaline batteries you buy from the store. They just aren't <em>safely</em> rechargeable.</p>
<p>Why? They tend to catch fire and explode, or when you run the electricity through them backwards they don't produce the same chemicals they were built with.</p>
<p>So we've always had the big rechargable lead/acid batteries. But making little ones has required a lot of development.</p>
<p>There are different bad things things that can happen when you recharge a battery...</p>
<p>For example the metal in the metal sandwich can fall apart from being repeatedly changed and changed back. This is why car batteries go bad. The lead flakes off and eventually the flakes form a conductor from the two sides of the sandwich and that fraction of the battery becomes useless. The typical 12 volt car battery has six sandwiches so when you lose a cell it's now a 10 volt battery. Lose another and it's an 8 volt battery and that's not enough to do the job.</p>
<p>The battery can get hot and literally &quot;cook&quot;. So the modern lithium-ion batteries have little thermostats in them and as you charge them they get warm, and the warmer they get the less electricity they can stand to take, so the thermostat slows down the charging by slowing down the current. That's part of why your &quot;quick charger&quot; for your phone will, on an empty battery, charge to 80% real fast and then take longer and longer to get to 100%. It got warm as fast as it got charged and so it can't charge to full without slowing down.</p>
<p>Finally there's that whole thing where batteries &quot;get memory&quot;. This is not what's happening. As you charge and discharge some kinds of batteries they get pits and cook into new chemicals &quot;fractionally&quot; So every time you recharged the old batteries you &quot;used up&quot; a little of teh metal or the acid/alkali. With some of the material used up, the total amount of available stuff to make electriciy was reduced and the batteries lost their &quot;capacity to hold a charge.&quot; People called this &quot;memory&quot; because it was easier. But in truth you were more likely to ruin a battery by &quot;topping it off&quot; than you were likely to ruin it by charging a nearly dead battery. So it <em>seemed</em> like frequent short charges were &quot;remembered&quot;. But, no..</p>
<p>So finally, what is over charging.</p>
<p>Each sandwich inside any battery has a limit to how much electricity it can store. If you reach that limit and <em>persist</em> in forcing electricity through it backwards then it <em>can't</em> save any of that electricity as chemicals. So it <em>cooks</em>. Heat is generated and the good chemicals may bake or burn.</p>
<p>For instance, as your car battery dies the headlights visibly dim. This is because the 12 volts becomes 11, then 10, then 9 (and so on) as you use up the stored energy. And as you charge the 9 become 10 then 11 and 12. (the actual peak number is something like 13 volts for a car battery, but let's stick with 12.)</p>
<p>The charge/voltage regulator in your car stops charging the battery when the target 12 volts is reached because after that it's just doing damage. But if you've ever had a junker car that &quot;Eats Batteries&quot; you know it was really that your voltage regulator went bad. It wen't bad by being unable to stop the &quot;overcharging&quot;.</p>
<p>Now over time, because of different battery materials <em>and</em> by the proliferation of <em>better</em> electronics, the whole &quot;overcharging&quot; thing has largely gone away. We simply got better at the whole task from every angle.</p>
<p>But we still hear of whole phones (by part number) that are &quot;prone to explode&quot;. This happens when the phone in question, or the battery pack itself, has a design fault or was built with inferior parts. The bad design, or bad parts, lets the battery take in, or give out, too much electricity too fast. It gets hot. It get's unstable. And then it goes &quot;boom&quot;.</p>
<p>That's overcharging in a nutshell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern device batteries have their own internal logic to control the input and the output of power. They come programmed with a safe range of charge and would not let you charge beyond an upper limit or discharge below a lower limit.</p>
<p>Therefore you cannot overcharge your battery unless you're using a device from the 90's with those ancient nickel-cadmium chemistry.</p>
<p>The worst enemy of your battery is heat. This is what slowly chips away its efficiency. Unfortunately heat is a byproduct of both charging and discharging process, therefore there isn't much you can do to improve your battery life (apart from not using it, that is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What batteries are you talking about? Phones nowadays are generally smart enough to disconnect the charger voltage from the battery when the battery is charged.</p>
<p>Rechargeable batteries generally convert electrical energy to chemical energy and back again, as needed. They do this best under specific conditions, over a limited range of temperature, for example. Li-ion batteries like in our phones are most efficient when charged between 50% and 80%. They do this through reversible electrochemical reactions. If you discharge them to 0% and charge them back to 100%, often some measure of irreversible chemical reaction occurs.</p>
<p>If you want a specific explanation of the irreversible chemical reaction, can you provide a specific battery or application for the inquiry?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out on this thread, you can't actually overcharge the battery above 100% with a modern device by leaving it plugged in. Leaving it plugged in does, however, have the potential to wear the battery. The reason for this is that the phone is still running on the battery, and basically topping itself off every few min. Since the most destructive parts of the charge cycle are the very bottom (20%-0%) and the very top (80%+) you are cycling the battery at the worst part over and over. If you got an app that let you limit the max charge to 60%, the effect would be negligible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your specific question indicates a deeper misunderstanding though. It is a fallacy because of the implicit quantifier: that &quot;a=b&quot; is apparently true for all a,b, and c such that a=b+c, not some particular values of them (obviously true if c=0, as you say). The reason it is a fallacy is because this is clearly absurd for many values (although one counter-example is sufficient).</p>

One way to cool something down is the passive way of equilibrium, put something cold near the object you're trying to cool down, and equilibrium will have heat travel from the warmer object to the colder one, cooling one and warming another. Another way would be to modify the properties within the PV=nRT gas laws. If you change one side, the other side will change as well to maintain equilibrium. To get the extreme cold temperatures, you'd heavily compress the gas, which will increase the temperature, then cool it down to a reasonable temperature like room temp, and once you expand it out, it will heavily cool down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The normal way we make liquid gasses is to compress them, which makes them heat up, then cool them back down. Then you release the cold, high-pressure gas through a nozzle. When you drop the pressure of something, it becomes colder. The temperature drops to the condensation point, so some of the gas becomes liquid, which you collect. The remaining very cold gas is used to cool off the compressed gas in step 2, before being cycled back through the compressor.</p>
<p>Now helium is seriously weird in many ways, so you have to be careful in what pressures and temperatures you try to liquefy it at, but the basic idea is the same. Pressurise it, release the pressure, collect the liquid that is created and recycle the remaining gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The first step is to compress the gas, but by doing so you will actually heat it up above room temperature. You can now cool the gas by letting it equilibrate with a cooler environment. Now you can exploit the Joule-Thomson effect*, that states, that an expanding gas will cool down. So by expanding the gas into a bigger Volume, you will further reduce its temperature. You have to repeat this over and over again, but eventually you will end up with liquid helium.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>*Helium is actually a special case here as it will not reduce its temperature on expansion if its temperature is above a certain value. To actually exploit the Joule-Thomson effect in Helium for cooling you have to pre-cool it. For this you could use regular air that has been cooled below the critical value by using the same technique. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you cook, you're trying to get heat from outside the food to inside the food. There's lots of different ways to do that. Baking in an oven isn't actually very efficient! You can sear a steak on a very hot skillet in 2-3 minutes, but baking the same steak to the right doneness might take an hour in an oven. Because the oven's so bad at getting heat inside food, trying to turn the heat to the same levels as the skillet will leave you with a completely burned outside and a near-raw inside in a hurry.</p>
<p>There's also certain chemical things that happen in food when we cook it. At very high temperatures, beef &quot;browns&quot;, which creates very pleasant and complex flavors. That's why fancy steaks are almost always seared. You can bake a smaller steak in an oven, but you'll never quite get the same kind of flavor that searing creates. Low temperatures also do things! Pot roasts are generally tough cuts of meat, but after being kept in a slow cooker at around 200 degrees for hours, the heat will have broken down much of the tissue that makes the meat tough and turned it into a tender, tasty meal. Brisket and many other cuts are almost inedible unless cooked this way.</p>
<p>That's beef, though. Why do most of the things we cook fall in the 350-425 degree range? Well, I'm thinking of a lot of the things I throw in the oven. Frozen pizzas, frozen snacks... I'm not trying to <em>cook</em> those so much as <em>warm</em> them. But &quot;hot air&quot; isn't super good at getting heat inside food. So if I crank the heat up too high, I'll burn the outside and have a frozen inside. (Microwaves are the opposite: they're better at getting heat <em>inside</em> food. That's why pizza rolls take 20 minutes in the oven but only 2 minutes in the microwave. But that kind of 'heat' isn't so good at browning, so it never crisps them quite right, does it?)</p>
<p>That's what's going on with a lot of foods, too. Go much hotter than 425 and the heat can't penetrate the food fast enough to stop you from burning too much. Go much lower than 350 and it's going to take hours to heat the food enough, and in many foods like bread it might be important to generate some steam before certain reactions finish. That's why a lot of instructions for baking turkeys suggest cooking at two different temperatures. In one phase, the goal is to slowly get heat inside the turkey without drying out or burning the outside. In the other phase, the goal is to brown the outside to create more flavor.</p>
<p>Cooking often involves a LOT of complex chemistry, and delicate balancing acts of temperature.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Wow. This is without a doubt my most popular post ever. Thanks for the gold, and thanks for so many comments. I want to address a few things, it seems there's a lot of nitpicking.</p>
<p>In general, I wanted to cover &quot;high heat burns the outside before the middle gets hot enough, low heat takes too long and can't brown&quot;. It's ELI5, not an exhaustive guide to the science of cooking. There's lots of dishes that can't take 300 degrees, lots of processes like denaturing proteins I didn't get into, etc. I already feel like the post is too long for ELI5, I couldn't talk about every potential interaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, I appreciate corrections on how microwaves work, but again that was really a one-off example. I know about how microwaves excite water molecules, and that moisture content matters, etc. It's still true a microwave can cook, say, a chicken breast much faster than an oven but in so doing you miss out on things like browning. All of this makes the post even longer and distracts from answering, &quot;Why do we bake things within a specific temperature range.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes, when explaining complicated topics to people who want a rough answer, it helps to make gross oversimplifications. I think /r/AskScience is far more appropriate for the level of detail most of you are striving to find!</p>
<p>And yes, I do cook more things than pizza rolls. But it's a lot easier for people to relate to pizza rolls than &quot;that time I made spanakopita&quot;, and if I'd started talking about baking bread I'd have been WAY too encouraged to get into the chemical details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Flour, sugar, eggs for baked goods,</p>
<p>Protein, fat for meats.</p>
<p>The big difference is in the thickness of those components.</p>
<p>Ovens are actually very inefficient because most of their heat is infrared radiation that hits the top layer of the thing you are cooking and very slowly that layer conducts heat in.</p>
<p>The hot air conducts some heat too but again it only hits that outside layer.</p>
<p>The higher the temperature the faster that outside layer heats up but the variation in conducting that heat in is very small.</p>
<p>Therefor, with a lot of trial and error since gas ovens were invented (Wood etc before were just not precise enough that the exact temperature mattered versus how long to leave something in), we've learned that that temperature range, 375 +- 50 for wheat, 425 +- 50 for proteins, depending on thickness is the best middle point between letting the heat get to the middle of whatever you're cooking and nto burning the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First I'll hit on lower temps: below the range you mention it would either take too long, or more importantly, the food would simply &quot;warm up&quot; rather than have chemical reactions occur (not enough heat to promote browning, crisping, and caramelization... including an important reaction [to flavor and texture] known as the Maillard reaction, as others have mentioned). </p>
<p>You can though, for example, cook a steak at a very low temp, like under 150F, to get it &quot;warmed up&quot; to an internal temp that people like, then hit it with some really high heat in a skillet to brown and crisp the outside, which people also like. But this is more complicated, so it's not as common. (As a side note, a newer method growing in popularity, known as sous-vide, is made to do that first part...  immersing vacuum sealed food, usually meat, in temperature controlled water at lower than usual cooking temps, but again not as common).</p>
<p>As for higher temps that the range you list - for some foods that actually does work (like commercial pizza ovens, that are usually around 800F), but those applications aren't as common so it's not worth the cost and complexity to make home ovens even go that high. Plus it would be more dangerous in a home. </p>
<p>The other issue with high temp, and again even more important, is just that the outside of most &quot;food sized&quot; items will burn before the inside is heated up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit:</p>
<ul>
<li>140 is  holding temp, also the internal temp for a medium/medium well steak. Not high enough to really break down tissue, but not low enough for bacteria to grow. </li>
<li>160F is the internal temperature of chicken that is safe to eat</li>
<li>180 F is the temp for poaching a food, something delicate that can't handle a boil. Water transfers heat more efficiently than air. </li>
<li>212 is the temp water boils at. Boiled potatoes takes 12~ minutes, same cut/size to roast is 40~</li>
<li>250 is a temp you would cook something at for hours, like smoking a pork shoulder for 6 hours. </li>
<li>350 is a good temp for roasting something over a moderate amount of time</li>
<li>425 won't cook anything to 160 in the middle, but it will make the outside crispy very fast. </li>

<p>However, for digging under buildings  and such there's another technology - tunnel boring machines. </p>
<p><a href="http://74f85f59f39b887b696f-ab656259048fb93837ecc0ecbcf0c557.r23.cf3.rackcdn.com//assets/library/image/1/original/17448_crossrail_tunnel_boring_machine_fully_assembled_12_dec_20121.jpg" target="_blank">Here's one of the TBMs used in the newest London underground expansion, Crossrail</a></p>
<p>They're basically giant worms pushed by hydraulics. The front head turns slowly, grinding the ground in front. Conveyor systems carry the sludge away. <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oF181FMiEK0/VXjvj5IaR2I/AAAAAAAAIeg/i6Ye__b2Pkc/s1600/IMG_4653.JPG" target="_blank">Little trains</a> bring precast concrete tunnel segments, which are placed against the wall and bolted in place by a giant robot arm. </p>
<p>This is pretty efficient, provided the ground is stable. Unfortunately, many large cities are built on river basins or other flat, muddy ground. This requires more advanced techniques. </p>
<p>Back in the day (eg Paris metro) they used to freeze the ground by pumping cold liquid through pipes that they pushed in. Then they could excavate a tunnel and build walls before the ground started to melt.</p>
<p>A more modern technique is to use a Earth-Pressure-Balance TBM. If you just use a regular TBM ground will just fall down in front of the cutting head, causing a sinkhole above the TBM.</p>
<p>In a EPB TBM the cutting head is kept pushed hard against the tunnel head, so that the ground doesn't start caving in. The front of the TBM is sealed, linking seamlessly with the tunnel lining (built from those concrete segments) that the TBM is always assembling as it moves along. </p>
<p>Subway tunnels are pretty well mastered nowadays. The main issue is cost control. In the US you're looking at $200-1000 million a km! (Yes, a million dollars a <em>meter</em>). Spain on the other hand has managed to build subway systems well below $100 million/km. This is mostly a management/legal problem. </p>
<p>Other tunnels can be more difficult though! Highway tunnels are much bigger, so cause more problems. A recent example would be Seattle where the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement tunnel caused sinkholes to open in the city, or Boston's Big Dig which cost billions upon billions above predictions. </p>
<p>There's always new innovations as well. One big one is the New Austrian Tunneling method (which is really a collection of good practices) which is particularly applicable in hard rock. This basically uses pretty standard-looking earthworking equipment, the top half of the tunnel is dug first, the rocks natural strength holding up the tunnel. Then spray-concrete is thrown on the roof. </p>
<p>After that the second team comes through and digs out the bottom half, concreting that as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are big drills that chew rock very slowly, deposit it onto a conveyor belt that takes it out of the tunnel.  Right behind them is a similar machine that lays some brand of concrete, reinforcing mesh, and usually a polymer coating.  </p>
<p>At no time is more than a very little bit of the tunnel exposed without reinforcement.  The whole process goes very slowly, and only really vibrates at the surface entrance/exit, which is usually in an industrial area anyway.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many have described how it's practically done already, but I thought I'd add why it works and why it doesn't fall down after you drill.</p>
<p>The structures above are generally large, so their weight is distributed over a large area. So when you drill, in front of the drill you obviously have the ground intact and still holding up the ground above, and behind the drill you place concrete asap to hold up the tunnel. So you have the little piece in between, right where the boring machine is, as long as the buildings above are distributing their weight over more than that area, you shouldn't really have a problem. Furthermore, through the earth the lifting power of the concrete and the earth on the sides of the tunnel is also distributed - somewhat like an arc. So it's providing some lifting power to building right above the uncovered hole as well.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Both the weight and the forces keeping them up are distributed a lot horizontally, so the relatively small tunnel roof of unsupported earth with all the buildings above (usually) doesn't fall down on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) are amazing.  You can view a video of how they work here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx_EjMlLgqY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx_EjMlLgqY</a>.  They drill, place the walls of the tunnel and move the rock out all in one device.  </p>
<p>Before the project was started, samples of the soil and rock were collected along the pathway.  This way the soil/rock types can be anticipated.  Surveys to make sure there are not potential obstructions are also done (Bertha, a TBM got stuck in Seattle and it was quite a saga! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_(tunnel_boring_machine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_(tunnel_boring_machine</a>))  Some easements and purchases of land were necessary because our state says you own your land down to the center of the earth (ok, maybe not, but you get the idea).  </p>
<p>Surveys have been performed and will be regularly checked to make sure vibration does not cause damage, but the contractor tells us that folks have no clue what is happening under their feet.  I've seen other forms of horizontal drilling and can say that has been true with those methods, although they are much smaller.  </p>
<p>For our project, there is a launch and retrieval shaft, both of which required access to the surface, as well as multiple small sites along the way for small vertical shafts for air &amp; odor control.  Those sites are small and mostly take advantage of existing sites the towns along the way already own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm by no means an expert, but I have some knowledge of this. Everyone correct me, please. I know I'm not getting meiosis quite right, it's been a long time since I've done cell bio/genetics. Anyway, never too late to learn, OP. </p>
<p>Sperm cells, as the name suggests, are a type of cell in the human body. They are created through a cell division process called meiosis, which occurs in the testicles. A similar process creates eggs in women, and occurs in the ovaries. </p>
<p>Sperm are haploid cells, which means they contain half the chromosomes (your genes/DNA, basically the instructions for making you) of a normal cell. A normal cell has 46 chromosomes but a sperm cell only has 23, 22 standard chromosomes with small differences in their code that make you unique and a sex chromosome that will be either X or Y to determine your <del>gender</del> sex. A female egg cell has the other 23 chromosomes, 22 regular and an X chromosome. If a sperm with a Y chromosome meets an egg, you get XY and the resulting child is a boy. If the sperm has an X chromosome, the child is a girl. The sex chromosomes are called X and Y because they're actually shaped liked Xs and Ys. Women's eggs only have X chromosomes. </p>
<p>Meiosis is similar to a cell division process for most other cells, mitosis, (where a cell clones itself, divides, then splits into two new cells) except there is are additional steps. One of these steps is recombination/crossover, where after cloning themselves, the chromosomes pair up (imagine the same chromosome from a parent holding onto a twin and lining up across from the same chromosome from the other parent and its twin). Then the chromosomes crossover, where they link up and swap parts with their partners from the other parent. Then the cell divides, creating two new cells with chromosomes that are a mishmash of chromosomes from both parents. These then divide again, so that there's only 23 chromosomes in each cell. </p>
<p>This is a highly simplified summary. In terms of your last question, sperm are basically the same between human and non-human animals. The primary difference is the number of chromosomes. However, they undergo similar processes (meiosis and all) and share the majority of their characteristics.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually in developmental biology right now, so this is one of the subjects.</p>
<p>Sperm cells are created in the testes from stem cells, which are types of cells that can develop into more specialized cells. These stem cells are guided through development by signals from the nurse cells that encompass them, while some stem cells remain undeveloped to maintain a population of cells that can create more sperm. As the cells develop they go through meiosis, which means their chromosomes recombine and each of the four cells has one of each chromosome instead of two chromosomes each with two chromatids.</p>
<p>After meiosis the sperm develops its characteristic features by going through what is called spermiogenesis: flagellum, compacted nucleus, an acrosome to help reach the ovum, etc. However, the sperm doesn't become fully developed until after it leaves the body and undergoes what is called capacitation, which allows it to sense molecules emanating from the area surrounding the ovum and move towards them, as well as increase its speed and allow it to fuse with the ovum. Capacitation can happen in the female or outside (in sea water for sea urchins) depending on the species.</p>
<p>Components of the sperm include a whip-like flagella for movement, an acrosome, which releases proteins that digest the material around the ovum, bind to the ovum, or help signal to the ovum that it has been fertilized, centrioles for the flagellum, and glycoproteins (proteins with sugar on them) for ovum binding and fusion etc.</p>
<p>As far as difference between species, I'm not especially familiar, but they should have different surface molecules to recognize ova of a specific species, and I image their shape is generally similar between species, but I'm not certain.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Plant sperm are an interesting contrast to those of animals like humans -- plant sperm usually move using structures called flagella. Sometimes they have many thousands of flagella on one sperm cell. </p>
<p>Like animals they develop from mother cells by halfing the chromosome count (meiosis). But plants don't have testes, so they are produced inside different structures, such as inside pollen grains, or in antheridia of ferns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

As a child conceived from sperm donation, you don't! There is a valid chance you will sleep with someone related to you. Due to the age of my donor, I'm much more worried about sleeping with a half sibling. I usually sit down with people I'm seeing and ask if there's any chance they were conceived from/a parent donated to a sperm bank.</p>
<p>Worst part is that there's always a chance <em>they</em> don't know. Sperm donation is a bit of a taboo subject still, so some parents never mention it.</p>
<p>I appreciate that my parents wanted children so badly, but it's still an ethical grey area for me. I enjoy being alive, but don't enjoy not knowing my father, not knowing half of my medical history, and wondering how many half siblings/cousins/relatives I have out there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a DOT in their maintenance side. Most paving jobs consisted of some kind of removal of asphalt (although not all jobs). Each job had a contract and the contract would state what happened to the asphalt millings. Usually the DOT tried to keep them, but sometimes they were given back to the contractor. The term we used was RAC (recycled asphalt concrete) or RAP (recycled asphalt product)</p>
<p>If we kept the millings, we would use it as material, similar to how we would use cold-mix asphalt or gravel. Sometimes we would spread it on old roads that badly needed repaving (but were never going to be repaved for various reasons) or use it to build up eroded sections of road. Some of the other areas had machines that would reheat the RAC to a temperature that melted the asphalt binder (the sticky black tar) and then they could use it to patch potholes. It was probably the ideal choice for RAC however the machines were expensive.</p>
<p>If the contractor got the RAC, they took it to their yard to use on other jobs. I believe a certain percentage of recycled asphalt can be used when making new asphalt, but there may be stipulations in paving contracts saying whether or not it's allowed. </p>
<p>Some jobs reuse the RAC right on site using this train of machinery. Here's a website that explains it.

<blockquote>
<p>On 21 May 1946, with seven colleagues watching, Slotin performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around a 3.5-inch-diameter (89 mm) plutonium core. The experiment used the same 6.2-kilogram (13.7 lb) plutonium core that had irradiated Harry Daghlian, later called the &quot;demon core&quot; for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper 9-inch beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the shims normally used. Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.</p>
<p>At 3:20 p.m., the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a &quot;prompt critical&quot; reaction and a burst of hard radiation. <strong>At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand.</strong> He jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation.</p>
<p>As soon as Slotin left the building, he vomited, a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense ionizing radiation. Slotin's colleagues rushed him to the hospital, but the radiation damage was irreversible.[1]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can certainly feel intense radiation. In fact, you can do this right now (depending on the weather). Just go outside and stand in the sun. The effect you feel is the radiation from the sun heating up your skin.</p>
<p>As for the radiation from Chernobyl. It is unlikely that you would've felt it directly. The peak radiation intensity received by one person just after the meltdown is estimated to be somewhat comparable to the total power output of a standard LED lamp.</p>
<p>However, the radiation coming from Chernobyl, while lower in total intensity, is much more damaging than radiation coming from the sun. Solar radiation is, for the most part, too low energy to be harmful (UV being a notable exception), so even though there's a lot of it, it won't do much. The radiation from Chernobyl consisted of much higher energy gamma radiation as well as other types of ionizing radiation. Forms of radiation that can and will damage living tissue, even in relatively small quantities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes</p>
<p>You can get burns from microwaves and beta particles, you would most certainly feel burning and it would be extremely unpleasant, most likely from nerve damage it would be hard to breathe, your eyes would literally be being burnt out of their sockets</p>
<p>I remember reading a story about something that emitted just beta particles that 2 Russians found after a patrol in a vehicle crash, a blizzard set in and whatever it was kept them alive but they suffered burns and the rest of the unit came to retrieve it, they retrieved it by having 1 member pick it up and move it for a certain amount of time before passing it off to another before they suffered radiation poisoning</p>
<p>The Russians solve problems by any means necessary</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
