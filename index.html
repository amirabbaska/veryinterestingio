<p>Briefly, the color of something can depend on the environment, particularly the polarity of the solvent. When the solvent evaporates, the environment changes and so does the color.</p>
<p>Less likely possibilities are the dye being volatile and evaporating or the color not really changing, just the amount used is small enough that you can't detect the color in a thin layer like you can in a thick bottle.</p>
<p>If you have particular products in mind, we can try to find the composition and determine if one of these hypotheses is correct. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The natural log, which is the inverse of e, I was able to use to model human vision. Ever try dimming your light bulbs (especially smart bulbs)? Go to 50% brightness. It sure doesn't look 50% as bright. Human light sensitivity is 5logN. If a product design engineer knew what I know and modeled the brightness of a bulb as a logarithmic function, he could make a lightbulb that dimmed by what a person would precieve as 50% halfway through a dimmer knob. </p>
<p>Human hearing is logarithmic too. This is why decibels are 10x higher each time you increase 1 decibel. Sound seems to be twice as loud when you actually 10x the pressure behind it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gah, some people responding here need to just not. </p>
<p>Alright I'm going to spend some time breaking down how colour works for you before getting to the why. It's needed background information, but feel free to skip over the bits you know. </p>
<p>Colour as we perceive it is not something inherent to the spectrum of visible light. It's related, but there is nothing about a photon with a 2.61whatever eV of energy that makes it inherently or objectively blue. The photon does not give a shit, it's just a photon that carries some energy and has the related wavelength. </p>
<p>The perception of colour is a product of biology. Your eyes send an electrical signal to the brain and your brain interprets that information. It turns out being able to easily distinguish different objects is useful what for not getting eaten and finding things to eat, and most materials reflect different and unique parts of the light spectrum. Thus the eye evolved to give more detailed information to the brain and the brain evolved to process that into what we perceive as colour, thus reducing your chances of getting eaten by wolves or licking a poison dart frog. </p>
<p>So how does the eye work. I'm sure you're aware that you have specialized cells in your eyes called rods and cones; rods cells are responsible for low light vision, cone cells for vision in bright light.  You've also probably been told that rod cells are achromatic which is why you don't see colour in darkness, but cone cells are chromatic and allows you to see colour in other times. This is accurate enough but a little overly simple. Each one of those cells, cones and rods both, contains a pigment, and like any pigment it absorbs light around a certain wavelength and reflects others, and when it absorbs light, this produces a response in the cell to the brain. They also respond most strongly at a certain wavelength and then falling off in a general bell curve type shape to the left and right of that peak. </p>
<p>You can see an image of that <a href="https://www.unm.edu/~toolson/human_cone_action_spectra.gif" target="_blank">here</a> (note, not to scale, comparative only) but to list: </p>
<p>Rods activate between  400nm and about 640nm, with their peak around 510nm. </p>
<p>Blue cones activate between  370nm and about 550nm , with their peak around 420nm. </p>
<p>Green activate between  400nm and about 700nm with their peak around 530nm. </p>
<p>Red activate between  400nm and about 700nm, with their peak around 560nm. </p>
<p>This is why the light off a 420nm ish laser looks really really blue. It's activating the blue cones in your eyes very very strongly, and everything else much weaker. However most things aren't lasers and don't produce/reflect monochromatic, instead  they reflect multiple different parts of the spectrum. That results in more than one wavelength of light hitting your eyes at the same time. You'll also notice there's quite a bit of overlap between the ranges of activation for the cells in your eyes. It's that overlap combined with mixed wavelengths triggering more than one type of cell at a time that gives rise to the rest of the colours. So while the visible spectrum looks like <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c9bd877c0d7d5a998e2dfba6736d3389" target="_blank">this</a> the diagram of colours we can percivce looks like <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZKral.png" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>So now we can get into the why. That last diagram  there is a C.I.E. Chromaticity chart. The X,Y coordinates describe the relative strength of activation of each of the cone cells in your eyes. Closer to the bottom right, red is most strongly activated , bottom left blue and top left green. If  I point violet light at your face (so bottom left) and then start to also add in red light by increasing the intensity of the red you can follow the charting from violet and start moving into purple into a sort of light fuchsia to a dark fuschia and so on. Eventually there's just tons of red wavelength light bombarding your eyes, in comparison to blue wavelength light and the red overwhelms the blue and you see nothing but red. This is also why a really really bright violet wavelength light appears blue, but bright purple still looks purple. Intense violet light just triggers blue cone cells strongly so our brain goes &quot;oh that's really blue&quot;, but intense purple still maintains that mix of red and blue we perceive as purple</p>
<p>Also contrary to what you may have heard, rods do play a role colour vision, however not all of the time. You need light that's dim enough for rods cells to be activated, but not too dim that the cone cells stop activating. This is why colours get a bit funny around dusk/dawn or in areas with dim light from streetlamps. Rods activate quite strongly in the sort of blue-green area of the spectrum. So when the light gets dim reds start to become more dull or even close to black, but you're more sensitive to light in that green/blue chunk spectrum and can still make out greens and blues. </p>
<p>That also why things like aircraft cockpits use red lights. Rods are not saturated by the red light and remain active thus allowing for night vision when looking outside of the aircraft, but the red light stops you vision from shifting entirely to scotopic (night) vision where the pilots would no longer be able to read their instruments. It's also good way to observe nocturnal animals who usually can't perceive red very well and are thus still in the dark as far as they're concerned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question leads down a rabbit hole. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Purple is not on the visible spectrum</strong></p>
<p>ROYGBIV. No P at all. Violet =/= purple. </p>
<p>Violet is not the same as purple. Let that sink in. The similar color is an illusion. Violet is actually a color we can't really precieve (directly). Purple is a mix of red and blue pigment. Violet is the thing to the right of blue on the rainbow. Purple is a fake color - so is brown. </p>
<p>We &quot;see&quot; violet because of harmonics. We don't have a violet color receptor; just red blue and green. There is a sensitivity in the red cone that makes it activate a tiny bit from violet light. Thus is essentially a harmony like in music - because the wavelength is almost doubled. Notes have the same similar sound to their harmonic partners. </p>
<p>Because this is similar to a red mixed with a blue (purple) our brains use the same sensation to represent them. In reality, they are as different as yellow and indigo. </p>
<p><strong>Edit: people seem interested so here is more of the rabbit hole</strong></p>
<p>They sky isn't blue. </p>
<p>Ever heard of Rayleigh scattering? This is the explanation often given for why the sky is blue. It states that nitrogen and oxygen (thanks /u/rrtk77) refract light to favor shorter wavelength and it's true. But violet is shorter than blue. So why isn't the sky violet?</p>
<p><strong>The sky is violet</strong>
If you hold a colorimeter up to the sky, it will tell you that your eyes are lying to you. The sky is actually violet but our eyes don't see violet very well (for the reasons above). </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2: pink is also not real</strong>
<a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/11/color-pink-doesnt-exist-can-see/" target="_blank">http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/11/color-pink-doesnt-exist-can-see/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because purple isn't actually on the spectrum.  It's not a real color at all (that is, there is no single wavelength of light that is purple).  The visual spectrum runs from red to deep blue (indigo), but there's no purple on it anywhere.  Purple exists all in our head, as a consequence of how our visual system works.  How is that possible?</p>
<p>We have three different types of cone cells in our eyes, which detect three different ranges of light:  Red, green, and blue.  As you would expect, red light stimulates the red cone cells, and we see red.  Same with green and blue.  What about wavelengths between those colors?  Well let's take yellow as an example.  Yellow light stimulates the red and green cones simultaneously, and our brain sees that as yellow.</p>
<p>But here's where it gets interesting.  If yellow light stimulates the red and green cones, what happens when we shine both red and green light on the same spot of our retina?  As far as your cone cells are concerned, there is zero difference between the red and green cones being activated from one wavelength of light, or from multiple wavelengths of light.  So when we see both red and green light from the same source, it looks exactly like yellow light to us, because of how our eyes work (as an aside, this is how we can produce so many different colors from computer monitors, TVs, and phone screens:  we just use different combinations of red, green, and blue).</p>
<p>So now we get to the <em>really</em> cool part.  What happens when you shine both red and blue light on the same part of the retina?  Your brain wants to interpret that as a single color.  But it can't use the midpoint between red and blue (like it does for red+green=yellow), because the midpoint between red and blue is green, and shining red and blue light at your retina specifically <em>doesn't</em> activate the green cone cells.</p>
<p>So your brain invents a new color:  purple!  It's a color that doesn't actually exist in nature.  There is no pure purple light.  There is no single wavelength that can stimulate both the red and blue cones, but not the green ones.  Purple is an &quot;imaginary&quot; color that is all in our head, as a byproduct of how our visual system works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have 3 color receptors in your eyes.  Colors are interpreted by your brain as a blend between those receptors.  Yellow is green and red being activated.  Magenta(reddish purple) is blue and red.  Cyan (a sea-blue) is blue and green.  All the colors you can see are an interpretation of how much each of those receptors get activated.    </p>
<p>In the electromagnetic spectrum, the colors of light go from red-orange-yellow-green-blue-violet.  Spectral violet isn't the purple violet that you see elsewhere.  It's because the red color receptor is a little bit sensitive to the deepest blue wavelengths of light, while the green is not.  Biology isn't perfect.  </p>
<p>So to answer your question why does red seem to fade into purple as well as orange?   That is because orange is red, with increasing of green, where as fading to purple is red with increasing amounts of blue.  </p>
<p>Remember, we are talking about light here, not paint colors.  Paint works by absorbing all the colors, except for what you see.  Paint that is yellow is absorbing the blue light, while reflecting green and red.  That is also why &quot;blue blocker&quot; sunglasses make everything yellow.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you adjust the wavelength of a light gradually from red to green, the light will gradually stimulate the red-sensitive cells less and the green-sensitive cells more. To your eye, orange or yellow light looks just like a combination of red and green light because it stimulates the same cells. Gradually changing the wavelength looks just like gradually making a red light dimmer and a green light brighter.</p>
<p>But what if you start with a red light and gradually make it dimmer while turning a blue light on? That's the fade from red into purple and from purple into blue. There's no wavelength of light that stimulates the red and blue cells equally, so this fade isn't equivalent to any gradual change of wavelength. But it should still look like a smooth fade to your eye because it's still just one type of cell being stimulated more as another type is stimulated less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ex Intel process engineer here. Because it wouldn't work. Making chips that don't have killer defects takes an insanely finely-tuned process. When you shrink the transistor size (and everything else on the chip), pretty much everything stops working, and you've got to start finding and fixing problems as fast as you can. Shrinks are taken in relatively small steps to minimize the damage. Even as it is, it takes about two years to go from a new process/die shrink to manufacturable yields. In addition, at every step you inject technology changes (new transistor geometry, new materials, new process equipment) and that creates whole new hosts of issues that have to be fixed. The technology to make a 5nm chip reliably function needs to be proven out, understood, and carefully tweaked over time, and that's a slow process. You just can't make it all work if you &quot;shoot the moon&quot; and just go for the smallest transistor size right away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because when a transistor is very small, it has a number of side effects like quantum effects and short-channel effects. Also, transistors work by doping semiconductors, if the semiconductor is very small there are very few doping atoms. Also, a small imperfection results in a big effect when we're working in small scales. There are many ways to fix it but it's not evident. This is the tl;dr it's actually a very vast science. You can ask me for specific things or you can google these 3 things: Beyond CMOS, more Moore, more than Moore</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Changing scales also changes how well (or if at all) different technical solutions work and mess up the tuning of the process you previously had. Taking a technology and just slapping it at a different scale doesn't work, you need to take many small steps and adapt your technology or sometimes even use entirely new technologies to overcome principal problems in order to get there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I was thinking about how people are more attracted to people who are in good shape and not fat. There are examples of obese unattractive people who put a lot of effort in and got in good shape and became attractive. With that being said, if a man were to get a women pregnant after losing the weight and getting in good shape, would that make a difference in the genetics of the children and their health, compared to if he had gotten a women pregnant while he was still obese? I'm wondering because if people are unattracted to obese people because that could imply bad genes, how would them getting in shape suddenly make them more attractive? Wouldn't the obese persons genes stay the same after getting in shape and thus result in the same potential baby? Or would it result in a healthier baby? Is an obese persons unattractiveness more related to the fact it shows the potential lack of ability to take care of a child? </p>
<p>I'm only talking about men because obviously a unhealthy woman during a pregnancy would result in a less healthy child. </p>
<p>TLDR: Why are obese people unattractive and if it has to deal with genes why is it possible for them to become attractive after getting in shape?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up something called Epigenetics. Epigenetics are the things that determine how your DNA is expressed. Epigenetics definitely changes on a generation by generation basis. We don't know a tremendous amount about it, but what studies we have done pretty strongly show that epigenetics can do things that normal DNA cannot. Such as making an offspring have an aversion to certain smells and chemicals based on what the parent experienced.</p>
<p>Here are two great videos on it:
One from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvB0q3mg4sQ" target="_blank">MinuteEarth(2:43)</a></p>
<p>And one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1bZEUgqVI" target="_blank">Scishow(9:28)</a></p>
<p>A great takeaway is that the changes in epigenetics were passed onto sperm cells. Therefore, eating healthier and losing weight not only makes you look better, but can also change your epigenetics, changing the way you build muscle, store fat, etc. </p>
<p>What is unknown is just how fast this happens. For example, it is unknown for how long someone has to be fit before there are significant changes in epigenetics to then be passed on to the children. </p>
<p>Edit: Never got around to explaining Epigenetics. The videos do a good job but the TLDW is that the Epigenome is a way of reading the DNA. The DNA doesn't change, but the Epigenome changes a lot based on how you act and behave. The Epigenome determines how strongly certain parts of the DNA get expressed. So essentially, take a person who went through a famine and survived, their epigenome will change to allow them to survive through extended starvation. This is then passed to their children and as a result, their children have a leg up on surviving a famine. There was even a study on this exact things done in Sweden. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The kids may or may not be healthier, but it's quite likely it will be harder to have them.</p>
<p>This next one is more anecdotal and should therefore be taken with a grain of salt. I've read about research that argues that the generation that was around for world war 1 and the roaring 20s were the first ones to access processed foods - but they were significantly skinnier than we are now. The theory was that the processed foods, with higher levels of fat and salt and sugar, affected their dna, and hurt their children and their grandchildren as well. I remember the study attempted this with mice, and it worked, but again - no clue. If true, then being obese at any point would also affect your reproductive health as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Research on mice and other animals has demonstrated that the physical fitness of the father at the time of conception does make a difference in the outcome of the children.  Replicating the research on humans is a bit tricky since you can't exactly force people to gain/lose weight and have children to fit the schedule of your research, but there is no reason to suspect that the same mechanisms won't hold true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The powder bacteria you get is much like baker's yeast or &quot;astronaut ice cream&quot; that you can buy in the store. The bacteria are freeze-dried or, the more technical term, lyophilized. The main idea is to remove all the water to prevent spoilage which happens from biological activity which in turns requires water. First the sample is frozen so that all metabolic activity is stopped, and then a vaccum is pulled so that the water sublimates (goes directly from ice to gas) which keeps all of the other molecules that make up the cells frozen in place. After all the water is gone, the cells just remain a dry jumble of salts,proteins,lipids, etc. until water is added again.</p>
<p>The bacteria are no longer really &quot;alive&quot; in that they perform no chemical reactions without the water. They can't eat, they can't reproduce, they can't make more of anything. So there is no need for food. My guess is that the expiration date is only there because after a long time, moisture will seep back in.</p>
<p>The coming back to life part is tricky, but luckily single cell organisms are just bags of chemicals in water. So they are relatively easily dried and reconstituted. Much of the cells do die in the process, but it does not matter, as long as there is enough to make it past your stomach, even a few bacteria can turn into billions very quickly once they settle in the guy. Cryoprotectants are often added in the process, and a common one is trehalose (a sugar that's chosen because its cheap). The sugars help keep ice crystals to a minimum size during the freezing step. If the water crystalizes into large crystals, they can rupture the membranes or break proteins that would severely limit the ability of the bacteria to come back to life once rehydrated (because ice is less dense than water).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Lyophilization (basically freeze drying) can be performed on many bacterial species in order to convert them to powder. Some of the bacteria die, but enough remain so that they can start growing again under the right conditions.</p>
<p>For more information, I recommend this paper:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3909163/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3909163/</a></p>
<p>Additionally, some bacteria form spores, which can withstand harsh conditions. These are particularly easy to store as powder (think anthrax letters). However, the typical bacteria given as probiotics are not spore-forming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can the bacteria survive all this time without any food?
How come they don't reproduce until they're eaten by us?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lyophilized bacteria are metabolically inactive. As long as the cells aren't damaged, they can be revived upon rehydration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My linguistics Professor told us that even in completely unrelated languages, their early words to address the parents tend to gravitate towards a certain type of sound. Her explanation was that the lip muscles are one of the earliest muscles the child learns to use, because sucking is important for survival, so bilabial open syllables (open syllable are simple consonant+vowel combination) like &quot;ma&quot; &quot;ba&quot; or &quot;pa&quot; are the easist for a child to learn.</p>
<p>&quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; would then be the slightly more grown up version of &quot;mama&quot; and &quot;dada&quot;. (da is a bit of an odd one out because it's not bilabial, but still relatively easy to learn compared to complex words)</p>
<p>Even in languages in which parents are traditionally addressed more formally, they usually start out with easier &quot;baby&quot; words, and adopt the more formal terms later when the child can speak properly. But in many cases, some variation of the babyterms just stick.</p>
<p>In short: a baby physically wouldn't be able to address his father as &quot;Alexander Leopold von Großauchenbach&quot;, so they just call him &quot;dada&quot; instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We all know how addressing people works differently in different dialects of English. (mom, mum, ma, mother to name a few)
most of these forms are based on language acquisition. Children go through different phases where they start using open syllables (think mah , moo, da) then later they start using repetition (mama, dada, moomoo). Nasal M is &quot;easier&quot; to learn (one of the first sounds to make) because it's a constant flow of air through the vocal cords (voiced) then out the nose. Pronouncing the p or d (which are considered plosives) requires better coordination of muscle groups since the airflow has to actually be stopped for their realization.</p>
<p>m is easier to learn than p.</p>
<p>addressing people, especially specifically defined people groups such as: coworkers, bosses, servants, family members, clerics etc. is incredibly complex and a fascinating part of linguistics.
There are other languages where it's commonplace to refer to parents by their first name, or as already mentioned in other comments: japanese people refer to their siblings when it comes to a direct address with the japanese word for &quot;sister&quot;.</p>
<p>other languages are way more interesting than English when it comes to the direct address of people, or family members.
this ain't no ELI5, but for anyone interested in that topic i suggest starting to read about the concept of politeness and language, esp. Brown &amp; Levinson &quot;Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage&quot;</p>
<p>the basic breakdown of how you address someone is very complex.
Brown and Levinson postulate that humans have two distinct &quot;faces&quot;. A positive face and a negative face. The positive face is something like: I want to feel great and mighty and powerful. The negative face is I want to keep the stuff I have and not have anyone threaten me or my position.
Positive face politeness is saying how great the other person is.
Negative face politeness is saying how little of a person oneself is to make the other person appear bigger/greater than oneself in comparison.</p>
<p>How does that work in real life tho?
Well if you look at french for example, they have the &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vous&quot; for the english &quot;you&quot; singular and plural respectively. This so called T-V-Distinction can be found in other romance languages like spanish for example. If you used &quot;tu&quot; with some total stranger or a police officer or a person that is usually respected, that's considered rather impolite and offensive. You're (according to Brown &amp; Levinson) &quot;threatening&quot; their positive face by not adhering to societal standards in paying respect to their position in society.</p>
<p>English only has the &quot;you&quot;, but think about old english &quot;thou&quot;. You've seen it in bible texts and in religious contexts mostly.
Only a few centuries ago the thou got replaced by you. The politeness towards people like parents and immediate family members, which used to be addressed with a &quot;thou&quot; (informal, less social distance) got reinterpreted and children started to &quot;you&quot;(more formal, more social distance, but also respect) the parents to show more politeness and practiced the positive face politeness. This was in no way the children's choice obviously.</p>
<p>Funnily enough we find examples of people wanting to use a different way of expressing the lacking concept of plurality when it comes to the word &quot;you&quot; in English. The lack of distinction gives rise to words such as &quot;y'all&quot; or &quot;yous&quot;.</p>
<p>I could go on and on. Such a fascinating part of language &lt;3
feel free to ask more</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> &quot;thou&quot; is informal and more direct, which was a deliberate choice for the church at the time. 'God and his representations (priests, clerics, bible etc.) are so close and involved in society'. It was a kind of marketing scheme in that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My Sociology of Cognition professor gave some lectures on totemism and how people across cultures dedicate special titles as a collective to people they look up to, whether it's a community leader of some sort or a person within the family depending on the pecking order. </p>
<p>Mom is mom, Uncle Joe isn't just Joe but mixing uncle and Joe is ok because not as high up on the respect order as the parent. Kids raised by grandparents might call the grandmother mama since they play that roll. </p>
<p>All societies have pecking orders and status symbols, etc. It helps us cognitively sort the world around us. Where this originated I'm not sure, but the idea he was relaying is that we all, as collectives in society and as individuals, need to make sense of the social order around us by sorting people with signs of status and respect. </p>
<p>We say &quot;hey doc&quot; to doctors but we don't call them by first name, generally. </p>
<p>We say &quot;professor&quot; rather than just their name, maybe &quot;professor (last name)&quot;. Some adjuncts are ok with &quot;professor (first name)&quot; but my Sociology of Knowledge professor earned her PhD mid-semester and people started calling her &quot;professor (last name)&quot;. </p>
<p>There's no society out there without these designations of status, and it makes sense. Obviously mom has a higher status in one's life than the mailman, no offense to the mailman. </p>
<p>I don't know of any society where it's acceptable or normal across the board to call mom and dad by their first names only, but I might be wrong. Social sciences are fuzzy and my area of focus is more on current dynamics because I'm also studying public policy and political science but that's what I've gathered so far. </p>
<p>Hope this sorta maybe answers the question along with the other gems in this thread. There's no one exact answer I think, because even cognitive sociology is theoretical rather than full blown empirical, compared to say, chemistry and whatnot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In other words, OP is asking a question about why we stick with those words <em>instead of</em> actual names.</p>
<p>I'd actually like to question an assumption in OP's question, which is that &quot;actual names&quot; for individual persons (that they kept throughout their life) predated words for &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot;. It's much more likely that humans had &quot;words&quot; (or conventionalized noises) for referring to or getting the attention of their caregivers long before we had conventionalized names.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>These are really only relevant in the initial stages of a relationship. As you get to know them further you get more information from other sources than looks and your relationship (whatever it is) becomes more established. The relevancy of your attractiveness rating becomes diminished and it is therefore no longer benificial for you to judge them as harsly in either direction. </p>
<p>For example: &quot;Attractiveness&quot; can be a good tool for figuring out which potential mate it is best to invest time &amp; resources in on limited information. But once you're in a commited relationship judging the attractiveness of your partner as harsly is less relevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Since that's all you know about them, you will first think, &quot;Wow, they're really really good looking. Every other part of them must be just as good looking.&quot; But, after a while, you start talking to them and getting to know who they are. And maybe from those interactions, you begin to find out, &quot;Oh, maybe they're not as great after all.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you meet a very ugly person for the first time, you will first think, &quot;Ew, this person is ugly! Gross! Every other part of them must be ugly too!&quot; But, after a while, you might start talking to them and getting to know them too. And maybe from those interactions, you begin to find out, &quot;I was wrong, this person is actually pretty cool!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if you weren't five, I'd say it's all about first impressions and either holding high or low expectations of a person purely based on looks. Getting to know people over time changes those impressions and depending where you first hold them, it's easier to go to the opposite side.</p>
<p>However, this phenomenon isn't always true. You'll meet people in life who can be both attractive on the outside and inside as well as ugly on the outside and inside. Everyone's different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In this specific example, most genes that code for skin color also code for eyecolor. Fair skinned people have brightest eyes way more often, and dark skinned people with bright eyes really stand out because of its rarity.</p>
<p>Bright skin was adaptive to sustain vitamin D production in the skin with less sun. Bright skin contains less melanin, which gives the skin and the eyes it's darker color. Bright eyes don't have an optical advantage, the iris always blocks light, no matter the color.
Maybe after the first bright eyes appeared, there was some sexual selection because they were outstanding, or it made communication easier because the pupil increase due to arousal is much easier to see in bright eyes.</p>
<p>Tldr: bright eyes are a side effect of less melanin in the skin to allow Vitamin D production. Also Sexual selection</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Lighter color eyes appear the way they do because of a difference in the more anterior layers of the iris. The difference between light and dark eyes is not due to different pigments. The tyndall effect, similar to why the sky is blue, is the primary reason light eyes appear the way they do. Light colored eyes dont actually have a definite color. Since The color the iris is perceived to be is dependent on scattering of light, the ambient light will influence what color the iris appears to be. Some one can appear to have green eyes in certain lighting conditions  but more blue in others.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the effect of color on peacocks. Their feathers are all brown but it is the microscopic structure of their feather that create various light scattering effect producing what we see as vibrantly colored feathers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
