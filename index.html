		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acne is a &quot;multi-factor&quot; process.</p>
<p>Dirt/bacteria from the environment isn't the only or biggest reason for acne.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sebum</li>
<li>Androgen/Testerone</li>
<li>P. Acnes Bacteria</li>
<li>Keratin</li>
<li>Dead skin cells</li>
<li>Clogged pore</li>
</ol>
<p>First you have Sebaceous glands that release sebum which help lubricate your face for protection to keep foreign bodies, but when sebum gets stuck in the gland it's like glue.</p>
<p>Androgen (male) hormones help push the sebum out of your glands, but when you have a change in hormone levels, sebum is pushed out more rapidly and if the gland is blocked, the sebum is collecting inside while not being pushed out.</p>
<p>In our bodies we have the P. Acnes bacteria: it is an anaerobic bacteria and therefore cannot survive in an environment with oxygen. So the P. Acnes bacteria thrives when the gland is blocked because there is no oxygen and it feeds off of our sebum.</p>
<p>Keratin makes parts of our bodies harder (heh). The mixture of sebum, bacteria and keratin becomes a hard plug under the skin.</p>
<p>Just to add to the fun, dead skin cells also collect inside, especially if they are not washed off correctly.</p>
<p>When the gland remains closed off, nothing can secrete out of it. The clogged gland is at this point, filled with P. Acnes bacteria, old sebum, dead skin cells, hard keratin and androgen hormones are trying to push it all out on schedule but everything is stuck inside the gland with nowhere to go. This is what forms a pimple/pustule.</p>
<p>That is the basic process of acne.</p>
<p>The sebaceous glands are only located on certain parts of your body and therefore are not effected by this process. So your hands and feet aren't going to form pimples just because they touch dirt.</p>
<p>One could say the main cause is the P. Acnes bacteria. But the right conditions need to be met in order for a pimple to form.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert here but I believe it is caused by the sebaceous glands becoming blocked. Since there are many more sebaceous glands on the face, more chances for them to become blocked. Sebaceous glands excrete oil, known as sebum, to help lubricate the skin. When they become clogged, the gland continues excreting sebum. With the gland clogged, it becomes inflamed and thus, a pimple. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acne is, basically, a clogged pore (hair follicle) that becomes infected (by a specific strain of bacteria). Factors that reduce the frequency of infection include:</p>
<ul>
<li>desquamation (exfoliation)</li>
<li>sebum production (how much oil your skin exudes)</li>
<li>hygiene (how sanitary your skin is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some reasons acne is more common on the face:</p>
<ul>
<li>The skin on your face is thinner than skin on most other parts of the body.</li>
<li>The skin on your face also produces more sebum than other parts of your body. </li>
<li>We don't exfoliate our faces as much (friction from clothing helps with body). </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a swing at a possible explanation, albeit I'm no expert on the subject so maybe I can give something to think about until the experts roll in. So for starters, pimples are caused by inflammation of your pores. This is typically due to a bacterial infection, where the bacteria seep in to the pore, then your body attacks it which causes the redness, swelling, and puss. Although the pore itself may become blocked by oil which also results in pimples.</p>
<p>Now as to why it specifically happens more on the face, the answer is it generally doesn't. Acne occurs primarily in areas which are ripe in hair follicles. Thus why back acne, and pubic acne exist, and you may sometimes find acne on your arms and bum. This is due to the sebaceous glands, which secrete sebum, or oil, on to the hair follicle. Because of them neighboring so close together, there's the greater chance of bacteria getting in, although it's attacked pretty quickly and doesn't penetrate further. </p>
<p>Along with that, sebum can sometimes get blocked up and cause acne that way as well. While hair follicles are found throughout the body, sebaceous glands are primarily found in the facial, chest, and pubic regions. Thus why they're more prevalent in these areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Suppose that protons and electrons were really &quot;fundamental&quot; particles.  Then we'd expect high energy collisions of electrons with protons to be elastic because fundamental particles shouldn't have any internal structure that can &quot;store&quot; energy.</p>
<p>However, in experiments at SLAC where protons and electrons were collided, there was inelastic scattering - which means that the proton or electron took up the energy in some way, and that contradicts the hypothesis that they are &quot;fundamental&quot; in the sense of having no internal structure.</p>
<p>You can read about the experiment on wikipedia.  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inelastic_scattering" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_inelastic_scattering</a> )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deep inelastic scattering is basically taking leptons (electrons, for instance) and shooting them really fast at hadrons (like a proton or neutron). The electron essentially breaks apart the hadron and sends quarks flying. But the tricky thing with quarks is due to something called quark confinement, (or &quot;color confinement&quot;) they can't actually exist as an independent particle. So as the quark is being &quot;kicked out&quot; by the electron smashing into the hadron, all that matter/energy/mass (definitions get slippery at this scale) reforms into a new hadron, usually something a little more exotic than the protons or neutrons we're familiar with. Based on the scattering of these hadrons, we can infer that this is how they formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're misunderstanding the fundamental attribution error. It is not meant to be an explanatory framework for understanding human action and conduct. The fundamental attribution errror is a bias. It is a concept that describes the tendency among persons to attribute causes for an event to be either external (situational) or internal (dispositional) wrongly.</p>
<p>Imagine that you're part of a sports team. Your team is your in-group and you play against another team, an out-group. Now, it so happens that the other team score the first goal. According to attribution theory, the tendency on your team would be to make external or situational attributions to explain the goal. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The other team got lucky</li>
<li>One of your players slipped</li>
<li>Your goal keeper was distracted</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when your team scores you'd have a tendency to explain that through internal attribution. &quot;We scored because we are better than them, ergo: the goal was fully deserved.&quot; It might actually have been the other way around: your team got lucky and the other team, having better players, possessed advantageous dispositions, but because of the tendency to place attributions erroneously, we cannot see that clearly. It is an important dynamic in understanding in-group/out-group behavior, not a factual description of human behavior. There should be no contradiction between Social information Processing and the fundamental attribution error.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, all bases are equally easy to work with and do any sort of math with for most general purposes. In niche situations, where for some reason certain numbers keep popping up a lot more than you would expect them to randomly, OR if storage &quot;fits&quot; a medium neatly, a particular base might be better (purely due to more compact or evenly divisible storage), but that's not the case most times.</p>
<p>Base 2 for computers makes sense physically due to how we designed the transistors, for example, but even that was just a largely arbitrary decision of how we CHOSE to design them. You can (and people have done so) build base 3 computers, etc.</p>
<p>It's hard to even think of any other example of a system that inherently has some numbers come up more often, or where storage is more natural only in one way. Even if you think of counting with your hands, you could imagine doing so in MULTIPLE ways that all seem about equally reasonable based on the biology. One finger = one integer? Base 1. One finger = a binary bit? Base 2. The first way, but only for the left hand, then the right hand does tens? Base 6. Counting half-extended fingers at the knuckle to get three gestured states? Base 3. Count every finger, then raise a foot for tens? Base 11. Count each knuckle on your whole hand with an index finger of the other, then use lowered fingers on the other for tens? Base 16.

<p>Edit: Apparently many people don't like my blanket statement. The truth is these types of questions pop up on this sub fairly often because I think many non-experts think base representation is something fundamental or something that hinders our understanding of math or anything like that.</p>
<p>The answer to these questions is always the same: all of the important and useful properties of numbers have absolutely nothing to do with the base. The base is just a way to write down the number; it doesn't change the number in any way. So rationality, primality, being a power of 7, transcendentalness, etc. all have absolutely nothing to do with the base. </p>
<p>Sure, you can come up with some property that depends on the base. For instance, an integer is even if and only if its base-2 reprentation ends in 0. But who cares? That's not really too important and if you're going to reference the base specifically in your property, then you're just cheating the intent of my blanket ststament that bases don't matter. Because they really don't when it comes to the myriad of questions similar to that of the OP. </p>
<p>(Does base matter for some applications? I suppose it matters in how floating point arithmetic is performed. But, again, that's just so far from what OP is asking or what the myriad of similar questions ask. But I suppose part of one's expertise is knowing that stuff like floating point arithmetic is just irrelevant to the OP's question, and so I apologize for any confusion there.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If a computed simulation used <strong>limited precision arithmetic</strong>, then there are numerical artifacts that depend on the base.</p>
<p>Suppose are are living in a simulation, and the simulation is implemented with a computer that uses floating-point formats like our own computers do. In the common 64-bit binary floating-point format, the unit of least precision is 2^-52 times the value of the largest bit in a number. E.g., if an object is at a location represented by 5 units of distance, the smallest possible move the simulation could represent would be a distance of 4•2^-52 units (4 because that is the highest bit in the binary representation of 5 and 2^-52 because of the width of available bits in the format).</p>
<p>Imagine our technology progresses to the point where we can see some of these quantum effects in experiments (by which I mean numerically quantum, not quantum mechanics quantum). We might see that a distance of 5 units can be altered by amounts of 4•2^(-52), a distance of (say) 11 units can be altered by amounts of 8•2^(-52), a distance of 23 units can be altered by amounts of 16•2^(-52). The binary nature of the floating-point representation is visible in the quanta: They appear in amounts that differ in ratios of powers of two. (We do not need any knowledge of the absolute magnitude or meaning of the units of distances. We just observe that the ratios of quanta are powers of two.)</p>
<p>If the implementation used a base-10 representation of floating-point, we would observe the ratios of quanta to be powers of ten.</p>
<p>So, if we are in a simulation, it is theoretically possible that the numerical base used to compute the simulation could have effects we might observe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The golden ratio is a beautiful mathematical <em>idea</em>, but it doesn't manifest in nature as much as is claimed in videos on youtube or books about the universality and even mystical significance of the ratio. It is 'pop' science, tenuously connected to a wide array of natural processes because people find that idea aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p><em>Mathematically</em>, the golden ratio is fascinating. It is the irrational number with the simplest continued fraction expansion...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and it is the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. </p>
<p>Fibonacci numbers <em>do</em> show up in science, in ((almost?) exclusively biological) natural processes, though this relationship also doesn't occur as much in nature as is often claimed. The number of spiral patterns in the arrangements of leaves around branches, petals around flowers, and scales around pine cones are often consecutive Fibonacci numbers - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotaxis" target="_blank">phyllotaxis</a> - and the higher those numbers get the closer the placement of elements around those spirals is related to the golden angle (the golden mean as applied to the circumference of a circle). This arrangement arises because it is the simplest and most efficient way to arrange petals (for example) such that they all get the maximum amount of sunlight with the least amount of work.</p>
<p>In a sense the golden ratio is a lot like a Platonic 'ideal' - the idea that circles (for example) are always just approximations of some ideal perfect circle, that the forms of everything we see in nature are imperfect shadows of pure ideal forms that we cannot perceive directly. In that sense the golden ratio is the ideal, perfect relationship that is approximated in natural forms by the Fibonacci numbers. This leads some people to assume that there must be something universally important about the golden ratio, in the way that ideal-but-inaccessible forms were considered important to ancient Greek philosophers. But such ideas are in the realm of philosophy, not physics.</p>
<p>tl,dr: the golden ratio is fascinating in mathematics as the eventual limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and as an organizing principle in some spiral biological processes. Claims that the golden ratio has some other significance or cosmic relevance might be interesting philosophically, but they have little to do with science.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The golden ratio is so common in nature because it is the product of such a simple idea: the ratio between the first thing and the second thing is the same as the ratio between both those things and a third thing. It's what you always get when you tell cells or leaves or branches or scales to just &quot;grow more of yourself.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As has been noted in several posts, brain functions are in many ways &quot;geographically&quot; located. It is very common for Alzheimer's disease to first impact the left temporal lobe. In more &quot;classic&quot; presentations, the disease impacts two regions, the first being the medial temporal lobe where hippocampus is, a formation that plays a major role in memory functions. The second, moving outward (towards the ear) is a region of the temporal lobe very important for language functions. </p>
<p>In addition to memory difficulties, another classic first symptom of AD is language disturbance called anomia, or the inability to name objects.  In daily living this is observable when people have more &quot;tip of the tongue&quot; moments&quot; or circumlocution (talking around the name of the object). Example, when grandma asks for a pen, but cannot come up with &quot;pen&quot; --- &quot;Can you pass me that...you know that thing you write with....it has ink..&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Different kinds of memory (such as semantic (memory of facts), procedural (memory for skills like walking or playing an instrument), and episodic (memory for events that happen to you)) are localized in different parts of the brain. Language (both understanding and production) are also localized separately.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're suffocated by being locked in a small box, it's not actually the lack of oxygen which is the problem.</p>
<p>Normally the cycle is 20.9% oxygen, 0.04% CO2 in, then 16% oxygen 4% CO2 is exhaled.  </p>
<p>Inhaling 1% is very uncomfortable, &quot;stuffy&quot; air.  7%-10% CO2 is toxic and will lead to suffocation <em>even if there's sufficient oxygen</em>.   Excess CO2 will change blood pH and the body can't handle that.</p>
<p>So if you exhaled into a bag along with a tank of pure O2, well you could add the equivalent of +4% pure O2 on one side and vent out 4% of the volume of gas on the other side, but the CO2 mixed into the air so you don't remove the 4% CO2.  No, the new CO2 level after partial venting is 3.84%, still toxic.</p>
<p>So we're got 3 problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can't maintain breathable air by just adding O2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can't breathe pure O2 when diving either, O2 is toxic at the increased pressures experienced while diving.  We can't dilute it with CO2 either, it can ONLY be diluted with nitrogen or (rarely) with helium.</p>
</li>
<li>We don't want to waste any volume of air here other than the CO2, but we can't just vent CO2 selectively.  Not only would we waste the remaining 16% O2, but a larger volume of inert nitrogen too, and we don't want to carry a huge volume of nitrogen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Same's true for spacecraft.  Spacecraft can't tolerate high O2 either because it makes everything super-flammable.</p>
<p>What we have is a CO2 scrubber of lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide.  These adsorb ONLY CO2 from the air and form a carbonate, this does reduce the volume of air and and equivalent volume of O2 can be added.  The nitrogen (78% on Earth, varies in diving and space ships) is not consumed nor regenerated.  The CO2 is literally &quot;scrubbed&quot; out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a certified rebreather diver. I dive the Poseidon MKVI and 7.</p>
<p>The rebreather machine is basically a Nitrox mixing machine on my back. One of the small bottles is 100% O2. The other is regular air. On the surface it feeds me the pure O2. As I dive it blends more and more air into the system to keep the gas safe to breath. </p>
<p>The breathing system is a closed loop. Bubbles only exit the system when I use the gas for buoyancy purposes. The O2 will get used up by my body to survive so there is a sensor that automatically replaces the O2 as my body metabolizes it.</p>
<p>The CO2 my body produces is deadly so there is a chemical in the system that absorbs that CO2. That's called the scrubber. Mine is a prepackaged sodalime chemical that I can buy at any rebreather specific dive shop.</p>
<p>That's about it. Rebreathers are great. They are totally silent. Fish don't run away when they see you. They seem to think you are just another fish instead of a bubble spewing monster. One very small 2L tank of O2 can last me three - four hours of diving. If you dive with regular divers that ends up being an entire weekend of 2 tank diving. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans don't exhale solely waste gasses - in reality, there is still some oxygen in the gas mix that you breath out. Rebreathers function by allowing this gas to be recycled, adding appropriate amounts of oxygen from the tank to the recycled air, and by filtering out gasses such as CO2 (IIRC). I can't give you any exact numbers, but this is my understanding from reading the Wikipedia page a while back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simplified : </p>
<ul>
<li>breathing consume only a small part of the dioxygen in the inspired gasses, &quot;replacing&quot; it by CO2</li>
<li>So you still have O2 in the expired gasses, and it is mainly the CO2 which could become toxic when re-inspiring expired waste gasses.</li>
<li>Rebreather work by removing this CO2 from the expiring gasses, keeping them breathable</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the details are a lot more complicated than that (what is used for removing CO2, how to keep partial pressure of O2 high enough and so on), but the barebone principes are these.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the olden days, credit cards were often not scanned with the mag strip, because the equipment was still too expensive for smaller retailers.</p>
<p>What they did instead was use a carbon paper and a roller machine to take an imprint of the front of the credit card with the numbers. This was commonly part of the receipt, and one copy would be torn off and given to the customer.</p>
<p>The problem with this, of course, is that now all these receipts you are just throwing away left and right have your whole card number on them. </p>
<p>This is where the extra numbers on the back to confirm an online(or at the time, over the phone) purchase can be used,  if you only had a receipt you found with the front of someone's card, you would not have all the numbers needed to complete a transaction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>They're in a different spot than the main credit card number, so if you get a picture of the credit card you still can't use it because you don't have the security code.</p>
</li>
<li>On systems that save your credit card number, they are not supposed to save your security code, which means you need to type it in in order to place an order. That means that if someone else gets access to my computer or login, they can't order stuff for themselves because they don't have my security code. The same goes if the seller's system gets compromised, enabling hackers to access our credit card numbers - but they can't use them without the security code.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to /u/Dacke comment... Android Pay is actually way more secure because when it transmits a credit card, it actually transmits a one-time credit card generated just for this transaction, so stealing it is pointless.</p>
<p>As with any security system any time you have <em>static</em> or non-changing information it is considered easy to individually compromise. </p>
<p>The new chip in new credit cards in america means that you never actually transmit the credit card number to the payment system. Instead you transmit an identifier and a rolling code. The code is verified by the server to verify legitimacy. Since reading the code is pointless since it changes by algorithm every few seconds you have a much more foolproof system. So <em>at least</em> the card readers in every store are no longer attack-vectors for credit card theft. Previously you hack a credit card reader provider and you get <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>edit: I'm sorry I think I mixed up android pay and the older Google wallet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just three extra digits, it's a separate code that is used very differently.  The credit card number identifies the card, can be read by card readers from the magnetic strip, and is stored by merchants' systems that store your card information.  Or, if they use the old machines that make an imprint of the card, that number is on the imprint (which means the full credit card number is on the receipt).</p>
<p>The CVV code (the three extra digits) is just written - on the back of the card, with no raised plastic, so it won't appear in imprints and won't be as easy for people to see or photograph.  It is <em>not</em> stored when your card number is stored, and PCI (the standard in the US that companies that take credit card numbers are required to abide by) places more restrictions on where you can keep that number.  It can only be temporarily kept for use during a single transaction, and that's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a set of regulations that dictate the payment card industry called PCI.  if you want to do anything with payment cards you have to be PCI compliant.  One of the major things in PCI compliance is you cannot store the CVV (those digits).  You also cannot store the mag stripe data.</p>
<p>This makes it hard to copy a card from legitimate hardware.  It also allows companies to tell how you used your card.  Merchants are charged different rates for &quot;card present&quot; (you physically swiped your card) and &quot;card not present&quot; (you typed in your card number, like an online purchase).  There are other categories and large companies can negotiate rates.</p>
<p>The numbers are also present on the back of the card, which makes copying the numbers more difficult.  If I wanted to steal your credit card number with the CVV I'd have to see both sides of your card.  This means is most likely need physical possession of the card, I cannot sneak a picture.</p>
<p>When you combine these features it makes it more difficult to steal someone's card number.  It doesn't make it impossible but does out up enough barriers to stop a good amount of low-level thieves.  Furthermore the way the numbers are used with mandatory industry standards they serve a purchase for the men behind the curtains that run the show.</p>
<p>Lastly I've called the digits CVV but different companies and networks may have a different name for them.  They serve the same purpose though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's quite simple. Advertisers pay money to Google/Youtube for the rights to show an advertisement before (or during) a video. Google/Youtube takes a cut of the revenue, and the Youtuber earns the rest.</p>
<p>The amount advertisers are willing to pay in terms of cost per click or cost per view, is dependent on many factors, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The popularity of the Youtuber / video</li>
<li>The target audience of the Youtuber / video</li>
<li>How competitive (from an advertiser perspective) the video is (or its associated keywords are)</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain videos are not eligible for monetization (so Youtubers typically won't earn ad revenue from them). This includes, for example, many videos depicting nudity or sex and videos containing extremely foul language or controversial / offensive topics.</p>
<p>If a video contains commercial music, sometimes the music publisher or record label will file a copyright claim over the video and instead of taking it down will request the Youtuber's revenue share instead. So, in these cases, the Youtuber is not penalized but also does not earn ad revenue from the video.</p>
<p>Youtubers also make lots of money (much more than standard ad revenue) by negotiating product placement deals directly with advertisers to personally use and/or promote a product (such as a mobile app, web service, gadget, etc.) within their video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend is a popular YouTube creator (currently between 150k-250k subscribers). There are three core ways YouTubers make money. </p>
<p>(1.) YouTube AdSense: </p>
<ul>
<li>This is purely getting paid for views on videos, because there are ads on videos, such as display ads (the ads next to the video), overlay ads (ads that pop up at the bottom on the videos), and skippable and non-skippable video ads before the actual content. Depending on the time of the year, the amount a creator is making is roughly between $1 to $2 per 1,000 views. YouTube does this because they are getting a cut of the revenues that the advertiser is paying for on the videos. Some videos are not &quot;monetizable&quot;, so the creator will not earn anything for the views. This is generally because of offensive content within the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) Sponsored Content:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is advertising within the video itself. This form of advertising can occur in many different forms, but a few examples would include companies paying for their products to be featured in videos, merely having the products mentioned in a video, or saying something along the line of &quot;this video is brought to you by [XYZ Company].&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>(3.) Selling Branded Products:</p>
<ul>
<li>This one is pretty obvious. Selling t-shirts, stickers, hats, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>My girlfriend is only involved in (1.) &amp; (2.) at the moment, and she made ~$50k in 2016. Each community within YouTube is different, but in her sphere, the majority of earnings come from sponsored content with AdSense being a nice bonus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ad makers pay YouTube to put their ads on YouTube videos. YouTube keeps a portion of that money (around 30% I think) and then pays the youtuber based on how many views they get. For a non-partnered youtuber, it's about 10 views for 1 cent, 100 views for 10 cents, 1,000 views for $1, and $2,000 for 1 million views (these are all estimates, it varies a lot). I'm not sure how different it is for partnered YouTubers, but I think it depends more on who they're partnered with. It also depends on your viewer base, and more specifically, how many viewers have Adblock.
On videos over 10mins you can put extra ads, and therefor some extra money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
