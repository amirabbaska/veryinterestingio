		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why were taxes so high?  World War II. </p>
<p>All the military equipment, all the soldiers' pay, all the medical expenses, all the expenses had to be paid, somehow.  </p>
<p>That somehow was with debt. Debt that had to be paid off by the government over the next 20-30 years.  </p>
<p>So, during WWII, the British government (and ALL governments, actually), sold massive amounts of debt (war bonds) to everybody and anybody.  </p>
<p>Years later, that debt had to be paid off. With interest.  To raise the amount of money needed to pay off that debt, the tax rates had to be ridiculously high, especially on high earners.  </p>
<p>Remember, England was VERY hard hit by the war.  Rationing did not end until the mid 1950's.  </p>
<p>Even the US had tax rates around 90% on top earners, in order to pay off the US war debt, pay for the rebuilding of Europe, and maintain the military at war footing for the first couple decades of the Cold War.  </p>
<p>And, during that time, the US (and the UK) paid DOWN their massive deficits to more sustainable levels.  </p>
<p>So, the whole debt crisis thing we keep talking about today, we KNOW how to reduce the debt.  </p>
<p>We just don't wanna.  </p>
<p>Were taxes that high sustainable?  Short term,yes. Long term, there wasn't a NEED to maintain the tax rates that high, once the hump of paying down the War Debt was gone.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have dealt with questions of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6h2o0u/what_should_be_free_but_isnt/divvgx5/" target="_blank">tax brackets and flat taxes</a>, but I'm going to turn to the second part of your question: was it sustainable? The short answer is, yes. Probably. The history of taxes (especially in the US) is a fraught one, but it really can be divided into two eras: pre-Reagan, and post-Reagan. It's not a case of Democrat or Republican, no matter who might tell you otherwise. Tax rates reached their peak under Eisenhower, and they were lower under Clinton and Obama than they were for six out of Reagan's eight years in office.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, it's important to note that current top tax rates are <strong>not normal</strong>. Between the start of WWII and the Reagan Administration, <a href="http://federal-tax-rates.insidegov.com/" target="_blank">the top tax bracket never dropped below 70%</a>; since 1987, it's never risen above 40%. Why? Well, it mostly boils down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics" target="_blank">trickle-down economics</a> -- the belief (for better or for worse) that cutting taxes on the top earners will allow them to invest their money more freely, thus providing jobs down the line. As an economic theory, it's pretty flawed, not least because it assumes that the rich <em>will</em> reinvest their money, rather than squirrelling it away, as is often the case; if you want money put back into an economic system, it works better to give it to the poor, because they pretty much <em>have</em> to spend it. (Sidenote: 'trickle-down economics' is a branding nightmare to begin with, but it was originally known as 'horse and sparrow' economics -- the theory being that, 'if you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows'. It's got its detractors, is what I'm saying.)</p>
<p>Recent Presidents haven't been too keen to be seen to raise the tax rates (even though a more progressive tax structure actually benefits the majority of people), because a lot of people have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the tax bracket system works. They hear that number go up, and they immediately assume they'll be worse off, when in most cases they wouldn't be. (Take Reagan's tax shift in 1988. Under Reagan's plan, someone earning the median individual income in 1988 (<a href="http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php" target="_blank">$25,872</a>) would have paid about 19% in tax. Someone earning the same amount just two years earlier would have paid just 13.8% of his income in taxes. Compare that to someone earning $250,000, on the other hand: he would have paid about 27.7% in 1988, but 41.9% two years earlier. The top tax rate lowered from 50% in 1986 to 28% in 1988, but poorer people <em>actually paid more</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Similar systems worked for decades. It might have needed a little tweaking, but generally yes, it would have been sustainable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its important to note that not all the income of a top earner was taxed at 95%. Income taxes usually work by brackets. Example with made up figures: Your first $18,000 is taxed at 10%, then $18,001 to $75,000 is taxed at 15%, etc. </p>
<p>In the U.S., the highest bracket currently is ~39% starting at ~$418k, so only income above 418k actually gets taxed at the highest rate. </p>
<p>I assume it works/worked like that in the U.K. too, where only income above a certain amount was taxed at 95%. </p>
<p>I wanted to point out tax brackets because I've run into so many people who don't realize that they're a thing. </p>
<p>As far as if it was sustainable...¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
<p>I have a feeling political ideology will drive the answers in here because economics is hard and confusing and usually doesn't give clear cut answers. </p>
<p>edit: fixed some typos. Rushed this answer then jumped in the shower so I didn't do any proofreading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right, so as an actual British person who has studied modern British history, I can give you an actual answer that isn't from Americans talking about America and WW2. </p>
<p>Following WW2, the two main parties, Labour and the Conservatives, agreed on major policies in a consensus known as Butskellism, named after the Conservative Rab Butler and the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell. </p>
<p>This consensus basically followed the economic theory of Keynesianism which is that idea that the aim of the state should be to keep unemployment as low as possible and the best way to run the economy was to borrow to invest. Part of this theory was substantial high taxes on the wealthy which also helped pay for Britain's extensive welfare state and the sluggish economic situation at the time. </p>
<p>This consensus lasted until 1979 when Margaret Thatcher came to power and established a new consensus following monetarist policies. This is similar to &quot;Reaganomics&quot; in America. She, and Reagan, believed that individuals spent their money better than the government and so reduced taxes. She reduced the top rate of tax from around 83% to 40% in her first term and it's been like that ever since. </p>
<p>As to your question of &quot;was it sustainable?&quot;, well yes,  taxation like that lasted for 30 years and probably would've gone on for longer of Thatcher's economic policies hadn't become dominant in the UK</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I think a lot of people are missing here, at least in America, is that while yes ww2 was a cause, another big reason for high tax rates was a response to the depression. Income inequality was at record high, the working class was suffering, unemployment was at 25% and there were huge outcries for action. There was a huge movement to &quot;soak the rich&quot; by sticking it to them with high tax rates. So they made the top bracket for rich people 90%+ and used it to find new deal programs. Of course no one actually paid said rates because they implemented loopholes to allow rich people to invest in businesses and jobs. This caused businesses to expand in order to avoid being taxed. This not only created jobs, but well paying jobs that led to the the post war economic boom with the middle class being as rich as it was. </p>
<p>I'd argue one of the reasons income inequality is rising again is because we lowered these rates. So the rich hoard the wealth to themselves, and the incomes of the bottom 80% stagnate or decline. </p>
<p>To be fair I'm not sure the same justifications of the 95% policy apply to the uk, but that is one way of looking at it in the us. It was used as an incentive for the rich to invest their money into companies and grow the economy rather than increasing their own paychecks. No one actually paid 95% in practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>heavier elements were seeded through the universe by supernova. Specifically by Population III stars and the large examples of Population II stars. </p>
<p>Supernova are unimaginably violent and energetic. The matter blown off by them from them isn't just flung out a little distance and then pulled back in, the shockwave is moving at thousands of kilometers per second. the Gravity of the solar system doesn't stand as chance. Given a bit of time, that matter gets spread and distributed over a very very large distance. </p>
<p>And then another star goes supernova. And then another. And then a few million more. And so on. Each of them flinging those heavier elements out into their galaxies/protogalaxies.</p>
<p>In the meantime star formation hasn't stopped.  In the heart of giant molecular clouds throughout the galaxy, hydrogen is happily collapsing into new protostars, except instead of mostly pure hydrogen with bit of helium and a very little bit of lithium those first stars have spread heavier elements into the mix. This actually accelerates star formation in those molecular clouds  since the higher density particles make it a bit easier for gravity to do it's thing. </p>
<p>A few billion years of supernovae and there's now quite a lot of heavier elements out there. Relatively speaking anyways. The build of hydrogen in whatever molecular cloud are sun formed in collapsed in this &quot;modern&quot; era of star formation. Hence why we're here sitting on sitting on a rock mostly made up of those heavier elements talking about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In the early universe there was a huge abundance of hydrogen and as a result, many many giant stars that lived short violent lives. Coupled with the expansion of space, it wouldn't necessarily have to be a local star. </p>
<p>Also a good amount of the mass is converted into energy such as gamma rays and x rays. But the rest of the mass could be in a huge distance away from us, depending on the origin star(s). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are techniques for automated processing of crash reports.</p>
<p>Generally, the goal is to match failure report(s) to a (known) problem. [1] [2] [3] [4] Initial approaches revolved around matching the call stacks generated at the time of a crash. [1] [3] Bartz et al. [5] applied a machine learning similarity metric for grouping Windows failure reports. This is done using information from clients when the users describe the  symptoms of failures. The primary mechanism for measurements is an adaptation of the Levenshtein edit distance process, which is deemed to be one of the less costly string matching algorithms.
Lohman et al. [4] technique consisted of normalizing strings based on length before comparing them. They applied metrics commonly used in string matching algorithms, including edit distance, longest common subsequence and prefix match.</p>
<p>Kim et al [6] developed crash graphs to aggregate a set of crash dumps into a graph, which demonstrated to be able to more efficiently identify duplicate bug reports and predict if a given crash will be fixed. Artzi et al [7] developed techniques for creating unit tests for reproducing crash dumps. The approach consists of monitoring phase and test generation phase. The monitoring phase stored copies of the receiver and arguments for each method and the test generation phase restores the method and arguments.</p>
<p>Le &amp; Krutz [8] noted that the same fault can result in different call stacks and developed the technique of grouping crash reports by cross-checking manually and automatically grouped crash reports to derive grouping criteria. Dhaliwal et al [9] on a case study of Firefox observed that grouping crash reports by two or more bugs together increased the time-to-fix for the bugs, and proposed a grouping approach that produced one group per bug.</p>
<p>Automated crash report grouping is nowadays thought as a requirement for every crash reporting solution.</p>
<p>After crash reports are grouped, there are also automated approaches dedicated to forensic analysis [e.g. for <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsdevsol/2014/06/26/automating-analysis-of-windows-store-crash-reports/" target="_blank">Windows store apps</a>]. There are multiple patents on <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US6763517" target="_blank">similar goals</a> (scroll down to &quot;Reference by&quot; section).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a mid sized software company and my delivery team is responsible for our main product (80%+ of sales). We have tools that give us reports on the post back errors each morning and they are designed to help us decide which order to tackle the issues in (there are far too many to complete all of them).
We use metrics around the number of clients affected, or if one of our big important clients are affected (like every business, some clients are worth far more to the company than others so they get preferential treatment) or the total number of hits on a single issue regardless of client. We the spend a couple of hours on these before moving onto the new functionality we want to add.
We also have a section on our report for our support team who work with clients. Here there are things like issues we already resolved (ie. ask client to take upgrade) or where there might be an environmental issue (failed to write a file due to being disallowed permission to the directory or something - here, support can work with the clients IT to resolve). Basically anything that won't require a software change.
This may or may not be industry standard, but it is what we do to try and reduce the issues.
Hope this helps! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, in the sense that it can be used to clarify multiple intertwined misconceptions about AI.</p>
<p>First, <em>what is artificial intelligence</em>?</p>
<p>In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of &quot;intelligent agents&quot;: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003). The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. [1]</p>
<p>In colloquial use, what is implied by <em>AI</em> is what John Searle hypothesized as &quot;strong AI&quot; (Searle, 1999, &quot;Mind, language and society&quot;), which is inadequately defined. Quoting Searle: &quot;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds&quot;. The field of AI initially was founded on this premise; the claim that human intelligence &quot;can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it&quot; (the Dartmouth proposal). It has become exceedingly clear this description eludes us (machines have no mind, and our emulation of organic brains has only been done at a very small-scale, see OpenWorm)  that's why CS has moved gradually to a definition that excludes (mental) facilities once thought to require intelligence: optical recognition, competing at a high level in strategic games, routing, interpretation of complex data, etc. This is the reason approaches like the CM-originated &quot;cognitive simulation&quot; have been abandoned.</p>
<p>This is the first major problem with &quot;true artificial intelligence&quot;: to test for it, one must first define it precisely and unambiguously.</p>
<p>Secondly, Searle's &quot;strong AI&quot; is now a <em>long-term</em> goal of AI research, and not part of its definition. Creating lifelike simulations of human beings is a difficult problem on its own that does not need to be solved to achieve the basic goals of AI research. Believable human characters may be interesting in a work of art, a game, or a sophisticated user interface, but they are not part of the science of creating intelligent machines, that is, machines that solve problems using intelligence. Its creation, existence, and implications are more relevant to the philosophy of artificial intelligence (Turing, 1950, &quot;The Imitation Game&quot;), the impact of which on actual AI research has not been significant (John McCarthy, 1996, &quot;The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence&quot;, What has AI in Common with Philosophy?)</p>
<p>AI researchers have argued that passing the Turing Test is a distraction from useful research [2], and they have devoted little time to passing it (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003). Since current research is aimed at specific goals, such as scheduling, object recognition, logistics, etc. it is more straightforward and useful to test these approaches at the specific problems they intend to solve. To paraphrase the analogy given by Russell and Norvig: airplanes are tested by how well they perform in flight, not by how similar they are to birds - aeronautical engineering isn't the field of making machines that behave like pigeons, to fool other pigeons.</p>
<p>So, secondly, due to its irrelevance to the modern understanding of the field as well as the complexity of its imprecise definition, &quot;strong AI&quot; is not an active area of R&amp;D.</p>
<p>[1] This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell &amp; Norvig 2003, Luger &amp; Stubblefield 2004, Poole, Mackworth &amp; Goebel 1998, Nilsson 1998</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this question is more a philosophical one. What is intelligence? Turing test proposes that if it can function like a human it is intelligent. But then again i believe there are humans who would fail turing test. Also animals are also intelligent in their own way but do not function like a human. If we were able to create a true virtual dog it would not pass the turing test but i would still say it is a true artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I think we have invented a true artificial intelligence when we have a system that has some kind of theory of mind (basically has it's own ideas and goals etc.) and that is able to adapt to arbitrary new situations (within limitations of it's sensory inputs of course). It does not necessarily have to be able to fake being human. </p>
<p>So my answer is, AI development is not much concerned with turing test and neither is the definition of intelligence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>True artificial intelligence is going to be a moving goalpost for a long time.  There will need to be a line drawn regarding if it counts as AI if it is just a huge matrix of preprogrammed responses to things.  Look at early models such as SmarterChild which was on AIM.  Some would argue that would count as AI because unless you tried to trick it, it could converse fairly well.  It could carry on better conversations than most 3-5 year olds depending on how you judge the quality of conversations, but you could easily expose the weaknesses of its design with creative phrasing.  There are also those 20 questions electronics games.  I could think of &quot;wombat&quot; and by answering yes or no questions, it could tell me I was thinking of a wombat in less than 20 questions.  This seems like AI at first but it is really just a flow chart with a over a million possible end points. </p>
<p>So even if we eventually have robots running around that can own a home, hold down a job, and even socialize with humans, is that a sign of real AI or is it just a more elaborate version of the 20 questions game that now uses its sensors to collect information of its surrounding and basically answer millions of its own questions to choose from one of trillions of different actions based on a huge flowchart that was generated through years of previous tests and simulations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, most people with epilepsy are not photosensitive.</p>
<p>Some types of epilepsy can be triggered by stimuli at a specific frequency. So in some cases, a person might be sensitive to lights flashing at a particular frequency. Another person might be sensitive to loud, rhythmic sounds at a particular frequency. </p>
<p><strong>Short Answer :</strong></p>
<p>The same way any form of over-stimulation causes seizures.</p>
<p>The flashing lights cause the brain send out too many brainwaves at once. This results in a seizure.</p>
<p>This type of epilepsy is known as photosensitive epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>Long Answer :</strong> </p>
<p>Photosensitive epilepsy results when a neural circuit somewhere in the brain resonates with a sensory input, and the brain fails to keep that resonance under control.</p>
<p>Flashing lights tend be a very powerful pattern of stimulation as they can activate both on and off retinal ganglion cells (cells in the retina that respond to changes int the state of light). Scientists who study the visual cortex will often use a drifting grating of black and white bars to elicit a strong reliable response. The reason why some epileptics might respond to this stimuli probably has to do with how those signals are handled beyond the retina, in the thalamus or cortex. What happens at that level is hard to answer. Broadly speaking these areas are wired or have properties that make them poor handlers of highly synchronous stimuli. One possibility being recurrent excitation coupled to low inhibition could cause an epileptic like state in the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who buy cars generally do not like sounds intruding in the cabin. Although modern cars have many forms of sound deadening from simple to carefully engineered, the carpet remains a large part of that sound deadening. More cleanable floor coverings would tend transmit more sound to the cabin, or would be heavier than carpet.</p>
<p>People who buy cars generally like them to feel luxurious. This feeling of luxury probably began with horsedrawn coaches but moved to cars and other vehicles. If you have never really seen a car with its carpet gone, its a fairly naked and ugly sight, appealing to certain people, but not at all to most. Floor coverings that are not carpet would not have this effect, and don't sell all that well in the general market.</p>
<p>Carpet in a car insulates the feet from metal, much as home carpet insulates the feet from cold boards. Like any fabric blanket, it helps trap heat inside the car in the winter, and at the very least gives the illusion of warmth to the occupants in low temperatures which is almost as important.</p>
<p>The adsorbent nature of carpet that makes it seem like a bad choice is in fact a sort of boon. Something like a thin sheet of formed rubber in place of carpet would seem a better choice to use when moisture is expected. But water, trash, and dirt would still collect on such flooring, while water would slosh around the floorboards in all but the driest climates. Trash and dirt would be easier to see, and the car would look nasty sooner. Instead carpet traps any water and dirt so that they can be contained and removed later. </p>
<p>Cleaning some sort of rubber or other floor would probably involve lots of scrubbing around on the surface with towels in order to clean, and in practice would not be much less odious. No, you cannot hose out the car. The whole car interior would have to be designed for hosing/powerwashing, meaning materials that are either very expensive or very unpleasant to deal with. Electrical systems in the cabin would need to be even more expensively designed and likely heavier in order to resist an expected regular bath. In the end, no matter what you make the flooring out of, cleaning a car interior is a hassle. Minus the powerwashing, you are still down there scrubbing away at your rubber floor.</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but the average car's carpet can be pulled all the way out with a minimum of trouble by the properly equipped. If the carpet is utterly ruined, it can actually be replaced without much trouble, or it can be vigorously washed. Other solutions, like rubber, could do the same, but would be either be thin enough to rip and wear through, or thick enough that they add significant weight to the car compared to carpet. Excess weight is undesirable for economy and performance reasons. As many have pointed out, carpet is not actually that hard to clean, even in the car.</p>
<p>The addition of drains to floors seems obvious, except that the modern car floor is full of bumps, depressions and ridges meant to increase rigidity and serve engineering purposes other than channeling water. Either floors would be more expensive to design without carpet, or many drain holes would have to be strategically added, adding failure points to the floor for leakage, cracking and encouraging rust. Rust needs no encouragement and must be strenuously battled. Carpet covers all this ridged unsightliness well while asking for very few favors from the engineering process and adding no problems mechanically. </p>
<p>Carpet is actually the easiest, most effective way to solve the problem of car flooring, pleasing the owner and making things easier, and thus less expensive to the manufacturer, which results in lower prices, and there we go pleasing the people who buy the cars again. The modern vehicle carpet has been exhaustively designed to do that job very well. Many, many smart people have asked why carpet, and yet, we always return to fuzzy stuff on the floor, for all the reasons I mention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I doubt you'd particularly enjoy being in a vehicle without carpet either... The noise reduction is a lot more than you are thinking it is. You'd end up with an echo filled, extremely loud vehicle without it, while with it you have some degree of insulation from the noise... And it should perhaps be mentioned that no single material can be manufactured cheaply that does all these things.</p>
<p>That's basically all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did it for a while. There's a lot to it, but here's how I can simplify it easiest:</p>
<p>There's a complicated math problem that a lot of people are trying to solve. You run a program called a miner on your computer that repeatedly tries to find the answer to that problem. When it does find the answer, it gets shared between all the other people who were also trying to answer it, and when they confirm that it's the right answer, you're rewarded with whichever type of cryptocurrency you were mining (e.g. bitcoin). The answer also includes the next math problem everyone has to solve, so all the miners start working on that. Rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>It's actually very simple to start mining on any computer, but you'd end up spending more money on electricity than you'd ever earn, so don't bother. I can go into more depth if you have specific questions but the actual cryptography is over my head. I have done a lot of reading about the various hashing algorithms used and how they work but I couldn't explain it well enough. It's been over 2 years. There are also a lot of cryptocurrencies with different methods, so I understand some better than others.</p>
<p>Edit: For everyone informing me of the existence of altcoins, yes, I know, I only ever mined those (until multipools got big and then I took my payouts in bitcoin and let them decide what was worth mining). I meant it wasn't worth it to CPU mine them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't mine, but it does a decent job for an ELI5 answer </p>
<p>&quot;look, it's simple. you have a Happy Burger brand fast food establishment, and sometimes kids come in and want their Happy Burger brand Happy Kiddy Burger, which according to the Happy Burger brand franchise operating instructions is supposed to be 4oz of usda utility grade hamburger lightly grilled and pressed into a poppy seed bun with two slices of mild pickle and a slice of tomato and a piece of iceberg lettuce and the name of the kid written on the top in half an ounce of Happy Burger brand special sauce about which the less said the better</p>
<p>so naturally what you do is, you post an ad saying, cooks wanted, please bring your own grill and meat and bun and pickle and tomato and lettuce, we'll supply the sauce</p>
<p>and you get an applicant, and you send him down to the Hall of Cooks, which is a featureless infinite plane that you keep in the unlit basement of your Happy Burger brand fast food establishment. and you tell him to just keep making burgers and handing them up, and if he hands up a burger that satisfies your standards, you'll pay him a bonus, which is $100,000, plus the price of the burger, which is $.50</p>
<p>now the cook can't see too good down there, and he keeps handing up burgers that are more like pickly meatballs with a swastika painted on the side in tomato sauce, but as long as the meat's cooked the health department won't shut you down, so you keep taking them and dutifully handing down briefcases of cash with a few quarters tossed in. and the cook's pretty happy, even after you summarily declare one day that you're only going to pay $50,000 per burger in the future</p>
<p>so the cook calls in a friend, and she sets up in the Hall of Cooks and starts handing up burgers, and now you're getting acceptable burgers faster than you can sell them. so you raise your standards a bit, and you insist that burgers have to be on a bun, and that cuts production back down to a manageable rate. but the cooks are still pretty happy, even after you cut the burger bonus again to $25,000</p>
<p>this goes on for a while, and now you're got a hundred cooks down there, and you're started demanding that they spell out the kid's name correctly, and that's not easy. so now they're not just making burgers to your increasingly exact specifications, they're racing each other to be the first to get the kid's name right. but you're still paying $5,000 a burger, and apparently the cooks are still happy, because more and more keep showing up</p>
<p>you get curious one day while you're squeezing into your franchise past the giant mountain of rotting discarded hamburgers, and you head down to the Hall of Cooks. the last time you came down here, there were only six cooks, and they were just standing around in a disorganized circle; but now they're organized into these large groups. in one of them, you find your first cook, and he shakes your hand. &quot;remember when we just started out and i was lumping up store meat by hand and cooking it on that tiny old george foreman?&quot; he laughs. &quot;That was before we figured out cookie cutters and rolling pins.&quot; he's standing at a huge professional-grade charbroiler with twenty-four different patties arranged on it; suddenly, in a single efficient flash of movement, he flips them all over. of course, the dull glow of the grill isn't enough in the utter blackness of the Hall, and most of the patties end up on the ground, which you suddenly realize is a lot spongier than it's supposed to be. also, doesn't the ceiling seem lower? you shake it off and head back upstairs to start taking orders, wondering when it'll be the right time to cut the bonus to $1,000</p>
<p>it's been another year. there are tens of thousands of cooks in your basement. you're rejecting burgers for sloppy handwriting. you're rejecting burgers for having too thick a slice of tomato. you're rejecting burgers for excessively clustered poppy seeds. seven months ago, the cooks started building floor-to-ceiling ovens with internal robotics custom-designed for making Happy Kiddy Burgers; now there are whole fields of them, each making ten thousand burgers a second. of course, it's still pitch-dark down there, and the cooks aren't exactly susan calvin, so almost all of those burgers get added straight to the end of the Great Greasy Mountains, but it's amazing how quick they come now. you overhear a few of the cooks talking excitedly about the orders they just placed for massive new ovens from Barbecue Labs. you don't know how any of them can afford this when the burger bonus is only $100&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You notice how people crack Nazi jokes about the Germans all the time - and none about Imperial Japan? It's because the Japanese Empire and their atrocities simply aren't well known. It's important to recognise that it's the same way in China; if you were to fly the Rising Sun Flag in Beijing, you would quite rightly get a proper thrashing. Fly the Swastika? Weird looks at most. It's just that things matter a lot more when they happen to people close to you, who are similar to you. </p>
<p>In addition, the West has made a (justified) concerted effort to completely destroy Nazism's reputation. Nothing of the sort happened in Japan. There just wasn't an awareness of what happened in the East, outside of those actually involved in the Pacific theater, so Japan never had the reputational demolition that the Nazis had. I don't mean to imply that Western media intended to &quot;protect&quot; Japan as such, or that they swept it under the rug. It's just that there was both a lack of awareness, and also just a lack of fucks to give in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is the comfort women, Chinese and Korea women taken as sex slaves. I'm willing to bet the same thing happened in the Philippines and Singapore. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as a warning this is a HIGHLY simplified version of how they work:</p>
<p>(most) solar panels are made from two thin sheets of silicon.  Silicon has a very regular crystal structure, but each layer has been mixed with a small amount of two other elements.  What this accomplishes is that one layer has a crystal structure with some extra electrons and one has a crystal structure missing some electrons.</p>
<p>When you connect both layers the extra electrons move over to fill the holes and it just sort of sits there.</p>
<p>If you put this silicon sandwich in the sunshine, that sun has enough energy to knock an electron loose from one side, and then the electrons all shift places to fill in the new hole.  If you hook a bunch of these small cells together into a big panel you can get the electrons to flow through a wire and you get electricity out of it.  </p>
<p>Keep combining more and more panels (made up of lots of tiny cells) and you can get a lot of energy.  When the sun goes away all the electrons find all the holes and the whole things just sits there waiting for the sun to shine on it again.</p>
<p>If you hook a battery into the mix you can charge that battery with the electrons (again very simplified) if you connect it to the grid you can power your home, or you can use it for anything else that you would use electricity for.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br />
A lot of people have asked about &quot;where the electrons come from&quot; or &quot;can the panel run out of them&quot; etc.  As I stated above this is a VERY simplified explanation.  The electrons don't actually move around, and again this is highly simplified, but think of it more like they bump into their neighbor which bumps into its neighbor, etc.  They are not actually moving around the wire, or the panel.  Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Someone also asked why not one big panel instead of lots of little ones, and the answer to that is that no matter how big your panel is, it will always produce the same voltage.  A little tiny solar cells pumps out about .5 volts so does a really big one.  So if you want 12 volts, or 120 volts, etc you have to string the smaller panels together. In the same way you can take a whole bunch of AA batteries and get enough voltage to run something large, you can take a whole bunch of small solar cells and put them together in such a way that you can get the voltage you need.</p>
<p>Different solar cells work with different efficiency in different wavelengths of light.  Most commercial solar cells work best in full sun, but can still function in diffuse light.</p>
<p>Solar cells seem to degrade a bit after about 25 years, and then slowly degrade after that, some very old solar panels from the 50's are still going strong with relatively minor degradation.  With the current dramatic price drop in solar cells, it is very likely that the roof or the stand you have them affixed too will wear out before they do, and even then it will be nearly free to replace them in the future (assuming costs keep going down and efficiency keeps going up, which it can still do for a long time before we reach limits imposed by physics).</p>
<p>Here is a cool chart of all the different solar cells being tracked by efficiency. (how much sun they turn into electricity).  <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png" target="_blank">https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png</a></p>
<p>as you can see some cells are doing pretty good (46%), although they might be very expensive.  </p>
<p>Roughly 1000 watts of solar energy falls on 1 square meter of ground, so at 46% a meter of that solar cell would make (roughly) 460 watts of energy.</p>
<p>As you can see as the price of the cells comes down, as does the price of battery and inverter tech, solar has a very real chance of powering just about the entire world.  Combined with smart grids, grid energy storage, electric car energy storage, and increases in efficiency, solar and other renewables are clearly the energy supply we should be backing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The core principle of solar cells is the p-n junction. The n-type material has impurities consisting of atoms that add more electrons than silicon atoms normally have, and the p-type has added atoms with fewer electrons (quantized as &quot;holes&quot; with the opposite charge of electrons). When these are stuck together at the junction, the extra electrons from the n-type diffuse across to the p-type, and the holes diffuse across to the n-type, so the number of electrons balance out.</p>
<p>However, since the n-type atoms have lost electrons, that side now has a net positive charge, and the p-type side now has a net negative charge. An electric field has been created through the crystal that tries to push electrons back into the n-type side.</p>
<p>As others have explained, when light hits the cell, it &quot;knocks&quot; electrons free. They absorb the energy of the photons and are free to move through the cell, leaving behind holes where they used to be. The electric field separates the electrons and holes, pushing the electrons to the n-type side and holes to the p-type side (a process similar to diffusion, known as drift). The more light, the more charges are separated to collect on opposite sides of the cell. This is the photovoltaic effect! The cell now has a voltage across it, and when you connect a light or battery or other load, the voltage pushes electrons out of the cell and through the load.</p>
<p>If you want more information, pvcdrom is an excellent resource that I regularly use, maintained by some of the best solar researchers in the United States!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many materials absorb light when it hits them. When a solar panel is hit by light it also absorbs the light, but it does this because the light knocks into an electron and makes the electron excited (which absorbs the light). This excited electron wants to move around a lot and it jumps around from atom to atom. But because of the way solar panels are built the electron can only move in one direction. If you have a lot of light hit the solar panel then a lot of electrons will be knocked around and &quot;freed&quot; to flow through the material, but only in that one permitted direction. Hook something up to the panel so the electrons have somewhere to go and they'll flow right through whatever you hooked up. And there you have electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
