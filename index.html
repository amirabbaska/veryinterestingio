<p>Source: It makes sense in my head so I hope that's how it is</p>
<p>Edit: think of the atoms. As the ball rolls, the object itself stays on the ground, but each surface atom is constantly going up and down, taking turns hitting the ground and then getting rolled back up. That's what makes up all the tiny impacts that cause the sound</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>a sphere and a plane meet at a single point. because of this, even a tiny ball exerts enormous amounts of pressure on the table it's sitting on. as a result, both the ball and the table deform. just a little bit, and not permanently. this bending and unbending of both the ball and the table causes noise even with the best materials.</p>
<p>in practice, of course, balls aren't perfectly round and tables are not perfectly flat. the ball will click and clatter as it's flat parts hit the table all at once. the table will creak and groan as the divots and wood grain strike the ball. etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because humans have evolved what basically is two systems of thinking.<br />
System 1 is the instinctual, intuitive process that all animals have.  It is fast, has access to nearly all of your memories, and brings quick information based on heuristic shortcuts.  Part of this is is an individual-recognizing system that automatically says &quot;this is Bob.&quot;  Almost all animals have it, though it is not always based on vision of faces.
System 2 is the conscious, intentional thought.  This is slower, and you have a limited amount at a time (focus or attention), but it allows you to assess things in a more ordered detailed way.  This is thought to be what we call sentience.<br />
When you intentionally study a face, you are calling on system 2 and suppressing system 1, so you can view features and not &quot;Bob.&quot;  This throws off your automatic pattern recognition that is the default.  It creates some dissonance in your mind, and the face without the automatic intuition seems strange or alien.<br />
This topic interests me a lot because being aware of your conscious vs automatic thought processes can be really useful, because system 1 is usually working with more information, but it has a tendency to jump to conclusions and have a lot of biases.  Awareness of when and when not to rely on the things that automatically pop into your head can make your decision making much better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I do same with most things - &quot;car&quot; = boxy zoom zoom thing that moves me place to place and smells like freedom and America.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Judaism is what's called an &quot;ethno-religious group&quot;. Thousands of years ago, that was pretty common. If you were Egyptian, you almost certainly also followed the Ancient Egyptian religion. If you were Jewish, you almost certainly also followed the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>This was to the point that it was almost &quot;by definition&quot;. The Egyptians didn't expect non-Egyptians to follow the Egyptian religion, and the Jews didn't expect the non-Jews to follow the Jewish religion. There are writings from antiquity talking about how whenever someone traveled to a different place or married into a different tribe/nation, they'd sacrifice to the local gods of the area, not worrying about the ones back home until they got home. During times of war, there would be attempts to lure the other side's god(s) to your side with offers of better sacrifices or whatever.</p>
<p>Again, this was the common state of humanity and its various groups for thousands of years. It was generally assumed that there were many gods of many nations, each set of god(s) looking out for their respective nations. Pantheons were fluid, with gods in different pantheons being identified with each other (oh, you have a thunder god too? It's probably the same guy, you just call him Bob instead of Spencer, next time I sacrifice I'll call out to Bob too...).</p>
<p>Where the Jews and Judaism differed from most others is that they became strict monotheists (there's evidence that at the beginning of the Jewish religion they were more accurately &quot;henotheists&quot;, meaning they recognized that other gods existed, but only theirs was the best/most powerful/chief).</p>
<p>(EDIT: Above I originally said that henotheism meant that they felt it was only right to worship one, not that one was the most powerful/chief/best. The correct term for thinking it's right to worship only one is &quot;monolatry&quot;, which is a difference that I swear I knew before. Props to u/Zorro_Darksauce for the correction.)</p>
<p>This monotheism gave rise to the idea that non-Jewish gods didn't exist. While they shed polytheism, they didn't shed the nation-god association, meaning that God was <em>their</em> God and while He was also everyone else's God, everyone else had a lesser role in His plan and weren't required to do as much and/or were denied His special favor.</p>
<p>The other way in which Judaism differed from many others is that this dynamic continued until today. The other major examples that I can think of would be Shinto and Hinduism, but there are countless religions of equal pedigree and age around the world that are often lump under the generic &quot;folk religion&quot; tag.</p>
<p>This is contrasted with religions like Christianity and Islam, which were founded as religions not for a particular people, but for <em>all</em> people. As a result, they had an imperative to go out and convert others to their religion that was lacking in the earlier dynamic (and would even have been viewed as kind of silly...&quot;they're not Japanese, why would they practice Shinto?&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I answer your question, I have to note that most of the answers here, even those with hundreds of upvotes, are in part or even wholly wrong. I don't know why there is so much ignorance about Judaism - it is not exactly a secret religion and there is plenty of fairly authoritative information about who we are and what we believe on the Internet (well, I guess a lot of BS written by non-Jews and even anti-Semites, too, so maybe it is difficult separating truth from reality here).</p>
<p>To dispel some of the myths I've read so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Judaism does accept converts and has so since ancient times. It is only frowned upon because Jews see the obligations incumbent on Jewish people alone (613 commandments) is an unnecessary burden for Gentiles to take on (who are obligated to follow 7 commandments). Jews believe that Gentiles who follow that tiny subset of obligations to be just as righteous as Jews who follow the full set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Judaism doesn't stress the afterlife like Christianity and Islam do, what's clear from our tradition is that it is not reserved for Jews. Everyone (everyone) ends up in the same place: &quot;the world to come&quot; (which is ambiguously defined since, well, no one has ever come back to tell us about it...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sincerity is important for conversion, so the idea that converts are only allowed to take in spouses is diametrically wrong. Prospective converts are routinely denied if they are found to be doing so just to appease future in-laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only are converts considered as Jewish as someone born Jewish, there is actually a commandment that Jews can not treat converts differently, and can not even draw attention to the fact that a convert wasn't born Jewish. A convert is as Jewish as Moses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;God's chosen people&quot; is completely misinterpreted. Among Jews familiar with our religious tradition, it has always meant the obligations of Torah and the fact that the Jewish nation chose to accept them. It has never meant we believe God loves us more than Gentiles; this is a strawman invented by Catholic authorities ages ago in order to demonize us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Judaism, there is no concept of race. It is meaningless. There are and have been Jews of all sorts of national origin since ancient times, not least due to the fact that conversion has always existed (the book of Ruth is literally about Judaism's first convert). As for how we feel about treating people who are different based on their looks/national origin: in the Bible, Moses's sister Miriam is struck with a sort of disease when she makes fun of Moses's (African) wife, and God doesn't release her from the disease until she repents for days.</p>
</li>
<li>There is no concept of a &quot;racial Jew&quot; or &quot;partial Jew.&quot; You're either Jewish or you're not; you were either born to a Jewish mother or a convert, or you're not Jewish. Period. Someone with a Jewish father but a Gentile mother is not Jewish (unless s/he converts). And since both mother &amp; father contribute the same amount of DNA to a child, the idea that Judaism cares about how much &quot;Jewish DNA&quot; you have is simply not true.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to answer your question: </p>
<p>Judaism is only a religion. The reason that, in certain locations in the world, Jews look broadly similar to one another is that those groups historically didn't intermarry (they followed the religious commandment to marry another Jew) and conversion was either frowned upon or outright forbidden (sometimes under penalty of death or punishment of the Jewish community) by the surrounding population, or there was so little contact between Jews and their Gentile neighbors that each population evolved separately.</p>
<p>It might be helpful, though, to think of the Jewish people as a nation. You can either be born to a nation automatically and have all the obligations incumbent on you automatically by virtue of your birth, or you can join the nation (&quot;naturalize&quot;) by agreeing to follow rules and being accepted by a designated authority.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are several different ethnic groups of Jewish people that wouldn't have similar features. Your average Ashkenazi Jewish person isn't going to look exactly like your average Sephardic Jewish person isn't going to look your average Bukharan Jewish person isn't going to look like your average Cochin Jewish person, because during the several Jewish diaspora, the Jewish peoples moved into other nations, fell in love with and had children with local ethnic groups, but also had a significant degree of intermarriage and unique customs that each of these groups became distinct ethnically.</p>
<p>With regard to Catholicism/early Christianity/orthodox faiths, remember that during its spread, the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, etc., spread them by force and conquest, and sent missionaries out to every land under the sun. &quot;Catholic,&quot; as an adjective, literally means &quot;universal.&quot; The idea was that everyone was obligated to convert to Christianity. Some iterations of the faith took this to mean &quot;... or die!&quot; while others did not. So the reason why there is no strong ethnic association with Catholicism (there are weak associations; the Irish, Italians, Latin Americans, etc.) is because Catholicism never envisioned itself as the faith of any particular ethnic group. It was always practiced by multi-ethnic groups of early Christians. </p>
<p>Judaism, on the other hand, was the ethnic religion of the Hebrews, much like all of the Indo-European groups had some version of the PIE religion. Catholicism, for the most part, wiped out folk religions of Indo-Europeans, to the point today where all attempts at reconstructing those folk religions for worship are at best copies of copies of what we think someone eight hundred years dead thought about those religions. But there are always movements within ethnic groups to practice that group's traditional religion. It's just that the Jewish peoples, like a few others (Zoroastrians, for example), have managed to maintain and preserve their ethnic folk religion in a way few others have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Thing is, it's basically in the realm of ethnicity and community. And converts ARE accepted, there's just a prohibition on proselytism and a conversion process is long to make sure that people really want to go through it. There are also many types of Jews (Kaifeng, Ashkenazi, Mountain, Beta, Mizrahim, etc) but we're united by the faith (even if many aren't religious), common family ties and the fact that we're around 1% of the world's population.</p>

I grew up next to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_in_Mexico" target="_blank">Mexican Jews</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Rivera" target="_blank">Diego Rivera</a>. There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Israel" target="_blank">black Ethiopian Jews</a>. Natalie Portman looks nothing like Sammy Davids Junior who looks nothing like Mila Kunis or Daniel Radcliffe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, be very wary of the concept of &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_categorization%29" target="_blank">race</a>&quot; itself, as there is a widespread suspicion amongst modern scientists that the idea that people can be classified into races is untenable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example in humans it's about 1.2*10^(-8) per base pair per generation. This can vary even within the human population though -- older fathers have more mutated sperm, which is why paternal age correlates to health problems. It can certainly vary between species, though I don't know by how much.</p>
<p>In particular, bacteria reproduce asexually (mitosis) while humans reproduce sexually (meiosis). The latter is a more error-prone process than the former. [EDIT: not the full story, see /u/EasySeven 's reply]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution and mutation rate are two dfferent things. If a species only produces &quot;bad&quot; mutations, then selection just weeds those bad mutations out. But what a &quot;bad&quot; mutation is, depends on the environment, so the same mutation can be bad in one environment and good in another.</p>
<p>Then there is also the population size. A larger population produces more mutations than a smaller population (seems logical of you think about it). A larger population is also likely to have more genetic diversity. </p>
<p>Evolution works on selection pressure on genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is created by mutations. </p>
<p>To answer you question: bacteria tend to have a larger population size than multi-cellular organisms, even than humans. It is hard to generalize, but I guess selection pressure is also higher in bacteria. So, yes, bacteria are probably evolving faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First things first, the rate of evolution is not the same as the rate of mutation. Evolution refers to how individuals adapt to their environment while mutation is just changes in genetic sequence. </p>
<p>Now, the human body is remarkable at preventing mutations. Mutations primarily happen during replication (the process where DNA is copied). In this process the DNA double helix is opened up by various proteins, and then an enzyme latches onto the DNA string and slides across it, while catalyzing the reaction that adds the complimentary Nucleotide. </p>
<p>A core feature of DNA is that it's reverse complimentary, meaning that every single nucleotide compliments another one. There are four nucleotides in DNA, Adenine and Thymine always bond, and Guanine and Cytosine always bond. So DNA is copied by splitting the DNA double helix, and having an enzyme catalyze the addition of the complimentary nucleotides to the DNA string, which ends in two copies of the original DNA strand.</p>
<p>So already that enzyme which catalyzes the addition makes it so that  only complimentary nucleotides can be added. But in one out of every thousand additions, a wrong nucleotide is added. But another enzyme checks the additions, and removes wrongly added nucleotides. Together these two mechanisms makes it so that only 1 in a 1,000,000 nucleotides is a wrong one. And finally another repair system &quot;The mismatch repair system&quot; checks the newly synthesized DNA  strand one final time after the synthesis is done, and cuts out any wrongly synthesised parts. In total these three mechanisms make is so that only 1 in 10^9 mistakes are made when synthesising DNA. </p>
<p>This mechanism is present in both bacteria and humans, thus the two mutate at rougly mutate at the same rate. </p>
<p>Now the reason that Bacteria can evolve more quickly than humans is because of something called horizontal gene transfer, which is a way in which different bacteria exchange DNA in the form of plasmids (DNA pieces seperate form the circular DNA in bacteria) that can be exchanged between bacteria. This mechanism does so that Bacteria are incredibly efficient at exchanging DNA, and it is through these exchanges that something like antibiotic resistance can quickly spread through an entire bacterial population in a very short amount of time. </p>
<p>Naturally this discounts the environmental factors, to which bacteria are much more exposed, which also cause mutations.</p>
<p>So in short, bacteria and human cells mutate at the same rate, but bacteria are much more efficient at transfering any beneficial mutations between one another and thus &quot;evolve&quot; faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  Depending on &quot;how good&quot; the molecular mechanics is, and how long (i.e. how many potential places there are to have a mutation), the mutation rate will vary between species.  A couple other people have mentioned those numbers and compared humans to other species.</p>
<p>I'm going to also add that it can vary with position in the genome, and environmental conditions.  For example, your immune system has some cells that produce antibodies, and the antibodies are coded for in their DNA.  However, when the immune system senses that it's under attack, some of these specific cells undergo what is called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation" target="_blank">Somatic Hypermutation</a>&quot; -- there is a special mechanism that makes the particular regions of DNA that codes for antibodies mutate up to a million times faster than everything else.  This results in many different cells with different antibodies; the ones that work get used (they divide <em>without</em> the mutation system turned on), while the ones that don't don't.</p>
<hr />
<p>E: Another example: HIV is known for it's very high mutation rate: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26375597" target="_blank">(4.1 ± 1.7) × 10^(-3) per base per cell</a>.  That's on the order of 100k times faster than other things, and is part of the reason it's so hard to fight off.  That number is high enough that in a &quot;full-scale&quot; HIV infection, the virus can experiment with changing every base pair in its genome <em>every day</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only is the rate different between species, it can be different between genes within the same species.  Some organisms have mechanisms that selectively increase the mutation rate of targeted portions of their genome.  For example, our immune systems recognize pathogens by their surface proteins, so it is advantageous to mutate these proteins more rapidly than ones in their metabolic pathways.  This is a naturally occurring version of site-directed mutagenesis.</p>
<p>One way this is achieved is by carrying broken copies or fragments of the genes near the functional copy.  These can incorrectly bind to the functional gene and increase the chance of a copy error.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you go to bed at night, you've been moving around all day and your muscles are still prepped and active for movement, and weaker as you've been using them all day. As you're laying in bed, unless you're utterly exhausted, you have to find a position where your muscles can relax best. Once you fall asleep, you stop moving completely for a few hours on end which causes your muscles to stiffen. When you wake up in the morning, you generally feel amazing as you've begun moving again and stretching. Stretching makes your muscles relax and stiffness of sleep go away, which is why it feels so awesome to lay in bed after waking up and moving a bit. Your muscles are so relaxed after a morning stretch that any position is comfortable.</p>
<p>This is also why it's so much easier to fall asleep at night if you do proper stretches throughout the day.</p>
<p>It could also be a psychological thing either caused by the warmness of the blanket vs coldness of the morning, or having to do with getting up and going to work</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

During the night, we cross over into our night vision by undergoing a process called dark adaptation. Our rods in our eyes become more active than our cones because their primary function is to pick up on the absence or presence of light (i.e. light or dark). The rods have basically no job during the day other than say the obvious, &quot;There is light everywhere!&quot; But, at night, the rods have a much more interesting job to do. The eye's focus on using its rods also makes the cones perceive green as brighter than red since the cones shift their focus and now have the easier job. This is a perceptual reason why night vision goggles and displays use green light. It is also the reason why the vast majority of alarm clocks use red light to avoid disrupting sleep as much as possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been 4th amendment issues raised with various spying programs, but several times various federal courts have declined to rule, citing a lack of evidence the plaintiffs were damaged by the programs in question.</p>
<p>The following cases are examples, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_v._National_Security_Agency" target="_blank">ACLU v. NSA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLU_v._Clapper" target="_blank">ACLU v. Clapper</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_v._NSA" target="_blank">Wikimedia Fdn v. NSA</a></p>
<p>This question of standing is fundamental. Because the programs are secret, it is impossible to know what information of yours may have been intercepted. </p>
<p>By the way, it is case law that someone has no expectation of privacy over information that was shared with a third party. e.g. when you dial your phone to reach your aunt, you shared the fact that you dialed that number with the phone company, therefore it cannot be information exclusive to you and your aunt, and therefore no private information is taken when the government read your call records. </p>
<p><strong><em>TL;DR</em></strong>: Simply saying &quot;three-letter-agency probably knows what web sites I've visited&quot; isn't a lawsuit you can file, because (a) you don't know whether they know, and (b) even if they did know, you had to ask a third party (your ISP) for the websites, so that wasn't harm anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Patriot Act, and other statutes and amendments, Congress has created a special court, known as the FISA court, to review the sufficiency and constitutionality of highly sensitive requests by the federal government agencies and agency components involved in gathering intelligence information on individuals within the US involving the national security of the US. The FISA court is staffed by certain constitutionally appointed federal judges (see Article III of the Constitution) who serve for set terms in that capacity.  The Article III federal judicial branch long has been understood to exercise final interpretive authority over what is permissible government action under the Constitution (see Marbury v. Madison).  The executive branch of the federal government cannot act through its intelligence gathering and law enforcement capacity to obtain information in certain ways, including the real-time surveillance of electronic transmissions (i.e. &quot;wiretaps&quot;) and similar invasive techniques, unless the request or program is first submitted with adequate evidence for its necessity through the FISA court process for review.  This usually includes periodic returns to the court for it to monitor both the progress and the continued need for this exceptional kind of surveillance.  To submit a FISA warrant or request, the Department of Justice imposes serious internal review requirements, including approval by the AG or, sometimes, her delegate.  For these reasons, the obligation that the executive branch obtain Art III judicial review under a process authorized by congressional statutory action, coupled with the necessity of proving a national security justification and submitting the activity to continued judicial monitoring, have so far been determined adequate to satisfy the constitutional concerns they raise.  And if there is a program involving electronic surveillance by federal law enforcement based on national security concerns (that is, not justified under ordinary criminal warrant requirements) that involves US citizens on US soil which hasn't been approved in secret by the FISA court according to the requirements of that system, then the action is illegal and unconstitutional. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order to sue in a court of law, especially against a government, you need what is called &quot;standing&quot; </p>
<p>That's provided either specifically by a law giving you access to the courts (so the statute itself says &quot;people like X, Y or Z can sue to enforce this statute&quot;) or by the concept of &quot;injury-in-fact&quot; in that you were actually and specifically harmed by the unlawful act. </p>
<p>there's a derivative of that &quot;injury-in-fact&quot; standing which is essentially allowing non-injured parties to step in for the injured parties and exert their rights on their behalf.</p>
<p>to make the technical discussion very brief, groups like the ACLU haven't had too much success (so far, BIG point) in asserting standing on behalf of a generalized class of harmed individuals, so they literally need to find a straight-up victim of the unlawful act. </p>
<p>unfortunately, what typically happens is that that specific harm winds up disappearing well before the merits of the lawsuit get fully litigated through the entire appeals chain, or the parties settle and it doesn't actually work to provide broadly-applicable judicial precedent about the law.</p>
<p>you need to understand that NSA spying is relatively recent when you're looking at things on legal timelines - courts take a LONG time to resolve issues (they are inherently, and damn well should be, extremely conservative institutions), so the fact that this has been going on for 10-15 years is actually a point in favor of the &quot;the judicial system is working on it&quot; side of things. </p>
<p>eventually, something egregious enough may come to light and the court system will accept a lawsuit and modify the standing doctrines to allow it - this is how the law generally winds up evolving to address things. </p>
<p>for an example, abortion restrictions typically evaded another &quot;Justiciability&quot; requirement (this is the general term used to explain what each litigant needs to have in order to properly present a claim to a court) - that of mootness. Because, by the time an abortion restriction lawsuit came to the court, easily 9 months could have passed (and you didn't have a claim unless you were pregnant, because of the opposite justiciability requirement, ripeness, - no point fighting over an abortion law if you weren't pregnant) and, poof, there's no abortion to fight over. </p>
<p>So the supreme court changed the doctrine of mootness to account for this and the &quot;Capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot; exception to the (non-)mootness requirement was borne in Roe v. Wade itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brown noise helps you focus by removing auditory distractions.  Its the same idea as closing your eyes to help you hear or smell better.</p>
<p>Brown noise works better than simply blocking out sound with earplugs because our hearing become more sensitive when it's quiet.  In a completely silent room where you can &quot;hear a pin drop&quot;, the faintest of sounds (e.g. the aforementioned pin) will stick out.  Your brain needs to assess all of these faint sounds to ensure they aren't important (a threat, your name being called, etc.).  If you are listening to brown noise, you can't hear anything other than the brown noise, so there are no other sounds for your brain to assess.  Furthermore, your brain determined the brown noise was unimportant and could be ignored within a few seconds of turning it on, so with no new sounds to interpret, you've done the auditory equivalent of closing your eyes.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a bit more science, we can talk about brain regions.  Although there are specialized areas for different types of sensory processing (occipital lobe for visual stimuli, the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe for auditory stimuli), this information still travels to the frontal cortex to be consciously assessed.  Brown noise allows the primary auditory cortex to stop bugging your frontal cortex with dumb messages like &quot;HEY! A DOOR JUST OPENED!  DO WE CARE?&quot; and lets it focus on important things, like the exam I should be studying for right now.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR listening to brown noise is the auditory equivalent of closing your eyes to focus</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Your brain is especially attuned to detect changes in your surroundings. If there's a low level of background information...when it's silent almost any sound can alert your brain and you can't help but to pay attention...like a dripping tap or a snoring partner...white, pink and BROWN noise playing across all frequencies are like a muffling blanket of sound....they mask other sounds by making them less significant when compared to the background&quot; </p>
<p>...I didn't explain it like you are five, [its from this SciShow] (<a href="https://youtu.be/9T978ES0LdQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/9T978ES0LdQ</a>)</p>
<p>Essentially brown noise isn't distracting, its a nice blend of sounds balanced for the human ear so that the highs aren't too high. This helps minimize outside interference allowing you more brain power to focus on the task at hand rather than wasting it interpreting random noises, a trait which may at some point in human evolution permitted you to survive and extended your gene pool's fitness but now, in the age of information, prevents you from studying.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are looking for is most likely the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_resonance" target="_blank">stochastic resonance</a>.
Simply explained, it works like this:</p>
<p>To successfully send and receive a signal, your nerves/neurons need to get their electrical signal over a certain threshold so that it counts. </p>
<p>If you add random but constant noise to the situation, it adds to the strengths of all signals, making them more likely to cross the threshold and being effective. </p>
<p>The German wiki-article has a good picture too explain it: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/6f/Stoch_reson_example1.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/6f/Stoch_reson_example1.png</a></p>
<p>So now more of the signals have effect, which is similar to having better concentration/&quot;stronger brain signals&quot;.</p>
<p>The isolation from distractions is also very useful, but complete silence without distractions would have less of an effect than white noise.</p>
<p>A related example would be one of the main factors of ADHD:
Due to a lower dopamine level, control-signals in the frontal lobe are less likely to have an effect and an ADHD brain needs more effort to reach the same level of concentration/control. If you correct the dopamine level through certain drugs (which would put other people in TOO-MUCH-DOPAMINE-EVERYTHING-IS-INTERESTING-MODE aka &quot;being stimmed&quot;), concentration returns to normal level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Polycarbonate will dent and scratch easier than glass because its softer than glass, but as a result it will not shatter. <del>Usually you dont notice these, and if your glasses get really bad, you can actually get the lenses buffed and polished back to a smooth shine.</del> (you cannot buff scratches in the actual lens, as it will alter the prescription, but on the top layer and antiglare coatings can be reapplied.)</p>
<p>Gorilla glass on iphone screens, for example, is much harder so that it doesnt scratch and can be made thin enough for the sensors to detect your finger on it. The drawback with this hardness is that instead of deforming (denting) when it gets a hard impact, it will shatter much easier than polycarbonate does.</p>
<p>This same phenomenon can actually be seen in diamond &quot;the hardest substance on earth&quot; The only way to cut diamond is to use a diamond coated cutting wheel (EDIT because not everyone's 5: or cleave it along an axis specific to its crystalline structure.) . When I was little, I thought &quot;then how can you cut diamonds to make the wheels to cut the diamonds to make the wheels...&quot; BUT diamond is SO HARD, it can be pulverized with relative ease.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers like your phone is heavier and your glasses are plastic, a phone has very sensitive technology directly behind the glass.  It needs to be able to detect your finger as well as having a 1080p display that is crisp and clear.  Because of this, the glass has to be thinner.  As with any brittle substance, thin pieces are exponentially easier to break than something slightly thicker.</p>
<p>Your glasses also have more give.  Meaning if they fall on a lens, the body of the glasses can bend slightly to absorb impact.  There is no such give with a phone.  Think of the karate move where you break a cinder block.  If the to holders are spaced out, its much easier to make it crumble than if you balanced it on one stand and hit it dead center.</p>
<p>But seeing how much abuse my glasses take without a scratch, i'm pressed to say that at least mine are plastic lenses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
