For those who are his friends and family, protecting his anonymity is about respecting his desire to live and work this way. </p>
<p>There are photos of him out there, but this tight knit inner circle is effective because there is never a verifiable confirmation by anybody who knows him personally to say &quot;yes - that's him&quot;. So the photos and &quot;Is This The Real Banksy???&quot; headlines are just left hanging out there.</p>
<p>Statements can be released through spokespeople. Works done in public spaces might be created by Banksy, but put up by other people. Anyone brought in from outside to be involved in a work will only deal with Banksy's crew, not Banksy himself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Thing is, everyone prefers not knowing. His identity already Is Banksy. Outing him fully, with confirmation, would just mean Banksy stops making work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Climate at high-obliquity&quot;, Ferreira et al, Icarus 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mit.edu/~pog/src/ferreira_climate_high_obliquity_2014.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.mit.edu/~pog/src/ferreira_climate_high_obliquity_2014.pdf</a></p>
<p>For a water-covered Earthlike planet tilted at 90°, they find a relatively moderate climate, all things considered.  Summer pole temperatures reach 310 Kelvin (100 F), winter pole temperatures around freezing, coldest year-round temperatures at the <em>equator</em>, which gets less sunlight on the annual average.</p>
<p>Wind speeds at ground level are similar to the regular Earth, but the pattern is somewhat different.</p>
<p>I'd consider their simulated planet &quot;totally habitable&quot;.  The ocean and atmosphere are very effective at smoothing out the large differences in heating across the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing about Uranus that I thought was great to dwell on -- At the beginning of Summer, the Sun is directly above the pole.  That means that, to an observer at the pole, the Sun is nearly motionless ... and is directly above.</p>
<p>It does not set or rise, and its light comes down directly.  That spot should become what would be relatively &quot;very hot&quot; for the planet.  It would depend on how long the planet was in that position.  For Uranus, it is close to that for decades.</p>
<p>I --think-- that is unique in the whole solar system.  For a period of decades, the Sun seems motionless in the sky directly overhead.</p>
<p>That is why I was surprised at that paper that was mentioned.  Yes, the continually sunlit pole is warmer than the side that gets no light at all for a long time, but the atmosphere movements distribute it far more than I would have thought.</p>
<p>As I remember it, when Voyager swung past Uranus, (I hope I have this right correct me if I am wrong) the planet was in that summer solstice position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not that smart but I learned in science class that Uranus is tilted at about 60 degrees which actually causes it to have 1/3 of the year in complete darkness which greatly decreases the temperature. Uranus also has 1/3 of the year in total daylight which increases the temperatures drastically.</p>
<p>This darkness and brightness creates very cold winters and very warm summers. Uranus most likely does not contain life forms due to extreme changes in climate.</p>
<p>Uranus also has very powerful winds due to the temperature differences across the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Balance is controlled by a group of small organs in the ears, called the vestibular system. These organs detect two different kinds of motion: rotation and movement in a straight line.</p>
<p>The way straight line movement is detected is that there are tiny little bones shaped like bits of stone that sit in a kind of sac that is lined with tiny hairs. When you move in a straight line, the little stones press against the hairs, which send signals to the brain that say “hey, we’re moving forward!” or “hey, we’re tipping over!”</p>
<p>The way rotation is detected is with three rings inside your ears.  These rings are filled with fluid and more tiny hairs, and they are arranged in a way so that no matter which direction you move, the fluid presses on the hairs, too. So, if you did a cartwheel, one of the rings would say to your brain, “hey, we’re doing a cartwheel!” If you spin around like a ballerina a doing a pirouette, a different ring would tell your brain, “hey, we’re doing a pirouette!” And if you nod your head up and down, a third ring tells your brain, “hey, our head is nodding!”</p>
<p>The fluid in our ears is roughly the same as blood.  Sometimes, that fluid thins out, which makes movements seem more intense than they actually are, which can cause problems with balance. Sometimes the little hairs in the organs will break away,  and the spot where they were either sends too many signals to the brain, or none at all.  This can also affect balance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are an input into the economy, just like oil or farm land or machines.  As a general rule, the more people you have, the more you can produce. So, on a surface level, a shrinking population is bad for an economy in the same way that a dwindling oil supply or lack of capital is bad.</p>
<p>Unlike most of those things, people also create demand, not just supply. So fewer people can also mean that people aren't out there looking to buy new stuff---especially land and houses. which can also upset the economy quite a bit. </p>
<p>On top of that, shrinking populations also usually mean aging populations.  As people get older they tend to go from being net producers to net consumers, especially when health deteriorates.  This can force a country to make hard choices about how, and how much, to support an older population that increasingly can't support itself.  This is made worse by the fact that some jobs simply aren't suited to older people (There are very few 80 year old coal miners, or 70 year old ER nurses, and even when people are only 40 or so they may find that family and health makes it hard to work the kind of job or hours they could have worked when they were 50.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eh. Not entirely. A few things.</p>
<p>First, depending on the food we're talking about, salt might be an inherent part of the process, either of canning in particular or just the food in general. Pickles? Olives? Gotta have salt. You just do. Salt is also a critical ingredient in any number of fermented foods, many of which are canned. </p>
<p>Second, salt is a flavor enhancer. Processed food manufacturers have tended to add loads of salt to a wide variety of foods for the better part of a century as a way of making their products tastier. Canned foods are hardly unique here. </p>
<p>Third, while canned vegetables are certainly saltier than their raw counterparts, they're not necessarily as salty as you might think. <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/baked-products/4872/2" target="_blank">One 30g slice of white bread</a> has a little less than <em>three times</em> as much sodium as <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2344/2" target="_blank">28g of canned green beans</a>. </p>
<p>Fourth, while canning certainly <em>tends</em> to kill biological organisms, it's not magic. Some organisms are merely weakened. Some may even survive, though in small enough numbers that they can't cause a problem if the food is eaten within a year or two. A little salt goes a long way towards ensuring that fewer bacteria survive, and those that do stay dormant. </p>
<p>But lastly, bacteria aren't the only things that contribute to food spoilage. There are other chemical processes that have nothing to do with bacteria that can make food go bad, or at least lose quality over time. Discoloration comes immediately to mind, but that's not the only thing. Flavors can change. Textures can break down. Foods can take on flavors from their containers. Salt creates an environment inhospitable to bacteria, to be sure, but it also tends to interfere with some of these other processes, making it useful as a preservative even in a largely sterile environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Canned soups are produced in retorts. Effectively, these are giant pressure cookers with two main variations: Rotary and Hydrostatic. Hydrostatic, as the name implies, keeps the cans static during the processing. Rotary, as the name implies, rolls the cans in a big spiral to help mix the soup. </p>
<p>Because rotary mixes the soup, processing times can be much shorter than hydrostatic. Static cooking can sometimes be 9 times longer than rotary. Another way to think of this is that rotary induces convection in the can whereas hydrostatic only induces conduction. Both process at temperatures well above boiling. </p>
<p>These high temperatures for 90 minutes or more sterilize the food. There's a lot of science that goes into pinpointing exactly how much time and temperature needs to be applied to the product to make it safe to eat. However, major food companies obviously prefer to err on the side of overcooking because that ensures their products are safe for the masses. </p>
<p>It is important to note that, at least in canned soup, <em>sodium does not play any role in the safety of the food.</em> Food safety of the canned products are 100% guaranteed by the heating process they undergo. Salt content is just for flavor. </p>
<p>Many products lose their flavor in steam retorts over long periods of time. Something that doesn't lose its flavor at these high heats is salt. Sodium is universally delicious, present in almost every cuisine in some form or another. It's a cheap way to build back some of the flavor that is degraded from the retorts. </p>
<p>I think it's been very clear in the last 20 or so years since more evidence has come out about how sodium influences high blood pressure, more consumers are trying to lower sodium in their diets. Even the RDAs by the US Government have lowered the maximum limit of sodium in one's daily diet. As a result, many companies have tried to lower sodium in their products. Retort technology is improving, slowly but surely, so I anticipate that sodium will decrease over time in canned foods. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

And for the most part, the general consensus is that purely hydrophobic coatings don't do much, if anything, to help with increasing speed. </p>
<p>Primarily, the main reason is because it's the <em>laminar flow</em> of the water over the surface that provides a thin layer of water that is carried along with the boat, and so the primary friction layer is water-water, not water-boat surface. </p>
<p>Similarly, back in the 80s or 90s, there were a few boats that used a stippled tape made by 3M to help improve their friction surface, and this actually DID measurably improve their speed and reduce friction. It was quickly outlawed by FISA, and the reason today that FISA boat manufacturing rules specifically dictate that no extraneous coatings or coverings that serve to reduce friction aside from the natural surface of the shell are permitted was because of this early experimentation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In sailing 1/2 a knot can mean a lot in a race so people will do whatever they can to gain an advantage. The argument though is that a pure hydrophobic surface actually increases drag due to eliminating a boundary layer. So really sanding the surface down to an insanely high grit would be better than spraying your hull. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow I never thought my actual PhD research would come up on reddit but here I am, color me surprised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically the short answer is yes, my lab has proven many times that using micro/nano structures surfaces and hydrophobic surfaces can reduce skin friction drag on a surface moving through the water. Basically all it does is create a layer of air (called a plastron) between the skin of the ship and the water, and since the friction coefficient of water over air is much lower than water over a surface, the friction is reduced. This is very similar to why a golf ball has dimples. We have shown that you can reduce the skin friction drag of a ship hull by close to 90%, but this is only the friction, this does not account for form drag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real challenges right now are two fold, manufacturing ability and durability. I’ll start with the manufacturing because that is easier. A lot of the coatings we have developed are completely in-feasible for a ship because it either requires super precise etching (like you see in a microchip processing laboratory) or it requires harsh chemicals and you can’t really dip an entire ship in a giant vat of chemicals. So what we are working on right now is a simple coating that could be painted or sprayed on that would induce similar results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we have been successful in making one that can be sprayed, but this brings with it, it’s own challenges. First is the durability, many hydrophobic coatings are not durable on a metal surface and would end up just rubbing off after a short amount of time, we have created one that is pretty durable and is very promising so far in testing. The next challenge we are encountering is the durability of the plastron (the air layer between the hull and the water). This has been shown to break down over time, most likely from the air diffusing into the water, but it hasn’t been shown yet. But if you keep the plastron connected to the atmosphere (ie the air layer extends all the way to above the water line) then it appears this can be mitigated because your air layer is/can always be ‘refreshed’ with more air. What I am currently researching is how to we make a surface that is completely submerged (like a submarine) maintain a stable air layer with no connection to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind of a long answer to your question but it is a huge field of interest right now and has a lot of money/potential in it!</p>
<p>TL;DR yes it would, but it also isn’t really relevant on sailboat racing because it is banned by the RRS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: I also just want to clarify for people that not ALL coatings shear off at speed. One of the coatings I am testing with has shown numerous days of durability at about 20 m/s flow and absolutely no affect of the structure. The key is preventing wetting. If the coating wets, then yes, it will not last long because water is so much more ‘abrasive’ but if you maintain that air layer, it will last a long long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In your body you have cannabinoid receptors scattered throughout your physiology (CB1 in the CNS and CB2 in the PNS). These cannabinoid receptors are specifically designed to be triggered by a substance manufactured by the body (endogenous) called anadamide.<br />
Anandamide that has many functions within the body associated with fertility and immune function. Current working theory is that the level gets extremely high right after childbirth. Common side effects of marijuana intoxication include short term memory loss, increased appetite, Euphoria, and paranoia.  The same side effects would be beneficial immediately after giving birth including short term memory loss causing you to forget the pain you just endured, increased appetite to replenish lost nutrients during childbirth, euphoria making you happy with your new baby, and paranoia preventing anything detrimental happening to the child.
Again, this is working theory, and there is a lot of research currently in the subject. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine is one of the brain's most important painkillers. When you're not in pain, the brain releases neurotransmitters into the system that inhibit the release of dopamine. When you experience pain of sorts, your brain releases a natural cannabinoid called anandamide that binds to the receptor that triggers the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters, which allows dopamine (uninhibited) to then flow freely into the brain's synapse. </p>
<p>When you smoke cannabis, THC (the main psychoactive compound in cannabis) mimics the natural cannabinoid anandamide and binds to the same receptor that prevents the release of the dopamine inhibitors. It doesn't mimic the actual neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin (the way drugs like meth and cocaine do) and so it doesn't cause your brain to work in reverse, which is why using cannabis in moderation doesn't appear to do any seriously long-term damage to your brain.</p>

They were basically (ELI5) modern slaves, the employer could set rules, remove pay, they had no insurance for illness or retirement. They lived in very small flats, and beds (!) often were rented out to strangers - you do do not need a bed when you are working, right?</p>
<p>If you annoyed your employer, you lost a job in a time without any social welfare and no way to safe up money. If you had an accident at work, you might have been brought to the hospital ward, which was conveniently outside of the factory area which means that if you die after your (work) accident it happens outside of the factory/mine and this means your family cannot get pay. After all, you did not die at work, right? (The list goes on and on)</p>
<p>Then people got fed up with it and went on strike. Often that was to the dislike of the state which send the police and the factory owners who sent strike breakers (workers and muscle for punching).</p>
<p>This went on and on, workers formed Unions to fight back and over time the violence led to peaceful strikes which leads to the systems, workers' rights, social security and welfare you have today. Even the whole environment-debate is part of this, as by now we decided that the health of a countryside is more important than the profit of the factory-owners. In some countries all that is better developed than in others. </p>
<hr />
<p>Now, why we do have to work more than in past times (40 hours a week) is a whole different matter. I doubt Neanderthals worked more than some 30 (or something rather low) hours <em>per month</em> for getting food and firewood. The pay and recreation options were probably just cheaper. ;)</p>
<p>[And since so many &quot;nice&quot; people asked so &quot;nicely&quot;, here is some link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time#Hunter-gatherer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> but because they were such &quot;nice&quot; people I am not willing to do more research for such &quot;nice&quot; people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can explain this by symmetry arguments! The force acting on a charge due to a magnetic field is a vector (like all forces) but the magnetic field is a pseudovector. Vectors change sign under a reflection transformation and pseudovectors do not. </p>
<p>Here's an intuitive way of thinking about it. Imagine we place a mirror on the floor and drop a baseball onto it. We know the force due to gravity will pull the ball down towards the mirror, but the mirror image of the ball looks like it is accelerating upwards toward the mirror surface. Thus the mirror image of vectors like force and velocity has the opposite sign of the original. </p>
<p>Now, place a current loop in front of the mirror that generates a magnetic field pointing towards its surface (like the &quot;vertical mirror&quot; in <a href="https://nukephysik101.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/parity-mirror.png" target="_blank">this image</a>). The magnetic field direction depends only on the current direction in the loop, which is NOT changed in the mirror image. Therefore, the magnetic field in the reflection of the current loop points in the same direction as the original current loop. </p>
<p>Now launch a test particle into the field generated by the current loop. Because force is a vector (odd under reflection) and magnetic field is unchanged in the reflection, the magnetic force cannot have any components parallel to the magnetic field because these components would not flip sign in the mirror image as a force must. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation by u/allofthephotons and here, as a more direct explanation:<br />
The magnetic field is just a convenient construction to reflect the force between charges that move. That is all.<br />
When charges move, relativistic effects change the appearance of the normal static electric force. Take an electron moving parallell to a wire carrying a current. The wire is neutral, but consists of negative charges electrons moving along one direction, and positively charged atoms standing still. The electron moving along the wire with the electrons will due to relativistic lorentz contraction see a positive charged wire. The electronstream in the wire is not contracted since it moves with the electron, but the stationary atoms are contracted. Therefore the wire appear positive charged, and the electron is attraced. It can only be attracted or repulsed as obvious from the normal static electric force equation. A little hard to explain with text only, and pictures will show this simply. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an example from Schwartz's Principles of Electrodynamics, based on relativity. (Have I just disqualified this answer as &quot;not intuitive&quot;? Carrying on regardless...)</p>
<p>Imagine an infinite, straight wire with a constant current that is composed of equal numbers of positive and negative charges flowing in opposite directions (so the wire's net charge density is 0).</p>
<p>Now add a particle with charge q moving parallel to the wire with constant velocity v (lab frame K). What's the force on the particle?</p>
<p>To answer, Schwartz transforms the problem to the rest frame K' of the particle. Applying the corresponding Lorentz boost to the wire's charge-current four-vector, one finds that in K' it has a non-zero charge density. The charge is therefore attracted towards the wire by an electrostatic field.</p>
<p>(There are two assumption/empirical facts here: 1) in the particle's rest frame, the force is given by the electric field as the particle sees it, and 2) because the charge and current distributions are time independent, one can calculate the electric field in K' by the usual integration-over-charge-density approach.)</p>
<p>Boosting back to the lab frame, one finds the answer to the question, which is that the moving charge feels a force perpendicular to its velocity.</p>
<p>If you now separately calculate the B-field for the current by the usual formula, you also find that the force calculated above satisfies F=q vxB.</p>
<p>Of course, the above is just one example (and would not be applicable if the particle were moving towards the wire instead of parallel to it, because assumption 2 would be violated.) There's a more elaborate induction process to get to the full relativistic apparatus. However, the above example does establish the existence of a force perpendicular to a charged particle's velocity and the magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright.  Let's see:  </p>
<p>The magnetic force is applied as a charge <em>moves through</em> a magnetic field  That means you have 2 directions defined:  The magnetic field and the particle's direction of movement.  </p>
<p>Thus, your force can be applied in a total of 3 directions:  The direction of the magnetic field, the direction of velocity, and &quot;neither&quot;.  Let's take them one at a time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Direction of magnetic field:  This one, if we imagine two same charged particles connected by a string:  Having them perfectly at rest means they don't move.  However, if you move one, even slightly, they'll both go shooting off in the direction of the magnetic field, &quot;creating&quot; velocity, and thus, energy, from nothing.  So this one doesn't work.</p>
</li>
<li>Direction of velocity:  Same issue, here.  Two equally charged particles, connected by a string, perfectly at rest.  Start one moving, and they will begin to spin faster and faster forever.  Creating velocity, thus, energy, from nothing. <strong>edit</strong> This one is a bit less perfect of an example because they'd be creating velocity in opposite directions, and technically could be a net zero effect. Maybe imagine the two particles &quot;converging&quot; in open space.  Since their electric force interaction will be likely a net zero, adding magnitude (or subtracting) from both velocities will be creating energy.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, since it literally <em>cannot</em> apply force in either of those directions, it must be applying the force in a direction that is neither of those.  Thus, orthogonal to both directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
