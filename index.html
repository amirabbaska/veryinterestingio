<p>My argument: consider a drop having slidden to the tip of the stalactite. The (constant) air flow pushes it away with some force, causing it to be in a position that is slightly off from the place it would be without wind. The offset only depends on the strenght of the wind, so this offset is constant. This means the stalactite grows straight, from a constant angle (as opposed to curved).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our sensation of being cold (or hot) is strongly affected by the rate at which we exchange heat with the environment. When we're wet, the water is almost always colder than the 37 C of our body. That means that heat flows from our body into the water on our skin. And since water has a considerably higher heat conductivity than air, the body loses heat more rapidly when it's covered in water.</p>
<p>Next, the water will evaporate, which lowers the average temperature of the water that remains, causing further heat flow from the body to the water on the skin. Essentially, this is the same as sweating, except that sweating is a beneficial process that the body initiates when it is too hot.</p>
<p>So when we're wet, we lose heat more rapidly than when we're dry. This causes a stronger sensation of feeling cold, even though the water on our skin may be warmer than the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, humans don't really feel absolute temperature but instead you feel heat transfer.  Heat energy coming off you makes you cold, heat energy coming into you makes you hot.  The concept of wind chill and the various &quot;real feel&quot; temperatures from various weather sites are an effort to approximate heat transfer rates as temperatures (I.e. a wind chill of 15 F is the same heat transfer rate as an actual temperature of 15 F with no wind.)</p>
<p>What happens when you are wet is that you are suddenly able to transfer heat to your exterior much more rapidly.  The transfer from you to the water happens via conduction and convection at that point, plus the water has a much higher heat capacity so it can absorb more energy before it warms up.  The result is that even when the water is the same temperature as the air, it pulls more heat away from you making you feel colder.  Evaporation further exaggerates the ability of water to pull heat energy out of your body and further improves the heat transfer rate.</p>
<p>There is an easy demonstration/intuition check you can do at home to help understand that heat transfer concept.  If you put a metal fork in the freezer overnight then take it out the next morning the fork will feel much colder than the air in the freezer.  That isn't because the fork is a different temperature but because air doesn't transfer heat very well but metal does.  Similarly when you open an oven door you are exposing your face to 400+ degree (F) air, you can even safely reach your hand inside to check or move things with no problem.  Compare that to boiling water or steam coming off a pot.  The water is much cooler (212 F) than the oven is, but if you touch it you'll burn your hand almost immediately.</p>
<p>A lot of times people focus on absolute temperature, but in most cases heat transfer matters much more.  Absolute temperature definitely influences that transfer rate, but the material in question and the ambient conditions (flowing water/stagnant air etc) are often more important. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are correct but I feel I can add a bit more...</p>
<p>Air has a lower thermal conductivity than water and is used as an insulator. Insulating materials like styrofoam and fiberglass are mostly air, the material itself is structured to hold pockets of air and prevent it from moving. As you sit still you lose body heat to the air near your skin, but as long as that air is undisturbed it heats up and stays there like an insulating blanket (incidentally this is how blankets, clothing, and hair work: trapping the air warmed by your body so that it stays near your body). When a breeze blows you feel cold because the air near your skin that has been warmed by you is pushed away and colder air then contacts your skin.</p>
<p>Water on the other hand is a relatively good thermal conductor, as you lose body heat to the water near your skin it is conducted away to adjacent water molecules... the heat doesn't stay near your skin to form an insulating blanket like it does with undisturbed air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>HVAC Engineer here...</p>
<p>Two things are essentially drawing heat from your body when you are wet.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evaporative cooling. A few others mentioned it but it's how your AC is cold on the evaporator (clever name), it's why it feels cool outside when it's raining, and it's one of the benefits of sweating. When a substance changes from its liquid state to a gas, it absorbs energy around it, typically this is thermal energy.</p>
</li>
<li>Water is a much more efficient means of transferring heat from/to your body than air. This is why you can put your hand in a 212 degree oven briefly and be ok, but if you put your hand in 212 degree water, you will be burned. The reverse is also true. In most instances where a person is wet (rain, swimming, etc) the water temperature is less than our own body temperature. Typically we lose body heat to the air, which is inefficient, now we cover our skin in water and boom, the heat loss is more efficient and we feel cold because we are literally colder on the outside.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of evaporative cooling. When substance changes phase from a liquid to a vapor - it takes quite a bit of energy to get a low energy state(liquid) to a high energy state(vapor). When you have water on your skin and this water evaporates it takes that energy from your skin causing the skin to lose energy and become colder. If the water on your skin does not vaporize, you do not have this cooling effect. This is primarily why people always say that they prefer &quot;dry heat&quot; to &quot;hot and humid&quot;. In a humid environment, the air is already saturated with water vapor and cannot take much more water into it so water on the skin doesn't vaporize easily, leaving you hot. In a dry heat, however, water vaporizes easily which means this cooling effect of evaporative cooling can be used to keep you cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The usage of shorthand is actually a product of cultural socialization that has happened with generation y and z; with the death of distance and instant messaging becoming more prominent with social media platforms it's often much easier for various shorthands and trends to spread; having said this 2k16  and now 2k17 is actually derived from the verbal shorthand of the year. Reading it out loud in English feels  shorter when you replace the the &quot;twenty&quot; or two - zero with 2k because 1000 is socialized to be shortened by simply the letter k. In a sense because we're so used to seeing it it spreads and provides a &quot;easier read&quot; in our minds.

<p>Edit: for extra clarification -- if the insurance company did pay them $10 for that $1 item, at that point the insurance company would be paying into the profit center of the business, paying for their expenses, costs, and such.  There are some exotic forms of insurance, but for the most part they will only cover what you lost and what you paid for it, they aren't going to cover what you <em>might</em> have made in profit </p>
<p>For things like internal metrics, they can totally say &quot;We had $10 worth of potential revenue vanish this year due to theft&quot;</p>
<p>Value can only be assigned once an actual transaction takes place, until then the only value associated with it is the $1 the company paid for it.   </p>

<p>The reason is that, as you see from the other comments, there are many different ways to understand loss. One way the law deals with this is by choosing the idea of loss that fits the blameworthiness of the wrong doer. For example, someone accidentally knocks over and breaks a glass figurine, they are likely to pay only replacement costs. Whereas if that same person purposely broke or stole the figurine, their worse behavior would allow for a greater recovery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a GameStop employee of 9 years, let me throw in my 2 cents...</p>
<p>We are particularly careful of theft of new games and systems.  This is because there is not much profit in the sale of those items.  For instance, a $60 new game costs the company $55 to buy, netting them a $5 profit (these numbers fluctuate between games, but generally this is the largest profit margin).  This means they have fronted all that money.  Now, when a new game is stolen, we are at a loss of that $55 of fronted money.  To make that back, we must now sell 11 copies of the game to generate $55 ($5 of profit per game).  </p>
<p>Systems are even worse.  A $400 console generally costs the company around $390 &quot;wholesale&quot;.  That means there is a $10 profit per console sold (of course the market here is to put consoles in the hands of customers, thus enabling them to buy games, controllers, etc.).  However, when a new console is stolen, we must then make up that $390 of fronted money... meaning we must sell 39 consoles just to break even ($10 profit per console sale x 39 consoles = $390).  It can take all month or more to make up for the theft of a console.</p>
<p>However, on the other side, used sales have much larger profit margins to keep the company afloat.  They may buy a PS3  off a customer for $40, and resell it for $120.  That's a 300% profit margin.  Due to this, theft of used merchandise is not as big of a deal.  In fact, I specifically remember one year around Christmas, our District Manager told us to take all of our used console boxes and put them by the door.  The idea behind this was that with them being right in their face, more people were likely to pick one up, have it physically in their hands, and thus be more likely to buy it.  I argued that putting them right by the door was just asking for theft.  The DM told me he would rather every console be stolen than miss out on this opportunity.  We ended up getting like 5 consoles stolen, but we easily doubled and possibly tripled our Used Console sales.  At that +300% margin, the bonus sales more than made up for what I deemed &quot;acceptable theft&quot;.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, it's usually based on what the company has invested in the product, not potential sale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a psychiatrist and suicidologist, unfortunately I am on my mobile and cannot provide citations easily.  </p>
<p>The short answer on the whole population level is not significantly, but the longer answer is rather complicated. </p>
<p>First of all, very few people with depression is by suicide.  Overall, the rate of suicide in the Western world is generally 11 per 100000 per year. Having depression increases your risk of suicide by 3 to 5 times.  Therefore, we can translate those rates into 33 to 55 per 100000 per year.  Being depressed includes suicidal thinking as part of the illness, but it is not a common outcome to die by suicide.</p>
<p>Second, there are multiple risk factors for suicide. Depression is but one.  Family history, substance use, social circumstances, marital status, stress at work, resilience, etc... These are all factors of suicide risk, and are not changed.</p>
<p>Third, having depression doesn't mean you have taken antidepressants.  There is still a strong anti medication stigma put out there, and many people with depression are not compliant to their treatments (therapy or medication).  I sit on a coroner review panel in my province and review suicide analysis regularly.  A small percentage of depressed people who died by suicide (which is a subgroup of those who died by suicide) actually have detectable levels of antidepressants in their blood on autopsy.</p>
<p>Fourth, the effect size of antidepressants is good (0.45 to 0.8), but is not large enough to significantly statistically alter population levels of suicide.</p>
<p>Overall, the risk of suicidality on antidepressants (0.87% people get suicidal thoughts in the first two weeks under the age of 24, but let me tell you that the evidence for this is way shakier than most are aware) is much less than the risk of suicidality with depression and NOT on antidepressants, and the &quot;number needed to treat&quot; to effectively treat a depression is about 5 to 9.</p>
<p>On individual studies, taking an SSRI significantly increases the length of time one goes without suicidal thinking, and is an effective treatment for depression (equal to therapy and superior when both are combined), and I would guess likely does reduce suicidality overall in the group of those who take them.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people keep mentioning that depressed people starting medication have increased rates of suicidality (maybe now due to having energy for actions - I believe a claim made by industry). However, it is important to remember that healthy adults also have this trend. It is possible that anti-depressants just have this side effect. Anti-depressents are still considered one of the most effective treatments with people who have severe depression. But I would think of this side effect as something unfortunate that could happen with medication for a serious disease.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like surely mathematicians have discovered just about everything we can do with math by now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heavens, no!</p>
<p>What you learn in school as mathematics is actually just a small <em>subset</em> (and many say a very <em>boring</em> subset) of what mathematics is generally.  There are branches of mathematics that deal with things like studying the properties of prime numbers (which is <em>one</em> element of a field called number theory, and is studied from a variety of different perspectives), or with understanding the behavior and structure of surfaces as you stretch or fold or manipulate them (part of topology), or with understanding how the solutions to certain polynomial equations can lead to beautiful links between geometry and algebra and even topology (one aspect of algebraic geometry), or with understanding arrangement of objects that meet certain requirements of symmetry (design theory, which is a subfield of combinatorics).</p>
<p>In each of these fields, there are plenty of open questions.  Some of them are technical and intricate-- you would need some serious background to understand the question itself.  But some of the questions are easy to understand, but still a real <em>bitch</em> to answer.</p>
<p>For instance, there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="_blank">Collatz Conjecture</a>, which is straightforward enough as a problem (do all positive integers eventually settle into the 4-2-1 pattern?).  We don't have a solution for the problem, and our toolkit for going after this sort of problem isn't very well-developed.  It's likely to remain an open problem for a while.</p>
<p>Trick is, mathematics is the study of relationships and interconnections of ideas.  Those ideas are often very carefully defined, but that care and precision allows mathematicians to bring a variety of tools to bear on those ideas.</p>
<p>And ideas are... well, ideas are everywhere.  Somebody wondered what would happen if you brought mathematical ideas to bear on the Rubik's cube.  Or Sudoku.  At a big math conference this year, somebody discussed what could happen if you put the game &quot;Flow Free&quot; onto a different shape, like a ball or a donut.  Mathematicians looking at quantum physics said, &quot;Hey, that looks like the symmetric group!&quot; and helped build models for the behavior of particles at a ridiculously small scale.  There have been mathematical tools developed to measure gerrymandering.  Somebody looked at data science and data analysis, and realized that some of the problems looked a lot like topological problems-- and so there is a field called &quot;topological data analysis&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is preventing this end point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say the fact that mathematics has an infinite number of questions to ask, and at least SOME of those questions will always be interesting to SOMEBODY.  Fermat's Last Theorem captured the imaginations of mathematicians for CENTURIES-- which is all to the good, because many of the failed attempts led to interesting new tools, or to related questions.  Even in &quot;failure&quot;, mathematics often advances itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first question to ask is: what do any academics do, especially in STEM? What is left to discover? We can look at physics. If Newton's view of physics was right, research would largely have died out long ago. But the universe is much stranger than we thought. Relativity, Quantum Theory, Exotic Particles, etc. There's so much going on that we have open questions left for many future lifetimes. And how about biology? Well, if it was all about balancing the four humors, we wouldn't have quite so many people in labcoats. But even just human biology is a tremendous biochemical and genetic mess that we are just starting to de-tangle. So it probably doesn't seem too strange that professional biologists exist.</p>
<p>One reason you might think that all math has been discovered is that you haven't been acquainted with how large and strange the mathematical universe is. Mathematical models are, and have been, used to describe physical phenomenon from the complex rippling of waves to the folding of proteins and the stochastic behavior of the stock market. Deep mathematical ideas are needed to talk about relativity and quantum mechanics and string theory and to help find structure in the genetic code. Computer encryption uses mathematics, so there must be some part of mathematics that deals with how to conceal and recover information. Modern machine learning relies on increasingly sophisticated paradigms of statistical inference. In a certain sense (with some important caveats), mathematics needs to be at least as complicated as any of its applications.</p>
<p>Behind (beneath?) these applications is so-called pure mathematics. The distinction is fuzzy near the boundary but not entirely arbitrary. There are mathematicians that try to understand the nature of logical and mathematical systems: can everything proven be true? can our axioms describe everything of interest? There are mathematicians that try to understand how to compare and quantify knots. There are mathematicians that try to study how complex multi-dimensional signals can be decomposed into various sorts of basic waves. There are mathematicians trying to build a 'multiverse' of geometries in which different shapes can be compared and moved between. There are mathematicians who try to find fast algorithms to find routes on complex networks.</p>
<p>The key word in all these examples is &quot;trying&quot;. As mathematicians, we are foraying into the unknown. We don't know what will work and what will fail. We remain largely ignorant of the important questions to ask. It often turns out that we were studying something from the wrong perspective, making it unnecessarily difficult. And more often than not, every time we get an answer it gives us just enough insight to realize how peculiar and strange it all is, and sends us down yet another rabbit hole. We're currently far below the surface of the earth, moving between massive caverns by way of increasingly narrow tunnels. Please send help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is an example of what an applied mathematician might be doing:</p>
<p>A widely studied (yet still not completely understood) phenomenon is fluid turbulence.</p>
<p>When you look at the smoke coming from a fire, and you see all the swirls in the smoke, you are observing turbulence. When you are on an airplane, and suddenly the plane starts shaking, you are experiencing turbulence. Given how common fluids are in the world, understanding how turbulence behaves is super important.</p>
<p>We would like to be able to explain how turbulence behaves using mathematics. The reason we are using mathematics, is because mathematics is the tool that physicists and engineers use to do what they do. </p>
<p>Think about how you can use mathematics to calculate how long it takes for a ball to fall from a tall building. The same is true for using mathematics to explain how turbulence behaves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, trying to characterize turbulence, and trying to predict how it behaves using mathematics is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>It's so difficult, that there hundreds of mathematicians and scientists all over the world studying it, and working out the mathematics needed to fully describe turbulence.</p>
<p>You need complicated mathematics to be able to calculate things like how a fluid flows around objects, or how objects moving through fluids are affected. </p>
<p>At some point (not too far ahead though, unfortunately), the mathematics needed just hasn't been developed yet.</p>
<p>You need mathematicians to come up with ideas, and to work out these ideas, to make sure that these ideas are indeed correct. They spend a lot of time proving things, because they want to be sure that what they are discovering is correct.</p>
<p>This field has been around for a few hundred years now, and there is still a lot more to learn.</p>
<p>I hope that helped. Although my example was for applied mathematicians (mathematicians whose work directly relates to real world applications), pure mathematicians do a similar thing, except their work is more abstract.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Capsaicin has been shown to do this experimentally (though the only study I found was when it was given intravenously, rather than inhaled, though the effect was still on pulmonary irritant receptors).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To some extend a microwave can kill bacteria, but not all bacteria can be considered equal in terms of conditions required to inactivate or kill them. As you might understand there are many factors in play to consider such as the material, thickness of the material and the type of bacteria so it's not possible to give you a generalised answer that will apply to everything you stick in the microwave.</p>
<p>Perhaps you've heard of this tip before. Stick a sponge in a microwave to disinfect the sponge. Going by this example the following has been found. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/health/27real.html" target="_blank">NYTimes - The Claim: You Can Disinfect a Kitchen Sponge in the Microwave (2007)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, at least two studies have put the claim to the test, and both have confirmed it. The most recent, published in the December 2006 issue of The Journal of Environmental Health, found that microwaving kitchen sponges and other scrubbing pads for one to two minutes at full power could reduce levels of bacteria, including E. coli and other common causes of food-borne illness, by more than 99 percent.</p>
<p>A previous study in 1999 found that many bacteria are eliminated within the first 15 seconds of being heated by microwave, and that only E. coli survive longer than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>To avoid fires or overheating, the authors of the 2006 study recommended that only damp sponges and those without metal be zapped. But some experts say the practice poses a safety hazard and should be discouraged. Some news accounts have described cases in which kitchen sponges caught fire while being cooked by microwave.</p>
<p>Other studies have found a safer alternative: soaking soiled sponges in diluted solutions of bleach, which is just as effective as heating. Then again, there is an even simpler option: tossing the sponge out and getting a new one.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6293735.stm" target="_blank">BBC - Microwave 'sterilisers' warning (2007)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Gabriel Bitton, a expert in environmental engineering at the University of Florida, and colleagues contaminated kitchen sponges and plastic scrubbing pads in dirty water which contained faecal bacteria, viruses, protozoan parasites and bacterial spores.</p>
<p>After two minutes on full power, 99% of bacteria were inactivated. And E. coli bacteria were killed after just 30 seconds. Bacillus cereus spores - which are largely associated with vegetables or foods in contact with soil and are normally quite resistant to radiation, heat and toxic chemicals - were completely eradicated after four minutes in the microwave.</p>
<p>Professor Britton said it was likely to be heat, rather than radiation, that proved fatal <del>as microwaves worked by exciting water molecules.</del></p>
<p>The team also looked at whether the microwave oven could be used to sterilise contaminated syringes. It was found to be an effective method but took far longer - up to 12 minutes for the Bacillus cereus spores.</p>
<p>Professor Hugh Pennington, a food safety expert at the University of Aberdeen said heating was an effective way of sterilising kitchen equipment.</p>
<p>He said heat was an obvious method of sterilisation.</p>

<p>Disinfect: To kill all pathogens but not all microorganisms</p>
<p>Decontaminate: To make something safe for use by the general public</p>
<p>Sterilize: To kill all life, including viruses</p>
<p>Microwaves, do not kill cells by altering cellular structures, they just kill cells by heat. So it can kill cells to an extent, and can decontaminate if you let the microwave run long enough to get the food or whatever being heated to a high enough temperature. However, it does not necessarily disinfect. Food is always and only decontaminated. I've never heard of any industry or company disinfecting food, not sure it would be safe for consumption.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, even boiling cannot sterilize. You must use either incineration or a combination of pressure and heat, in order to increase the temperature of water past 100 degrees Celsius to kill all life. </p>
<p>Extra knowledge, endospores are an extremely heat resistant form bacteria can create, and they can outlive all other forms of vegetative bacteria. These are usually the hardest to get rid of when sterilizing something, unless there is extremely heat resistant Archae present in your food, highly unlikely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a sterile compounding IV room, and I can't help but chuckle when people think they've &quot;sterilized&quot; or &quot;disinfected&quot; something. In order to enter an IV compounding room, you must cover hair, shoes, beards, and face up to your nose, wash up to your elbows for 30+ seconds, dry with a low-lint paper towel drying elbow to hand elbow to hand, elbow to hand, put on a low-linting garment, and then apply alcohol-based sanitizer to your hands for 30 seconds or until dry. Then you must put on sterile gloves. That means not the gloves in the boxes. These come like band-aids are packaged and you must put them on without ever touching the outside of the glove with your bare hand or the inside of one glove to the outside of the other. Then you must spray these gloves with 70% <em>sterile</em> alcohol. (Yes. 70% isopropyl alcohol is not sterile by default). You are now ready to begin compounding. Because you shed about 600K particles per hour of filthy skin cells, you're basically the highest risk item and must constantly redisinfect. You must work in a space that delivers HEPA filtered air in one direction so that no microbes land in the exposed sites like needles and vial membranes -- which must be wiped three times in one direction before you use them because those are not sterile either. </p>
<p>Bacteria can survive outer space. They can survive 70% alcohol. They can survive radiation. They can survive just about anything. Unless there was some type of harmful bacteria in the food that was pathological, you probably don't have to worry about it because unless you perform the procedure above at all times, your food and house and you are crawling with bacteria at all times, especially since you have more bacteria cells than human cells. So it's all kind of  irrelevant. Wash with hot water and soap or a high-temperature dishwasher and that should be adequate for a dish you're using to eat.</p>
<p>Microwaves work by heating water. They're not as good at heating other things. Furthermore, it needs to be pressurized to sterilize bacteria because the temperature to kill everything but prions is 250ºF or 121ºC for ≥15 minutes. Bleaching the sponge or immersing in rubbing alcohol would work better. (Particularly in sequence).</p>
<p>TL;DR, it's the heat and pressure, unfortunately, your microwave is unable to generate it such that anything can be even remotely called disinfected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough, I think it's a both yes and no answer. </p>
<p>Yes, the heat generated from microwaves DOES kill most bacteria. Provided that the heat is high enough and for long enough periods. </p>
<p>This includes the heat that is generated by the microwave bouncing off the moisture within the bacteria. </p>
<p>Now...the real question might be, if you kept the pathogen cool, or if the pathogen did not contain any moisture, would the microwave kill it? </p>
<p>I think the answer is no - it would not kill it. Hence the reason why bacteria still survives in a microwave oven even after prolonged exposure, simply because the bacteria is kept cool or kept from heating up to a degree that would kill it. </p>
<p>Therefore microwaves themselves most likely do not kill pathogens. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The languages you are talking about are the Indo-European languages. Almost all languages in Europe are part of this language family. The original language that all of these descended from (Proto-Indo-European) had gendered words like that, so almost all of the languages that came from it also have it. Originally, there were three genders: feminine, masculine, and neuter. Some languages, like Russian and German, still have this. Some other languages, like Swedish, merged the feminine and masculine words to make a 'common' gender along with neuter. The Romance languages have gotten rid of the neuter gender and have the feminine/masculine words you were talking about. Funnily enough, English also used to have feminine, masculine, and neuter words, but over time people just kind of got rid of them, and now english is almost completely genderless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a vestige of the old Proto-Indo-European language. It simply had these classes. Many other languages have different classes; some use animate-inanimate. Many Native American languages have multiple classes that describe the noun (usually with animacy, state, and consistency). Most linguists use gender when it comes to actual gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter), while reserving class for pretty much everything else.</p>
<p>Gender is usually only grammatical. For instance, German <strong>Weib</strong> (&quot;woman&quot;) is neuter. So as I've said before, it's just vestiges of an ancient ancestral language. Nothing to do with sexism or whatever (usually).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to realise that many - even <em>most</em> &quot;why&quot; questions about grammar just don't have a good answer. Languages developed quasi-randomly, mostly without direction and often without &quot;natural selection&quot; evolving the language towards certain useful features. So a lot of quirks are just there because, well... they just are!</p>
<p>So the real answer is that <strong>we don't know, and possibly there is no good reason.</strong> However we can make some guesses which, in the case that gender didn't just happen for no reason, make sense. The first is that gender makes things less ambiguous. Think about the sentence:</p>
<pre><code>There is a shelf in the shop which I clean.</code></pre>
<p>Do I clean the shop or the shelf? In German this would be:</p>
<pre><code>Es gibt ein Regal in dem Laden *das/den* ich putze.</code></pre>
<p>If you use <em>das</em> then it means you clean the shelf, if <em>den</em> then it is the shop: there's no confusion, because the word has to change depending on the gender of the noun it's referring to.</p>
<p>The next useful feature is that gender just serves as an extra part of the word which, if you have two words which sound similar, serves to make it clear which you meant.</p>
<p>Other people have mentioned that the ancestor language of all Indo-European languages had gender, and this is why <em>so many</em> modern European languages have it now. Hopefully the above explains what we can say about why gender might have developed in Proto-Indo-European.</p>
<p>Finally let me point out that you should not get confused by the terms &quot;gender,&quot; &quot;masculine&quot;, &quot;feminine&quot; etc. &quot;Gender&quot; originally <em>only</em> meant the grammatical category and had nothing to do with human beings. It was occasionally used (often humorously) to refer to people being male or female, and then, because &quot;sex&quot; stopped meaning just &quot;male or female&quot; but started being short for &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and therefore being naughty, people started using &quot;gender&quot; to mean &quot;sex&quot; much more often. But this was in the early 20th century and way after &quot;gender&quot; had long been used more as a grammatical term, or a way to just say &quot;type.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't find anything about why &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; were the words used to talk about two of the genders, when they were also used to talk about people's sex. In English, the grammatical term is attested first but I suspect this usage all goes back to Latin. Anyway my point is that you shouldn't read too much into the names for what words are and what people are being the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a linguist at all, but I've noticed it can be helpful for disambiguation.  Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<p>First, consider sentences like, &quot;Put the microwave on the conveyer belt, and then put the ball on it.&quot;  Does &quot;it&quot; refer to the conveyer belt, or the microwave?  It's actually unclear.  So instead of &quot;it&quot;, you would have to say &quot;the microwave&quot; or &quot;the conveyer belt&quot; at the end of the sentence, which adds several syllables and makes the sentence longer, and we're always searching for shorthand.</p>
<p>Now imagine that &quot;microwave&quot; were feminine and &quot;conveyer belt&quot; were masculine.  Then instead of &quot;it&quot;, you would be able to say &quot;her&quot; or &quot;him&quot;, and your meaning would be obvious.  So you'd be able to say a shorter sentence without making it more ambiguous.  If there are 3 genders, then it might be unambiguous 67% of the time by random chance.</p>
<p>Second, I've noticed (this is an information-theory type of answer) is that sometimes extra syllables (sentence context) can make it easier to understand someone's meaning.  Imagine someone says &quot;Hand me the ta-&quot; and you aren't sure if they said &quot;tap&quot; or &quot;tape&quot; or &quot;tab&quot;.  If the word &quot;the&quot; comes in one of three genders for each of the words, then you can more easily guess which one follows.  Stealing from German for a moment, imagine the words are &quot;der tap&quot;, &quot;die tape&quot;, &quot;das tab&quot;.  If someone says &quot;Hand me der ta-&quot; then you can be pretty sure they meant &quot;der tap&quot; and not &quot;das tab&quot;, from the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>So I'm not totally sure how that sort of thing would evolve, but I can see how it adds greater redundancy to sentence structure and makes it easier for people with different accents of the same language group to communicate.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's 'hearing voices' and there's your internal monologue.</p>
<p>One is some people's stream of consciousness - the way they think - in a verbal way rather than visual way.</p>
<p>The other is often a symptom of schizophrenia or a hallucination.</p>
<p>Whether these two things are linked is an interesting question. i.e is the fact that I recognise my inner voice as my own thoughts the only thing that differs?</p>
<p>I believe this inner voice is (at least one of the things) that Buddhists are trying to escape from by meditating. Which I don't really understand. e.g I was out walking last night and I constantly converse with myself, think of different ideas and mull things as I'm doing that, to the point where I can have covered a large distance without really being aware. To me that's what makes activities like cycling and walking relaxing.</p>
<p>Whereas it seems to be that Buddhists believe that ignoring your thoughts and instead trying to focus on being in the moment is important.</p>
<p>Perhaps a lot depends upon what kind of thoughts you have. If you're fretting and anxious about things maybe you would want to escape it. I can't help thinking that a lot of epiphanies in maths and physics were reached by this kind of inner conversation - I'm sure most of us are thinking about more mundane things though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's the part of your brain that both thinks in sentences and recognizes language, a large part of which is a piece of meat known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area" target="_blank">Broca's area</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
