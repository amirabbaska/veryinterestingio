		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that you've gotten some great answers so far, but I wanted to give you a bit of the calculus explanation and how beautiful this question really is. If you don't have a calculus background, don't worry, I'll try to explain this intuitively.</p>
<p>Generally, we think of <strong>velocity</strong> (speed with a direction component) as how far we've gone in a given amount of time, change in x divided by change in t, if x is how far we travel, and t is how long it took us to travel that distance.</p>
<p>So if I travel x = 10km in t=2 hr, 10/2 = 5km/hr, and that would be my velocity.</p>
<p>But here we're focusing on velocity at an instant. <strong>Velocity at any instant</strong> is actually defined to be the instantaneous change in position, which we can denote with dx, divided by the instantaneous change in time, which can be denoted with dt. This is where the calculus comes in. It's just describing what your velocity is at any instant in time, kinda like the speedometer on your car shows you at a certain moment how fast you're traveling. This is actually called a derivative in calculus.</p>
<p>We can then set up a differential equation which describes your motion. This is an equation that can relate a rate of change in a quantity with the actual quantity.</p>
<p>Velocity at any point in time = (how far I am from my destination at any point in time)</p>
<p>If we start at 0m, at any distance x we've traveled, how far I am from the destination is just 100-x. For example, at x=25km from where you started, you are moving at 75km/hr. And our instantaneous velocity at any time is just dx/dt, as I explained above.</p>
<p>So we can write this as:</p>
<p>dx/dt = 100-x</p>
<p>This is our differential equation, and I'm not going to get into how to solve it, but I'll tell you that the solution in this particular example is:</p>
<p>x(t)=-100e^(-t)+100</p>
<p>&quot;e&quot; is Euler's number, around 2.71828. </p>
<p>x(.632) is 50m, so you'd be halfway there in .693 hours, or about 42 minutes. If you plug in t=10 hours, for example, </p>
<p>x(10) = -100e^-(10) + 100</p>
<p>which, if you calculate, is about 99.995m to our destination after traveling for 10 hours.</p>
<p>As t gets infinitely large (as an infinite amount of time passes), x(t) gets extremely close to 100km, but never reaches it, and so it's consistent with the other explanations. But if you're curious what the graph of position vs. time looks like, check <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/h1icybh65l" target="_blank">this</a> out.</p>
<p>Bonus: if you're still curious about this, /u/3blue1brown is going to release an &quot;essence of calculus&quot; series on YouTube soon. He explains all this super well and how beautiful all this is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question. Are you constantly decreasing every second along the way? So at 93km you are going 93km/h? Or, are you doing this in legs of every 10km. So, from 100km to 90km are you going 100km/h that entire 10km leg?</p>
<p>That would be two entirely different answers. Your question is a bit vague on which is the case.</p>
<p>If you are decreasing at a constant rate, like the others replied, then you wouldn't get there. If you are only decreasing every 10 km, then it's a simple stair step function.</p>
<p>It's just a sum of hours traveled during each 10 km leg of the journey.</p>
<p>100 km away, the first 10 km takes 0.1 hours. The next 10 km you're going 90 km/h and that takes 0.111 (repeating) hours.</p>
<p>Then each leg after is: 0.125, 0.142857143, 0.166666667, 0.2, 0.25, 0.333333333, 0.5. And the final leg you are going 10 km/h for 10 km. So that leg takes an hour.</p>
<p>Total sum: 2.93 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never. You can think of it like this, since you're constantly changing your speed, your destination is constantly 1 hour away. If it is one hour away, then you can't be there, so you can never get there.</p>
<p>More precisely, if v is your current speed, and d is the distance from your destination, then d/v is the time remaining if you continue at your current speed. In general, d/v is a function of time. Our velocity v depends on the distance d as v(d)=cd, where c=1/1hour. This means that d/v = 1/c=1 hour, and this is constant, fixed at one hour regardless of how far away you are from the destination. So you will never get there.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/66wqc9/if_my_speed_is_100_kmh_and_my_destination_is_100/dgly57q/?st=j1tvjnwx&amp;sh=3d9ec46c" target="_blank">OP remarked that he meant it to change continuously, not every 10km</a>. If you did change it every 10km, it would take 1/10+1/9+1/8+1/7+1/6+1/5+1/4+1/3+1/2+1 hours to get to the destination, which is ~2.93hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question, I started noticing this in my early 30's.  But I only occasionally have nasal connection or a runny nose, but I ALWAYS have a cough. </p>
<p>It's gotten worse over the years, as have hangovers...But as we get older our production of alcohol dehydrogenase decreases... I never had a hangover until 32, it's been all downhill from there. </p>
<p>I think the histamines in alcohol coupled with an increase in other inflammatory chemicals that result from the consumption of alcohol all add up. </p>
<p>I found this article which covers several possible relationships between alcohol and inflammation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842521/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842521/</a></p>
<p>From the abstract:</p>
<p>&quot;Chronic inflammation is often associated with alcohol-related medical conditions. The key inducer of such inflammation, and also the best understood, is gut microflora-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Alcohol can significantly increase the translocation of LPS from the gut. In healthy individuals, the adverse effects of LPS are kept in check by the actions and interactions of multiple organs. The liver plays a central role in detoxifying LPS and producing a balanced cytokine milieu. The central nervous system contributes to anti-inflammatory regulation through neuroimmunoendocrine actions. Chronic alcohol use impairs not only gut and liver functions, but also multi-organ interactions, leading to persistent systemic inflammation and ultimately, to organ damage. The study of these interactions may provide potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.&quot;</p>
<p>The bottom line is alcohol needs to be imbibed in moderation and everyone reacts a little differently, so just monitor what works for you and what doesn't. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sinus congestion from alcohol is caused by an alcohol intolerance and high levels of histamine in alcoholic beverages, according to CNN Health. One of the first signs of alcohol intolerance and sensitivity to histamine is sinus congestion and flushing of the skin. The condition is commonly referred to as an alcohol allergy, but is accurately diagnosed as an intolerance. The intolerance is a genetic condition where the person's body is unable to break down the alcohol, leading to complications. MayoClinic.com states that beer and wine specifically are high in histamine, leading to nasal congestion.</p>
<p>I have a friend that suffers from this. There is a couple of breweries that he found that is better on his allergies. Stone Delicious is the one I remember. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bacteriologist and this is a great question! </p>
<p>Unfortunately like most things in nature bacteria don't have an &quot;intention&quot; as such. They don't have brains so there isn't even really a &quot;knowing&quot;. Everything they do is simply following genetic codes. Tiny organ-like components in the cells read their DNA, turn it into proteins, and these proteins either diffuse around the cell (doing fun chemical reactions) or diffuse out of the cell as waste. Some of this waste can be harmful (toxins), benign, or useful to other organisms. </p>
<p>Bacteria are also <em>covered</em> in receptors. The receptors pick up specific molecules - maybe it's a sugar, a protein etc. The receptors are basically the eyes and ears of the bacteria, because the receptors then cause a chemical reaction inside the cell, which dictates how it responds. So if it's a tasty sugar it can use for energy, the receptor might &quot;tell&quot; the cell to move  vaguely in the direction of the sugar by rotating its flagella. </p>
<p>None of these processes are perfect but bacteria have been around many, many time greater than us, and it shows in how with just one cell they can be ruthlessly efficient. </p>
<p>(It's also important to note bacteria vary massively in complexity - some are basic models, others are able to form communities with complex social structures whilst still maintaining a single celled existence) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><strong>friend 1</strong> really likes water -- and only likes water -- and will go wherever water is. </p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong> really likes <strong>friend 1</strong>, and will go wherever <strong>friend 1</strong> goes. <strong>friend 2</strong> also likes eating food, so if there's food wherever <strong>friend 1</strong> goes, <strong>friend 2</strong> will eat it. </p>
<p>let's also say that there's a <strong>friend 3</strong> that, whenever their food is eaten by <strong>friend 2</strong>, will order more food (but will <em>only</em> order more food with <strong>friend 2</strong> eats their food). </p>
<p>you might have noticed at this point that each friend is pretty single-minded and only has one or two things that they're looking out for -- this is a simplified version of how intracellular dynamics works, where molecules interact with each other according to the rules of physics/chemistry. if you can imagine this on a much, much more complicated scale (while simultaneously being in a very, very, very small amount of space), then you can see how cells begin to function. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Billions of years ago, chemicals formed on this earth which had the ability to link together to form structures that could catalyze chemical reactions. The ability to form these structures was and is a consequence of the physical properties of the chemicals. Eventually over the course of hundreds of millions of years, it just so happened that a structure emerged from these chemicals which could catalyze the formation of itself. However, the self-replicating ability wasn't perfect and so different variations of the structure became formed. Most of the variations were likely ineffective at making a working self-replicating copy however others were more effective than the original. The more effective structures would naturally make more copies and so more and more effective variants of self-replicating structures emerged. This kept occurring over hundreds of millions of years during which time major variations popped up and different variations eventually dominated different environmental niches where their structures were optimal for the surroundings. (Cue animation of bacteria turning into fish then frog, lizard, mammal, caveman, human being.)</p>
<p>Why did that first self-replicating structure emerge? The immediate answer is that it emerged because the laws of physics and chemistry permit it. With enough time anything can happen so long as it's possible. But <em>why</em> did it emerge? That gets to a very deep philosophical question we mortals cannot answer. You could say it's random chance, it's just the way things happened to be. You could say it's the will of the divine. Regardless it happened.</p>
<p>Now, back to the question - how do single celled beings know what they're supposed to do to survive? They know because they are derived from a chain of ancestors going back to that original self-replicating structure. This isn't nothing. This chain is composed of living entities that somehow survived and replicated. In every generation there are plenty of entities that don't. The single celled entities are a collection of molecules that display an emergent behavior reminiscent of their previous generations which previously reproduced successfully. It appears that the single celled entity knows what to do when we see them now; but that's only because all of the cellular, macromolecular, and molecular mechanisms that led to non-reproducing emergent behavior were weeded out over the billions of years since that original self-replicating structure.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemist here, how acidic a substance is is measured in pH. This measure is a concentration of protons (or H+) atoms in the liquid, and it is a log 10 scale that goes from 0-14 with neutral being 7. </p>
<p>At pH 0 the concentration of protons is 1. At pH 1, it's 0.1, at 2 it's 0.01. etc all the way to a pH of 14 and above. It's a logarithmic scale, so 3 is ten times less than 2 and ten times more acidic than 4. (When you get to basic conditions you can think of it instead as the hydroxide ion (OH-) rather than the proton (H+)). </p>
<p>My Googlefu says that the stomach holds ~40ml when &quot;empty&quot; and has a pH of ~2. </p>
<p>If you were to drink a liter of water (1000ml, ~a quart) you would dilute your stomach acid 1:25. A 1:10 dilution would get you to pH 3, and with how log scale works, a 1:2.5 dilution gets you to something like 3.15. </p>
<p>Now, that's if it's a simple system, it's not. In reality there is a thing called buffering capacity, the same thing your blood does to the pH at a relative constant. Hydrochloric acid does not buffer, but your stomach also has carbonic acid, which does. </p>
<p>The second your stomach acid starts getting diluted, the buffering molecules in the liquid start losing protons, which causes the number of free protons as a whole to increase. Essentially, the system resists the change in concentration. It wants to stay as close to pH 2 as it can.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cells in your stomach can tell what the pH of the stomach acid is. It's how your body knows when to pump out more acid, which it does. </p>
<p>So essentially, yes, drinking water will change the pH of your stomach, but not by very much, and not for very long. Google says that the volume of your stomach halves every 12-15 minutes, so after drinking a liter of water you'd get back to the 40ml you started with in 50-60 minutes.</p>
<p>Edit: even though I live in America, I refuse to learn the imperial system</p>
<p>Edit 2: tried to explain buffering better</p>
<p>Edit 3: whoever told me to go back to my country and then deleted their comment, or edited it, or whatever, I was born here too, lived here my whole life. <strong>EVERYONE</strong> who does science, <strong>LOATHES</strong> the imperial system. </p>
<p>Edit 4: added estimate to get back to normal after drinking a liter of water.</p>
<p>Edit 5: Clarified a couple things, changed my explanation oh pH to what is correct although I think it's harder to understand. Added a more friendly ELI5 Below. I also tried to go through the comments and answer more questions that came up directly or address them in edits. </p>
<p><strong>Simpler answer</strong></p>
<p>Your stomach is very very acidic. So much so that even though you have such a small amount of liquid in your stomach when it's empty that drinking a normal liter sized water bottle would hardly change how strongly acidic it is. </p>
<p>Your stomach also notices when the acidity changes, and will start producing more acid, trying to stay at a constant level of acidity. </p>
<p>Your stomach then starts emptying itself, which on an empty stomach with a liter of water, takes a little less than an hour, and over that time has gone back to its normal level of acidity. </p>
<p>I don't know how to make my first explanation easier to understand without removing the ability to have you walk away from this thread truly having learned what is going on. I can answer the question simply, but <strong>explaining</strong> and having you truly <strong>understand</strong> is a lot harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacist here, we study the effects of water on the stomach for bioavailability of medications. Studies show that water goes right through the stomach in a matter of seconds (why drinking a cup of water right after some pills is recommended). While smoothies, for example, take about 30 mins to go through the stomach. </p>
<p>The stomach also has very complex mechanisms for regulating stomach pH. Not only does it have very efficient pumps to pump acid into the stomach, it also has pumps to pull acid out of the stomach. It also can secrete bicarbonate (a buffer) and typically has a bicarbonate layer in the protective mucosa of the stomach. The stomach is good at self-regulating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immediate effect of drinking water will make your stomach acid less acidic. Stomach acid normally is around pH 2 and will usually rise to around 6 or so after drinking water. However, the effect fades pretty quickly, probably in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>The thing is that your stomach maintains a buffer, which means that if the acidity of the stomach decreases, then the relevant cells will release more acid to increase acidity once again. Overwhelming this system to raise the pH level (lower acidity) for long periods of time probably requires too much water to drink safely.</p>
<p>EDIT: Source of information that I used for this explanation is listed [here] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18473176" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18473176</a>). In response to what others have said in the replies, I do understand the principles of pH and how they work, but I felt like there may be other factors involved that could lead to spikes in pH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Server&quot; changes over time in enterprise environments. It used to mean a very high power dedicated machine. But today it might just as well mean a very high powered VMware environment running virtual servers. </p>
<p>The Xeon has a few things going for it that make it suitable for enterprise server or vm environments. </p>
<p>It has a lot of cores which allows for extensive multitasking or multithreaded application support. VM environments can also assign dedicated CPU cores to a particular virtual machine. </p>
<p>It has a large amount of on board L1, L2, and L3 cache to speed up memory access which helps servers with high input and output IOPS  requirements. And it supports ECC memory which is a kind of RAM with built in parity checking that prevents errors and crashes caused by radiation and electromagnetic noise altering memory values. Basically it's RAM that will keep accurate values in all conditions. Normal desktop computers use non ECC memory and if a random neutron goes zipping through a memory chip and changes a 0 to a 1 it can cause corruption or a system crash. It's rare, but when you need 99.99% up time vs 99% uptime it's worth it. </p>
<p>Lastly, the number of PCIx lanes and northbridge functions allow Xeons to support very high input output operations a second (IOPS) with high speed access to multiple high performance RAID arrays, network adapters running anywhere from 1GBPS to 10GBPS, as well as multiple processor setups where a motherboard accepts 2 or more Xeon processors together. </p>
<p>Xeon chips also support a slightly different instruction set than say an I7 desktop processor. This allows it to more efficiently execute common commands you might find in an enterprise Linux environment or VMware ESXI environment. </p>
<p>One of the products I work on at my job has 16 to 32 cores and it's mission critical function is very high network, disk, and memory IOPS. The Xeon chips help it to achieve this with high bandwidth dedicated PCI express lanes, fast memory access and caching, and multiple cores allow threading of child processes to individual cores. Like 2 cores keep the database clean, 4 run DB queries, 2 handle GUI rendering, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The stomach collapses down when you haven't put anything into it.  This is different than the heart and lungs, which keep a volume of blood and air in them, respectively, and need to do so to function properly.</p>
<p>If there is still retained food in the stomach after a prolonged fast, it's frequently due a condition called gastroparesis, which means &quot;paralyzed stomach&quot;.  Gastroparesis is more common in diabetics, but non-diabetics can have it as well.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115349" target="_blank">this study</a> which quantified the amount of water in the fasted stomach as 35 ± 7 mL, so about an ounce.  When we put oro- or nasogastric tubes into patients having general anesthesia, we usually get about that much stomach juice back.  In patients with bowel obstructions, we can get a liter or more out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC: Social security number was never actually intended to be a form of identification. The IRS just needed a number that could represent someone uniquely so they picked the social security number that was already there. The social security number I think was initially focused on depression era welfare and only expanded into identification territory because it was easier than tracking people by name.</p>
<p>CGP Gray has a pretty good explanation others have linked to.</p>
<p>/u/celticeejit made a comment that compares the social security number to a primary key in an relational database, which I thought was good but was criticised by someone else for being too programmer heavy.</p>
<p>Basically, when you have a lot of data about something in a list of things, you want a specific identifier to refer to that object. e.g if you have two John Smiths, how are you supposed to tell them apart? You could refer to specific unique features about John Smith, like age or hair color or what school they went to, but it's much easier to refer to both John Smith's as 1 and 2 then it is to refer to them as John Smith with the red hair or John Smith with the gray hair. Especially if one of them has a kid also named John Smith. It's generally good form not to have a bunch of little details to identify something, when you can use a single tag/key/serial code. Also you want a form of identification to remain static so that even if little details change, the object as a whole can still be understood. For instance if Greg decides he now wants to be called Marsha Brady and has surgery to reflect this, He or She would still have the same social security number no matter who they are now.</p>
<p>A primary key ensures that no matter how much info might be shared (or similar) by two objects, they can still be referred to individually in a database. E.g when you need to get your computer or phone replaced, your manufacturer could know which phone they are fixing, whose phone it is, and the warranty status based on the serial number, even if it looks like every other phone. That might not be the actual primary key in their database, but it's the serial number may be the code they use to keep track of the warranty and other details.</p>
<p>Social Security number (despite the fact that it's insecure) is basically used as a one sized fits all identifier, or &quot;primary key&quot; because there's not really any other identifier that could be universally used. Not everyone has a driver's license, and some people aren't old enough to have voting IDs, but they probably have a social security number if they're a citizen.</p>
<p>tl'dr Even though it shouldn't be, The social security number is basically a serial number for people.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a SSA provided page about how Social Security numbers are calculated.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very insecure SSN is a consequence of the US population (and politicians) resisting the efforts to create national IDs.</p>
<p>The SSN was originally intended for one purpose: tracking a worker’s lifetime earnings in order to calculate retirement benefits after age 65. The SSA even added the disclaimer &quot;FOR SOCIAL SECURITY PURPOSES NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION&quot; to the card in 1946. </p>
<p>Many years ago the IRS allowed tax payer to declare how many dependents they had to earn a deductions. This was an honor system that obviously was abused. The INS then started to only accept dependents that had a SSN. </p>
<p>Parents then started to request SSN cards for children when they are born instead of when they started working (the original design). That increases the chances someone can [guess your SSN] (<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/webhead/2009/07/no_you_cant_have_my_social_security_number.single.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/webhead/2009/07/no_you_cant_have_my_social_security_number.single.html</a>) based on your place and date of birth. </p>
<p>Without any other form of national ID and now with most (if not all) US citizens having a federal provided identification, SSN became the defacto standard ID. From there banks, creditors, health care providers, etc. all started tracking you by your SSN. </p>
<p>That's actually a VERY BAD thing because </p>
<p>1- The SSN card is just a piece of paper, not a proper ID
2- The system was never designed to contain so much private, financial and health data
3- By combining so many ID's, it create huge risks for everyone</p>
<p>The populace should just get over it national ID issue. This paranoia people have with the federal government tracking them is silly (people should learn about this obscure not well know agency called NSA). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically, it's the <strong>only</strong> form of national ID we have, so nation-wide companies (such as credit companies) use it as the de-facto way of having a single way to identify citizens. Pretty much everyone that wanted a way to track US Citizens across multiple states now uses Social Security Numbers.</p>
<p>The problem is, there's absolutely <strong>zero</strong> security built into it. It was <em>never meant</em> to be a form of ID, so when it was created they didn't include any protections at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swallowing solids and liquids works slightly differently.</p>
<p>Swallow with an empty mouth and pay attention to what you're doing: The tip of your tongue presses against the roof of your mouth just behind your teeth, then 'rolls' along the roof of your mouth backwards towards your throat.</p>
<p>Basically, it's two actions: You open your throat and your tongue forces your food towards it.</p>
<p>When you chug water, you don't do that. There's no need to force the liquid to the back of your mouth, because your head's tipped back and gravity takes care of that for you...basically all you're doing it rhythmically opening and closing your throat.</p>
<p>So, swallowing with an empty mouth is a complex action, and because you're not swallowing anything but saliva and air, you have to manually 'reset' your tongue between swallows. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically, these answers are all a little off the mark. You can indeed swallow similarly to when you chug water. When you take a single, dry swallow (or swallow a bite of food) your voice box (larynx) raises and moves anteriorly to protect your airway (one of several safety mechanisms built into our airway). When you take sequential sips, your larynx remains raised, allowing for small movements and pressure from the bolus (water in this case) to open the muscle at the entrance to your esophagus (upper esophageal sphincter). Try swallowing and keeping your larynx high, then continue swallowing without fully &quot;resetting&quot; the system. It's easier to do with water, as swallowing is largely reflexive, but it can be done volitionally as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical speech-language pathologist: swallowing is triggered by sensory receptors in your throat. When performing a 'dry swallow' with no food or liquid in your mouth, there is no material to 'activate' these sensors. The small amount of saliva in your mouth will usually allow you to do it once or twice, but once that is gone, most people are unable to swallow until more saliva is built back up.</p>
<p>This is also why it is very difficult to prevent yourself from swallowing once food/liquid goes into your throat. Once these sensors detect a bolus, the swallow response is triggered. If, on the other hand, that sensory system is not working as it should, then you may end up with a delayed or absent swallow response. That's when I come to see you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mechanisms for causing this kind of injury can vary, and indeed it's not that well studied as it usually goes away quite quickly. The situation you are describing is called acute torticollis, and the most common reason for this is muscular over-extension/flexion. </p>
<p>The thing to remember is that the neck is very complex and there is extensive musculature which are more suited to rapid movements of the head or holding it in a neutral position. For this reason if you sleep 'wrong' then the head position you are in is usually over-extending a muscle group and over-flexing the complementary muscle group which leads to the same painful consequences as it would in the gym. </p>
<p>For an example of how this can happen, try to touch the part of your head just behind your ear to your shoulder whilst simultaneously pointing your chin up. If you hold this position for a few seconds then the muscles already fatigue, and it is quite painful. A milder version of this position over several hours while you sleep will cause much more fatigue and subsequently pain. Hope this is helpful! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll expand on the other comments. </p>
<p>Yes, there are several viruses that will result in the common cold, the most common being rhinovirus. The fact that there are multiple viruses that can give you the disease is NOT the major reason that you can get the cold more than once, since you can be infected by the same virus, like rhinovirus, many times in your life. This is because the virus mutates very quickly. </p>
<p>When human cells in your human body replicate, they have to create an exact copy of your DNA. Your cells do this very, very efficiently and effectively because there are <em>many</em> methods of fixing mistakes in your DNA. When viruses replicate their DNA/RNA, which is the part that they inject into you so you get sick, they (usually) <em>do not</em> have any way to fix mistakes in that DNA/RNA. </p>
<p>These mistakes in DNA/RNA lead to proteins (little parts in cells that actually do work) that have slightly different shapes. After infection with rhinovirus for the first time, our immune system will be trained to recognize the very specific shapes of the proteins that come from this virus. However, since the virus can mutate so quickly, the second time that you're infected by rhinovirus, the proteins from the virus will probably be a different shape than last time so your immune system can no longer fight it off effectively. </p>

<p>There are lots of different viruses that can make you sick.  </p>
<p>&quot;A cold&quot; is just a catch all term we use to describe the collective symptoms you get.  One of several common minor, non-influenza viruses made you sick?  Now you have a runny nose, sneezing and couching?  Ok, cool.  It's &quot;the cold&quot;.  </p>
<p>But, if you can't use one vaccination for all of them, why can the same medicines cure all of them?</p>
<p>They can't.  Medicine doesn't kill the cold virus itself.  </p>
<p>You just have to sit and wait for your body to kill it on its own. </p>
<p>What medicine CAN do is</p>
<p>A. Mask the symptoms so you don't feel like you have a cold (advil, dayqui)</p>
<p>B. Boost your immune system so your body can fight it better (coldeeze, etc)  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We still get sick because we're fighting a tiny war that's lasted millions of years. Our bodies have developed defences to the virus, and as it does, the virus develops defences or ways to counter the immune system. </p>
<p>First, the virus attacks in numbers. The first line immune response will catch a lot of them, but viruses make it through anyway. Even though a few may attack a single cell, it only takes 1 viral 'molecule' to completely destroy a cell and release hundreds or thousands more of itself by consuming the cell's resources and making copies, then destroying the cell. </p>
<p>First they get inside with a fake molecule marker that makes the cell thing it's taking nutrients in. Once inside, it is sent to a place where it is soaked in acid to break it down. It softens up and releases parts of itself that destroy this acid chamber that would kill it. Then it's free to float. It finds one of the cell's motor proteins and uses it to travel around. It will slowly try to get to the center of the cell. The cell itself has counters, including it's own little immune system that looks for antibodies attached to the viral molecules, but some manage to slip by. In some cases, before the cell is completely taken over, it will send a signal to the outside for white blood cells to destroy it, killing it, and the virus. </p>
<p>Along with that, once the threat it detected, the body floods the blood with antibodies, may destroy nearby cells in an area to prevent further infection by killing off potential infected before they can get out of control, and white blood cells rush to the area. Ultimately, damage is still done, the virus multiplies, and makes it's way out when you cough or sneeze, free to infect others. It's an overall success once it leaves with more than it started with, even if the rest in your body ultimately get destroyed and you heal. </p>
<p>The fact you can heal and fight it means your body is already prepared for it. </p>
