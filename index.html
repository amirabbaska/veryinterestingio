When she realised it was the mirror she would just sit and stare in to it and I am sure she saw her sister in her own reflection and missed and mourned her.

The other day my gf was out with him and stumbled upon another owner with the same breed. They started talking and it turned out that the dogs were siblings. All My gf had to say about the reaction was that our dog was very playful with his brother and didn't get jealous when My gf went to pet the other dog. Usually when he sees other dogs he gets a little aggressive and assertive and he is also very jealous so I don't know perhaps, but then again it could also be that he just happened to like this dog which is about 1/25 dogs he walks by.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Endocrine system generally, but it's also important connective tissue. Fat cells derive embryologically from mesoderm (there are three basic embryologic tissues). Also, you may be interested to know that there are two types of fat (let's call it adipose)-- white adipose and brown adipose. White adipose is typically what you think of when you consider fat. It's the stuff that's under your skin, in your belly, thighs, around your heart, kidneys, and etc. Brown adipose on the other hand tends to be around only when you are an infant, and it actually actively burns carbs and fat to create heat. It's brown because they contain iron rich mitochondria, which are the cellular machinery for burning through chemical energy. People have tried to harness / reactivate this stuff over time, and it's a pretty interesting research field in itself.</p>
<p>If you're interested in some peer reviewed lit on the subject, see: doi:10.1038/nm.3361 &quot;Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential&quot;</p>
<p>As to your question about tissues not being strictly &quot;monogamous,&quot; there are tons of examples!-- blood, blood vessels, nerves, muscles all comprise important parts of various organs. Generally, various tissues compose an organ, and organs work together in organ systems to carry out a specific function. For example, renal tubules are a tissue but they work along side smooth muscle, blood vessels, neurons, and endocrine tissue in the kidneys (an organ), which are an important part of the renal or excretory system. The human body is a wonderful thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Fat, otherwise known as adipose, is a loose connective tissue used to store fat cells. The purpose of fat is insulation, nutrient storage and cushioning. For example, there is a pad of fat that helps hold your eyes in place!
Recently, adipose has also been considered an endocrine organ! This means some people consider it an organ that releases hormones into our body!
I hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is fat is important to several systems; endocrine, musculoskeletal, digestive to name a few.</p>
<p>Another example of a tissue that isnt just for one system is epithelia.  Epithelia makes up a lot of our integumentary system (so does subcutaneous fat) but it also lones our visceral organs so it is represented in respiratory, digestive, urogenital to name a few.</p>
<p>Just remember the heirarchy. multiple cells make up a tissue, multiple tissues make up an organ, multiple organs make up a system.  It also depends on what you mean when you say fat.  We have fat cells that make up our energy stores but we also have lipids that are made of fatty acids attached to a polar group, e.g. our cells have a outer membranes made up of a double layer of phospholipids.  Lipids also serve as various signaling molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fatty tissue consists of a delicate tangle of crystalline orbs of trigyceride suspended by a network of collagen fibers. It may be metabolically active, absorbing glucose and fatty acids from the blood stream and making TG as a calorie-dense storage. This activity is under endocrine control through membrane-bound receptors mostly. These cells do not divide but get larger and smaller as they store and release TG. In some cases fatty organs surround other organs for mechanical protection and are free of receptors and don't do much but sit there absorbing life's blow. A rare form of adipocytes, brown fat, makes heat by short circuiting oxphos in mitochondria. Little mammal use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nah, I don't think it would be enough to cause an economic depression.  To quote from a Mr. Money Mustache (Early retirement blogger) article:</p>
<p>&quot;Newspaper reporters often repeat the phrase that consumers are the engine of economic growth in the United States. They say it so often that most people believe it, as witnessed by the quotes above. But when you read books written by economists (who in general know more about economics than newspaper reporters), they tell you that consumers are not the engine of economic growth. They are actually the caboose.</p>
<p>What is the engine of growth, then? It is the savers and investors. Only by sacrificing current consumption, can people put money into banks or share offerings, which end up in the hands of new and existing businesses who can then use that money to create new technology, factories, or human capital, allowing them to increase their productivity. Capital creates productivity, and productivity is the driver of our standard of living.&quot;</p>
<p>He has a lot more detail in the article, but that's the jist of it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of confusion in this thread - and not just here, you see it in a lot of &quot;economic&quot; journalism - between the drivers of short-term economic fluctuations (booms, busts, recessions) and the drivers of long-term growth. </p>
<p>The economy has a certain level of potential output: that is what would be produced if all workers were fully employed (except those who are temporarily out of a job because they're looking for work), all  factories produced at full capacity, all service businesses provided as much service as they can etc. This grows (we think) more or less steadily over time as workers enter the workforce, factories are constructed etc. </p>
<p>Sometimes the economy is below potential (as signified, for example, by a high rate of unemployment). Sometimes, more rarely, it's above (this can cause inflation). </p>
<p>If people suddenly stop spending as much, and save more, this will reduce GDP, because whatever they would have spent it on won't get made or sold. If spending falls enough, we might have a recession. But it shouldn't affect potential output. Eventually the economy should adjust (e.g. from a fall in prices) and we'll get back to potential, even at the higher level of savings.</p>
<p>And more savings should, eventually, lead to higher growth, because there will be more resources available for investment - new factories, new software, etc - which will support a higher level of potential output. </p>
<p>So the answer to your question is, yes, in the short term, there would be a recession, but if the overall level of savings increases this should support faster growth in the long term. </p>
<p>Of course this is a very simple model (it's the starting point for most economists, not the end point). In an open economy, you'd have to think about the impact on the exchange rate, capital flows, global demand. And a prolonged recession can hurt potential output as people lose skills, and the capital stock deteriorates. But distinguishing short-term fluctuations from long-term potential is a good way to start thinking about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You put savings for emergencies and retirements under the same category but they have massively different impact on the economy. When you save money for emergencies you put the money away in a safe savings account where they can be quickly retrieved when needed. This means that the wealth you have created will not be contributing to the economy very much as the bank need to keep the money on hand and not take any risks with them. But it is only recommended that you save about 2-6 months worth of expenses for emergencies which in the grand scheme of things is not that much.</p>
<p>Retirement on the other hand is quite different kind of savings. When you put money in a retirement fund you tell the bank to try to make them grow as much as possible as you do not need any of it until decades later. So the bank will make money the best way they can by investing the money. And since you do not need the money for a long time they can do pretty risky investments at that. This will give the economy a boost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If they were investing it or at least putting it in the bank, not necessarily because then the money would still end up moving around the economy when your bank loaned it out to someone or the sellers of the stocks your mutual fund bought turned around and bought cocaine wirh the money, or whatever the case my be. It would definitely have an effect on the economy because the money would end up being used differently if it ended up in the hands of banks vs retail companies, but I have no idea whether it would be good or bad on balance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Tens of thousands of years ago our ancestors found there was a distinct survival advantage in working together in familial groups. As such, we gradually augmented our existing survival attributes with social behaviours that would cause us to stay together when under stress.</p>
<p>Facial expressions, grooming each others fur, crying, touching, vocalisations etc. All of these things help communicate individual feelings and establish social structures. When you are being hugged or touched, your brain is rewarding you for taking part in actions that will improve your overall survival chances by releasing Oxytocin to calm your nervous system.</p>
<p>Remember, you are a product of a very, VERY long and unbroken chain of surviving organisms, stretching back millions of years. The actions that kept you alive were rewarded with <em>pleasure</em> hormones (eating, drinking, bonding, fucking, hugging etc). The actions that reduced your chances are either not rewarded at all, or marked by an unpleasant sensation we call <em>pain</em>.</p>
<p>This is why most people get lonely when away from other people. You're reducing your survival chances and so your body is trying to compel you to return to your kind. And hugging feels so good because you're being rewarded for bonding with said kind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Hugs cause our brain to release a chemical called oxytocin, otherwise known as the &quot;cuddle chemical&quot; because of the way it makes us feel. There's no way for us to be <em>sure</em> of the reasons for this reaction (it'd be like asking: &quot;Why do we have ten toes?&quot;), but we have some pretty good guesses. The pleasure we get encouraged us (as early humans) to be social, which as SovietWomble says, likely boosted our chances for survival enough that the trait won out.</p>
<p>About a week ago scientists reported that dogs have the same chemical release when we pet them: our touch makes them feel good. Apparently, when they stare happily at us, they're trying to provoke that feeling within us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolute speed would have to depend on absolute space and absolute time (since speed is a relationship of distance over time).</p>
<p>So, to have an absolute speed of zero, you would need to be stationary with respect to some absolute frame of reference, against all which is moving, moves. </p>
<p>Newton precedes you in the belief in such a system, however already in his own time, this belief was not universal, and has since been disproven. </p>
<p>General relativity tells us that there is no absolute frame of reference (actually, it tells us that all frames are relative, which is close but not the same as there is no absolute frame).</p>
<p>In fact, relativity tells us that in all of this there is actually only one thing which <em>is</em> absolute. The speed of light. </p>
<p>The closest we can come to 'zero speed' is by measuring our velocity against background radiation, in other words, relative to the average velocity of matter immediately after the big bang happened.</p>
<p>But the structure of physics precludes the existence of any 'absolute' or 'true' measure of space or time. Everything depends on the frame of reference from which you measure it. Everything, that is, except the speed of light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first clocks were sun dials, and originally the duration of a day was divided into 12 equal segments by the Egyptians.  These became hours, and obviously over time we discovered ways of counting the hours during night time as well.</p>
<p>The Babylonians divided the hour in 60 minutes, but it took a long time before minutes could be accurately measured.</p>
<p>In Medieval times in Europe a wide variety of mechanical devices were created that mimicked the sun dial (which is what decided which direction clockwise was). The mechanical clocks started to measure out minutes, although they were frequently inaccurate especially at this level of precision.</p>
<p>In the 1600s Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum clock, and this was the first device that could accurately and reliably measure minutes.</p>
<p>Over time the pendulum clocks were improved and made more accurate, <strong>it was only at this point that we were able to measure seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>Around this time we began to redefine time. Previously time was based on the Earth rotation, the passage of the sun across the sky, as reflected by the sun dials of old.  With these new mechanical devices we were able to have a more accurate way of measuring time.</p>
<p>For a while a second was defined as a fraction of a year,  1/31,556,925.9747</p>
<p>It wasnt until the invention of atomic clocks that we settled upon the now standard length of time elapsed by a second.  Technically a second is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We chose the caesium-133 atom because it has an extremely regular periods.  And we chose that 9.1 billion number because it was extremely close to the accepted length of a second at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>With the development of the atomic clock in the early 1960s, it was decided to use atomic time as the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.</p>
<p>Following several years of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, England) and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) determined the relationship between the hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second. Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV, they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. They found that the second of ephemeris time (ET) had the duration of 9,192,631,770 ± 20 cycles of the chosen caesium frequency. As a result, in 1967 the Thirteenth General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the SI second of atomic time as stated above.</p>
<p>This SI second, referred to atomic time, was later verified to be in agreement, within 1 part in 1010, with the second of ephemeris time as determined from lunar observations (the previous SI for 1 second)</p>
<p>Although, for specialized purposes, a second may be used as a unit of time in time scales where the precise length differs slightly from the SI definition. One such time scale is UT1, a form of universal time. The SI second is not the 'legal standard' for timekeeping throughout the world, only that &quot;over the years UTC [which ticks SI seconds] has become either the basis for legal time of many countries, or accepted as the de facto basis for standard civil time </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have bipolar disorder, and while depression is part of it, it is not the same disorder as standard (unipolar) depression. Bipolar is alternating episodes of depression and mania. Giving someone with bipolar an SSRI often actually triggers mania:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The symptoms of mania include: elevated mood, inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, difficulty maintaining attention, increase in goal-directed activity, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. These manic symptoms significantly impact a person's daily living.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A lot of people with bipolar are diagnosed when they having a depressive episode, and you can't tell the difference from regular depression, so that's what you assume is going on. So you take antidepressants and you get better! In fact, you feel great! SO awesome. Very productive! I'm amazing, I'm going to change the world, who needs to sleep, isn't everything FANTASTIC?! Hypomania, the more common lesser form of mania (vs say, psychotic mania), can often be sustainable for quite a while. </p>
<p>I was diagnosed with bipolar after being depressed, taking Prozac, and <em>going out of my mind</em>, absolutely off the deep end, hypomanic. But I thought it was great! I was super happy! I mean, my life was falling apart because I was batshit crazy, impulsive, delusional and scared people. But hey, I wasn't depressed, so the drugs were working!! It took almost a year to figure it out and change to suitable medication.</p>
<p>So yeah, that can happen when someone who is not actually depressed (although exhibits symptoms indistinguishable from depression) takes an SSRI. It made me TOO happy. Basically, too <em>everything</em>. Too much energy, too many impulses, you're gonna have a bad time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I almost removed the post because it is posing a hypothetical, however since this is a hypothetical that actually happens, why not discuss. </p>
<p>Most anti depressents fall into a class of drugs called SSRI's or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. They do exactly what the name suggests, they slow down or inhibit, the re-uptake or absorption / recycling of serotonin. </p>
<p>Serotonin is a neurochemical responsible for the neuron to neuron conduction of signals. The signals are electrical, but the transmission is done chemically and the serotonin controls the rate of this transmission. </p>
<p>What is supposed to happen is an impulse is transmitted between two neurons at the synapse, serotonin is used, and then it is reabsorbed to prepare for the next impulse. The theory of SSRI's effect on depression is that depression is caused by lower impulse rates which inhibit communication within the brain. That the conduction of signals from neuron to neuron is not working at the level of a healthy brain. You might say it's running too slow, or not responsive enough to the communication that jumps around between different lobes of the brain. </p>
<p>So they have these drugs and they inhibit the uptake of serotonin and this leads to higher levels of serotonin, which in turn facilitates easier neuron to neuron transmission across the synapses. In other words it sort of speeds up or facilitates better neuron to neuron conduction. It doesn't make you think faster exactly, but instead allows the communication in the brain to work faster and be more responsive rather than isolated and sluggish as in the depressed brain. </p>
<p>So if you gave an SSRI to someone who's brain was not in a physical state of depression, it would have the same action as if used on a depressed brain. It would facilitate faster neural signalling. What this would mean for the person taking the pill is much the same as what it would mean for a depressed person taking it. </p>
<p>Sexual side effects, changes in mood, altered perception, strange thoughts, changes in sleep patterns, drug use, and personality. The same effects for all. But in a depressed mind, these side effects are less damaging than the depression itself, so it's a good trade off. If someone is really depressed, and in danger of hurting themselves or someone else, the SSRI's along with mood stabilizers like Lithium  or alprazolam can keep them stable until they can get past the crisis. They can work very well in short term therapy. In the long term people can develop resistance, and find they have to adjust dosage and maybe even try other SSRI's in order to keep getting the therapeutic effects. For this reason drugs are usually prescribed along with therapy in order to help a person through the crisis, and give them some stability to start coming to terms with it or fixing the root cause if there is one. </p>
<p>I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice. I do have experience with this though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi. Long time user of antidepressants here. To truly ELI5: Taking antidepressants (SSRI) has an effect kind of like focusing a camera. There is a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where everything is in focus (not depressed). If the serotonin levels are above or below that depression occurs. Antidepressants boost the effect of the serotonin present. If it's already at the correct level, it may be pushed beyond the sweet spot and cause problems. Therefore, if a person who didn't need antidepressants took them, it may cause depression. Of course, the real world is not so clean cut and actual effects and side effects will vary from person to person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Warming oils makes them less viscous, making them more easily penetrate the porous plastic, staining it. This process is enhanced by the significant volume of pigment.</p>
<p>Since the pigment is easily seen, even small amounts are visible. To shift the stain you'll need patience, washing soap and more heat.</p>
<p>Seal your spag sauce in glass containers and never have this problem again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The way a yoyo works is this: the string isn't tight to the bearing which is how you can walk the dog etc. If you cause enough snap, it starts to wind, then due to the spinning, causes it to wind back on the string itself. Gravity plays no real part in basic yoyoing, only in certain tricks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

To be honest, a Yo-yo in space would bounce back harder I believe.  The gravity would not be affecting the yo-yo's repercussion.
Long story short, yes, it would actually make a yo-yo more effective; or annoying depending on how you treat it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because you can throw the yo-yo and when it reaches the end of it's string it will rewind itself.</p>
<p>The mere fact you can yo-yo horizontally proves that gravity has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>It is purely the yo-yo and the string interacting with the force of your throw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A yo-yo returns solely when the string catches on itself and rewinds. Gravity has no role in this process.</p>
<p>At times when the yo-yo is spinning at the end of a string without winding, the string is kept taut by the yo-yo's weight and/or swinging the yo-yo, preventing it from catching on itself. Once the string is loosened (by giving it a short tug or moving your hand towards the yo-yo), it will usually rewind.</p>
<p>On cheaper models, there isn't a bearing. The string can be knotted around the axle too tight for it to spin freely, and so may always rewind rather than hang.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As something of an aside, most diamonds are not actually formed from coal. Much of the carbon that went on to form diamonds likely predates any of the living material that would form coal altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
