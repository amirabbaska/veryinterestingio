<p>It's also important to recognise that there are <em>consciously</em> false answers and <em>unconscious</em> falsehoods. For instance that <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/05/05/only-2-say-they-are-below-average-intelligence/" target="_blank">practically everyone</a> considers themselves to be of average/above average intelligence. Repeated surveys asking the same questions in different settings and with different groups can build up a wider store of knowledge about likely responses such that, for instance, if I am asking something that is related to intelligence I can control for an over-reporting of 'above average' and an under-reporting of 'below average'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>In large enough populations, we may use 'trimmed means'.  For example, we would throw out the top and bottom 10% of responses.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a larger questionnaire, you can use control questions to throw out people who are just 'marking every box the same way', or aren't really considering the question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our surveys are for lawsuits, and the respondents are often known people, and we have other data on them.  So we can compare their answers to their data, to get a measure of reasonableness.  In rare cases where there are mis-matches, we might adjust our results, or state that our results may be over- or under-estimated.</p>
</li>
<li>Looking at IP addresses of responses may help determine is significant numbers of people are using VPN or other methods to 'vote early, vote often'.  Limiting responses to certain IP addresses may be helpful.</li>

<p>It works like this: </p>

<p>For half of the respondents, provide a list of 4 actions, a list that does <em>not</em> include intravenous drug use, and say &quot;how many have you done in the last month/year/whatever&quot;. Not <em>which</em>, but <em>how many</em>. </p>
<p>For the other half of respondents, provide a list of 5 things, the 4 from before, <em>plus</em> intravenous drug use, and again ask how many.</p>
<p>The difference in the average answers between the two groups indicates the rate of intravenous drug use among the respondents. </p>

<p>The bacteria in your mouth aren't &quot;attacking&quot; your teeth. They just live there. </p>
<p>You need 3 things to get a cavity.
1) a place for bacteria to hide out and around (teeth)
2) food for them to eat up (the crap you leave on your teeth)
3) bacteria</p>
<p>Any one of those things missing, and you can't get a cavity. </p>
<p>The bacteria are just hiding out in your mouth (and your teeth are one of the places they hide out). They're happily just chillin' and eating the crap you forgot to brush and floss off. And they take a big dump and leave it there. It just so happens the bacteria create acid.  When they take a dump on your tooth, they leave acid behind. It's that that causes your cavities. </p>
<p>All that acidic byproduct is what causes tiny holes in your teeth that turn into bigger holes. </p>
<p>Next thing you know they're like- &quot;holy crap, I just built myself a nice condo and that muthafucka isn't brushing! Hells yes! It's the muthafuckin' Golden Corral up in this biz&quot;</p>
<p>So, yeah. That pretty much sums it up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not really true. There can be bacteria residing in any part of your body that can become a problem given the chance. There's something called 'dysbiosis' when the normal structure of the bacterial communities in or on your body is out of whack. Maybe one kind of bacteria that is not usually a problem will bloom, causing inflammation and disease. These are called opportunistic pathogens. For example, Staph aureus is a 'commensal' (a bacteria that normally is found in the human microbiome) and most people have it in their nostrils and on their skin. MRSA is a drug resistant strain of Staph aureus, but in people who are vulnerable it can cause nasty skin ulcers, osteomyelitis, or sepsis. I work with MRSA all the time and probably have tracked it onto my skin at some point, but I have never been infected because my immune system works normally, it hasn't encountered open wounds, and I take proper clean up and containment measures. Another example: Candida albicans is a yeast that causes the common female yeast infection. It's also a commensal, meaning that most women have it in their vaginal area at low levels. If given the chance, it can bloom into a full blown infection but by no means is it a infectious transmitted disease like HIV. In short, the bacteria in your mouth in normal cases shouldn't be any more virulent than the bacteria in other parts of your body. In a healthy state bacterial populations are overall stable and avirulent. But if conditions allow a virulent strain to do much much better than its competitors then by god it will take over and wreak havoc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They are there because they are good at breaking down things that are coming into your body, but they are also aggressive and not well-trained. They'll stop someone from stealing stuff from you, but they might also bite your friend they've never met before.</p>
<p>Also, there are other bacteria in your body that are even worse. The stuff that lives in your intestines is like a pack of wolves. As long as they're contained in your guts, they are great at breaking down almost anything that comes through. If they ever get out, though, they'll try to eat everything they come across.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dental student here. Like most have said before bacteria have evolved along side us for millions of years to foster a mutually beneficial relationship (symbiosis), harmful relationship (parasitism) or neither beneficial/harmful relationship (commensalism) with us humans. Now with that in mind, bacteria in your mouth are quite comfortable where they are and under normal circumstances, in a healthy adult with good oral hygiene, they do us no harm and are just along for the ride. </p>
<p>However, if a change in environment presents itself, such as excessive sugar consumption coupled with improper oral hygiene, they can become what is called opportunistic pathogens. They take this excess sugar and eat it for energy and release acid as the waste product. This acid is what destroys your teeth, and cause cavities. </p>
<p>Many of the species of bacteria that reside inside/on us present this ability to do harm if displaced to another body cavity or their immediate surroundings change in condition (acidity, nutrient supply, less competition etc)</p>
<p>More like an explain like I'm 12 but you get the point.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In all seriousness though, I'm in the UK and it's very rare to see a bidet here.  Whenever I've encountered one abroad I have been too unsure about the logistics of it to even attempt to use it.  I think I have only ever seen them in Italy and maybe Spain?  And in all cases it's been a separate unit like <a href="https://www.villeroy-boch.hu/fileadmin/upload/facelift2014/Bad_und_Wellness/Produktkategorie/Bidets/bidet-montage-omnia.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>, rather than an integrated one like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/JapaneseToiletBidet.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of the separate unit, what do you do?  Like turn the tap on and position your arsehole so that the water sprays it?  Wet your hand then use your wet hand to wipe your arse?  Wet toilet paper then use that to wipe?  I honestly don't even know which way you face when you use it.</p>
<p>And if you have an integrated one, how do you avoid shitting on the nozzle?  Is it retractable?  If you have explosive diarrhoea then surely the bidet mechanism has all manner of nooks and crannies in it that you will never be able to clean all the shit out of properly?</p>
<p>To someone who is unfamiliar with them it all seems extremely confusing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a large number of contributors.</p>
<p>Origin point and time of the bidet. They were invented in the 17th century in Europe, and thus they would have spread to regional areas as a custom. Generally when people get used to a bidet (particularly one with warm water), they'll stick with it if it's possible and convenient. </p>
<p>Cultural momentum. If all the houses in a country have bidets rather than plain toilets, newly built houses will usually have bidets rather than toilets. It's the way things were done, so it's the way things will be done. And some countries even go to the point of requiring it by law.</p>
<p>Attachment to cleanliness. In the same way there are massive differences in how the process of &quot;bathing&quot; happen, there are cultural differences in how a person's toilet is approached. Some cultures place a lot more importance and ceremony on acts of personal toiletry like washing and bathing so, like in Japan, they'll lean toward using bidets.</p>
<p>Availability of toilet paper. Here in Canada bidets really haven't caught on because wood and paper are so available and cheap. In other cultures where there's not such a massively available supply, there's a bit more of a preference to save paper by using a bidet.</p>
<p>Aging population. Bidets make clean-up easier and they'll likely become more popular as we have more gray haired people with mobility issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just cultural anomalies. I live in England, and we bought a house recently which came with a bidet. This is unusual in the UK, and we don't use the bidet...we've discussed taking it out when we remodel the bathroom in a couple years, making room for a larger bath, perhaps.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>However, I can objectively see why a bidet would be more desirable, especially if that's what you're used to. If you simply use toilet paper, there will undoubtedly be at least a trace amount of your faecal matter remaining. Realistically, if you're wiping &quot;until the paper comes away clean&quot;, this should be a negligible amount and it will be 'contained' within the buttocks. It's not as though you 'spread it around'. Also, with daily showering, any sane person will be washing the area between their buttocks with soap and water anyway. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work with wildlife in a rehab clinic and I can tell you, though not with exact science, that we use light to convince the animals it's night or day. </p>
<p>For example, if we want to do surgery on an animal or an examination, we'll change the lighting to make it passive before we sedate it. This convinces the animal it's either day or night, depending on the normal schedule of the animal, and they relax. We then sedate them with a gas and do our thing. After the surgery, if they're capable and cleared by the vets, we'll put them back in their cage and alter the lights to their feeding time. We don't feed prior to surgery, so if possible, we like to give them something to boost their energy and spirits after. </p>
<p>We also use light to control behaviour. If a bird escapes their cage, we'll turn off all the lights to stop it from panicking and flying to a light source (what they perceive to be the sun or sky) and hurting itself. For diurnal animals during cleaning, we'll place them in a kennel cab and cover it completely, convincing the animal it's night time and it'll go to sleep. Vice versa for nocturnal animals.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this answers your question at all on perception of time, but to me it is evidence that, unlike humans, an animal's perception can be manually controlled via light and darkness.</p>
<p>EDIT: Shamelessly plugging wildlife care on my popular comment! If you see any wild animal that is behaving erratically, not following a known pattern (nocturnal animal out wandering during the day for example), or that looks malnourished or in anyway distressed, please contact your local wildlife centre or animal control. We can easily coexist with wildlife, and there's no reason to let an animal suffer when help is just a phone call away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I don't know if it's universal but many animals will adopt an approximately 24 hour wake/sleep cycle even in the absence of light. The circadian rhythm is driven by the brain. You can extend or shorten it to a degree by artificially controlling light exposure but only by a certain amount.</p>
<p>Fun fact: while humans' (and many animals) circadian rhythm is reset by light entering our eyes, ducks also have light sensitive neurons <em>in their brain</em> related to circadian rhythm. That means that a blind duck would still adopt a day/night cycle aligned with the rising and setting of the sun because enough light passes through their skull to activate those cells.</p>
<p>It's pretty hard to say how animals actually perceive time, though. I'm curious - what exactly do you mean by that? What kinds of descriptions are you expecting to see?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will answer this by reposting a comment I wrote in the thread that likely inspired this question...</p>
<p><strong><em>Production</em></strong></p>
<p>Basically, there are two main ways to make graphene: one is to start with graphite and try to separate the layers to individual layers; the other (CVD) is to stick individual carbon atoms onto a metal catalyst/substrate, so that all the carbons bond to each other to make graphene.</p>
<p><strong>CVD</strong></p>
<p>Now, with CVD, we can make insanely high-quality and purity graphene. But, CVD is very limited in scale. Basically imagine you are trying to make the world biggest pizza. You're limited by your oven, the wooden board to put it in and take it out of the oven, etc. CVD works best in batch-type processes, and unless the reaction works in air (which with graphene, it does not) you cannot have a continuous &quot;conveyer belt&quot; CVD process.</p>
<p>CVD is great for small-scale graphene, but difficult to scale to any industrial applications; maybe with specific high-end transistors or optoelectronic components, but more specialty stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Starting from Graphite</strong></p>
<p>Now, when you start from graphite... That's how graphene was first produced, in 2003 (published in 2004). They used scotch tape, and had some poor guy sitting there peeling scotch graphite with scotch tape for hours and hours, and found that a very small percentage of the particles on the tape were peeled into single layers (ie., graphene).</p>
<p>Since then, improved &quot;top-down&quot; methods have been developed, generally with two routes. One is to put graphite into DMF/NMP or ionic liquids, some of the very small number of solvents in which graphene remains stable-ish, and then to either use sonic vibrations (sonication) or other methods to shake or spread the layers apart. Here, you have a delicate balance. More energy input = more sheets separated, but also more damage to the sheets. Typical yields are under 1%, so to get 1 gram of graphene, you're usually looking at about 1 kg of graphite. Graphite isn't expensive, but the main challenge is the scale of reaction becomes difficult, and isolating single layer graphene from the many, many few-layer (typically defined as 2-10 or 2-50 layers, depending who you ask) is very, very difficult.</p>
<p>The other top-down approach is to oxidize graphite, commonly with a mix of acids and oxidizing catalysts (Hummers' Method), to get graphite oxide. This can then be sonicated to single layer sheets of graphene oxide, with up to 30% yields. However, it uses very harsh chemicals, in huge reaction volumes (dozens of liters to get grams) and the product has tons of oxygen defects, which drastically reduce the electrical and optical properties, and even mechanical properties. You can then use reducing agents to remove many of these defects, in ideal cases improving purity from about 50-70% initially up to 96%. However, doing this takes time, and yield after reduction is not very high, and it still is not nearly as good for electronics as CVD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Applications</em></strong></p>
<p>So basically, graphene falls into three categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>High quality in limited scale (CVD and even the first class of Top Down): really interesting for fundamental science, people can do and learn amazing things with it. Already has applications in research, but niche stuff that wouldn't support a whole industry. Could, potentially, be a big thing for some optoelectronic devices with further development, and either cost reduction or improved scaling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decent quality, in good yields (reduced graphene oxide): With the higher yield, it has a lot more fields where it's interesting. Mechanical properties are still very good, so structural composites are already a thing (similar to chopped fiber composites, almost). Optical and electronic, you already lose a lot of the amazingness that graphene can offer, even with the very small impurities in this stuff. Also, these materials are much less geometrically uniform, making subsequent manufacture into electronic components more challenging. There's also a lot of interest in these materials for biomedical and biotechnical applications, but still tons of questions. Some studies claim that graphene can be toxic, some say it's not. Looking deeper, we see that the details matter - some types of cells can handle some types of graphene, others can't, and anything you change, changes the outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>Shitty quality, very high yield (sticking with graphene oxide): basically useless for electronics, some optical stuff is still possible, but not the exotic stuff. Also interesting for bio stuff, but with the same problems as above. One nice thing, GOxide is pretty stable in water, which graphene is not, without modification - which can be important for bio applications, since water shows up a lot in biological systems!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>What to Expect</em></strong></p>
<p>Graphene can do a lot of wonderful things, that part of the story is true - it is a wonder material. The challenges are also there, though. First, you have to come up with a way to use these properties for beneficial applications. Then, you have to be able to produce the product/device cheaply enough, and fast enough, for the application - electronics generally need higher quality and can tolerate lower (but still high) throughput, while bio looks like quality is less important (research into how purity and other factors affect graphene in the body is very complex and ongoing) but really needs very high throughput - just think about the number of grams you need to put into one patient's allotment of pills (gram-scale) vs. the amount of precious heavy metals in your cell phone's semiconductors (barely measurable).</p>
<p>The biggest thing is, in some of these fields, there are other materials that are maybe not as impressive, but much easier to produce and use. To put it simply, if you can get 70% of the performance, and it's still 20% better than the current options, or you can invest time and money trying to wait it out for graphene to get that 95% performance... What would you do?</p>
<p>TL;DR - Graphene is in many simultaneous races (each application/industry is separate, after all) to become feasible faster than the market decides to just go with one of those &quot;almost as good&quot; options. This could kill graphene for those fields, if companies already shift manufacturing and processing to use these alternative materials, potentially driving up the cost to adopt graphene materials in the future, making feasibility an even bigger problem.</p>
<p>EDIT: I hope it goes without saying, anything you are still curious about, or would like explained more, or ELI5'ed, just ask. It's always challenging to judge or predict how deep of an answer people are looking for, so I hope I struck an acceptable balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a company that handles the infrastructure for a large streaming platform in Australia. CDN's are great at handling static files (pictures, videos, etc) but the majority of the workload come from things like API calls that can't be cached or change on a per-user, per-session basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the user play this video file?</li>
<li>Are they authenticated?</li>
<li>What is the DRM key that is used to decrypt the potentially encrypted fragments?</li>
</ul>
<p>All these can't be cached to the same degree as video files. The newest GoT season started with a spectacular failure of our largest cable provider's online platform - which was due to the fact that the authentication service couldn't handle the load. So all the video files were there, all the DRM keys available, but because no one could prove who they were, there was no playback.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process is generally known as &quot;playout&quot; (see the WIkipedia article).</p>
<p>CDNs are a major part of the last step. But there is a whole massive video processing infrastructure to even get to that step from the creator supplying the content. Content acquisition systems fetch the content from wherever it is generated (for GoT it is reasonably simple but for a complex live broadcast video will be being acquired from many places over many different technologies). Then there are the transcoding servers. And don't forget ad-insertion. And eventually some streaming servers. All before you get to the CDNs.</p>
<p>These are really big engineering projects -- each step involves large server farms, built around massive, fast storage.</p>
<p>And sending the bits would be useless without the operational management, quality assurance and fault and performance management systems to make the whole lot work reliably.</p>
<p>I don't know about HBO, but many broadcasters outsource playout to specialist companies you have never heard of. For example, my employer handles playout for a large European TV broadcaster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is one reason.  The last thing you want is for someone with a vigilante mindset to find someone in their locality with the same first and last name and then &quot;take matters into their own hand&quot;.  They want to avoid mistaken identity.</p>
<p>The other reason is that in the United States it is pretty uncommon for people to go by their full first, middle, and last names.  So if there is an alleged perpetrator named &quot;James Fields&quot; and he gets wide enough publicity as &quot;James Fields&quot;, every other James Fields ends up with a bit of a smudge on their reputation, even among people who know that they had nothing to do with the infamous actor.  In other words, they get &quot;Oh...your name is James Fields, like that guy from Charlottesville&quot;.  OTOH, if the media refers to them in an uncommon way that seems unnatural, like &quot;James Alex Fields Junior&quot;, then it creates a bit of a separation between the alleged perpetrator and everyone who shares the name.  Basically, it's an attempt to avoid &quot;ruining the name&quot; rather than an attempt to avoid &quot;mistaken identity&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since no one answered yet, I'll tell you a bit (I work in a Sleep clinic).  I don't have much time, so I'll keep it truly ELI5.  </p>
<p><strong>Short Version:</strong> We are not supposed to talk in our sleep, so when it does happen it's cause something is going wrong.  And usually the reason it is happening is because of the body's failure to keep the body completely and entirely paralyzed.  </p>
<p>It most of the time takes place during the part of sleep where we more often dream (i.e. REM sleep). During this time, you body is supposed to <em>actively</em> paralyze <em>all</em> your voluntary muscles (i.e. &quot;skeletal muscles&quot;). In other words, your body is making sure you can't move, primarily, it is thought, to make sure you don't act out your dreams.  Probably so you don't kill/hurt yourself pretending to do various things.  </p>
<p>With many people, this active paralysis isn't as complete as it should be.  So occasionally people talk.  But since talking isn't per se that dangerous, there's probably not a lot of pressure for it to be eliminated (throughout the many generations of people).  </p>
<p>Most people who talk, usually don't say very much or say it very clearly/coherently.  And usually only talk briefly.  Those people who seem to have full conversations/speech/confessions are few and far in between.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The first implies you are going to church for Sunday service or similar.
The second just means you are going to the physical church building.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why they diverged on some things like hospital but not others.</p>
