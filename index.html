		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's going to have their own reason, that somewhat reflects their opinions of society, so that needs to be considered, but my two cents:</p>
<p>Values and costs related to raising children.  It wasn't until fairly recently that a person would study and train for 20 years before they could start working, and education beyond that would largely effect how much you would make.  That means that in order for a child to begin making money, they need to be a full-grown independent adult, with substantial financial investment by their parents.  </p>
<p>This wasn't the case in the past.  100 years ago, a relatively young child, with relatively non-existent education could be economically productive, especially in less developed, more agricultural areas.  That means that a child could spend something like 10 years working before they were ready to go out on their own, which was an economic benefit to their families, lessening workload, <em>and</em> providing a sort of retirement plan.  They were an investment.</p>
<p>In those situations, it wasn't just economically feasible to be a stay-at-home mom, it was good business, a woman could find herself doing much better in most situations with a horde of children doing chores in a farm or working in factories, this incentivized getting <em>and staying</em> married.  </p>
<p>Today, your eight year old son, for most situations, isn't tending to the livestock.  They're going to school, costing money, and will likely leave the moment they become economically self-sufficient (in their mid-20s).  That means that raising kids is something you do for fun or self-fulfillment, and marriage goes right along with it.  If you don't want to spend all of your time raising six kids, you don't need a spouse to either make money or manage the household.</p>
<p>If you don't <em>need</em> a spouse, then the only thing keeping you together is feelings and emotion, which no matter how sentimental a person is, just doesn't have the same pull as &quot;My plan for when I get old is to live in this same house with these kids taking care of me, and if we get divorced, I'll have nothing.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind is that, until the mid-1970s, no-fault divorces were not legal in the US.  The only way to get out of a bad marriage was for one spouse to do something seriously wrong, like committing infidelity or (seriously) physically abusing the other.</p>
<p>That's why <a href="https://www.papermasters.com/images/divorce-rate.jpg" target="_blank">the US divorce rate</a> rapidly went up through the 1970s, peaking in 1980 and has been going down steadily since.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People rushed into marriage early on because that's how it had been done in the past, and because of the social pressures against pre-marital sex, etc. So if people wanted to engage in that, then they rushed into marriages. And marriages in the past weren't more successful, it's just that people were trapped in them -- both genders because of societal pressures, and women because they had limited means to support themselves. That's why, when divorce did become more accepted in the 70's, there were a ton of divorces... people who may have wanted out of marriages for a decade or more finally felt they could leave a bad marriage. The rate has actually fallen over time after those initial divorces happened, and also as people have waited longer to marry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all the comments made so far, but I think we're missing one element:</p>
<p>We want our friends to like us for introducing them to it. We want recognition of being cool / cultured / having good taste - whatever.</p>
<p>My favorite author* on child psychology says that the deepest desire, the deepest motivator, for all people is a need to be seen. We want to be seen as valuable and something special, be accepted for who we really are. Sharing what we like is a form of openness and vulnerability, and that makes us even more focused on getting the right feedback, so we get nervous about whether this movie, or show, or music actually made the mark.</p>
<p>That's why I value it greatly when friends share their interests with me, and I make sure they are seen when they share.</p>
<p>Wow! Thanks for the Gold!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to be guilty of showing things to my friends and expecting a certain reaction out of them, and it took me such a long time to finally realize why it doesn't work. Basically, it just creates a certain 'all-or-nothing' pressure that feels gross both to impose on someone else and for that person to notice is being thrust on them. Even just saying &quot;Hey I did watch this already but I'd love to rewatch it with you!&quot; subtly turns people off since they're worried you're focusing more on their reaction than discovering something together. </p>
<p>It's an understandable mistake to make - I always get a vicarious rush when someone I know discovers for the first time a long-time favorite of mine (that actually pretty much sums up nerd-dom in general). But what I've realized is that you need to either wait for them to discover it on their own, or very casually ease them into it while accepting that despite them being on the same wavelength as you in general, they might end up hating it - and that's totally okay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have that problem where my gf and I will be totally looking forward to a show but if I happen to watch an episode before her she will lose all interest in the entire series no matter what.  It basically has to be her idea and on her own terms and we must watch everything together.  She seemed totally down with the previews of Westworld but the second she found out I watched the first episode on my own she basically blacklisted it for herself.  Hasn't watched the series to this day.  Meanwhile she has no problem powering though a 22 episode season of some other random show in a week and asking me why I haven't given it a chance or why I won't rewatch it with her.  Some people just need to feel like they're the entertainers I think.  </p>
<p>Also as others have said before some of it may come from constantly worrying what your friend is thinking.  The best way to ensure your friend doesn't enjoy what you're showing them is to constantly pause the show/movie and try to get them to validate how kewl it is.  It's very awkward for them and a guaranteed way to ensure they never wanna watch anything you suggest to them again.</p>
<p>Edit: I suppose I'll add that it is indeed a dick move on my part to watch something without her that we planned on watching together.  That being said she will occasionally do the same thing.  Like I suggested she rewatch season one of Master of None so we could start season two.  She admitted to me after two days that she got so hooked she binged watched straight through season two one night while I was asleep.  I just laughed cause it didn't really bother me.  She is a binge watch pro and can burn through shows way faster than I can.  I came clean and admitted I started season five of the Americans without her and she didn't mind.  Sometimes we just aren't on the same wavelength with shows I guess.  We usually understand, but as I said above earlier she has a really difficult time getting into something I've started without her.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's cause when you watch a show, it usually takes a bit for the cast to mesh together and for them to hit a good stride for the humor. So by the time you're usually in the position where you feel this show is so great that you want to share it with people, you usually have watched a bunch of episodes already. </p>
<p>But when you typically show it to your friends, you start on the first episode, which may not be that super amazing as the later episodes are, especially once you know the characters and their idiosyncrasies yet. </p>
<p>Just recently this happened to me with Stranger Things. My roommate raved about it, and wanted me to watch it. I watched the first episode and was meh, but he insisted I watch a few more. I did, and enjoyed them. But he made his recommendation to me by the time he already saw 4 of the episodes, so his perception was a bit different. </p>
<p>Hope that makes sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agree with most of these comments, but some fail (in my opinion) to pinpoint exactly where the &quot;weird, awkward&quot; feeling comes from. I have 2 possible culprits for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Extra knowledge. When watching a series for a second time, you usually notice things that play a part later. Things you didn't notice before. This can make a series more enjoyable to watch again, but also makes you a lot more enthusiastic while watching it with the newly introduced friend. Imagine me pointing at a really small, tiny detail and saying &quot;That is so awesome&quot;, simply because it matters a lot later. kinda makes it weird.</p>
</li>
<li>And this is the big one. When watching a series that you really want someone to like, it's kinda like preparing for a date. You want it to be awesome, you want it to be perfect. Thus you notice the small problems so much more. Due to your own fear of the other person not liking the series, you instinctively notice more bad parts and end up trying to defend it, rather then enjoying the movie. Your friend will likely not even notice these small things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, our brains are kinda weirdly wired when it comes to introducing things to others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Something as large as a galaxy can definitely bend light around itself in such a way that we can see multiple &quot;copies&quot; of whatever is behind it. The light may travel further around one side than it does around the other, so in theory yes we can see the same object as it appeared at two different times. Look up &quot;Einstein Cross&quot; for a great example. As for how large the difference is, I'm not 100% sure, it could vary pretty wildly based on the size and distance of the objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Patients generally don't feel a thing, in fact some even ask us after a treatment if we remembered to turn the machine on.  The consequential damage radiation does is mostly at a genetic level, so it doesn't have a noticeable effect until cells try to use their DNA to divide or make some more proteins, or the cell inspects the DNA and finds damage.</p>
<p>A sufficiently high dose could in principle increase someone's temperature noticeably, but the dose needed for that would be way above the lethal threshold.  A lethal dose only adds as much heat to a body as drinking a <del>cup</del> sip of coffee.</p>
<p>Some patients receiving high-dose therapy to their brains report some sensations during treatment.  Unclear if real or imagined.</p>
<p>In the early days of accelerator-based radiotherapy there were some accidents where a machine accidentally delivered a dose ~100&times; higher and faster than intended, and the patients reported a feeling like an electrical shock.  That may have actually been an electrical shock though, as the electron radiation carries a charge with it.

<p>Interestingly, Louis Slotin reported that he experienced a sour taste in his mouth and a burning sensation after he was exposed to a lethal dose of radiation.   There isn't really a well understood neurological reason for this, and it's kind of hard to confirm since he's one of the few people to receive a lethal dose.  We would need a double-blind study where we irradiate people, with and without their knowledge, to definably answer this question.  That might be a tad unethical though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What caused me to ask this is someone was unable to get off the floor in the reactor because they were so poisoned and Harrison Ford had to go into a highly irradiated area to pick the person up. I was curious as to IRL if he had done that (gone into a reactor with no suit on) if he would have felt anything just going right in there and going back out to  a clean area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Depending on how high the level is based on &quot;high&quot;.  It is possible you would know, but at that point, the radiation is so intense you are as good as dead by the time you realize it. </p>

<p>&quot;After just 30 seconds of exposure, dizziness and fatigue will find you a week later. Two minutes of exposure and your cells will soon begin to hemorrhage; four minutes: vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. 300 seconds and you have two days to live. &quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Everytime they closed their eyes they would see something that looked like fireworks</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>In American English, the verb burgle, meaning to rob, is regarded as a humorous backformation from burglar, and burglarize is the preferred term in serious contexts.</p>
<p>In British English, it’s the other way around. Burgle is a legitimate verb, used even in sober news reports, and burglarize (or burglarise, as it would probably be spelled if it were an accepted word in British English) is virtually nonexistent in serious contexts. Some Britons view burglarize as an American barbarism.</p>
<p>Irish, Australian, New Zealand, and South African writers tend to go along with British writers on this. Canadians prefer burglarize.</p>
<p>Burglar has a long history going back at least to the Medieval Latin burglator and probably beyond. Burgle and burglarize both came about in the late 19th century—neither is significantly older than the other—developing separately on opposite sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Since English had the word <em>Burglary</em>, verbifying it as <em>Burglar+ize</em> was an obvious process. Someone did that, and it caught on.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, someone realised that <em>Burglar</em> sounded like 'burgle+er', and decided to coin [or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-formation" target="_blank">Back-form</a>] a new word 'burgle' to refer to the thing that burglars do. It caught on too, just in different places. </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_24_08_1867#page/n7/mode/1up" target="_blank">The first use I can find of 'burgle'</a> is an 1867 Australian newspaper mentioning that an American newspaper coined the term, so it's likely that <em>both</em> are American inventions. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans everywhere like playing with language, and English in particular tolerates a lot of (near?) synonyms. So you can end up with several words for the same thing. Often these have slightly different meanings, even if it's only that one sounds more formal. Or two different groups of speakers create similar words with the same meaning around the same time.</p>
<p>Burgle~burglarize is similar to other pairs of related words that exist: Orient~orientate, use~utilise, colour~colourise, plus others already mentioned.</p>
<p>My favourite &quot;why did they bother?&quot; is the reanalysis of &quot;pease&quot; as the plural form and the subsequent creation of the new singular form &quot;pea&quot;. It's like people decided to use &quot;rai&quot; in the sense of &quot;It's raise time at work, and I got a rai&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, first of all we don't.  Many sports only honor the top finisher.  Examples are NFL (football), MLB (baseball), and NBA (basketball).  </p>
<p>In other examples, where the top three are honored, there a couple of reasons I can think of.  The nature of some tournaments mean that the not every team or competitor had a chance to go head-to-head against every other entrant.  By recognizing the top three, you are honoring a team/individual who may have lost an early round but is otherwise would have been competitive with the top performer.</p>
<p>Also, there is a tradition in horseracing of betting to win (1st place), place (2nd place) or show (3rd) place.  If you only bet to win, only the favorites would garner any attention from bettors.  By having three slots, it makes the race much more interesting and allows for many different betting scenarios and strategies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried researching this and found no real definitive answers, but I think it's just traditional for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I think is due to wanting to encourage a large pool of competitors. For example county fairs have traditionally given out grand prize, first runner up, and second runner up, for each category with each one getting a smaller slice of a prize pool or a lesser value item. One prize might encourage only high level competitors, but lesser prizes might encourage lesser talented ones. Same reason many competitions will have performance tiers so more people will compete.</p>
<p>Another might be because many sports actually keep track of standings from competition to competition so the governing body notes competitors standings for that reason. In fact the olympics which I think you're really asking about awards the top 8 competitors. It's just that the top three (again like fairs) are honored in a medal ceremony, the other 5 get an official Olympic diploma with their standing, and all competitors get a participation medal and diploma.</p>
<p>When you consider that the very act of reaching that high a level requires a lot of dedication again it really attracts more competitors if you try to honor and celebrate as many competitor's accomplishments as you can. While the Olympics definitely have an element of national pride to them, the main aim is to promote friendship and good sportsmanship between countries.</p>
<p>You'll find that the three or more levels is much more common in amature compations as well. Most likely to again promote good sportsmanship and celebrate everyone's accomplishments. At the professional level it's much less common, with a winner take all approach being more the norm. Most likely due to how it fuels team rivalries and fan feuds, encouraging more paying fans to attend games, which after all is the real aim of all pro level sports.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Sympathetic -
Relaxes the bronchi (your throats relaxes helping you breathe)
Enzymes in the stomach are stopped (your body pauses your stomach to focus on more important stuff)
Stimulated glucose and adrenaline flood your system </p>
<p>Then comes the stomach drop part.. which happens due to your sympathetic nerve system-</p>
<p>Peristalsis is a symmetrical contraction and relaxation of muscles that propagates in a wave down a tube</p>
<p>In much of a digestive tract, smooth muscle tissue contracts in sequence to produce a peristaltic wave, which propels a ball of food  along the tract. </p>
<p>Peristaltic movement comprises relaxation of circular smooth muscles, then their contraction behind the chewed material to keep it from moving backward, then longitudinal contraction to push it forward.</p>
<p>Your body has turned off the contraction and due to the attention being elsewhere your stomach simply relaxes. Hence it feels like it &quot;drops&quot;</p>
<p>Tldr: stomach usually acts in waves -triggered- stomach only relaxes and doesn't contract again.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nearly every salt water ecosystem would die off. In the resulting food shortage and mass emigration from communities that relied on fish the original fresh water ecosystems would likely also be in danger due to fishing demands shifting to whats left. The sudden decrease in the amoubt of salt in the world would mean a lot of the minerals and salts in the soil near/under water would dissolve, which would likely damage coastal ecosystems by depriving them of nutrients. All the animals on land that relied on salt water resources such as fish would starve (i.e. pelicans) and that would move up the food chain as everything loses several food sources. With all the oceans dead, the coasts dead, and everything involved with the coasts starving to death it is likely that humanity would face a second wave of famine and emigration. The newly emptied coasts would erode much faster than before. Assuming that all of the fresh water added is the same several bodies of water that had not previously mixed would suddenly mix (think of those photos of the borders of oceans, where there is a clear divison in the water^^^I was wrong about this). This would change the flow of some currents and alter the weather patterns of the world. With new weather patterns several crop yields would be altered and a third wave of food shortages would happen during emigrations from the brand new deserts.  </p>
<p>Tldr: Ocean dies, things that need oceans die, weather breaks, its the apocalypse.  </p>

<p>So when you start moving, inertia keeps the gas stationary until friction with the sides of the moving walls causes the gas to start moving along with the tire. Eventually it all comes up to the same rotational speed. When you start stopping, the gas keeps moving until friction with the slowing tire walls cause the gas to slow as well. Once stopped the gas continues to move until friction brings it all stationary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Been a while but something along the lines of this...</p>
<p>Different molecules absorb certain wavelengths of light. In a lab we can kinda shine light though some molecules and then when viewing that light's spectrum, see which wavelengths are missing (absorbed by the molecules). So in a lab we can make a sort of spectral map for any type of molecule. &quot;When light shines though <em>these</em> molecules the remaining spectrum looks like this, and when we shine light though <em>those</em> molecules the remaining spectrum looks like that.</p>
<p>Now we just need to look at the remaining spectrum from the light of stars and see what wavelengths are missing and match it up to our lab made maps. &quot;The light from that star is passing though such and such type of molecules.&quot;</p>
<p>The cool thing is that there are many different types of molecules in a star, so we will see many many missing wavelengths, but we can match them up to maps we have and figure out all the types of molecules present in the star.</p>
<p><a href="http://sites.oglethorpe.edu/mrulison/files/2016/07/spectrum_binary-1698rt5.gif" target="_blank">Here is sort of an example</a> of two different spectral emission maps combined. The black lines are the wavelengths that have been absorbed by molecules. The top one is apparently from a star rich in hydrogen, and the middle is from a star with lots of heavier metals. The bottom is actually the light from the two stars (a binary system), but it's kind of the same type of spectral map you would see from one star with two different types of molecules blocking wavelengths.</p>
<p>EDIT: I just noticed that you specifically asked about planets, not stars. I've never looked into it, so take this with a grain of salt, but I can only imagine that it has to do with taking the spectral map of the star without the exoplanet in the way, and taking the spectral map of the star <em>with</em> the exoplanet in the way, and then somehow comparing the two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astrophysicist chiming in here. There are essentially 3 things we can measure on exoplanets: radius, mass, and atmospheric content. I answered a similar question about the first two <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6box89/astronomers_discover_a_puffy_planet_with_the/dhowlgf/" target="_blank">here</a>. For HAT-P-26b, there are a few things I would like to address in terms of what the predicted atmospheric content is.</p>
<p>First off, the water detection. When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, the light from the star will also go through the atmosphere of that exoplanet (assuming it has one). When light interacts with with the gas in the atmosphere it can be absorbed and scattered. This means that if we look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-spectrum_light" target="_blank">spectrum</a> of light, which is just the intensity split out into wavelength, then we can tell that certain parts of the spectra look different before and during the transit. In the case of HAT-P-26b, there was a clear <a href="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/356/6338/628/F1.medium.gif" target="_blank">drop in the light intensity</a> that corresponds to water. Taking this spectra, you can do some computer modelling of the atmosphere and get some information about the content of said atmosphere. This is essentially how exoplanet spectroscopy works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;found fewer heavy elements than they had expected&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is where the interpretation gets a little less straightforward. In astronomy, we like to use the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity" target="_blank">metallicity</a> which is essentially how much stuff is there other than Hydrogen and Helium in an astrophysical object (it doesn't have to be a metal). For HAT-P-26b, the scientists used the water content as a predictor of the total metallicity of the planet, and then compared that to the planets in our own Solar System, in particular Neptune and Uranus. They found that the metallicity was a lot lower than our Solar System. This is a fine approximation, but water isn't the normal &quot;species&quot; that we use to determine the metallcity in Neptune and Uranus. Methane is considered to be a more accurate tracer of metallicity. Further still, you have to consider the metallicity of the star that these planets orbit. HAT-P-26b's hosts star is considered &quot;metal poor&quot; by some estimates, meaning that you would expect any planets to also be metal poor.</p>
<p>So while the water detection is certainly a very interesting discovery, I don't necessarily agree with some of the interpretation. If anybody would like to read the full paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04354" target="_blank">here</a> is a free link to it.</p>
<p>Edit: I would also like to direct people to /u/Astromike23 and his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ca2j8/in_as_simple_a_way_as_possible_how_are_we_able_to/dhtat9j/" target="_blank">really great response</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've got a story for you :-)</p>
<p>They can't using &quot;only a telescope&quot;.  They also need some sort of spectrograph.  </p>
<p>So our eyeballs only see three colors (one might argue 4 if you included rods, but whatever).  But light can have infinite different wavelengths.</p>
<p>When you shine light through a prism or diffraction grating, light is bent a different amount based on its wavelength.  Here's a silly picture of a lamp viewed through a diffraction grating I found in a little kids science book:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eNBO0CC.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/eNBO0CC.jpg</a></p>
<p>So the rainbow produced by the prism/diffraction grating, you have the different wavelengths separated by <em>distance</em>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/WDHlMfh.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/WDHlMfh.jpg</a></p>
<p>Now this is a kids diffraction grating and a regular old camera, but it's the same basic idea as what fancy scientific equipment does.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of the spectrum emitted by that lamp (which has a compact flourescent bulb in it)</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TCe6K2Z.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/TCe6K2Z.jpg</a></p>
<p>See some spots are brighter than others.  I looked up the spectrum of CFL bulbs online and found this graph, and overlaid the graph over the spectrum I produced </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IXZJzLU.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/IXZJzLU.jpg</a></p>
<p>Lines up pretty well, eh? :-D</p>
<p>Those spikes are associated with certain elements.  For instance, that bright blue spike on the left is emitted by mercury.  The bright green spike is terbium and mercury.  The bright red one is europium.  And so on.  The spectra of different elements and molecules has been categorized, so by looking at where the spikes are, we can tell what something is just by looking at the spikes.</p>
<p>So for stuff that doesn't glow, we can heat it until it glows, shine the light through a diffraction grating, and voila!</p>
<p>For things where that's not possible, we can do the inverse...  Shine full spectrum light on them (e.g. from a sun) and they will <em>absorb</em> at specific spots in the spectrum.  That's information is all categoried nicely for scientists too :-)</p>
<p>I wrote some software to process the images off the camera, and produced a similar graph to the one I found online using just the data from the pixels in my image.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/a3G0VpC.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/a3G0VpC.jpg</a></p>
<p>The red, green, and blue are because consumer digital cameras have a bayer filter over the sensors, so i'm not getting raw data, just data through red, green, or blue filters.  </p>
<p>And that's the story how I made a spectrometer with a digital camera and a kid's science book.  The scientists are doing the exact same thing, except with something <em>much</em> dimmer than a light bulb a couple feet from me and with <em>much</em> fancier, more expensive equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the answers here are saying, &quot;just take the spectrum of the planet.&quot; While that's the basic theoretical way to do it, in practice it's a lot tougher than just taking the planet's light and passing it through a prism, since that signal is almost always too weak for exoplanets.</p>
<p>Remember, the only way we can even detect that HAT-P-26b exists is because it passes directly in front of its parent star from our point of view - it's basically a very tiny eclipse. When we observe the star from Earth, the star's brightness drops by about 0.5% when the planet passes in front of it. If the planet were bigger, it would block more light during the eclipse; if the planet were smaller, it would block less light during the eclipse.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that water vapor is very good at absorbing light with certain colors. Specifically, water vapor will absorb infrared light with a wavelength around 1.4 microns (different wavelengths are just different colors), while letting most infrared light at other wavelengths pass through.</p>
<p>So, let's say there's lots of water vapor in HAT-P-26b's upper atmosphere. When we observe the eclipse, the amount of light from the star that's blocked out by the planet will depend on the wavelength of that light. Water vapor will absorb any 1.4-micron infrared light that passes through the upper atmosphere, but will let through infrared light of other wavelengths. The result is that the eclipse in 1.4 micron light will be deeper (more total light blocked) than in other wavelengths.</p>
<p>What we end up doing, then, is observing these eclipses in a lot of different wavelengths by placing different filters on the telescope that allows each wavelength to pass through. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hYyQtgS.png" target="_blank">This graph</a> is from the original paper, showing all the different wavelengths the eclipse was observed in. The dip in the middle of each line there is how much light gets blocked for each wavelength during each eclipse.</p>
<p>When you then compare how deep the eclipse was for each wavelength, you end up with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j9UoP3L.png" target="_blank">this graph</a>, also from the original paper. The black dots are what's important here (the colored lines are all just different models). The black dots around 1.4 microns are a lot higher than the rest, telling us that a lot more light near those wavelengths are blocked out during the eclipses, and so we can conclude that there must be a good deal of water vapor in the upper atmosphere blocking out that light.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: We observe eclipses when the planet passes in front of the star in many different colors. Water vapor blocks out certain colors better than others, and we see deeper eclipses in those colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
