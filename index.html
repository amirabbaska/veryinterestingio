		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have some VERY strong opinions about this topic...</p>
<p>My kids have always eaten whatever we give them. It was never an option for them to be fussy or picky. We have never forced them to eat anything, ever, and if they didn't want to eat something we served, that was and is okay. However, they didn't get something else instead. </p>
<p>When parents give kids a new food and say 'Here, <em>try</em> this', the child gets the message that they might not like it or want to eat it. When parents say 'Just take a bite', the child gets the message that it is an option for them to reject the food. Even the expression on mom or dad's face, looking anxious or even hopeful, tells the kid that this food might be weird. </p>
<p>When our kids (now 12 and 13) were babies, we fed them a wide variety of foods and they only outright rejected a couple of things. We would not make any issue over it at all, but just put that food aside for a week or a month, and would then try again. Some things still got rejected, so we did the same thing - don't offer it again for a while, and try it again later, always trying to make mealtime as pleasant and calm as possible. When they were old enough to feed themselves, we filled their and our plates with the same food (in age-appropriate amounts), sat down, began eating, and they would as well. Eventually they ate whatever they were given, and still do for the most part. </p>
<p>Everyone has preferences and dislikes, and that's okay. But the thing I noticed is that there are cultures that eat things that other cultures might find weird or even gross. Chinese breakfasts often consist of a bit of fish, some vegetables, and other savory things which American kids would find unpalatable, in favor of sugary cereal or pancakes. Latin and Asian cuisines can be quite spicy and kids in those cultures seem to relish those flavors, where perhaps Scandinavian or British folks, for example, might be amazed at that level of heat. So it seemed to me like it's a matter of what is presented as 'normal' by the parents.</p>
<p>I also think the kind of snacks kids eat between meals will greatly affect what they are interested in eating at mealtime. Calorie dense, high fat or high sugar things, and mini-meals have not been available between meals for our kids. I love to cook and work hard on balanced, nutritious meals, so I want to make sure everyone is hungry when it's time to eat. So snacks at our house have always been things like fresh fruit, veggies, yogurt, a few whole-grain crackers, a handful of nuts, and stuff like that. My feeling is that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the main part of a meal, not a snack. They can have all they want of the snacky things, (because no kid should be made to go truly hungry), but they can't mindlessly eat chips at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, because then of course they aren't going to want much at dinner. </p>
<p>Of course this is all just my humble opinion. I don't judge the parents of the kids who bring a bag of Doritos and a Coke to school for breakfast because parenting is ridiculously hard. If your kid is fed and dressed and still alive every day, God bless you because you're doing alright in my book. But I've struggled with weight and eating all my life, and I <em>really</em> want to give my kids every chance to possibly not have that struggle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody else is pointing out the biological reasons, the reasons that keep kids from eating nasty alkaloid 'berries' or other things that might harm them. This is critical, without this behavior many - most? - kids would have poisoned themselves at some point. Avoiding bitter foods is a very good survival trait for young kids.</p>
<p>But there are additional reasons. After you give them something they <em>do</em> like, they are going to want that every time... if they want icecream but got peas, they won't eat the peas <em>even if they love eating peas</em>. Below a certain age they generally can't communicate that other than by refusing to eat or by pushing the food away from them, so the message parents take away is &quot;she is a fussy eater, she doesn't like peas&quot;. When it happens again with another food, they aren't surprised because they already know that the kid is a &quot;fussy&quot; eater.</p>
<p>Which means there are cultural facets, too. In many cultures you eat what you are given, even as a toddler. Different expectations, different behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People tend to like what is familiar. This is just as true for art as it is for food. The people who hated van Gogh's paintings in 1885 weren't uncultured, they just found his work unfamiliar. Children aren't fussy eaters, they are just drawn to familiar tastes. They start with milk and formula and work out from there. Commercial baby foods are also pretty bland and very soft. If children are going to eat a more varied diet, there are two keys to pulling it off: 1) start them young. As soon as they eat solid food have them try everything. 2) Don't force them. If they really hate asparagus, getting angry and forcing them to eat 7 stalks will reinforce it. Instead, have them eat 3 bites... enough so they remember the taste next time (remember, familiar is good), but not so much that the memory is a bad one. By the 3rd or 4th time they try it, they may find they like it. </p>
<p>This has worked amazingly well for our children. They'll eat everything except even mildly spicy foods and eggplant. Heavily garliced foods, brussels sprouts, broccoli, okra, lamb, etc... no problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1 Kids have very little power and will use  what power they are given in strange ways.  Often after a long day, parent(s) and kids are tired it was just easier to not fight and make a second dinner (do not do this it is a trap!).  They will notice this pattern and exploit it as it a small level of control.</p>
<p>2 If you kid(s) doesn't want to eat what I made the can sit quiet until we are done or if not quiet the in time out. When they tell me they are hungry just before bed I pull out the plate they turned down earlier for them to eat.</p>
<p>3 exposure give them lot of types of foods to eat when going out. But let them pick between two <strong>new</strong> items.  They get the power of choice and have to try new things.</p>
<p>4 let them help you cook, they will be more likely to eat if they helped make it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>massage machines, when somebody roughens up our hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically considering these as 'touch sensations', there are two aspects, the psychological aspect and the physiological aspect.</p>
<p>Psychological factor is that being touched or touching someone else are important modes of human interaction next to language.  Studies show that the hormone oxytocin has a role in this, which is the hormone of love and attachment.  That's why we feel good when we get a handshake, hug or a shoulder massage to a congratulatory pat on the back.  Secondly, the physiological aspect, the stimulation, increased blood flow, etc.  When we get a massage, our brain receives the sensation because our skin cells send the nerve signal from skin to brain and then our body released endorphins which act like natural pain killers.  Then the body tend to be more relaxed as the stress level is reduced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When talking about percentage change, you've got to provide context, and should avoid introducing a percentage that they're off.</p>

<p>Long story short specifically for telomeres, the answer is &quot;not really&quot;. Different cells divide at different speeds. Also, many cells do not divide any further at all. If someone got even a minor injury or a mildly traumatic event or some weird habits, that would affect cell division as well. And then there are the individual differences in telomere lengths. Given all these, it will be virtually impossible to predict the &quot;endpoint&quot; of cell division in the real-time scale, let alone predicting one for an individual based on a few cells.</p>
<p>Also, generally telomere length is not the limiting factor for humans. There's some evidence that it can be a contributing one, but it is not really a major factor (the correlation was not practically significant and causation is somewhat dubious). There are many other ways a person can die &quot;of old age&quot; depending on the definition, including cancer, neurological disorders (Alzheimer's etc.), osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, weak immune system etc. etc., all of which are very much age-related. There are even sayings that most people don't have Huntington's Disease because we die before we reach the age of developing one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short response because I'm on mobile.</p>
<p>I believe more evidence is emerging (especially in the field of stem cells and iPSCs) that telomere length is a dynamic process. Cells contain proteins that can trim long telomeres (telomerase), protect short ones (TZAP and the shelterin complex), and lengthen critically short telomeres (thought to also be the telomerase). The whole thought that aging was directly attributed to telomere length was appealing. Although I think it is naive to assume a cell doesn't have a way to lengthen telomeres and just dies. Long telomeres are actually trimmed to a shorter length because it's considered a cancer risk. While I don't have telomere elongation articles right in front of me and some of the resources I'm finding suggest telomeres don't lengthen in somatic cells, the paper below does discuss the dynamic process. I'm starting to believe telomere length is a lot more dynamic than the previous notion that we lose some base pairs every replication cycle and then the cell dies.</p>
<p>Li JS, et al. TZAP: A telomere-associated protein involved in telomere length control. (2017) Science. 10.1126/science.aah6752</p>
<p>Edit: and I'll just quote this article to address your original question because there is a correlation. &quot;In addition, we find that telomere length inversely correlates with lifespan, while telomerase expression correlates with mass. The
role of replicative aging as a tumor suppression mechanism is well accepted; however, its contribution to lifespan remains controversial.&quot;

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you under the impression that when the last telomere falls off a person just falls over dead?</p>
<p>People don't die of &quot;old age.&quot; They die of one of many causes that become common as they age. The terminology &quot;dying of old age&quot; means one or several of these things occurred and it doesn't really matter which one. Often this is a major stroke or heart failure caused by a dysrhythmia, or even a progressive illness like a respiratory problem or cancer finally causing one of the conditions necessary to life to not be met for long enough to kill the person.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if ill function of cells thanks to not having been replaced or regenerated was a major killer, you could (and do) have that with plenty of telomeres left. The telomeres alone are not a good predictor of general health or longevity in human or in any animal as complex as humans. Death has many, many contributing factors, many possible causations, and predicting when someone is likely to die therefore necessities a complex predictive approach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Corruption generally comprises illegal activities, which are deliberately hidden and only come to light through scandals, investigations or prosecutions. There is no meaningful way to assess absolute levels of corruption in countries or territories on the basis of hard empirical data. Possible attempts to do so, such as by comparing bribes reported, the number of prosecutions brought or studying court cases directly linked to corruption, cannot be taken as definitive indicators of corruption levels. Instead, they show how effective prosecutors, the courts or the media are in investigating and exposing corruption. Capturing perceptions of corruption of those in a position to offer assessments of public sector corruption is the most reliable method of comparing relative corruption levels across countries.</p>

<p>People like to say stuff about specific nutrients and your body knows and etc but there's literally zero worthwhile proof or evidence of it.</p>
<p>Cravings in pregnancy tend to take two forms. One form is generally for &quot;high energy&quot; foods. Calling this a craving however is a bit much, it's not really a craving, they're just hungry and high energy foods make people feel good.  This can be a bit unusual for folks, since growing a tiny human requires more resources from someone's body than normal.</p>
<p>There's also something to be said here for that food just plain tasting good. food is tied to emotional responses for people (and pregnancy hormones fuck with that like nothing else), and tastebuds change during pregnancy. If someone wants chocolate or pickles or whatever it probably has more to do with those things being tasty than &quot;your body magically knows it's short on magnesium!&quot; or whatever. </p>
<p>The other sort of craving is pica. It's not exactly particular to pregnant women, however pica isn't really all that well understood. however there's a reason it's classified as a mental disorder, not a nutrient deficiency and why treatment doesn't consist of &quot;here take this multivitamin&quot; . Brain chemistry and etc is fucky enough under normal conditions, let alone during pregnancy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two thoughts on why it happens, both are probably somewhat correct. One is that hormone production changes during pregnancy and that stimulates the desire for certain things. For example, as a woman's insulin levels drop or rise their body wants certain things that will adjust those levels. Some women report that they experience changes in tastes or desire for food in relation to menstruation, another time that hormones fluctuate.</p>
<p>The second reason is that pregnancy is very physically demanding and it's necessary to increase both blood volume and nutrients. The brain is a very greedy organ and initiates cravings to not only supply the body and baby with nutrition, but to meet its own needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example, you absorb up to 6X more nutrients from your food. You also have changes in hormone levels and energy requirements, and overall you desire more food. It is unlikely you are lacking a specific vitamin, mineral or amino acid, but this is the most common interpretation: 'the body' needs something it doesn't have. For the majority of cases the most likely explanation is that it is an evolutionary trait that no longer serves its original purpose, like waking up during the night to tend the fire (now we just wake up and pee and/or go back to sleep). Your body 'wants' energy and you desire food, but the type of food you choose might be something weird (eg pickles); it's not really the type of question biologists can decipher easily, but it's quite interesting if it's happening to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Bottom line: it's a discriminator for applicants.</p>
<p>Like someone else said, they put you in a room, ask you questions, and get you to either confess (lie about what you previously filled out, which will drop you from the hiring process) or give them an excuse not to hire you, if you stick to your story.</p>
<p>Example: you pass all the preliminary screening, the PT test, the interview, etc. now comes the poly. There's just something about you they don't like, but they can't find a tangible excuse to not hire you. So they give you the poly and then say your results came back &quot;inconclusive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look, we're not saying you lied, just the results were, 'inconclusive'.&quot;</p>
<p>This is typical at smaller depts with maybe only one opening and 15 applicants.  They may think you look too young, or too old, or too white, or too female, but they can't <em>not</em> hire you for that. The poly gives the dept an out.</p>
<p>Obligatory &quot;this blew up&quot; edit:</p>
<p>I'll try to get to everyone. I believe if you took the time to respond to me, I can take the time to respond to you. I'll do my best.</p>
<p>Just some quick answers:</p>
<p>LEO = law enforcement officer</p>
<p>Why do depts even do this and not just be &quot;straight shooters&quot; to applicants? .... I dunno, small town police depts are seeping in small town politics and probably don't want the drama. Or are saving money by avoiding a law suit... for another law suit. </p>
<p>&quot;Too white&quot; ... congratulations to the 50% of you who got the joke.</p>
<p>My experience is in Small Town, USA. A few commenters are letting me know they're outside the US. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I made it through the LAPD hiring process, but didn't accept the offer. The lie detector was a big part of it. They use it to get you to admit things you wouldn't admit. </p>
<p>&quot;You said you didn't do the thing.&quot;

They aren't lie detectors at all, they measure acute changes in your &quot;anxiety&quot; levels.  These can easily be faked during true statements, and you can meditate or relax on false statements and it will throw the devices off.   </p>
<p>Bottom line, they are bullshit, but most people don't realize this and even if they do they aren't trained enough to evoke the same reactions (some of which are part of the autonomous nervous system, which isn't directly controllable consciously or at least with out practice) by will.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work Internal Affairs and part of that deals with hiring public safety applicants.  My department won't disqualify anyone for failing the polygraph alone. </p>
<p>Generally speaking I think being told you're getting a polygraph tends to make people get a little more honest with their answers during my interview.  I don't do the polygraph myself,  that's all handled via independent contractors that have no motivation to my knowledge to even attempt to fail a person without cause. </p>
<p>My department is very understanding that people have a past, have chosen to experiment with drugs and occasionally have even been arrested and still get jobs. The key is being honest. If you're lying now,  odds are you will be lying later. </p>
<p>That lying thing continues to be a major thing during your employment.  Speaking from my experience, nothing makes internal affairs investigators more motivated to nail an employee to the wall than lying or being corrupt in general. I take it very personal when someone brings discredit to themselves and to the department I've chosen to represent. </p>
<p>Just my two cents on the matter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>The internship is similar to training/education which would be given in an educational environment.</li>
<li>The experience is for the benefit of the intern.</li>
<li>The intern does not displace regular employees but works under close supervision of existing staff.</li>
<li>The employer providing the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.</li>
<li>There is no guarantee of a job at the conclusion of the internship.</li>
<li>Both parties understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the internship.</li>

They have zero enforcement power., and really just serve as a prebuilt mechanism for large countries to try to get sanctions passed every now and then, if they want to. Also if violating it were really that much of an issue, a country could just pull out of the treaty. The place to stop this is at the national level, with laws that forbid it, and a Government that is interested in enforcing those laws.

<p>Additionally while there are laws regarding wages, and laws regarding slavery there is nothing that bans you from volunteer work. That is what unpaid internships are classified as. You are a volunteer, not a forced worker and as such are not by default entitled to any kind of pay. You also agree to this by taking the volunteer position. </p>
<p>That said, some States have heavily restricted what qualifies as an unpaid internship or outright banned them. But the specifics vary by State. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
