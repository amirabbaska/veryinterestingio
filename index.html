<p>Thanks for all the answers so far but this user has my question right:</p>
<p>/u/cleverlikeme </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the OP is actually asking about 'background' conversations that aren't distinguishable audibly but still get clear subtitles.
In other words, in some movies, you can read some dialogue that is actually impossible to hear because it's mumbled, trailing off, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/u/Aomidoro</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would be very curious to hear from somebody who actually has industry experience with this, because as described by the OP it does seem like sometimes the closed captioning must be produced from the actual script because it contains dialog that is not actually discernible.
Closed captions produced in realtime for live tv inevitable have mistakes (I believe they are produced on some sort of phonetic chord-based keyboard?), but actually even closed captions for tv shows that aren't live sometimes have large numbers of errors. I noticed this before on either amazon video or netflix: the closed captions had situations where clearly the person making them didn't understand the word being used (especially for technical terms), so obviously in this case they weren't working from the script.
Therefore it seems like there are different ways these captions get made? My guess is that there are essentially two different processes depending on whether a show is captioned by a separate company or whether the captions are from subtitles produced by the actual makers of the show (or perhaps it's simply an issue of whether the creators of the show bother to provide the script or not?), but I'm curious if anyone knows whether this is actually the case?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took a class on subtitling in college and it's really important to realize that subtitles, be them for deaf/hard-of-hearing or from on language to another, are a form of poetry. When you bring in time into the situation of reading all kinds of rules pop up. How many characters you can use is a big one, so you might rather use the word &quot;gross&quot; over &quot;disgusting&quot; for the sake of a shorter subtitle that can actually be read in time. You might correct someone's stutter or mis-speak, unless of course it is critical to the film. </p>
<p>The main goal of subtitles is to make the film watchable for someone who can not hear or for someone who does not speak the language the film is in. This means you will make sacrifices, jokes will be lost, information in general will be lost, cultural references, and word play are very common examples.</p>
<p>In response to the initial question, the subtitler  should use their best judge of whether what needs to be subtitled and what doesn't. Does a visual explosion need &quot;<Explosion Sound>&quot; no it does not, but say an explosion is happening and it is silent! Now the subtitle &quot;<Silence>&quot; would be super helpful to the viewer.</p>
<p>One last factor, is depending on the movie you saw it could have been subtitled with computers which do a terrible job. The best subtitles are still done by humans who can use their best judgement as to what should be included.</p>
<p>EDIT: As others brought up it's important to not confuse closed captioning and subtitling. Watch a Criterion DVD if you want to see A+ human done subtitles, watch Netflix or the live news if you want to see a computer type out what it &quot;hears&quot;. To properly answer the original question I'd need to actually see what the OP saw. I have subtitled films before, one a documentary and some 1920s short films french-&gt; english. I had the script to neither, and of course the documentary didn't have one. Having script would help discern what someone is saying, but it does not always take into account things subtitles do (nor does it take into account tone or the way a word is said which is very important). This includes when the camera cuts, when it's a voice over dub, music, etc. A subtitle is only up right when the person starts talking, and down as soon as they are finished. If they're talking fast, better come up with something that sums it all up. If they're talking and mid-sentence it cuts, you do a new subtitle, this one being in italics (because the character speaking is not on screen). There's a language to subtitling you may understand without even realizing it. Download a freeware subtitling program, you subtitle frame by frame you the precision with nicer programs is amazing. First you go through the movie marking where subtitle will be then you go back and type in what each subtitle is. As you go you keep notes that you refered to or spelled things the same way the whole time. So if you refer to an &quot;automobile&quot; as a &quot;car&quot; in the subtitles to save space you better keep using the word &quot;car&quot; throughout the whole movie as not to become confusing. This goes double for slang you translate or type out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are confusing closed captioning with subtitles. Subtitles only mean the lines of text on the movies for reading, and when used alone, generally only for spoken sentences. Closed captioning includes all noise related things essential to watching the movie, including explosions sounds and whatnot. </p>
<p>Now to answer OPs questions, subtitles most often have official subtitles, and other unofficial ones may be just ported from these, perhaps translated or copied from released movie script. You're probably thinking of srt files that come with video downloads, but remember, movie theatres also have access to subtitles that they can display. One instance I can think of was Thor dark world, where the dark elves talk. It's in a completely made up language so no one should know what it's talking about, but official subtitles show that they actually are saying something, and when I watched it in the theatres it was displayed. I only realized it wasn't embedded to the movie when I tried watching it a week ago without subtitles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some users, like u/Jake0024, make the correct argument from thermodynamics that heat travels from hot to cold. What is unsatisfying about this argument is that it goes against our intuition about how lenses work. After all, can't we just focus an image of the moon down to an arbitrarily small size? And the smaller we make it, the more concentrated the light gets and the hotter it can heat something up. </p>
<p>The problem with this intuitive argument is that the simple lens equation we were taught in high school or college is a lie. Or rather, it is an approximation for small angles. For a lens that takes an object at position o and focuses it to an image at position i, the magnification is supposed to be M=i/o. So just get a shorter focal length and i will get arbitrarily small, right?</p>
<p>But this approximation for the magnification comes from the conservation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue" target="_blank">etendue</a>. Here is a simplified version of how it works: If the lens has a radius r, then we can define an angle theta_o=arcsin(r/o) and an angle theta_i=arcsin(r/i) on each side of the lens. The conservation of etendue tells us the magnification will be:</p>
<p>M=theta_o/theta_i</p>
<p>In the small angle approximation arcsin(x)=x, so this reduces to the formula we learned in school. But when you try to really focus the image down to a small spot, you won't be able to use the small angle approximation on the image side - the image sits very close to the lens now. And theta_i can't get any bigger than π/2. So we get:</p>
<p>M=2*theta_o/π</p>
<p>Since the moon is far from the lens, we can justify a small angle approximation there and write:</p>
<p>M=2*r/(π*o)</p>
<p>So the magnification is actually proportional to the diameter of the lens (2*r) in this limit of a highly focused beam. Aha, so we can still focus the moon down to an arbitrarily small spot! Unfortunately, the total light collected by the lens is proportional to its diameter squared. So a tightly focused image of the moon has the same intensity per square meter, whether it is created by a giant lens or a tiny one. It turns out this limit is equal to the intensity per square meter at the surface of the moon. Therefore, the moon can't heat things up any hotter than they would get sitting on the surface of the moon.</p>
<p><strong>tldr:</strong> If you move past the small angle approximation you learned in school, you find there is a limit to how small you make your image of the moon. This prevents you from using moonlight/sunlight/etc for reaching arbitrarily high temperatures with passive optics.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> A single mode laser behaves as if the light is coming from a point source, so you can focus laser light down to very small spots and heat things up to arbitrarily high temperatures. This doesn't violate thermodynamics either, because lasers effectively have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature" target="_blank">negative temperature</a> that can transfer heat to any positive temperature system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing that's confusing is moonlight is really reflected sunlight (albedo). The temperature of the moon itself is based on the material (regolith) absorbing sunlight and then emitting it to space. Temperature only matters in this case if you're trying to focus the moon's IR light which relates to temperature via wein's displacement law. However you're really focusing the reflected sunlight and the moon IR light (which is very small).</p>
<p>With that being said it is theoretically possible to focus light to get hotter than the reflected surface it comes from if most of the light is reflected. I think the moon only reflects about 10% of the light so it may still not be possible.</p>
<p>For a source of light, you cannot use a lens to make the focused point hotter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Let's think photons. The sun emits a certain number of photons. At the surface of the moon there is a certain number of photons per area. Let's say for argument that the moons surface is Lambertian. Let's say it absorbs 99% and reflects 1%. </p>
<p>The question is simply whether or not 1% of the photons incident on the moon, reflected by its assumed Lambertian surface and collected by a hypothetical giant achromatic lens, would carry sufficient energy to heat a material enough for it to burn.

<p>Today, most mammals possess dichromatic vision, corresponding to protanopia red–green color blindness. They can thus see violet, blue, green and yellow light, but cannot see ultraviolet, and deep red light.[4][5] This was probably a feature of the first mammalian ancestors, which were likely small, nocturnal, and burrowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primates have re-developed trichromatic color vision since that time, by the mechanism of gene duplication, being under unusually high evolutionary pressure to develop color vision better than the mammalian standard. Ability to perceive red[7] and orange hues allows tree-dwelling primates to discern them from green. This is particularly important for primates in the detection of red and orange fruit, as well as nutrient-rich new foliage, in which the red and orange carotenoids have not yet been masked by chlorophyll.</p>

<p>Being able to see <em>red</em> made ripe fruits stand out visibly from unripened fruit, and from the green background foliage. I'm sure this influences our ability to appreciate flowers and their vivid contrast to <em>green.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our sense of smell and our sense of taste are very connected. </p>
<p>When food has spoiled, the aromas given off by bacterial or other activity are apparent to us... isovaleric acid with rancid milk, butyric acid which smells like vomit or bile, aromatic indoles that smell like poop or manure, or the vinegar of acetic acid. We have built in aversion to these smells due to evolutionary pressures and the back of our head &quot;knowing&quot; these are linked with nasty biological processes such as spoiled food or rotten meat. </p>
<p>When a fruit, or an orange, smells sweet and tasty, we're smelling the oils of the plan and other aromas. Many flowers that you might not think of as edible, actually are (even dandelion weeds can and are made into a tea, and lavender has culinary uses for instance). Fruits, too, are often &quot;flowers&quot;, pear trees have flowers and many fruits are &quot;flowering fruits&quot;. So there are evolutionary reasons for a human to smell the flower and be sure they aren't smelling something weird like acetic acid (meaning that maybe some berries have gotten gross and fermented). Cooking flowers in the west isn't done so much these days, but before artificial flavors and other ways of cooking, it was a lot more prevalent, but you still see this in people making herbal teas for example; the chemicals given off are pleasant, sometimes linked to chemical signals that mean &quot;food&quot; and other complex flavors (bitter, after all, is a flavor too). </p>
<p>Someone in the comments mentioned corpse flowers and how their rotting smell attracts insects like flies, etc.; this is of course the opposite extreme where the flower is releasing isovaleric acid and other compounds into the air; flies which WANT to find and smell rotting corpses think &quot;Oh hell yes, some corpses over there&quot; and have an evolutionary impulse to go over there.</p>

<p>Umm, hello? Rosewater in cooking anyone? Turkish delight? Roses have TONS of culinary uses, and it's linked to the aromatic compounds they release that, like many of the plants that we cultivate for straightforward culinary purposes, both activate our sense of smell and taste (and most importantly, do not activate any instinctive aversion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi- I am a master florist and I teach floral design in a formal curriculum. </p>
<p>Flowers and greenery were initially introduced as a ceremonial reward. A crown of greenery, for instance was given to an athlete for completing a monumental task which reflected his prowess. </p>
<p>Floral crowns were bestowed on maidens to accentuate and highlight their youth during courting ceremonies. </p>
<p>Bouquets were carried by brides to mask any unpleasant smells when hygiene was not important, and also to give the bride something to hold on to. Some have noted that this may represent a phallic meaning, but it was probably just to keep her from calm and to keep her hands still. </p>
<p>Funeral flowers also masked any smells and also deflected from staring at a corpse, i.e. Lighten the mood. </p>
<p>Large arrangements were displayed to indicate wealth. </p>
<p>The Victorian era introduced giving flowers as a gift as the flowers had different meanings. For instance, roses for love, hydrangea for gratitude, baby's breath for innocence...</p>
<p>These all evolved into a cryptological messaging system that delivered a message in a discrete way, gentile way. </p>
<p>That being said, the floral business is dying. People see flowers as a ridiculous expenditure but I'm really trying hard on my end to share my skills and knowledge with anyone who is interested. </p>
<p>Great question, by the way! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a heavy element of culture in this. While the appreciation of flowers is widespread around the globe, there are many societies in which flowers have been viewed with indifference or even disapproval (floral decorations have never been especially important in West African cultures, for example: sub-Saharan art has routinely depicted animals and people, but rarely flowers).</p>
<p>In general, the kind of societies in which an appreciation of flowers is mostly likely to develop are ones that are urbanized and have economic surpluses. Flowers are appreciated <em>precisely because</em> they are wasteful and don't have any practical use as foods; they symbolize the abundance of a wealthy society. </p>
<p>Part of the beauty of flowers lies in the physiological response their colours and shapes generate; but it's also that the cultivation of flowers, and the time and attention necessary to make floral decorations, denotes luxury and leisure - and these are qualities that have positive associations for human beings.</p>
<p>(I've loosely drawn from <em>The Culture of Flowers</em> by anthropologist Jack Goody for this answer.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Attraction to these particular &quot;useless&quot;  flowers e.g. Roses,  is highly unlikely to have been specifically driven by natural selection. </p>
<p>A few people here are getting towards a potentially correct idea from an evolutionary perspective which is our sense organs and brains are attracted to things like flowers for potentially adaptive reasons. </p>
<p>Not every trait we have is driven by natural selection. Some of our traits are driven by natural selection because they offered a fitness advantage and were selected for. Other traits we just have because they didn't cause a disadvantage and so they happened to spread through the population by chance even though they could have been lost. Other traits are things which weren't selected for but come with other trains which are adapted. E. G. Red blood itself isn't adaptive because of the colour red but is a product of having our haemoglobin which is adaptive. These were coined &quot;evolutionary spandrels&quot; by Gould and Lewontonin. </p>
<p>It's likely were attracted to useless flowers like roses for a sort of spandrel reason but it could also just be a we are because of chance variation which wasn't harmful. </p>
<p>It's easy to form a&quot; just so story&quot; which comes up with an explanation for traits like this in an evolutionary framework, but you can't prove or disprove them so be careful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Alice in wonderland syndrome.</p>
<p>I'm not sure my exact age at the time but I was around 9 or 10. I was laying stomach down on the brown velvety living room couch facing out with my left cheek to couch. Must have been attempting to nap.</p>
<p>I was staring at the opposite wall where the room corner meets the ceiling and all of a sudden I felt myself shrink down to doll size. The room became bigger and bigger and I didn't move any part of my body except my eyes to look around the room. The depth and size of the objects in the room kept adjusting and readjusting to various proportions. </p>
<p>I was so young I didn't understand the disorientation should be alarming and I felt like I could control the swing of becoming smaller and then normal size and then abnormally larger. I remember feeling like I was &quot;in&quot; the carpet like I was insect size. The sounds from around the house (like my grandma cooking in the nearby kitchen) seemed to ebb and flow per the appropriate &quot;size&quot; I was or distance I was away. I vaguely recall being able to recreate the experience only one more time but trying over and over to do so because I enjoyed the feeling so much.</p>
<p>I only learned what this is called about 2 years ago. Until then I kept it to myself because I thought I may have dreamed it or made it up in my childish recollection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bunch of people pointed out that it's called 'Alice in Wonderland Syndrome' but haven't said why it happens, so I did some digging. It turns out that nobody (at least according to papers published up to 2016) knows the exact cause; however, a doctor put someone in a scanner during an attack and saw abnormal blood flow in parts of the brain that process vision, texture, size, and shape. They didn't say what the scanner was, so I'm assuming an MRI. This is from an article done by ABC news, so take it with a grain of salt. source: <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/Primetime/story?id=3581479&page=1" target="_blank">http://a.abcnews.com/Primetime/story?id=3581479&page=1</a></p>
<p>It seems to happen to children randomly. It's also linked to a lack of sleep or sometimes experienced as you're going to sleep. Less benign causes are as an early symptom of the Epstein-Barr virus (mono), migraines, tumors, temporal lobe epillepsy, and hallucinogenic drugs.</p>
<p>For people experiencing AIWS with no underlying cause, rest and dietary change are usually prescribed to prevent symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your ancient ancestors had an omnivorous diet of fruits, nuts and meat where they could find it. Imagine you see that the inside of a carcass you're eating is rotten and full of maggots. Gagging is your brain telling you to eject the contents of your stomach to avoid poisoning yourself.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why you feel the need to vommit when someone else does. You may have ingested the same poison. After all, if that ape is near you then they're probably in your group. And you're probably eating the same thing they are. Therefore better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Sure...you may lose the contents of your stomach, but it's better than death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Think of Pavlov's dogs. Pavlov would ring a bell and give his dogs food. When he gave the dogs food, that would drool. Eventually, after ringing the bell and giving the food, they started to drool when they heard the bell.</p>
<p>The same principle can apply to gagging in some cases. From my own life: oatmeal. I used to eat oatmeal without a problem, but I would eat it slowly and it would get cold. The cold oatmeal made me gag. This happened a lot, and now the smell of oatmeal makes me gag.</p>
<p>Maybe more poignant. I brush my tongue after brushing my teeth. This makes me gag (since I'm sticking the brush far into my mouth). Now, I gag when I finish brushing my teeth even if I skip brushing my tongue.</p>
<p>Evolution makes us gag reflexively to some things, per /u/SovietWomble 's explaination, but we may be conditioned to gag at other things.</p>

They do it to increase drama and make the people seem more real. </p>
<p>And it varies depending on the type of show, often influenced further by how &quot;genuine&quot; versus &quot;ridiculously staged&quot; the show is. </p>
<p>On the sole-reality-participant shows (Survivorman, for example), they film it themselves during their next 'break'. </p>
<p>Sometimes it's performed in a side room almost immediately during a break in the action, when for example, they're restocking a cooking show competition's pantry. </p>
<p>Often it's performed afterward, sometimes weeks afterward, where the participant watches some footage of the build-up that may have already gone through editing, and is asked &quot;Okay, what was your reaction at this time? How were you feeling?&quot; This is often used in the remotely-filmed shows like some of the Alaskan homesteader families or fishing/ice-road driving, or where there's work locations involved like exotic goldfish-tank constructions.</p>
<p>In ones based on a competition, they'll film extra and cherrypick the wildest statements in interviews to maximize drama, selecting carefully to keep things surprising and avoiding giving away or misleading on who's going to be eliminated. In others, and particularly the more dismal ones where there are artificial obstacles, the interviewees know it's all about saying what will be the most over the top. One of the surviving-adversity ones where two guys get stranded somewhere and have to work their way out was HORRIBLE at this, and although I enjoyed the techniques and show, the interviews were truly cringeworthy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, it's their history. Good or bad, a lot of the people living in those areas now have ancestors that were in the war. No one wants to go through life feeling ashamed all the time (even if some tell them that they should, in fact especially if someone is telling them they should). So there's three choices; ignore that entire part of your family history, town history, state history, feel like shit because of the bad stuff, or remember and be proud of the good stuff.</p>
<p>And yes, there was good stuff. The vast majority of southerners fighting for the Confederacy had never, not once, owned a slave. In fact quite a few of them probably viewed slavery as a lot of people view automation now: something that is taking jobs we could and should be working. Why should I scrape by on a meager plot of land with my sons working the fields and my daughters tending the livestock while the big plantation owner in the next county can make a fortune with labor he doesn't have to pay. So why did tens of thousands of non-slave owning lower class citizens sign up to fight for the Confederacy? Because they believed in states rights, that a state should govern itself within its own borders, and that being a part of the Union ought to be voluntary. When the Union told them that no, they couldn't leave and we're sending Federal troops to make sure you don't, that pissed a lot of people off, slavery or no. Many soldiers in the Confederacy weren't there fighting for &quot;The Confederacy&quot;, and they sure as hell weren't fighting for some rich guys with cheap labor. They fought to protect their state, which at the time they saw as their country. Back then, people still thought of states as what the name implies: its own nation. Don't forget that that's why they were called states and not some other term like province. State is a synonym for nation. That's why there's a State Department. That's why Presidents and Prime Ministers are called &quot;Chiefs of State&quot;. The State of Virginia was to them a nation called Virginia. A nation that had a voluntary membership in a Union of other nations, and should be free to leave if they choose.</p>
<p>Many southerners (and non southerners) still look up at that motivation as something good. Casting off the yoke of an oppressive government, fighting for the right of your community to see to their own affairs, fighting what they see as foreign invaders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also consider that the South has an independent culture from the rest of the US. From Texas to Virginia it's The South. There really are no comparable regional cultures anymore. </p>
<p>Everybody not from the south picks on the South. I know I do. They still despise all these damn Yankees moving down south and being rude and shitting on them.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was asked pretty recently, and this is the second time I've reposted this in two days. The answer is the active effort by ex-Confederates to revise history throughout the late 19th century:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer has been given as to what the Confederate flag represents.</p>
<p>However, there is more to the story - <strong>why the Confederate flag is still in widespread use across the South.</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of the American Civil War, there was a very considerable effort by ex-Confederates to rehabilitate the image of the South. This historiographical narrative is called &quot;the Lost Cause of the South&quot;, and refers to the revisionist effort to portray the reasons for the South and its soldiers seceding and fighting the war as a somehow noble struggle - the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" target="_blank">Doomed Moral Victor</a>, to use troperspeak.</p>
<p>The primary problem that this narrative needed to overcome was the problem of slavery being morally bankrupt. So the Lost Cause narrative went around this by suggesting that the South seceded in order to fight for &quot;states' rights&quot; and to &quot;protect the Southern way of life&quot; which was romanticized. Two Lost Cause films that promote these ideas are <em>Gone With The Wind</em> and <em>Gods And Generals</em>.</p>
<p>Next, the Lost Cause had to smear the names of the Union heroes and promote the Confederate heroes as somehow superior. Lee's gentlemanly mannerisms and brilliant stratagems are held in contrast to Grant's &quot;simple-minded butchery&quot; and vulgar habits. The defamation of Grant extended even into his term as President, which is frequently derided as an extremely corrupt administration. Stonewall Jackson's piety and tactical brilliance is venerated while his extreme eccentrism and laziness to the point of detriment is glossed over. Sherman's March to the Sea is portrayed as an episode of history's worst war crimes.</p>
<p>Next, Confederates who repented had to be ruined. James Longstreet was one of Lee's most reliable and competent subordinates, but after the war was over Longstreet criticized the South's motives for war and, even worse, dared to collaborate with the Republican politicians. His reputations was destroyed by Lost Cause revisionists, most egregiously in that blame for the defeat at Gettysburg was pinned upon him rather than Lee for decades.</p>
<p>Next, the Doomed Moral Victor narrative had to be justified ex post facto - the South had to have started an unwinnable war for noble reasons and died a martyr. The Civil War was winnable by the South - the North, despite its many advantages, still had to impose its will over a huge area and population. All the South had to do was resist and hold its key areas long enough for the North to decide the war was unwinnable, and thus come to the negotiating table. But the South's gross incompetence in the Western theatres and inability to win offensive victories meant they lost the initiative and ceded key territories (such as New Orleans and the Mississippi River) that ultimately doomed their war effort.</p>
<p>Finally, Reconstruction had to be demonized. Narratives of exploitative carpet-baggers and corrupt radical Republican administration dominated. Black suffrage was portrayed as a terrible, misguided mistake. Egalitarianism was a failed experiment that only caused disorder and disunity. When the election of 1876, the closest election in American history, rolled around, the Republicans compromised with the Dixiecrats and lifted military administration from the former rebellious states, and the Jim Crow era began as black residents of these states were totally deprived of their franchise and civil liberties.</p>
<p>But why and how did this happen? Because the North wanted it to happen. Years of war and division had taken their toll, and both sides wanted reconciliation. The North was tired of expending its resources keeping down a strife-ridden South, and the Southerners wanted their sacrifices acknowledged as well as assurances that they weren't evil people. That the rights and freedom of African-Americans in the South had to be sacrificed on the altar of reconciliation was inconsequential - the Northern population might have opposed slavery, but they were just as racist as their Southern cousins.</p>
<p>And so the narrative became set in stone as truth - the Dunning School interpretation of the war was extremely popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Even today, the influence and damage of the Lost Cause narrative is still readily evident. <strong>And because the Lost Cause narrative rehabilitated the image of the Confederacy over a century ago, it later became acceptable for the Confederate flag to be displayed as a symbol of &quot;Southern pride and heritage&quot;</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Southern States bore the brunt of the Covil War. All but two battles were fought in their territory, and while the North had a larger death toll in nominal terms, the South proportionally had a higher fatality rate. They gave up tons, and had nothing to show for it. This led to the lost cause movements 20-30 years after the war which somewhat successfully rebranded the confederates message, and romanticized the Rebel fight. Combine this with the Union being very lenient on the Confederacy during Reconstruction, because they didn't want to deal with a never ending insurgency, and you have a recipe for how the Confederacy is viewed by many today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, games stay in early access because they're trying to see what works. Subnautica is a good example of this: it's an underwater survival game that has been in early access for a long time now. Its release date has been pushed back several times, and for good reason. While the game has a great concept and good gameplay/mechanics, it is plagued by many bugs, glitches and flat-out errors. Its notorious for running slowly and shakily, even on some higher-end computers. Thanks to early access, they've been able to prioritize these errors from community feedback, figuring out what to do and how to do it while keeping the fans happy. For example, they've been able to squash bugs quickly because the community finds them for them.</p>
<p>TL;DR- It's so devs can work on the game to make it better and eventually prepare it for release.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
