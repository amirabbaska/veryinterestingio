		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, B.A. in psychology here.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this: if a person with schizophrenia doesn't ever hear speech, would they still hear voices? </p>
<p>The thing about schizophrenia is that it falls under the categorization of psychosis, that is, a departure from reality. In order for someone to be classified as a schizophrenic, their separation from reality would be identified given an already established reality, namely, that people should not hear a person's voice talking when there is no such external stimulus. &quot;I can hear my own voice in my mind though,&quot; you might say. That is not the same since it is not a perception. It is not an external stimulus interpreted by your brain. In a schizophrenic or other psychotic individual who hears voices, the brain perceives the voice as if it is an external stimulus, or at least that is what we are able to determine based on individuals' descriptions of said voices. However, the individual is still aware in most cases, depending on the intensity of the psychosis, that the voice is in their head.</p>
<p>Thus, the issue can be anywhere in the brain areas related to auditory sensation, perception, and of course all other related mental networks, such as those of memory, speaking, language analysis, etc. The way our brain functions is that we perceive what is happening in the world outside our minds by complicated processes in our brain and body that TRANSLATE an external stimulus like sound into patterned signals that we can understand. </p>
<p>Something to consider - If a person DOES hear voices given they have never heard human speech, including their own, as a result of drug use or mental illness, then we can conclude that there is a very strong genetic component, something in our DNA, that &quot;remembers&quot; what human speech is. Guess what? Studies have shown that a deaf person who has never heard human speech in their life and has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, DOES describe hearing voices. Isn't that fascinating? Given this information, this means that the cause for hearing voices may not by a separation from reality... it may not have to do with external stimuli. Perhaps, it is something very deep in our DNA. No surprise there, schizophrenia is quite heritable. In the case of paranoid schizophrenia, 30-40% of siblings will share it. That is, your chance of having Par. Schz. are significant if your sibling has it. Amplified by the use of drugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I doubt anyone will see this reply now with all these other posts, but Hell, I'm going to post anyway.</p>
<p>To understand why hallucinations occur, you must first understand how the brain works on a fundamental level.</p>
<p>The brain is what we would call a 'feedback mechanism'. Essentially this just means that is primary function is to take in inputs (stimuli / 'the feed') from its environment (the world) and then produce an appropriate response ('feeding back' input to the world) through moving your body. Afterward the results of your movement result in new stimuli from the world. Essentially it results in a constant cycle of action and reaction. </p>
<p>There is obviously a lot more to it which I don't cover, but more relevant to this subject, the brain itself is composed of various sections which all control and perform different functions. Some process thought, some process your visual sight, some control and process memories, and some process sound. </p>
<p>All of these various sections are linked up together, too. They constantly reference each other, feeding input and output to each other. So, the brain is also composed of its own internal feedback mechanisms, with its own unique cycles.</p>
<p>Essentially, all reality as we know and experience it is controlled by all of these loops. Everything you hear, everything you see, and everything you feel is composed of these loops. This is the primary key to understanding where hallucinations come from.
Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>During an auditory hallucination, what is actually happening is that rather than the usual feedback cycles in the brain simply processing inputs, some sort of stimulus causes a loop which is referencing the exact same auditory processing functions as the ones which create 'sound' in one's mind, along with some semi-cognitive functions or memory retrieval (or likely both). Basically, it's a 'broken loop'. </p>
<p>In other words, instead of a simple stimulus travelling its normal route of pathways in the brain, it striggers a sort 'detour' route through different pathways and along the way it collects both sounds and 'ideas'. The result is someone experiencing thoughts in the form of spoken words, or other sounds, in a way that would seem 'real' in exactly the same way as any other sound would feel real. This is because it is created within exactly the same methods as everything 'real'.</p>
<p>tl;dr version:</p>
<p>Your brain creates reality through a bunch of loops and when one of these loops gets mixed up it creates a different kind of reality that seems just as real as the one you normally experience every day.</p>
<p>If anyone actually does read this and has any questions feel free to ask! I'll do my best to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three basic protections to keep in mind:</p>
<p>Copyright = media, like books, movies, and such. Things that can be literally copied.</p>
<p>Trademarks = logos, characters, brand recognition</p>
<p>Patent = inventions, processes for doing things/making things.</p>
<p>You can't copyright or trademark food. You can patent a food, but only if it's pretty unique. Cereal isn't - most of it is all variations on a similar thing.</p>
<p>So there's nothing wrong with Fruit Spins looking or tasting like Froot Loops.</p>
<p>Brands and packaging can be protected. The font and logo of Froot Loops, for example, are probably trademarked. The bird-guy they use, too. So as long as Fruit Spins doesn't copy the font, logo, or bird-guy on their branding or boxes, they're not violating a trademark.</p>
<p>The Avengers, on the other hand, is likely copyrighted (for the actual content of the movies/comics) and trademarked (for the characters). </p>
<p>So if your Dahvengers movie had the same plot as an Avengers movie, just with different names or small details changed, you'd be violating copyright. If the characters were the same, or slightly changed (The Incredible Bulk, Titanium Dude, etc), you'd be violating trademark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't copyright a recipe for food and usually can't patent a food product. The specific form in which a recipe is presented can be copyrighted (the words and formatting), but as long as someone changes up the words they can use the same ingredients, measurements, and steps. Similarly, you can protect branding and food packaging, but not a food product. If someone figures out how to make a Twinkie and sells it with different packaging and branding, they're allowed to.</p>
<p>Malt-O-Meal and others can get away with off-brand cereal because their packaging and branding is different. For example, they don't use Lucky the Leprechaun with their Marshmallow Mateys cereal (similar to Lucky Charms); they use a kangaroo instead. Also, I don't even think the recipe is exactly the same because their cereals definitely taste a little different.</p>
<p>In some cases you can patent  food products, but they have to be non-obvious and novel. Most food products are obvious variations on old recipes (like with cereal). Egg yolk substitutes are an example of a patented food product.</p>
<p>The big difference with movies is that you can copyright a script and characters but you can't normally patent a food. As a result, you can't recreate and sell a movie even if you have the ability to. You can still change a few things to avoid confusion with the original film and probably be okay, though. Or make a parody. The main thing is you can't cause confusion between your film and the original (i.e., you can't make it so that filmgoers would think your film is the original when at the box office buying tickets or that the original film approved or endorsed your film).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The best way is plasma to heat to steam to rotation to electricity. Modern power cycles operate close to the Carnot efficiency. It literally doesn't get any better than steam, especially for large-scale systems like a power plant. These aren't the steam engines of the 1800s, they're highly advanced, modern machinery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The reason everyone hypes up fusion energy is because of how incredibly cheap and clean it would be if it actually worked. The main fuels for fusion reactors (or at least the main ones being studied/constructed such as ITER, NSTX-U, Wendelstein etc.) are deuterium and/or tritium. This is just heavy hydrogen isotopes. You could potentially get this by simply filtering sea water, taking the heavy H2O molecules, and using hydrolysis to get the heavy hydrogen.</p>
<p>So imagine this: we have working fusion reactors and you can get the fuel by just looking through tons of sea water. Energy suddenly becomes super cheap, clean, and nearly infinite! Not to mention fusion reactors don't use the same fuel as nuclear weaponry. Current fission reactors cause a lot of hullabaloo in the media since they require fissile material which is also used for nukes (this was the main controversy that caused the Iran Deal). Thus fusion reactors are a HUGE step forward in nuclear disarmament. Not to mention once we get working fusion reactors there are offshoots like helium 3 reactors to power advanced thruster systems that are currently being developed.</p>
<p>In summary, the issue in energy production has never been that steam is too primitive. The issue is that the materials used to create the steam have their own problems. Fossil fuels create carbon pollution and fission plants create nuclear waste and can be used as a front for nuclear weapon production. Fusion would ideally have neither of these problems and be very cheap to operate. Of course now we just have to actually do it. Which is the hard part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The neutrons carry 4/5th of the energy of the fusion reaction, so it's very necessary to capture that for electricity production.  Typically, the blanket is envisioned as consisting of a mixture of lead and lithium.  Lead helps shield the rest of the reactor from these high energy neutrons, and slows them down and multiplies them so that the lithium can breed tritium for use in future reactors.  The blanket will be cooled by water in a heat exchanger, which then goes to a turbine for electricity generation.</p>
<p>A less conventional idea is to use direct conversion of charged particles to electricity.  I don't know a lot about this, but the main idea is to take exhaust from something like a linear machine (like Tri-Alpha's) and collect the charge.  I'm not sure this has really ever been done yet, but it might be able to create higher efficiencies in the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a songwriter, I'll just say that it's more difficult than you might imagine to accidentally create the same melody as someone else. This may be surprising since many of the most popular songs in the world use the same 2-3 chord progressions. There's a comedic team that does a medley of all the songs that use the Canon in D progression, and it's striking just how different the melodies are from one to the next, but they all work perfectly with the music.  </p>
<p>Now, sometimes you will get a similar melody for a few notes, sometimes you'll notice you're doing it, sometimes you won't. It wasn't until after I recorded a song for an album that I realized our chorus had the same three notes from the line &quot;Take On Me.&quot;  A few people joked about it but mostly not, because the rest of the song is so totally different, and it's three notes. It happens.</p>
<p>Even if you wrote a chorus with the exact same chord progression and tempo as another song, the chances of accidentally writing the same melody even for a few notes in a row is astronomical. If two songs sound similar enough to be copied, they probably are.  The thing is it can be unintentional. I heard a song in a store yesterday, no idea who or what it was, but it was hip-hop. The hook was catchy. 30 mins later I found my brain writing a song in another genre around that chord progression, though I had forgotten what the melody sounded like. I decided to forget it just in case more of the melody I was dreaming up was from that song than I meant it to be, and even if it was, nobody would have ever put the two together if I'd released it.</p>
<p>One funny story though, in regards to music and not vocal melody, Back in about 2005 I wrote an arpeggio riff that I played with guitar tapping; it was a breakdown-outro to a song. We recorded a demo of it but ended up leaving the song off the record we were writing because the rest of the song wasn't very good. Fast forward 11 years and the first half of that riff is now the theme for the Daredevil show on Netflix.  I still plan on using that riff in a song though, because it's good, and I wrote it first, dammit.  But do I think the composer copied me? Even if we'd released the song to the public, no, I would not think that.</p>
<p>Here's my riff: <a href="https://instaud.io/UNr" target="_blank">https://instaud.io/UNr</a></p>
<p>Here's the Daredevil theme, in the same key, no less: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFYFh8w4758&feature=youtu.be&t=17s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFYFh8w4758&feature=youtu.be&t=17s</a></p>
<p>Edit: funny thing, I heard the same melody from the beginning of this part in a classical song on the radio today. </p>
<p>Edit 2: I just remembered another funny story, tangentially related. While writing that same album I mentioned, I had decided that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlJ-OJVFik" target="_blank">Escape from the Bomb House by Less Than Jake</a> was a great song and I would just rip it off. This happens fairly often too, and what I mean is that I liked the vibe of the song, I liked the chord progression, I liked the way I felt when I listened to it, and so I wanted to try to get as many of those same things together in a new song. This would probably mean using the same tempo and maybe some of the same chords, but that I'd fool around using that song as a base and eventually it would turn into something new. This is often how songs are written anyway, I'd end up writing something new while learning something else, so I decided I would do it on purpose this time.</p>
<p>Well anyway I get my guitar out and start figuring out how to play the song and am surprised to find that we had already written a song with almost the exact same chord progression from start to finish! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIykLzlIHNw" target="_blank">Stitches by Much The Same</a>  It's not exactly the same and it's in a different key, but if you're musically inclined you'll hear that if you removed the vocals and put it in the same key, the chord progression in the verses and choruses are almost identical.  The reason this is related is because despite these two songs being similar, and me being a big fan of one as we wrote the other, the melodies are worlds apart.</p>
<p>Of course I could not try to write another song with almost the same progression for the same album, so I dropped that idea. That brings us to now, when we are writing our newest album, and it turns out that two of our new songs, written by the same guy, are almost the exact same chord progression as each other, in the same key, enough that as we're learning them I keep getting them mixed up.  Like so similar the way those two Nickelback songs can be played on top of each other.  But they're both really good in their own way, and nobody would be likely to notice the similarity unless they tried to learn them on guitar, so whatever. =)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you don't. </p>
<p>basically, copyright law is against <em>copying</em>; if you come up with the exact same melody by yourself, then it's fine, as long as you can prove that. </p>
<p>to prevent people from abusing this, there's a rule that if you've had access to (heard, for example) a previous creation (in this case, the song) and your work is similar to that previous creation, then it will be presumed that you did copy and you have to prove you didn't (not easy). you can also be found to have &quot;subconsciously copied&quot;. </p>
<p>balancing this is the rule that if you didn't <em>intentionally</em> copy, you won't be required to pay damages, only enjoined (ordered by way of injunction) to stop infringing the original copyright (so you can't sell your song etc.)</p>
<p>so if your song sounds similar to a popular one, you probably will be stopped from doing much with it even if you didn't consciously copy, but you won't have to pay crazy sums or anything unless you obviously intended to copy and profit from the original. </p>
<p>edit: there are some other replies that say you can't copyright a melody. this is untrue; there is one copyright subsisting in the lyrics and another in the melody. this is why song credits list the songwriter/composer separately.</p>
<p>second edit: the first edit is true in the UK and Australia. there's a comment somewhere here which apparently says that that's not the case in the US, but I can't tell for sure (don't know much about US IP law).</p>
<p>third edit: some people are asking &quot;what about beats/chord progressions etc.&quot;</p>
<p>basically, there's this concept of an idea-expression dichotomy in copyright law. copyright protects expressions, not ideas. to illustrate, if I told everyone to write a love story, they would probably come up with fairly different things. the idea here is &quot;love story&quot;, but each writer has come up with a different <em>expression</em> of that idea, and each individual expression has its own copyright.</p>
<p>the simpler an expression, the closer it is to the idea, and the more difficult it is to prove infringement of the copyright protecting that expression. the reason is that if you protect the idea, you basically give the holder of the copyright a monopoly over <em>every single expression of that idea</em>. so, in my love story example, that would mean that if I had copyright in it, I would be the only person who could ever write love stories, or allow anyone to.</p>
<p>stuff like chord progressions and beats are very, very close to ideas. for example, the simple I-IV-V-I can be played slow or fast, loud or soft, on the trombone or the glockenspiel, in A Major or F# Major, etc.. when you step so close to an idea, you would have to copy someone more or less wholesale to be liable for copyright infringement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a professional musician, and I have an issue with Deja Vu where I often believe the things I write or play, I've heard before. The thing I and my mates have found is that there is always a 90% chance someone has played the same progression of notes, chords, or rhythms, but rarely the combination of the three. So it is highly likely that there are chunks of songs that sound really similar all the time. But most of the time, the connection is never made, nor do people WANT to make it made. Much like politics, it's not illegal to be unaware. If it looks like you are copying large chunks of lyrics and music, there are unwritten rules about whether or not you get sued; like when Van Halen was informed that their song &quot;Jump&quot; sounded really close to an Australian 70s band, they just said &quot;Well, oops.&quot; The pursuit of any dispute was tossed because &quot;Jump&quot; is a million times more famous and popular. So, technically, if you do accidentally copy a riff note-for-note, just become the most popular version of the song.  There is a website that makes a list of a lot of &quot;Suspiciously Similar Songs&quot; and most of them make no mention of lawsuits. <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SuspiciouslySimilarSong/Music" target="_blank">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SuspiciouslySimilarSong/Music</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, a lot of work goes into designing a heating system for a home so that heat is distributed somewhat evenly. Heat coming from appliances probably isn't going to be as evenly dissipated. To give an extreme example, having one source of heat in a corner of your home will require more energy to maintain your home's climate than having a whole system of ducts which aim to evenly heat your home, because an uneven climate loses more heat to the outside environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Note that both of these explanations could well be true.</p>
<p>In a broader sense, camouflage is usually stronger in ground nesting bird eggs, such as the eggs of plover.  Robin eggs are in nests usually located well off the ground.  Visual camouflage on the eggs is less important because the eggs themselves are fairly well hidden by the nest and the leaves around it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although cults are religious groups typically, they have a lot of differences which are quite big.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leadership: Whereas a religion may have a religious head and a hierarchical structure to it's system, a cult typically only has 1 or 2 leaders who make all the rules and who have absolute control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communities: Cult members often live in groups or communes which brings them further into the cult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolation: Many of these communes are isolated from the rest of society and members may be forced into cutting off communication with the outside world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coercion: Many inductees are mistreated and abused in order to establish a form of psychological control over their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recitation: Cult members aren't told how to interpret their religion, they're told the phrases and motos to reinforce it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objective: Cult members are constantly told that if they remain loyal and do things for the cult that they will be elevated to the select few who can be enlightened/transcend/attain inner peace. However the goal posts are constantly moved back to keep the higher ups in absolute control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited Information: Whereas anyone can pick up a bible and more or less understand most of Christianity, cults only reveal small tidbits of their beliefs at every new level that a member reaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alienation: Cult members are constantly engrained with an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seclusion: Most cults are self sufficient so that members don't ever have to leave, and most of the time they're not allowed to anyways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expensive: Yes church can be expensive, but cults routinely ask for it's members to dedicate their whole live to the cause and to pay their &quot;dues&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>Secretive: Cults never openly advertise about themselves, their beliefs, their leadership, or how they spend the money they receive from members. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Guys I get it, many religions do this to some extent or another. But the main point is that the governing bodies of cults actively participate in this behavior. Just because there are  congregations that practice these behaviors, doesn't make every church a cult. Cults are like pornography: you'll know it when you see it.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of conflation between cults and sects and there's plenty of reading online. But to give an answer to the <em>colloquial</em> understanding of cults...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One or two charismatic leaders - the cult usually dies with them. Religions do not rely on individuals such as this which is one of the reasons they last so much longer than cults, which almost always die within one or two generations </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolation - limited exposure to alternative ideas is an important part of keeping people indoctrinated. Sometimes this literally means creating an isolated community (think Jim Jones). Most religions are accepting of new members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High demands - while a religion usually demands very little, cults usually are quite demanding of their members, whether that demand is money, time, freedom, or whatever else. While some religions can also be very demanding, usually it is possible to follow it with a less demanding interpretation. Cults generally demand a lot of all members. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerable followers - it is simply not normal behaviour to join a cult and believe its teachings. Cults rely on the weak and vulnerable, and those easy to manipulate. Arguably you could say the same for religion, but a vulnerable person turning to religion is not the same as a cult preying on people. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strict rules - cults usually have fairly strict regulations on behaviour in the outside world. Religions are generally compatible with the modern lifestyle - they're so big that they need to either adapt or survive. Again this is one of the reasons cults tend to be quite short lived, because they are often incompatible with daily life.</p>
</li>
<li>Secretive - again, to keep people indoctrinated it helps to convince them that they have exclusive access to some special truth. This helps to neutralise threats to the ideology because you can simply claim &quot;well they don't know what we do&quot;. Religions on the other hand generally specifically aim to spread their message. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are the simple/ basic parameters for a cult that I learned in Religions of the World: </p>
<ul>
<li>A group that loves something</li>
<li>A religion whose beliefs differ from the majority around them (Ex: Christians in the Roman Empire were considered cult members since they didn't worship Roman gods) </li>
<li>A religious group that is exclusive, secretive, authoritarian </li>
</ul>
<p>Expanding on the last three... </p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive: Might claim that they alone have the truth and that everyone else is wrong; if you leave the group your salvation will be in danger</li>
<li>Secretive: Certain teachings aren't available to outsiders or they're presented only to certain members of the group-- sometimes in confidentiality.</li>
<li>Authoritarian: A human leader expects total loyalty and unquestioned obedience </li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters probably answer the second part of your question as well, since cults endanger the lives/self-esteems of their members and, even if they don't, they're pretty hush-hush, leading to suspicion.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the People's Temple documentary? It's pretty good and shows how brainwashed and stuck people can get. Cults often prey on &quot;weaker&quot; people, like the elderly, those without relatives, vulnerable people... It's sad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is difficult to answer the question when you juxtaposition it as humans vs animals &quot;such as ants&quot;.</p>
<p>A key reason most animals (including humans) strive to be better than one another has to do with the aspect of evolutionary theory known as sexual selection. Most animals will seek a mate that improves the likelihood of their offspring being successful. Part of that is seeking the genetic makeup that improves the offspring. Another part is selecting a mate that will be the best parent.</p>
<p>In some species the sexual selection is mainly done by one sex, which results in competition in the other sex. One example is birds of paradise. Other species the selection is done by both sexes, which leads to competition in both sexes. Humans fall into this category.</p>
<p>Ants is an entirely different story, because their genetics is based on haplodiploidy. The entire colony are the offspring of the queen, so there is no genetic variation. When she mates she mates with ants that carry only her dna, so there is no evolutionary benefit in mating with x, y or z.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different animals have different strategies. Remember that from an evolutionary point of view, all that matters is passing on your genes by any means. Workers ants are all infertile. They won't be passing on their genes anyway. So there wouldn't really have any been any pressure to develop internal competitive drives because that would actually compromise the chance of them the queen passing on her genes (and that is where all the worker ants get their genes from too)</p>
<p>Humans might be a social group animal, but there is still competition for resources between different members of the group and between different groups. An individual that manages to stand apart from the others and get higher status has more chance of passing on their genes, so that sort of behaviour got selected for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary perspective, it's because we want <em>our</em> genetic material to be passed down to future generations. Outshining other members of the species increases the chances of a mate picking you, and hence carrying on your genes. In the animal kingdom, you make yourself a more worthy partner by performing mating rituals, fighting off other suitors, etc. In the human world, we prove ourselves to be good potential mates by being smarter/richer/more successful.</p>
<p>From a more social perspective, the norm of competitiveness is embedded within our society - the more talented you prove yourself to be, the more likely you are to be accepted and provided with opportunities. </p>
<p>In comparison to ants, however, I'm not too sure. It may have something to do with their mating system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oohhh, can answer this! A major cause is the genetic makeup of ants (and also bees). It's because they're &quot;haplo-diploid&quot;. Basically, the males only have one copy of their genes, while the females (worker bees) have two copies of their genes, just like humans do. </p>
<p>When a human (or most other animals) has a baby, they are 50% related to it. This is caused by the way genes shuffle between parents when an egg fuses with sperm, but basically, you get half the genes from mom and half from dad. Each parent gives one of their two copies. It's a little more complex than that, but essentially, your offspring get half of your DNA. And not all of your kids get the same 50% as it shuffles each time. </p>
<p>So a daughter is 50% related to her mom (other half from dad) and 50% related to her own offspring (other half from her mate). However, remember how male bees and ants only have one copy? Well, this causes a special case where the dad ant or bee is 100% related to his offspring! He gives his entire copy to his kids, but the female bee only gives 50% of her genes; she only gives one of her two copies. This means that <strong>female ants and bees - workers and drones - are 75% related to each other!</strong> That's a 75% similarity between sisters, so <strong>sister ants are more related to their sisters than they are to the queen mother, or their own possible offspring!</strong></p>
<p>Well, what does that mean? Since ants are more closely related to their sisters than to their offspring (and I only mention the females because males aren't &quot;workers&quot;), their &quot;evolutionary fitness&quot; is stronger if they know their place and help their sisters live. If they tried to have babies, they'd be 50% related to their kids. But they're 75% related to their sisters, so their efforts are best spent keeping sisters thriving. And so long as the queen is the same, that will continue to be the case, since all the queen's kids will be more sisters. It's better to help your sisters and queen mum, since that's your best chance of having genes like yours stay alive and going. </p>
<p><strong><em>TLDR: because ants are more related to their siblings than they are to their own kids! SCIENCE!</em></strong></p>
<p>PS: This is why the death of a queen sends bees and ants into chaos. If the queen changes, her babies will be nothing like you. And if that happens, your devotion to the new queen is in vain. When a queen dies, the female ants go into a frenzy trying to become the new queen and save the maternal lineage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
