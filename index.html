		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maximum hair length is determined by the length of the <em>anagen</em> (the period when hair growth occurs). This is different for each individual. Longer hair is possible only for people with a longer anagen. Typically this period lasts between 2 and 7 years. For some people it's longer. When the anagen period is over, the catagen or transitional phase begins. This lasts for about two weeks after which the telogen or resting phase begins. After the resting phase is over (after about one to four months) the hair will fall out. This is considered normal hair loss and you probably notice it every day. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, yes, there is a maximum, but it's drastically different from person to person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Human hair has a diameter of 17 to 181 µm, let's use 181 µm. The only density estimate I can find is 0.62 mg for a 4.5&quot; sample of hair (from &quot;Biomonitoring of Mercury Exposure with Single Human Hair Strand&quot;). Lastly, Wikipedia gives us a value of 10 MPa for the ultimate tensile strength of human hair.</p>
<p>If we put this all together, I'm finding that a single strand of hair could reach <strong>4832 m</strong> (about 3 miles) in length before failing under tensile load.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid helium is required to induce ordinary superconductivity in the static magnetic field coils of the MRI. With the discovery of higher temperature superconductors a few years back there was work on building MRI magnetic coils using these materials and then cooling them with liquid nitrogen instead of liquid helium. My recollect of somewhat laymanized papers in the medical imaging press at the time was that the magnetic fields produced from high temperature superconductors were not as uniform as those produced from true superconducting coils. As a result, the prototype MRIs they were testing had to make software corrections to the images produced that reversed the effect of the non-uniformities in the static magnetic field. A lot of imaging professionals pooh poohed these machines saying a radiologist review the images from them would never be able to tell whether something in the image was a true anatomical feature or an artifact introduced into the images from the software corrections. Bottomline, the new devices didn't really catch on but it suggests if liquid helium did become increasingly scarce, there might be alternatives.  Regarding the statement that helium comes from natural gas production, until recently this was true, but only in the fields of north and west texas. In recent years a gas field elsewhere in the world, I think it was in China, was found to be a significant new source of helium, relieving concerns about a world wide shortage of helium as the texas fields became depleted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most MRI magnets use liquid helium because it is a convenient way of cooling the coils to the temperature (&lt; 4K) required. The use of liquid helium, means that the coils can be fully immersed, and will remain cold for weeks, with no operator action.</p>
<p>In practice, most MRI magnets are &quot;zero boil off&quot;. A chiller unit is installed (typically a Gifford-McMahon refrigerator) connected to a copper block, which protrudes into the magnet cryostat. The copper block is cooled to about 2K. Any helium that boils off from the liquid, contacts the cold copper, condenses back into a liquid, and drips back.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers take this a bit further, and instead of using liquid helium immersion, simply take a very high powered cryochiller, and connect it to a copper or aluminium frame onto which the main magnet coils are attached. This design is often called &quot;cryogenless&quot; or &quot;zero cryogen&quot;.  The chiller cools the metal frame, and in turn cools the coils to superconducting temperature. The disadvantage of this is that the construction of the magnet is much more expensive than a simple helium immersion magnet. Another problem is that in the event of an electrical failure without the buffer of liquid helium immersion, the magnet can rapidly warm up, and will &quot;quench&quot;. A power outage can be a big problem for a zero cryogen magnet, so you need the additional cost of reliable backup power.</p>
<p>Quench is sudden loss of magnetic field in a superconducting magnet, caused for example by the magnet temperature rising above the critical temperature. When this happens, the magnet rapidly loses its field, and releases a large amount of energy as heat into the coils. In a liquid cooled magnet, this causes quite spectacular explosive boiling of the helium resulting in burst valves blowing open, and an impressive smoke show, then days or weeks of downtime as the magnet is checked for quench damage, has the burst discs repaired, is recharged with helium and re-energised. In the case of a cryogenless magnet, a quench is less spectacular, but can still result in magnet damage, and a long period of downtime, while the magnet is cooled and restarted.</p>
<p>Of course, zero cryogen magnets still require some sort of working fluid in the chiller. In this case, they use the same type of Gifford-mcMahon chiller which uses a small amount of helium gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many answers but nobody mentioned overheating.</p>
<p>Yes, bloated Windows (or other OSes) will get slowed down, but even if you format your computer, it might still be slow. That's because of two reasons. The first is, your hard drive will get slower. Buy an SSD, should be good for the next 5 years. The second, more common one (since as seen in this thread, nobody cares about it) is the fact that your processor starts overheating after years of use.</p>
<p>That's not because the processor gets bad or anything, it's because the thermal paste on the processor is old, it dries up, cracks, fills with air bubbles which overheat. If you change the thermal paste on your processor (and graphics unit) your computer should be as good as new. </p>
<p>You won't even necessarily notice your computer is overheating. That's because most laptops opt to slow down the processor instead of letting it overheat too much, but in some extreme cases your computer might end up turning off whenever you put too much strain on it. I've seen a case of a core2duo that should be running at 3GHz running at 600 MHz. Change your thermal pastes people!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also consider the increased RAM requirement of your web browser as computing power increases. </p>
<p>I'm picking on RAM because I've personally noticed my web browsers eating all of mine on occasion.</p>
<p>Two factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>updates to the software make it less efficient by adding more resource-hungry features</li>
<li>as compute and network grows, &quot;web applications&quot; grow their resource requirements as well</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the developers don't notice the relatively minor increase in resource use, and by the time it's added up to affect you, they've upgraded their computers.</p>
<p>So ideally you'd notice this at 5 rather than 3 years,  and you'd not notice it if your &quot;internet use&quot; involves one window with one tab on one page at a time.</p>
<p>I notice it because I leave my browser open 24/7 with 10-50 tabs, 3 of which are pinned web apps like Gmail and Facebook.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After three years time, there's only a few reasonable causes I can think of for a severe loss of usability in a computer.</p>
<p>1) The computer is cheap, and is using hardware that is already several years out of date at the time of purchase (I'm looking at you, Intel Celeron and Pentium).</p>
<p>As far as a solution, well, don't buy dirt cheap laptops. The &quot;Diminishing Returns Curve of Computer Hardware&quot; is a term I like to throw around. Basically, it's a graph of dollars spent v. performance yield of the computer. Despite somewhat popular belief, it is curved on both ends. Spend more than, say, $800, you will start to see less performance gain per dollar, and the strength of this effect gets stronger and stronger as you keep spending more money. Spend less than, say, $300, you will start to see <em>more performance loss</em> per dollar taken off. Those dollar amounts are rough and not true values to live by, but the point is there is a middle ground.</p>
<p>2) Very poor treatment of the operating system, be it Windows, OSX or a Linux distribution. This kind of piggy backs on #1, as newer hardware can better cope with the abuse, but if you have a ton of junky programs on your computer, you will find it is going to run quite poorly.</p>
<p>If this is the case, some single use programs (for Windows systems) I like are [Junkware Removal Tool] (<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/junkwareremovaltool/" target="_blank">https://www.malwarebytes.com/junkwareremovaltool/</a>) and [adwcleaner] (<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>).</p>
<p>I hesitate to say antivirus will help, because those are targeting malicious software that is actually trying to steal your information or damage your system, and junkware isn't always malicious. That said, antivirus is always a good idea because malware can end up causing system slowdowns. Some antivirus names I am familiar with and haven't had a bad time with are Malwarebytes, Kaspersky, Avast and Sophos.</p>
<p>3) A bit of a stretch, but a failing storage device in a computer is extremely disruptive to system performance. Not to mention, your data will be in danger if you don't back it up to another device before it fully fails.</p>
<p>There are tools, such as [Piriform's Speccy] (<a href="https://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank">https://www.piriform.com/speccy</a>) that can tell you what is called the &quot;SMART status&quot; of your storage devices. Basically, SMART is a system that makes your storage device self aware of it's own health. If it's not &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Verified&quot; or some other synonym of the word &quot;Good&quot;, then something is wrong with the device and you should back up your data before it inevitably fails.</p>

<p>My argument: consider a drop having slidden to the tip of the stalactite. The (constant) air flow pushes it away with some force, causing it to be in a position that is slightly off from the place it would be without wind. The offset only depends on the strenght of the wind, so this offset is constant. This means the stalactite grows straight, from a constant angle (as opposed to curved).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our sensation of being cold (or hot) is strongly affected by the rate at which we exchange heat with the environment. When we're wet, the water is almost always colder than the 37 C of our body. That means that heat flows from our body into the water on our skin. And since water has a considerably higher heat conductivity than air, the body loses heat more rapidly when it's covered in water.</p>
<p>Next, the water will evaporate, which lowers the average temperature of the water that remains, causing further heat flow from the body to the water on the skin. Essentially, this is the same as sweating, except that sweating is a beneficial process that the body initiates when it is too hot.</p>
<p>So when we're wet, we lose heat more rapidly than when we're dry. This causes a stronger sensation of feeling cold, even though the water on our skin may be warmer than the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, humans don't really feel absolute temperature but instead you feel heat transfer.  Heat energy coming off you makes you cold, heat energy coming into you makes you hot.  The concept of wind chill and the various &quot;real feel&quot; temperatures from various weather sites are an effort to approximate heat transfer rates as temperatures (I.e. a wind chill of 15 F is the same heat transfer rate as an actual temperature of 15 F with no wind.)</p>
<p>What happens when you are wet is that you are suddenly able to transfer heat to your exterior much more rapidly.  The transfer from you to the water happens via conduction and convection at that point, plus the water has a much higher heat capacity so it can absorb more energy before it warms up.  The result is that even when the water is the same temperature as the air, it pulls more heat away from you making you feel colder.  Evaporation further exaggerates the ability of water to pull heat energy out of your body and further improves the heat transfer rate.</p>
<p>There is an easy demonstration/intuition check you can do at home to help understand that heat transfer concept.  If you put a metal fork in the freezer overnight then take it out the next morning the fork will feel much colder than the air in the freezer.  That isn't because the fork is a different temperature but because air doesn't transfer heat very well but metal does.  Similarly when you open an oven door you are exposing your face to 400+ degree (F) air, you can even safely reach your hand inside to check or move things with no problem.  Compare that to boiling water or steam coming off a pot.  The water is much cooler (212 F) than the oven is, but if you touch it you'll burn your hand almost immediately.</p>
<p>A lot of times people focus on absolute temperature, but in most cases heat transfer matters much more.  Absolute temperature definitely influences that transfer rate, but the material in question and the ambient conditions (flowing water/stagnant air etc) are often more important. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are correct but I feel I can add a bit more...</p>
<p>Air has a lower thermal conductivity than water and is used as an insulator. Insulating materials like styrofoam and fiberglass are mostly air, the material itself is structured to hold pockets of air and prevent it from moving. As you sit still you lose body heat to the air near your skin, but as long as that air is undisturbed it heats up and stays there like an insulating blanket (incidentally this is how blankets, clothing, and hair work: trapping the air warmed by your body so that it stays near your body). When a breeze blows you feel cold because the air near your skin that has been warmed by you is pushed away and colder air then contacts your skin.</p>
<p>Water on the other hand is a relatively good thermal conductor, as you lose body heat to the water near your skin it is conducted away to adjacent water molecules... the heat doesn't stay near your skin to form an insulating blanket like it does with undisturbed air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Two things are essentially drawing heat from your body when you are wet.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evaporative cooling. A few others mentioned it but it's how your AC is cold on the evaporator (clever name), it's why it feels cool outside when it's raining, and it's one of the benefits of sweating. When a substance changes from its liquid state to a gas, it absorbs energy around it, typically this is thermal energy.</p>
</li>
<li>Water is a much more efficient means of transferring heat from/to your body than air. This is why you can put your hand in a 212 degree oven briefly and be ok, but if you put your hand in 212 degree water, you will be burned. The reverse is also true. In most instances where a person is wet (rain, swimming, etc) the water temperature is less than our own body temperature. Typically we lose body heat to the air, which is inefficient, now we cover our skin in water and boom, the heat loss is more efficient and we feel cold because we are literally colder on the outside.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of evaporative cooling. When substance changes phase from a liquid to a vapor - it takes quite a bit of energy to get a low energy state(liquid) to a high energy state(vapor). When you have water on your skin and this water evaporates it takes that energy from your skin causing the skin to lose energy and become colder. If the water on your skin does not vaporize, you do not have this cooling effect. This is primarily why people always say that they prefer &quot;dry heat&quot; to &quot;hot and humid&quot;. In a humid environment, the air is already saturated with water vapor and cannot take much more water into it so water on the skin doesn't vaporize easily, leaving you hot. In a dry heat, however, water vaporizes easily which means this cooling effect of evaporative cooling can be used to keep you cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Reading it out loud in English feels  shorter when you replace the the &quot;twenty&quot; or two - zero with 2k because 1000 is socialized to be shortened by simply the letter k. In a sense because we're so used to seeing it it spreads and provides a &quot;easier read&quot; in our minds.

<p>The reason is that, as you see from the other comments, there are many different ways to understand loss. One way the law deals with this is by choosing the idea of loss that fits the blameworthiness of the wrong doer. For example, someone accidentally knocks over and breaks a glass figurine, they are likely to pay only replacement costs. Whereas if that same person purposely broke or stole the figurine, their worse behavior would allow for a greater recovery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a GameStop employee of 9 years, let me throw in my 2 cents...</p>
<p>We are particularly careful of theft of new games and systems.  This is because there is not much profit in the sale of those items.  For instance, a $60 new game costs the company $55 to buy, netting them a $5 profit (these numbers fluctuate between games, but generally this is the largest profit margin).  This means they have fronted all that money.  Now, when a new game is stolen, we are at a loss of that $55 of fronted money.  To make that back, we must now sell 11 copies of the game to generate $55 ($5 of profit per game).  </p>
<p>Systems are even worse.  A $400 console generally costs the company around $390 &quot;wholesale&quot;.  That means there is a $10 profit per console sold (of course the market here is to put consoles in the hands of customers, thus enabling them to buy games, controllers, etc.).  However, when a new console is stolen, we must then make up that $390 of fronted money... meaning we must sell 39 consoles just to break even ($10 profit per console sale x 39 consoles = $390).  It can take all month or more to make up for the theft of a console.</p>
<p>However, on the other side, used sales have much larger profit margins to keep the company afloat.  They may buy a PS3  off a customer for $40, and resell it for $120.  That's a 300% profit margin.  Due to this, theft of used merchandise is not as big of a deal.  In fact, I specifically remember one year around Christmas, our District Manager told us to take all of our used console boxes and put them by the door.  The idea behind this was that with them being right in their face, more people were likely to pick one up, have it physically in their hands, and thus be more likely to buy it.  I argued that putting them right by the door was just asking for theft.  The DM told me he would rather every console be stolen than miss out on this opportunity.  We ended up getting like 5 consoles stolen, but we easily doubled and possibly tripled our Used Console sales.  At that +300% margin, the bonus sales more than made up for what I deemed &quot;acceptable theft&quot;.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, it's usually based on what the company has invested in the product, not potential sale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a psychiatrist and suicidologist, unfortunately I am on my mobile and cannot provide citations easily.  </p>
<p>The short answer on the whole population level is not significantly, but the longer answer is rather complicated. </p>
<p>First of all, very few people with depression is by suicide.  Overall, the rate of suicide in the Western world is generally 11 per 100000 per year. Having depression increases your risk of suicide by 3 to 5 times.  Therefore, we can translate those rates into 33 to 55 per 100000 per year.  Being depressed includes suicidal thinking as part of the illness, but it is not a common outcome to die by suicide.</p>
<p>Second, there are multiple risk factors for suicide. Depression is but one.  Family history, substance use, social circumstances, marital status, stress at work, resilience, etc... These are all factors of suicide risk, and are not changed.</p>
<p>Third, having depression doesn't mean you have taken antidepressants.  There is still a strong anti medication stigma put out there, and many people with depression are not compliant to their treatments (therapy or medication).  I sit on a coroner review panel in my province and review suicide analysis regularly.  A small percentage of depressed people who died by suicide (which is a subgroup of those who died by suicide) actually have detectable levels of antidepressants in their blood on autopsy.</p>
<p>Fourth, the effect size of antidepressants is good (0.45 to 0.8), but is not large enough to significantly statistically alter population levels of suicide.</p>
<p>Overall, the risk of suicidality on antidepressants (0.87% people get suicidal thoughts in the first two weeks under the age of 24, but let me tell you that the evidence for this is way shakier than most are aware) is much less than the risk of suicidality with depression and NOT on antidepressants, and the &quot;number needed to treat&quot; to effectively treat a depression is about 5 to 9.</p>
<p>On individual studies, taking an SSRI significantly increases the length of time one goes without suicidal thinking, and is an effective treatment for depression (equal to therapy and superior when both are combined), and I would guess likely does reduce suicidality overall in the group of those who take them.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people keep mentioning that depressed people starting medication have increased rates of suicidality (maybe now due to having energy for actions - I believe a claim made by industry). However, it is important to remember that healthy adults also have this trend. It is possible that anti-depressants just have this side effect. Anti-depressents are still considered one of the most effective treatments with people who have severe depression. But I would think of this side effect as something unfortunate that could happen with medication for a serious disease.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like surely mathematicians have discovered just about everything we can do with math by now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heavens, no!</p>
<p>What you learn in school as mathematics is actually just a small <em>subset</em> (and many say a very <em>boring</em> subset) of what mathematics is generally.  There are branches of mathematics that deal with things like studying the properties of prime numbers (which is <em>one</em> element of a field called number theory, and is studied from a variety of different perspectives), or with understanding the behavior and structure of surfaces as you stretch or fold or manipulate them (part of topology), or with understanding how the solutions to certain polynomial equations can lead to beautiful links between geometry and algebra and even topology (one aspect of algebraic geometry), or with understanding arrangement of objects that meet certain requirements of symmetry (design theory, which is a subfield of combinatorics).</p>
<p>In each of these fields, there are plenty of open questions.  Some of them are technical and intricate-- you would need some serious background to understand the question itself.  But some of the questions are easy to understand, but still a real <em>bitch</em> to answer.</p>
<p>For instance, there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="_blank">Collatz Conjecture</a>, which is straightforward enough as a problem (do all positive integers eventually settle into the 4-2-1 pattern?).  We don't have a solution for the problem, and our toolkit for going after this sort of problem isn't very well-developed.  It's likely to remain an open problem for a while.</p>
<p>Trick is, mathematics is the study of relationships and interconnections of ideas.  Those ideas are often very carefully defined, but that care and precision allows mathematicians to bring a variety of tools to bear on those ideas.</p>
<p>And ideas are... well, ideas are everywhere.  Somebody wondered what would happen if you brought mathematical ideas to bear on the Rubik's cube.  Or Sudoku.  At a big math conference this year, somebody discussed what could happen if you put the game &quot;Flow Free&quot; onto a different shape, like a ball or a donut.  Mathematicians looking at quantum physics said, &quot;Hey, that looks like the symmetric group!&quot; and helped build models for the behavior of particles at a ridiculously small scale.  There have been mathematical tools developed to measure gerrymandering.  Somebody looked at data science and data analysis, and realized that some of the problems looked a lot like topological problems-- and so there is a field called &quot;topological data analysis&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is preventing this end point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say the fact that mathematics has an infinite number of questions to ask, and at least SOME of those questions will always be interesting to SOMEBODY.  Fermat's Last Theorem captured the imaginations of mathematicians for CENTURIES-- which is all to the good, because many of the failed attempts led to interesting new tools, or to related questions.  Even in &quot;failure&quot;, mathematics often advances itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first question to ask is: what do any academics do, especially in STEM? What is left to discover? We can look at physics. If Newton's view of physics was right, research would largely have died out long ago. But the universe is much stranger than we thought. Relativity, Quantum Theory, Exotic Particles, etc. There's so much going on that we have open questions left for many future lifetimes. And how about biology? Well, if it was all about balancing the four humors, we wouldn't have quite so many people in labcoats. But even just human biology is a tremendous biochemical and genetic mess that we are just starting to de-tangle. So it probably doesn't seem too strange that professional biologists exist.</p>
<p>One reason you might think that all math has been discovered is that you haven't been acquainted with how large and strange the mathematical universe is. Mathematical models are, and have been, used to describe physical phenomenon from the complex rippling of waves to the folding of proteins and the stochastic behavior of the stock market. Deep mathematical ideas are needed to talk about relativity and quantum mechanics and string theory and to help find structure in the genetic code. Computer encryption uses mathematics, so there must be some part of mathematics that deals with how to conceal and recover information. Modern machine learning relies on increasingly sophisticated paradigms of statistical inference. In a certain sense (with some important caveats), mathematics needs to be at least as complicated as any of its applications.</p>
<p>Behind (beneath?) these applications is so-called pure mathematics. The distinction is fuzzy near the boundary but not entirely arbitrary. There are mathematicians that try to understand the nature of logical and mathematical systems: can everything proven be true? can our axioms describe everything of interest? There are mathematicians that try to understand how to compare and quantify knots. There are mathematicians that try to study how complex multi-dimensional signals can be decomposed into various sorts of basic waves. There are mathematicians trying to build a 'multiverse' of geometries in which different shapes can be compared and moved between. There are mathematicians who try to find fast algorithms to find routes on complex networks.</p>
<p>The key word in all these examples is &quot;trying&quot;. As mathematicians, we are foraying into the unknown. We don't know what will work and what will fail. We remain largely ignorant of the important questions to ask. It often turns out that we were studying something from the wrong perspective, making it unnecessarily difficult. And more often than not, every time we get an answer it gives us just enough insight to realize how peculiar and strange it all is, and sends us down yet another rabbit hole. We're currently far below the surface of the earth, moving between massive caverns by way of increasingly narrow tunnels. Please send help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is an example of what an applied mathematician might be doing:</p>
<p>A widely studied (yet still not completely understood) phenomenon is fluid turbulence.</p>
<p>When you look at the smoke coming from a fire, and you see all the swirls in the smoke, you are observing turbulence. When you are on an airplane, and suddenly the plane starts shaking, you are experiencing turbulence. Given how common fluids are in the world, understanding how turbulence behaves is super important.</p>
<p>We would like to be able to explain how turbulence behaves using mathematics. The reason we are using mathematics, is because mathematics is the tool that physicists and engineers use to do what they do. </p>
<p>Think about how you can use mathematics to calculate how long it takes for a ball to fall from a tall building. The same is true for using mathematics to explain how turbulence behaves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, trying to characterize turbulence, and trying to predict how it behaves using mathematics is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>It's so difficult, that there hundreds of mathematicians and scientists all over the world studying it, and working out the mathematics needed to fully describe turbulence.</p>
<p>You need complicated mathematics to be able to calculate things like how a fluid flows around objects, or how objects moving through fluids are affected. </p>
<p>At some point (not too far ahead though, unfortunately), the mathematics needed just hasn't been developed yet.</p>
<p>You need mathematicians to come up with ideas, and to work out these ideas, to make sure that these ideas are indeed correct. They spend a lot of time proving things, because they want to be sure that what they are discovering is correct.</p>
<p>This field has been around for a few hundred years now, and there is still a lot more to learn.</p>
<p>I hope that helped. Although my example was for applied mathematicians (mathematicians whose work directly relates to real world applications), pure mathematicians do a similar thing, except their work is more abstract.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Capsaicin has been shown to do this experimentally (though the only study I found was when it was given intravenously, rather than inhaled, though the effect was still on pulmonary irritant receptors). Next time you have a stuffy nose, try sniffing it in front of a mirror and see if your nose flares slightly.</p>
<p>The additional mucous production is likely counterproductive to decongestion, but is effective in trapping and expelling unwanted irritants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
