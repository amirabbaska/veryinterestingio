		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a complete HM(using this abbreviation bc I hate spelling it) is caused by an empty ovum fusing with either 2 different sperm or with 1 sperm that duplicates= 46XX or 46 XY. Basically, only the father's chromosomes are in there. In a complete HM p57 is absent due to the fact that it is maternally transcribed and paternally imprinted. There is NO fetal tissue in a complete HM because the complete HM was caused by abnormal fertilization of an empty ovum. </p>
<p>A partial HM is different. It is 69 XXX or XXY or XYY since it is a normal egg fertilization with 2 sperm. Partial HMs do have fetal tissue (uncleared RBCs for example) because the mother's related genes are allowed to be expressed since the ovum is normal and carries a normal amount of chromosomes. </p>
<p><del>I'll look in my notes for the exact protein names but</del> the way I remember it, there is a protein that must be expressed for fetal tissue to form (p57KIP2 gene), and that protein is expressed only by the mother's gametes. Then there is a protein that is responsible for growth of the placenta(maybe... Some non-fetal tissue but I can't seem to find it in my old notes so far) which is expressed by the fathers gametes.</p>
<p>A normal zygote has a balance between the maternal push for fetal tissue formation and the paternal influence for development of the supporting structures. In a complete HM, there is no fetal tissue formation bc egg is empty and the relevant genes therefore can't be expressed. In a partial mole, the egg is normal so the genes are expressed but the balance is off since there is an entire extra sperm of DNA, so you get some fetal tissue formation but it's all disordered and jacked up. </p>
<p>This is just a medical student's basic understanding of this. I'm sure there is much more below the surface that contributes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing yourself by focusing on Hox, given that Hox is more important in segmentation than in organ identity. </p>
<p>What's really important is the nature of epithelial-mesenchymal signaling and invasion processes that are associated with placentation. Some of this is probably regulated or mediated by dysfunction in basic cell-cell signaling pathways like Notch-Delta.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell differentiation has various stages. Before HOX genes, before notch or wingless, before maternal RNA signaling, even before gastrulation and the formation of a trilaminar fetal structure, a fertilized embryo must undergo healthy trophoblastic formation. The trophoblasts form the connection between the uterine villous tissue and the embryoblast. Molar pregnancies are a subset of Gestational Trophoblastic diseases, therein lies the pathophysiology of moles. Normal cell signaling doesn't really kick in until after the morula/implantation phase. </p>
<p>Molar pregnancies result from a single sperm fertilizing an anuclear ovum (80% of cases) or two sperm fertilizing a normal ovum (almost the rest of cases). In the first case, the sperm's haploid genome will duplicate itself before mitosis to result in 46 XX (46 YY is lethal). The second case will result in 69 XXX, XXY, or XYY. Because of the loss of balance and what has to be a very screwed up collection of epigenetics, mitosis becomes severely unbalanced. The conditions required for cell signaling to produce healthy, differentiated tissue never exist in the first place. The &quot;give and take&quot; that needs to occur between uterine decidual tissue and fetal tissue doesn't occur and and the chorionic villi proliferate like crazy in a very cancerous sort of way. </p>
<p>So the ultimate etiology lies mostly in bad eggs that either form without maternal DNA (bad meiosis) or eggs that allow two swimmers in before crystalizing. </p>
<p>(Feel free to clarify parts that I explained poorly or inaccurately. I'm distracted and typing on my phone.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, differentiation of stem cells (like wound healing and cancer) is a chromatin remodeling process at DNA. It's not screwed up and chaotic; it's orchastrated. What happens here is that just after fertilization the recombinant DNA is not viable, so what would normally be a highly specific mechanistic cascade dead ends at abnormal placental growth, sometimes with no fetal development at all (thus, no activated hox) or with just partial fetal development (where inadequate signaling factors don't activate the important fetal development genes like hox). Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keeping cash reserves is totally normal and expected for many companies as a way to help diminish risk.  What if something happens and you need money? Well you've got it</p>
<p>Apple is particularly unique though -- because the amount of cash reserves they have is wildly high, absurdly so for their type of business and industry.</p>
<p>While Apple won't discuss why they do it, except in broad and generic terms, financial analysts have several ideas, of which may or may not be true, but are potential reasons, and all can be true to a degree. Such as:</p>
<p>A) Apple wants to do some large scale, primarily cash acquisitions of other companies (buying CBS, Disney, or Netflix have all been discussed).</p>
<p>B) The money isn't readily available to spend, that is its behind some complicated tax laws and such and may not be easily accessible, as such, it its highest value is to be as reserves, as if they tried to spend it, the value would decrease.</p>
<p>C) Apple is saving up for future products, sitting on the money for investments later, right now things are good, but if they need to smash, fast, new production of something new, the cash will heavily heavily lower the time needed to create a new high-quality product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taxes. The main reason they have a bunch of money outside the country is that it's too darn expensive to bring it back to the country. The money is sitting in piggy banks in other countries where the government's do not ask for too much in the form of income taxes. Sure, they could bring that cash back to the here  (called repatriation), but then they would have to pay income tax on that money, which is effectively 35% on amounts that large. </p>
<p>So they have a choice: keep the money wherever it currently is, or bring it home and pay $83 billion in taxes (ignoring all the extra tax planning they could do). </p>
<p>Yes, the other comments about diminishing risk and not having projects to invest in are probably true to a certain degree, but tax is the main reason. I think I recall in 2016 Apple raised debt in the US to finance expansion. Why do this when they have $246 billion overseas? Taxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well looking at Apple's stats on Wikipedia, their revenue, total amount of money coming in, in 2015 was about 215 billion, and their net income, the profit on that was 45 billion.  That implies their operating costs for a year were give or take 170 billion.  They own assets, property of some sort, worth around 320 billion, and the equity they have, the value of those assets minus any liabilities like paying back a loan type obligations or tax burdens or just outstanding debts for things they bought &quot;accounts payable&quot; or salary obligations or warranties (because a warranty is a contract that exists and if the warranty is called in they need to have money), is 128 billion.  So that means their liabilities are around 200 billion (obviously they're not all needing to be paid next year, or right now or whenever but they exist).   </p>
<p>So having 240 billion in cash reserves is pretty reasonable, they have a ton of operating expenses, it protects them from having a really bad year or two. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's true that waking up in the middle of your sleep cycle will make you feel groggy, but that really isn't the whole story, and as someone has already pointed out, doesn't explain grogginess at the end of the sleep cycle. And it happens every time you are woken up from deep sleep, not just when you've overslept. </p>
<p>What's going on when you oversleep: throwing in an extra sleep cycle or two messes up your circadian rhythm, so your body has to spend a lot of resources trying to sync everything up again. That can make you feel kind of out of sorts or grumpy. There is also evidence that oversleeping messes up hormones and neurotransmitters, which also makes you feel groggy, as they also follow your circadian rhythm and are now out of sorts.</p>
<p>Also: going without food or water for an extra hour doesn't explain what happens. If you are dehydrated to the point of confusion, that is a medical emergency. Humans aren't delicate flowers. There is evidence that not drinking coffee as early as your body expects it can throw you off. It's part of a phenomenon called &quot;weekend headache.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you're sleeping outside of your normal pattern, your body doesn't know how to plan the cycles.  So you actually wake up more tired than you would have if you had woken up earlier.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, try to plan for ~90 minute intervals for sleep per cycle.  So 7.5 hours of sleep would be more likely to have you waking up at the &quot;right&quot; time.  9 would be good as well.  8.25 is probably gonna leave you groggy, as would 10.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A scientifically semi-rigorous explanation I've heard before - and this is mostly just expanding on what others have said about hormones getting out of sorts - is about cortisol, a hormone that, simply speaking, makes you alert (like adrenaline but it works more slowly). It's released when you experience stress, and consistently high levels of it, i.e. chronic stress, are bad for you. Natural spikes of it are ok, though. Indeed one such spike normally makes you wake up in the morning, after which cortisol levels decrease over the course of the day (with stressful events triggering more spikes).</p>
<p>Now if you sleep through that morning spike, or if you wake up and then go back to sleep, you will naturally have less of this waking-up hormone to help you wake up later. Also explains why chronic stress can mess up your biorhythm, why is difficult to wake up or fall asleep ahead of your usual rhythm, why depressive ruminating makes it harder to go (back) to sleep, and why being startled (say, hearing a loud and/ or worrying noise in the middle of the night) can wake you up fully and quickly, and again make it difficult to go back to sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, this question will only garner speculative answers as no one knows. Animals usually have mating seasons so that when the offspring's born it will have an abundant supply of nourishment (either directly or indirectly, e.g feeding off the milk the mother sustains through feeding). For example, elk and deer have their mating season during the autumn months and give birth around spring time when plants begin to grow. This leads to good foraging opportunities for the mother to nourish her young as well as there still being enough plants for the calf to start feeding on during weaning.</p>
<p>It has been theorized that humans don't require this sort of &quot;offspring timing&quot; to coincide with food availability because we <strong>always</strong> have food available. However, most infants are born in the summer months. If this is some remnant of a mating season to give birth around the wet season in Africa, I'm skeptical of, but who knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two answers I've heard that seem worthwhile. The first is that at some time during the evolution of humans, reproduction-based sexual interaction was &quot;co-opted&quot; for a more sophisticated level of bonding between individuals. Sex becomes a kind of language of connection and a supplemental form of communication/reaffirmation.</p>
<p>A second idea I've heard (which is not at all mutually exclusive with the first) is that because female-dispersal was more typical during most of human evolution, creating instant sexual bonds was a useful tool for a young woman to have when entering a new community. Instead of waiting a month or several months, and potentially having to deal with male aggression and an uncertain position within a community hierarchy, a woman could potentially enter into sexual relationship with a man in the group, cementing her place socially, and pre-empting the stress of dealing with the (potentially aggressive) interest of multiple men.</p>
<p>Sloth-edit: Totally forgot to mention what u/mmm3says wrote about &quot;timing of conception is vague&quot;. I think that's another important piece of the puzzle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Bonobo chimps are even like us - constantly in a state of being physically receptive to potential sexual activity, regardless if conception is likely on any given day of the cycle. </p>
<p>Goodall noted that high-ranked males would &quot;sequester&quot; the high-ranked females to get exclusive reproductive rights. </p>
<p>Goodall also noted that all males of a Troop would (nominally, generally) help protect the young from predators, generally ALL mature males had mated with all mature females, and were ALL potential fathers. </p>
<p>Further reading about Bonobo chimps suggests sex is a social bonding experience.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Monkeys are social animals who like sex &amp; power hierarchies &amp; many primatologists/anthropologists seek to gain insight of our own sexuality through these genetic relatives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human breeding and sexuality are atypical as far as animal species go.  There must be evolutionary benefits to this that have outweighed those a seasonal breeding season (which in addition to timing and weather has impact on predation)
A couple of benefits to this behavior:</p>
<p>1) Humans, unlike most animals, have sex for pleasure without respect for season. (I'm though I heard females orgasming is rare or even unique to us, and makes sense as far as it encourages mating behaviors)   Men just don't stop by for some action for some month once a year.  This  has huge social and societal impact.
Closer and longer lasting intimate relationships with males and females.  A man would be less likely to stay with one woman and participate in childrearing if mating was a seasonal thing.  This allows females both a wider selection of mating partners</p>
<p>2) Because human estrus is not obvious, timing of conception is vague.  This creates opportunity for more ambiguity as far as who fathered a particular child.  This allows females both a wider selection of mating partners, and knowing her body better, to arrange conception with mate of her choice.  This uncertainty gives a woman the potential to secure child-rearing resources from a man who is not the child's biological father.  This give a man the potential to father a child and have some other guy raise it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We didn't evolve to have a mating season is the best answer when asked &quot;why?&quot; about anything that didn't happen in evolution. It just means there was no reason or pressure for us to need to keep mating to a short time period. It could be something to do with our long life spans, the incredible time and energy that goes into your children, or how long it takes from conception to birth being a long time compared to many animals.</p>
<p>It could be said that being able to reproduce at anytime is advantageous to reproduction, which means the better question is why other animals have mating seasons at all, and that will change depending on the animal I suppose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bricking generally means making completely unusable at the hardware level.  The reason that computers rarely get bricked is that we RARELY do any manipulation of the computer at the hardware level.  To brick a computer, you would need to break the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) which pretty much no one non-techy messes with.  If you break windows, you can still reinstall windows. If you break the BIOS, you can hose things pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The other aspect is that even with the BIOS, I can't think of ANYONE who would be messing around with the BIOS without using the official manufacturer's files.  Most of the time you're messing with phones, you are doing so with custom firmware/ROM's, which means something made by someone other than the manufacturer.  If you're flashing your BIOS, you're almost always going to be doing it with something provided (and quality controlled, tested, etc) by the company who made the product.</p>
<p>So it comes down to two factors: </p>
<p>1) for computers, you generally don't tinker at such a deep level that you're going to risk bricking it</p>
<p>2) Even if you are messing at that level, you're not doing anything that is not officially approved of by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The final aspect is the fact that it's relatively easy to replace a computer (especially a desktop) part.  If something in your phone breaks, 90% of us are just going to give up because it's so hard to replace.  Most of the stuff that's likely to go bad is also easily replaced/substituted.  I fried my sound card on one of my desktops a few months back, and for $10 I just plugged in a new sound card.  If I killed the speaker on my phone, I'd say fuck it and just buy a new phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PCs are built with openness in mind. Meaning on a PC you can install different OSs, boot from different media, install different hardware and so on. It's all under the users control and if you screw things up, you just boot from a USB stick or DVD and recover easily. PCs are meant to be tinkered with and handle accidents well. Even for accidents in the mids of a BIOS upgrade many mainboards have ways to recover from that.</p>
<p>Phones, tablets and game consoles are the complete opposite, they are locked down so that the user has little to no control about what is going on. Meaning a lot of tinkering has to happen in areas that the manufacturer didn't intent to be tinkered with or actively tried to prevent tinkering in. This means the tinkerer is walking a minefield and any error might put the device into an unrecoverable state.</p>
<p>All of this is not an accident, but by design. If manufacturers wanted to, they could make phones as easy to recover as a PC by letting the user boot from SDcard or access the internal flash storage via USB. Case in point, many bricked PSP could be recovered after people found out that booting from the memory card was possible via a modified battery. The feature was there all along, but not documented by Sony to prevent hacking.</p>
<p>Another issue is that even if the device allows you to recover, you would still need the data to put on the device to recover it. On a PC you have Windows install discs, Linux distributions and all that readily available to reinstall on a blank device. Getting the OS image for your phone might not be that easy.</p>
<p>To make things further more complicated, the ecosystem around those devices is not standardized and discoverable, which makes it hard to create software that works across different devices. A Linux distribution will work on essentially any PC, but you can't make a Linux distribution that will work as easily on every phone as all the hardware around ARM varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually can brick a computer if you manage to turn it off during a bios update for example. Android has something similiar to computers bios, called OEM bootloader. It is being run before the operating system, just like bios in computer. The thing is, if you want to replace the operating system in your computer, you do not need to replace or do anything at all with your bios. Bios by default allows you to boot from usb or cd/dvd and so you can judt install the OS freely. This is not true for android, most android  phones are OEM locked, and their modloader often also disables ability to access recovery mode, which allows you to flash custom OS, just like booting in your computer. Here is the key part, you as an user, have by default full access to your computer as an administrator (you can install whatever program you want, do whatever you want with your pc, you can even overclock your processor), but for your phone you do not have administrator rights , so you are limited to the OS ans settings set to you by the company . To bypass this and gain full control of your phone, you need to do something called rooting a phone. Rooting can be dangerous as it most of the time takes replacing the bootloader. If you fail to replace the bootloader properly, you brick your phone, as it is unable to start even the loading process before OS. This is a hard brick. Soft brick is when the OS you flashed (installed) is broken and the bootloader can not load it, you can still just flash another. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned you can brick a motherboard if you try hard enough. When I was a kid, I flashed a BIOS upgrade onto my dads machine, except I accidentally flashed the file for almost the same version (think XXXXX+ vs XXXXX Pro or similar) - and it totally let it flash, and upon rebooting, the machine was dead.</p>
<p>So I panicked, because like, it's my dads PC right and he's not going to understand what I was trying to do, he's just going to be mad. And I can't afford to buy a device to reflash the chip, nor did I have any idea how to make one, at the time.</p>
<p>But then I remembered my machine had the exact same motherboard, and took a look and, yay, the chip was removable. So I ask a bunch of random people on IRC if it would be sane/possible to boot my machine, get it all ready to flash the correct firmware, then while the machine is on, pull out the BIOS chip and replace it with the dead one, and flash it from the system that's already booted. This seemed to make sense to me, but they all told me it was stupid and would break the other one. (I've since found out that, obviously, I did not invent this idea, but hey I was really young, when you're young you came up with everything first)</p>
<p>Desperate kids will do anything an adult tells them not too, though, so I did it anyway and it worked. Didn't get hit with a belt that day! :&gt;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>O2 is twice as hard to detect compared to H2O</p>

<p>chlorophyll will be 6 times more difficult to detect compared to O2.  Factors like cloud cover on the exoplanet factor heavily into this.</p>

<p>very little, if any, muscle in the feet.

</li>
<li>
<p>keeping them tucked under their warmer skin</p>
</li>
<li>counter-current heat exchange: veins and arteries are organized closely together in a way that allows the blood leaving the warm heart to run near the colder blood from the feet before it actually reaches the feet. Benefit is that it warms the colder blood before it reaches the main body and the warm blood loses its initial heat to other blood instead of ice/air. <a href="https://teamatlantic.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ducks-heat-exchange.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>, credit to u/wildflower8872 from a similar thread years ago</li>

<p>I actually asked one of my nursing professors this question too, in a joking fashion because I told him I've always wondered about it since I was a kid, and why penguins didn't melt through the ice.</p>
<p>He went on to tell me an amazing explanation as to why a penguin's foot is like a human testicle. In human biology the testicles sit outside of the body so that sperm can be produced because at a internal temperature of 98.6 degrees they cannot produce sperm. However sitting outside the body exposure to colder air can also decrease the Bloods temperature enough that when entering back into the body it could cause a person to go into shock. So in the human testicle there exists a cross current system where the artery coming out of the body into the testicles passes by the vein that returns back in thus cooling the internal hot arterial blood when it comes out, and warming back up the cold venous blood when it goes back into the body.</p>
<p>The same exact cross-current system exists in a penguin's foot so that the arterial blpod can be cooled down to a temperature that the feet can not melt through the ice and then warmed back up on its way in so it doesn't cause Penguins to go into shock.</p>
<p>And that my friends is why a penguin's foot is like a testicle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Penguins, arctic foxes, and others don't have this issue, because they have counter current exchange systems in place, in which the returning blood is re-warmed by the oxygenated blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Part of the answer has a biochemical explantation.
A binding of oxygen to haemoglobin is normally a strongly exothermic reaction: an amount of heat (DH) is released as the molecules attach. The same amount of heat is usually absorbed in the reverse reaction. However, as oxygenation and deoxygenation occur in different parts of the organism, changes in molecular environment (e.g.: acidity) can result in heat loss or heat gain in the process.
With regards to cold peripheral tissues like the feet, DH is much smaller than humans.  This has 2 benefits. Heat is absorbed by the birds' haemoglobin when it's deoxygenated. The second is a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics. In any reversible reaction (e.g.: absorb/release of oxygen by haemoglobin) a low temperature encourages the reaction in the exothermic direction. So at low temps, oxygen is absorbed more strongly by most species' haemoglobin, and released less easily. A modest DH means that in cold tissue the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin doesn't become so high that the oxygen cannot disassociate.</p>
<p>2 mechanisms are at work; penguins can control the rate of blood flow to the feet by varying the diameter of arterial vessels supplying the blood. They also have 'counter-current exchangers' at the top of the legs. Heat flows from warm to cold blood, so little of it is carried down to the feet.
In winter, their feet are held a degree or two above freezing - to minimise heat loss, whilst avoiding frostbite. (Ducks &amp; geese are similar, but if held indoors for weeks in warm conditions and then released, their feet may freeze, because their physiology has adapted to warmth which causes blood flow to be virtually cut off and their foot temp falls below freezing)</p>
<p>Tldr; they've adapted to the cold and can lessen blood supply to the feet. They also  hold their feet at a steady temp, a degree or two above freezing.
Less heat is absorbed by the birds haemoglobin when it's deoxygenated. The low temperatures encourage an even more exothermic reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you watch a real chef, you'll see they are very careful about what they touch.  They're not going to rub their nose/face and not wash their hands.  If they touch something that would contaminate something else (raw chicken for instance) they'll immediately wash their hands before they do anything else.</p>
<p>Gloves block your the transfer from stuff on your hands to things you touch, and vice versa, no more.  If you wear gloves and handle raw meat, or money, or any of the other unhygenic things and never change your gloves you're actually more of a problem.</p>
<p>But for some reason, there seems to be this belief that gloves are a panacea for anything unsanitary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have my food handlers managers license. In my course we actually did a demonstration that showed the amount of germs that you can trap underneath the gloves. Most health inspectors prefer that you do not use gloves as they trap germs, foster a lovely moist warm environment for bacteria to flourish in, and use of gloves actually discourages hand washing.
We wash our hands constantly and mine get dry and they hurt from doing it so much in the winter. But you are better off that way, promise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole built from antimatter or one built from matter with the same mass are identical.</p>
<p>The quantity that distinguishes matter from antimatter is the baryon number. It is the total number of baryons (like protons and neutrons) minus the number of antibaryons. Baryon number is conserved in the standard model and that is what you would recognize as &quot;conservation of matter&quot; in some sense, and the reason for which the proton is stable in the SM: it is the lightest baryon and so it cannot decay to anything else because it needs to preserve its baryon number of +1. So the proton can only release its mass in energy for lighter particles if it meets an antibaryon carrying -1 baryon number, so they total to 0 and they can produce lighter non-baryon particles such as photons or mesons. That's why matter &amp; antimatter annihilate.</p>
<p>(A similar argument works with leptons, with a thing called lepton number).</p>
<p>These, baryon and lepton #, however, are not conservation laws with any specific deep or fundamental justification behind, they are just accidental symmetries of the standard model. (Unlike, for example, charge). As soon as you step out of the SM, these are violated. Black holes are well outside the SM and do not care in the slightest about baryon number. Black holes don't have a well-defined baryon number and throwing a proton or an anti-proton* into a black hole produces the same final black hole, whose only macroscopic distinguishing properties are mass, charge and angular momentum. After a lot of time the black hole has evaporated into Hawking radiation which is made of standard model particles, and the final baryon number of the radiation does not have any discernible relation with the baryon number of all the stuff that fell in. </p>
<p>* woops forgot: except for charge, charge is conserved even by BHs. So maybe you can throw a hydrogen atom (baryon # 1, charge 0) or an anti-hydrogen atom (baryon # -1, charge 0). Or neutron/antineutron.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A black hole can be considered to be two separate things, one a phenomenon of matter, one a phenomenon of space-time.</p>
<p>A black hole is formed from a very high-density collection of mass. Typically this is something like a collapsing neutron star or stellar core. The composition of the matter inside the black hole after the formation of the event horizon is a very complicated question, and something that theorists still haven't decided on completely.</p>
<p>However, the nature of the black hole to the rest of the Universe is very much different. From the outside the black hole is no longer a phenomenon of matter, it's primarily a phenomenon of space-time. What's &quot;inside&quot; the black hole is almost entirely irrelevant to the rest of the Universe. This is because there is no way for the matter trapped inside a black hole to influence the rest of the Universe, except gravitationally (and electrostatically if you want to get technical).</p>
<p>Many people have a fundamentally classical idea of how a black hole works. Generally something along the lines of an object with an escape velocity higher than light, so that even light can't escape from the black hole. This ignores the fundamental nature of black holes, however, which is closely tied into relativity and the behavior of space-time. Within a black hole's event horizon there is simply &quot;no way out&quot;. The event horizon is a one way door, once you pass it there are no space-time trajectories that go forward in time which leave the black hole (in fact, that do anything other than eventually travel to the singularity). This is important to understand because it recasts a black hole from a weird phenomenon related to light somehow to a phenomenon that directly affects the nature of, well, the fabric of reality. A black hole is like a little pocket Universe with no way out.</p>
<p>Once you shift to that conception some of the details of black holes might make sense. For example, whether a black hole is made of matter or anti-matter (or, indeed, entirely of photons) is irrelevant externally. Nothing that happens inside the black hole can escape the event horizon. If, hypothetically, you had one black hole that was formed from a collapsing star and another black hole that was formed from a collapsing anti-star merging them would still necessarily result in just a bigger black hole (mass-energy is just mass-energy). What happens inside the black holes isn't something that can affect the event horizons themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question.
A few things that I'd like to point to which I think might contribute to the discussion.
The relative degree of consonance/dissonance is directly associated with the number of cycles that are required before 2 (or more) notes repeat their pattern. e.g. in a unison it is a 1:1 ratio and so the two notes are considered consonant. Whereas the tritone/A4/D5 is an irrational number which when we use the same criteria takes the biggest number of cycles before resolution/repetition of the pattern compared to other intervals. Some other intervals, depending on the tuning system used, are 5:4 or 3:2 which resolve faster than the tritone and so, are described as consonant. You can complete the mathematics for any chord and this holds up to any cultural ordering of consonance/dissonance that I am aware of.
When comparing the major key to the minor key in western music, we have a set of melodic and harmonic structures that are common to both. What is happening here is that these two keys, while both considered consonant have slightly different variations. They are tied together and comparable largely due to the dominant -&gt; tonic (V-I, whatever you want to call it) which gives us a cadence. When you compare the harmonies found in these two keys and the intervals used to create the melodies, the minor key is slightly more dissonant than the major key. Given this is the case, and making some assumptions that brains all process patterns in a similar way (big assumption, i know) I think we have an argument for a natural predisposition due to slower pattern recognition in the minor key. Perhaps the minor key lends itself to slower tempo so as to allow time for melodies/harmonies to process, this may make the association stronger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
