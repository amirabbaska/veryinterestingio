		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your brain as a space ship and alcohol as a solar storm the ship has to travel through. </p>
<p>As the solar storm intensifies (more alcohol), the ship has to divert power from other components to maintain power on the shield and protect the ship. One of the first changes is that the AI autopilot (smart decision making) gets switched to a basic manual controls (impaired judgement). </p>
<p>As the storm intensifies, the captain decides to disable the flight recorder logs to save power. This means that the current flight data (short term memory) is not stored to the archives (long term memory).</p>
<p>This is what happens when we drink too much alcohol. It's not that we lost memories but the alcohol prevents us from recording them in the first place. Low to medium amounts may result in patches of time when memory is not recorded but heavy drinking can result in whole sections of time where you have no memory of what occurred. Alcohol does not erase memories as you generally remember all the events that occurred before you started drinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol affects a specific receptor in the brain that is responsible for memory formation. When you drink too much, this receptor is unable to work properly and you &quot;black out&quot; because you're brain isn't capable of creating new memories (which is an interesting distinction from creating the memories and later forgetting them).</p>
<p>If you want a slightly less ELI5 answer, in order to create a memory, the NMDA receptors in the hippocampus must be activated. This is accomplished by the presence of the neurotransmitter glutamate coincided with depolarization of the neuron (which itself is usually caused by activation of AMPA receptors which causes flow of sodium ions into the neuron). Activation of the NMDA receptor allows calcium to flow into the neuron, which causes vesicles that contain AMPA receptors to bind to the neuron's outer membrane. This increase in AMPA receptors on the neuron's surface is known as short-term potentiation and is the first step in long-term potentiation (which usually involves neurons creating new connections with one another). Long-term potentiation is what allows us to store memories. Alcohol, however, inhibits the NMDA receptor. In the presence of alcohol calcium cannot enter the neuron and, as such, new memories cannot be formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You might recall some stuff but it seems more like a dream than real, which is why you might ask friends &quot;Did I really...&quot;</p>
<p>Memories are formed in the brain by neurons making new connections. A theory is that alcohol effects how the neurons form connections such that without alcohol the neurons don't connect.</p>
<p>There is a field of study called State-dependent memory. The basic idea is that if you get drunk, when you are sober you won't really remember what happened. But if you get drunk again you will be able to remember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In everyday life, the energy scale you encounter the most is simply temperature. At low temperatures, there is less energy in a system and the fact that systems behave very differently depending on temperature is quite familiar. Eg. below 0 C water is a solid, whereas above, it is a liquid. </p>
<p>Actually, at much higher temperatures, metals also melt. However, it doesn't matter that at 660 C Aluminum melts because at the energy scale we live at, it is a solid.</p>
<p>I think this partly answers your question about the car crash. It's not just a question of total energy, it's a question of energy density. The energy needs to be concentrated in a very small region in order to see a quantum process.</p>
<p>To further understand how energy scales and distances are related, you need a bit of quantum mechanics. If you know anything about so-called 'wave-particle duality' this makes sense. The de Broglie equation relates the wavelength Œª of a particle with its momentum p: Œª=h/p, where h is the Planck constant. So, your wavelength decreases with both your mass and velocity. Associating energy E with momentum E~cp, where c is the speed of light, you find that E~ch/Œª. </p>
<p>So, if you want to see a process that happens only over a very small distance, you need to &quot;see&quot; it with something which has a comparable wavelength, and therefore a very large energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, when physicists talk about a specific energy scale it is because something is expected (or known) to happen at those energies. </p>
<p>For example, the electroweak scale is the characteristic scale of the electroweak part of the standard model. Above this energy scale the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force form an unbroken symmetry of the standard model. Below this scale, the symmetry is broken by the Higgs mechanism, resulting in the weak bosons (W+/- and Z) getting masses that are related to the scale. </p>
<p>Similarly, when we talk about the GUT scale, it is because this is the energy at which we might expect to see all the symmetries of the standard model unite to form one, single grand unified symmetry. The reason people think this might be a possibility is somewhat technical, but essentially all the standard model coupling are &quot;run&quot; with energy, and if you run the couplings up to very high energies, they almost become equal at energies of 10^15GeV. Hence, they might be unified into one force... maybe.</p>
<p>A popular symmetry for this is SU(5), which is the smallest allowed group that contains the standard model forces. In a similar way to the electroweak sector (actually a bit different, but for this example it doesn't matter too much), when we fall below the energy of unification, we would expect to see some massive particle that are consistent with that unification scale.</p>
<p>Similar for the planck scale, but with gravity. </p>
<p>tl;dr: scales in particle physics are usually where we expect something to happen, perhaps unification of forces. Perhaps being able to resolve new particles. Also I like to ramble off topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An energy scale is where something &quot;new&quot; happens or is expected to happen.  In a car crash, the total energy is large, but the energy in each individual interaction is low---on the scale of the chemical interaction, and not on the scale of, say, the nuclear interaction.  The reason the total energy is so high in a car crash is because there's ~ Avogadro's number of particles in a car.  In fact, if nothing catches on fire, the majority of a car crash happens at the scale of material deformation, which is a lower energy scale than the scale required for a chemical reaction---the energy needed for a rearrangement of covalent or ionic bonds.</p>
<p>When the energy in individual interactions becomes larger, then you have to start to wonder: is my theory of physics still valid when those large energies are involved?  This is the question behind the philosophy that leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory" target="_blank">effective field theories</a>.  Here's a great question:  we don't have a unified theory of physics, so how is it that we're able to make <em>any</em> progress <em>at all</em>?!  I mean, we can design bridges and rockets and all SORTS of stuff, and yet we don't have to teach anything about the Higgs boson to engineers.  Why not?  It's because Newton's laws are valid irrespective of what's going on &quot;down there&quot;.  We don't have to teach engineers relativity because the speed of light is ENORMOUS.  If the speed of light were 100 miles per hour, every car company would worry about relativity.</p>
<p>When do we know that we don't have to worry about relativistic effects?  When the velocities involved are much less than the speed of light.  Answers calculated with relativity will differ from answers derived from Newton's laws by a very small amount, as long as v, the velocity of the car (in this example) is much much less than the speed of light.  Newtonian answers are like (v/c)^0, which makes sense because it's independent of c.  The leading corrections to the Newtonian answer go like (v/c)^2.  But even if you incorporate those corrections you still don't have the full relativistic answer.  The next correction is (v/c)^4 and the next is (v/c)^6 and so on.  So you can see that if (v/c) = (speeds relevant to automobiles / speed of light) is small, we have to care less and less about the corrections.  However, you can see that when v/c is not small the successive terms can make a big difference!  If v/c = 0.99, the first correction is of a comparable size to the Newtonian answer.  So are the other corrections.  Even the 50th correction is of a scale (0.99)^100 ~= 0.36---a correction on the scale of 36% of the Newtonian answer!  So if we ignore relativity we're making a BIG mistake, but only if the velocities are large.</p>
<p>When physicists talk about &quot;energy scales&quot; they mean something similar---a scale at which you ought to be suspicious that you're making a mistake, and that you need a new theory to feel comfortable.  Notice that it typically doesn't matter if you change an energy scale by a factor of 2---if you were OK before you're probably still OK.  But if you change it by a factor of 10 or 100, look out!</p>
<p>Moreover, energy scales are often widely separated.  For example, chemistry happens at the eV scale, nuclear physics at the MeV scale (a million times as much energy).  The mass of the proton is 1 GeV, and the mass of the W, Z, and Higgs bosons are ~ 100 GeV (not exactly, but close!).  This is what allows us to formulate an effective theory and to ignore the complication of the whole underlying theory.  At each of those scales our &quot;previous&quot; (lower-energy-scale) description is no longer of any use.  In chemistry we don't talk about pions (which are important to nuclear physics), and to describe nuclear physics we don't worry about the Higgs, and we usually don't have to worry about electrons, either!  Moreover, all of the physics that depend on the same explanation happens roughly at the same scale (for example, the mass of the W is ~ 80 GeV, Z is ~ 91 GeV, Higgs is ~ 125 GeV; another example: most nuclear energy splittings are of the same rough scale).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Since other responses don't seem to be clearly touching this:</p>
<p>If a physicist quotes an energy or energy scale in this context they are talking about single particle energy, or perhaps the collision energy of two particles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To have them mediate the new GUT force, you need to create them, ie collide particles together with enough energy (10^16 GeV) to spawn them, and then let them do their stuff. </p>
<p>It is true that in a car crash, the energy release is orders and orders more than any GeV, but those are over the 10^29 particles per car. Averaged over each particle, its very much less. Even so, the particles never really collide head on with each other, Its mostly the degeneracy force of atoms pushing on each other. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2n8p6a/why_cant_our_bodies_heal_certain_injuries_nerve/cmbv7uy/" target="_blank">This comment</a> does a really good job of explaining it, but it's suuuuper long, so I'll let you go there to read it. Here's the gist, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now here is the interesting one: Nerval tissue. Do nerves regenerate? Yeah, kind of! ... but not everywhere. See, there are two compartments to the nervous system: the central nervous system (all parts of the nervous system that are embedded in bone cavities, i.e. the skull and the vertebral column) and the periphery nervous system (all nerves that exit the central nervous system, i.e. all the nerves in the limbs, the torso and the head outside of the skull). Most nerves are embedded in a substance called myelin - basically like cable insulation, increases the conduction speed. That is not all they can do though: the cells that build the myelin - called glia cells - also nurture and maintain the actual nerve fibers. The periphery and the central nervous system has different kinds of glia cells. Central has a variation like oligodendrocytes and others, periphery has schwann cells. schwann cells are capable of repairing lesions in nerval tissue and grow periphery nerves back together, given that they are still in the same place of course. Central nerves and their glia cells... well, simply put they just dont. Have a damage in your spinal cord or your brain? Tough luck, those glia cells just cant. Additionally there are usually no real inflammatory processes in the brain that could kickstart a healing process (and inflammation in the brain is... well, pretty much lethal, so nature kind of had to do it like that). There ARE small stem cell populations in the brain that supposedly can regenerate damaged nerves, but they dont seem to do a significant enough job because spinal cord damage and strokes are pretty much permanent. - u/GrafKarpador</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, to those saying it's impossible, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sandrine_thuret_you_can_grow_new_brain_cells_here_s_how/transcript?language=en" target="_blank">you absolutely can and do regenerate neurons!</a></p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/regeneration" target="_blank">Here's</a> another fun little explanation on how neuron regeneration works, specifically in regards to reacquiring the ability to see, breathe, etc. We're not quite there yet, but it's definitely within the realm of possibility thanks to stem cell research!</p>
<p>Edit: Even without stem cells, you can regenerate neurons, but as a lot of commenters have pointed out, the healing if often clunky and inefficient, so while it is possible, our neurons just can't reproduce quite enough to cure any conditions like OP mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for our vision, poor eyesight can be due to the cornea being misshaped, lens being misshaped, or because the length of the eye is either too short (causing you to be farsighted, or hyperopic) or too long (causing you to be nearsighted, or myopic). It could also be due to a combination of these three, among other things!</p>
<p>All of these primarily cause rays coming from the outside to not hit the back of your eye very precisely, which is where you have cells called photoreceptors (rods and cones). This is why we wear glasses and contacts, which alter these rays so they hit these cells accurately and precisely. These cells can, and are, regenerated and replaced regularly. </p>
<p>However, the neurons that send the signals from these photoreceptors to the brain are not replaced, which is why ocular diseases such as glaucoma, which damage the neurons, cannot be cured. </p>
<p>Other ocular diseases can impact any part of the entire visual process, however, those that affect the neurons usually end up in blindness if not properly treated (or slowed).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Understanding the cell cycle can help to explain this. The cell cycle consists of mitosis and interphase. Interphase is further divided into growth phase 1 (G1), DNA synthesis/replication (S), and growth phase 2 (G2). The transitioning between the different phases is regulated by different proteins called cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and tumor suppressor genes like p53 and RB. Furthermore there is an additional phase called G0, this is the phase that permanent cells reside in, this includes neurons, skeletal and cardiac muscles, and red blood cells. Permanent cells do not replicate, they don't go into mitosis, and they must be regenerated by differentiation of stem cells. The next type of cell is stable or &quot;quiescent,&quot; this type of cell normally resides in G0 but under certain circumstances they can be stimulated to enter G1 and then to further progress through the cell cycle and into mitosis in order to replicate. Examples of stable cells would be the cells that make up your liver and white blood cells. The third cell type is know as labile, these cells never enter G0, they divide rapidly and have a short G1 phase and continue through the cell cycle. Examples of labile cells include bone marrow, the cells lining your gut, hair follicles, and germ cells. </p>
<p>The reason that we have regulations and checkpoints is to prevent cells from growing uncontrollably. For example if a cell notices that it's DNA is damaged it will trigger apoptosis or programmed cell death. This is what happens when we get a sunburn. UV rays damage the DNA and so to prevent from mutations in the genome (skin cancer) from spreading, the cells sacrifice themselves (pealing sunburned skin). Another point worth mentioning is that labile cells are most at risk for becoming cancerous. Mutations in these cells can lead to colon cancer, cervical cancer, or skin cancer. Mutations in the regulatory genes can also cause cancer's. For example p53 is mutated in most human cancers, p53 blocks G1 to S phase, another example is Rb mutation causing retinoblastoma it also is involved in regulating G1 to S phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on u/shibboreth's comment, <em>M.A.S.H.</em>, the T.V. show and the film, are set in the Korean War but were used to satirize the U.S.'s involvement in Vietnam. It's also mentioned in the Clint Eastwood film <em>Heartbreak Ridge</em>, as <em>Heartbreak Ridge</em> was a battle during the Korean War. There was also the film <em>Porkchop Hill</em> about one of the final engagements of the war. It doesn't have a huge place in popular culture even in the years following it. </p>
<p>We U.S. only lost about 4,000 less soldiers and marines in Korea than in Vietnam even though the war was only three years long. I think a big part of the war being &quot;forgotten&quot; is that it was essentially a loss. After the landings at Inchon, the Marines pushed the North Koreans all the way into China. Then at the Chosin Reservoir the 1st Marine Division was surrounded by the Chinese and butchered, prompting Lt. Gen Chesty Puller to make the famous statement &quot;They are in front of us, behind us, and we are flanked on both sides by an enemy that outnumbers us 29:1. They can‚Äôt get away from us now!‚Äù</p>
<p>All of the ground gained by U.S. forces was lost quite quickly. South Korea was defended but at a high price. There wasn't really anything to celebrate except the soldiers going home. It was a stalemate, and it was arguably an American strategic defeat. The United States Army has never been defeated, but it's lots plenty of battles and a few wars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The Korean war is wedged between WW2 and Vietnam, but didn't affect America nearly as much as either. WW2 and Vietnam defined their generations, so it makes sense that they would be remembered. WW2 was on a much grander scale and the whole country was part of the war effort, and it's outcome was highly relevant to most people on earth. The Korean war had an impact mainly on the Korean peninsula. The Korean war didn't drag on like the Vietnam war, and it wasn't nearly as controversial. </p>
<p>I wrote that assuming you're American. If you aren't, then the answer is even simpler. It had UN backing, but if you're not American, Korean, or Chinese, then your county probably didn't contribute much to the war effort. A war on foreign land, where the outcome doesn't affect you, and the war effort doesn't involve you, is sure to be forgotten. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's somewhat ironic that it's forgotten, because it was one of the first major acts of the Cold War. I think the main reasons it is overlooked include:<br />
1 This was the first modern war that the US didn't really win. It ended in a stalemate, which technically still hasn't ended since a peace treaty was never signed.<br />
2 It was one of many &quot;holding actions&quot; during the Cold War, which was dramatic but indecisive, and didn't have much impact on people's lives.<br />
3 Korea wasn't really well known by Americans, and wasn't important until decades after the war.<br />
4 Many actors and directors joined the Army for WWII and came back home and told their stories again and again. Not as many went to the Korean War, and their stories were not told nearly as often (though the Manchurian Candidate, for example, featured a Korean War vet).<br />
5 It didn't have the dramatic stories that WWII did. Just like it's hard to dramatize the dirty brutality of trench warfare in WWI (another overlooked war), the stalemate of the Korean War makes it hard to find heroic stories to tell.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>You can't average velocities in this way. You can only do this if the time is equal for the two velocities. In this case, that's not true, since it's the distance that is equal.</p>
<p>To illustrate, assume that the track is 18 km long. The first lap takes 3 hours to complete at 6 km/h. The second lap takes 1 hour to complete at 18 km/h. The total distance covered is 36 km and this took 4 hours. That means that average speed is 9 km/h, only 50% more than the speed of the first lap.</p>
<p>If you want to have the average speed by the double of the speed of the first lap, the average speed should be 12 km/h over the total distance of 36 km. But that means that the total time spent should be 3 hours, which is already how much time was spent on just the first lap. That's why people are saying you'd need an infinite speed on the second lap in order to achieve the desired average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>After the first lap, you have an average speed of (lap_distance)/(lap1_time)</p>
<p>By running the second lap, you are doubling the total distance run.</p>
<p>If you want your average to also double, your total time must <strong>remain the same</strong> so that the average is (2&times;lap_distance)/(lap1_time+0).</p>

<p>&quot;Once I've run around the track once, if I just stop and <em>say</em> I ran the second lap in <em>no</em> additional time, what would my average speed have been?&quot;</p>
<p>So if you ran a lap around a 1000 meter track in 1 minute, your rate for that 1 lap would be 1000 meters/minute.  If you then <em>said</em> that you had actually run two laps in that time, your rate would be 2000 meters/minute.  This is twice the speed of your first lap!</p>

<p>If you run first lap 6km/h, and second 18km/h, you've spent T_1 for lap 1, and one third of that for lap 2, so total of 4/3 <em> T_1, meaning your average speed is 2 laps / (4/3 </em> T_1 ) = 3/2 of speed for first lap, that is 9km/h.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It circulates mostly as it always did. I bet you are imagining blood circulation like some sort of highway loop with big arteries directly connected to big veins, and the smaller vessels and capillaries branching off from them. It isn't like that: The blood from the heart is split up again and again until it is all going through tiny capillaries. Then the blood to go back to the heart is collected from the tissue by capillaries which then combine back into larger veins.</p>
<p>So if you cut off a limb it isn't like you removed a section of that central highway backbone and need to reroute before things can flow. Instead think of it like a fluid source being split up to be pushed through a sponge (the tissues) and then collected on the other side by a return fluid system. If you remove a big section of the sponge and plug up the larger supply tubes everything else continues as normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A water treatment facility supplies water to the entire city's four regions, the south, north, east, and west. What it does is send water through very large pipes into these different regions, and then smaller pipes and containers capture the water and start dividing it by streets, then smaller pipes send water into homes, and smaller pipes send the water into the faucets, toilets, and showers.</p>
<p>Then, drains take it all back in the same way small pipes in the drain to the bigger pipes under the homes to bigger sewer pipes in the ground that take the water all the way back to the water treatment facility to purify the water.</p>
<p>One day, a tornado rips through and rips up some of the houses, to the root, in the southern region. Water status pouring out very wastefully and if left unchecked*, too much water will be wasted that other regions in the city need. So, what they do is just shut down the main pipe leading into the southern region so water doesn't go into that region, but the other regions are still functioning as normal. Water still flows into those regions, runs through the main pipe then smaller pipes into homes and back into sewers and back to the water treatment facility. It just doesn't have to go into the southern region anymore.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the main misconception is that people believe our blood system was a circle. You know, you pump blood in the arteries and all the blod flows in a giant cucular path all arround your body until it reaches your heart again. If you cut a leg the path is broken and blood cannot flow anymore. If that was the case we had a big problem because that would mean if you cut a vein blood would pour out as if it was an arterie and you would die. </p>
<p>Thankfully this is not the case. We have two seperate blood systems. The arterie which has overpressure and the vein system which has an underpressue. Cutting a vein open some will get out but due to the underpressue most of it will stay inside. If you cut an arterie you will see a fountain of blood and you have to apply pressure on the wound to keep the blood inside.</p>
<p>So how this works is your heart pumps blood from your veins into your arteries system. This constant overpressure in the main arteries presses the blood through tiny paths in between all cells of your body. The underpressure in the veins sucks alll this blood into its system again. </p>
<p>So instead of a giant circle you have many arteries and veins which are all dead ends creating over and underpressures. Attached to those dead ends are many many tiny tunnels acting like a web all across your body were the blood gets pressed into and sucked out again. The mechanism is much more simple than it sounds and you could easily rebuild it using a regular pump.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Due to this overpressue effect your face for example slighly increases in size each time the heart pumps. It's hard to see with the human eye but a camera and a neat algorithm can see it. This is how good authentification software verifies a person is actually a living being and not a photograph for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compression is a way to more efficiently store data. It's best explained with a simplified example.</p>
<p>Suppose I have a file that contains the string &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot; (w/o quotes). This is 20 characters of data (or 20 bytes using basic ASCII encoding). If I know that files of this type rarely contain anything other than letters, I could replace this string by &quot;20a&quot; and program my software to read this as an instruction to create a string of 20 a's.</p>
<p>But what happens if I want to use the same function for something that does contain a number? Well, I could decide that any number that is to be interpreted literally, rather than as part of an instruction is preceded by a -symbol (and then add the special case of using \ whenever I want to represent a single ).</p>
<p>In certain cases, where the file doesn't contain many numbers or slashes, the size of the file can be reduced by this shorthand notation. In some special cases, the filesize actually increases due to the rules I introduced to properly represent numbers and slashes.</p>
<p>Next up a compression tool might replace recurring pieces of data by a symbol that takes up considerably less space. Suppose a piece of text contains many instances of a certain word, then the software could replace that word by a single character/symbol. In order to ensure that the decompression software knows what's going on, the file format could be such that it first includes a list of these substitutions, followed by a specific symbol (or combination thereof) that marks the actual content.</p>
<p>A practical example. Lets use both of the previous concepts (replacement of repeated data in a sequence by a number and a single instance of that data and replacement of freqeuntly occurring data by a special symbol and a &quot;dictionary&quot; at the start of the file). We use the format &quot;X=word&quot; at the start of the text to define a substitution of &quot;word&quot; by symbol &quot;X&quot;, with the actual text starting with a !. We use the \ to indicate that the following character has no special meaning and should be interpreted literally.</p>
<p>The text is:</p>
<p>I'm going to write Reddit 5 times (RedditRedditRedditRedditReddit) and post it on Reddit.</p>
<p>This line has 90 characters. Applying our compression algorithm, we get:</p>
<p>$=Reddit!I'm going to write $ \5 times (5$) and post it on $.</p>
<p>This line has 62 characters. A reduction of a third. Note that this algorithm is very simplistic and could still be improved.</p>
<p>Another technique that can be used is reducing the size of the alphabet. Using standard ASCII encoding, 1 character uses 1 byte of space, but this 1 byte allows for 256 different characters to be expressed. If I know that a file only contains lowercase letters, I only need 26 different characters, which can be covered with just 5 out of the 8 bits that make up a byte. So for the first character, I don't use the full byte, but rather just the first 5 bits and for the next character, I use 3 remaining bits of the first byte and 2 bits from the next byte, etc...</p>
<p>Now a file like this can only be interpreted correctly if the software on the other end knows it's dealing with a file that uses 5 bits to encode a lowercase letter. This is rather inflexible. So what I can do is to include a special header in the file, a small piece of data that contains the details of the encoding used, in this case it will mention that each character uses 5 bits and then has a list of all the characters that are used. This header takes up some space, so reduces the efficiency of the compression, but it allows the compression software to use any type of character-set that it likes, making it useable for any file.</p>
<p>In reality, ZIP and other compression techniques are considerably more complex than the examples I've demonstrated above. But the basic concepts remains the same: Compression is achieved by storing existing data in a more efficient way using some form of shorthand notation. This shorthand notation is part of the official standard for the compression-system, so developers can create software to follow these rules and correctly decompress a compressed file, recreating the original data.</p>
<p>Just like in my examples, compression works better on some files than on others. A simple text file with a lot of repetition will be very easy to compress, the reduction in file size can be quite large in these cases. On the other hand, a file that contains data that is apparently random in nature will benefit very little, if anything, from compression.</p>
<p>A final remark. All of the above is about &quot;lossless&quot; compression. This form of compression means that the no information is lost during the compression/decompression process. If you compress a file and then decompress it using a lossless algorithm, then the two files will be exactly the same, bit by bit.</p>
<p>Another form of compression is &quot;lossy&quot; compression. Where lossless compression tries to figure out how data can be stored more efficiently, lossy compression tries to figure out what data can be safely discarded without it affecting the purpose of the file. Well known examples of lossy compression are various file formats for images, sound or video.</p>
<p>In the case of images, the JPEG format will try to discard nuances in the image that are not noticable by a regular human observer. For example, if two neighbouring pixels are almost exactly the same colour, you could set both to the same colour value. Most lossy formats have the option to set how aggressive this compression is, which is what the &quot;quality&quot; setting is for when saving JPEG files with any reasonably sophisticated image editor. The more aggressive the compression, the greater the reduction in filesize, but the more data that is discarded. And at some point, this can lead to visible degradation of the image. So-called &quot;JPEG artifacts&quot; are an example of image degradation due to the application of aggressive lossy compression (or the repeat application thereof, the image quality decreases every time a JPEG file is saved).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are already some good explanations of compression.  But that isn't the whole answer to, &quot;what is a zip file&quot;.  </p>
<p>A zip file is  an <em>archive file</em> that also supports compression.  An archive file is a way of storing a collection of files (and directories, file names, and other data necessary to reproduce a subset of a file system) in a single file.  It is a convenient  way of packaging a bunch of files for archiving, sharing, etc.   </p>
<p>Compression is a common feature for archive file formats, but is not required.  Nor is an archive format required for compression.  Classic Unix 'tar' and '.a' files are examples of archive formats that didn't include compression.  And there are a variety of tools in Unix/Linux environments for compressing a single file without any kind of archive file format.</p>
<p>.zip files were the file format for a &quot;shareware&quot; DOS program from <em>1989</em> called pkzip, from a company named pkware.  Because it was functional and effectively free (and maybe because of the catchy name) it quickly grew to be a defacto standard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you have the following sequence of data:</p>
<p><code>Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Linguini Pizza Pizza Pizza Sub</code></p>
<p>Let's shorten it by making a code.  We agree that in addition to the regular text we can use % to &quot;signal&quot; that the next value is a number that tells us how many times to repeat the following text in parentheses.  So now we have:</p>
<p><code>%7(Pizza )Linguini %3(Pizza )Sub</code></p>
<p>Much shorter!  We know to repeat Pizza 7 times, then Linguini once, and then another signal to repeat Pizza 3 times.</p>
<p>We can also do:</p>
<p><code>%7(Pizza )%1Linguini %3(Pizza )Sub</code></p>
<p>That's pretty much the concept compression in a nutshell (and I've written code for decoding bzip data).  it is basically agreeing on code forms to shorten stuff, and implementing those tricks and techniques as part of a compression algorithm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's compress OP's question by replacing certain 3 and 4 character sequences with a single character:  </p>
<ul>
<li>= &quot;ing&quot;<br />
! = &quot;hat&quot;<br />
% = &quot; is &quot;<br />
Compressed:
W!%a &quot;zip file&quot; or &quot;compressed file?&quot; How does formatt<em> it t! way compress it and w!%compress</em>? </li>
</ul>
<p>Original:
What is a &quot;zip file&quot; or &quot;compressed file?&quot; How does formatting it that way compress it and what is compressing?</p>
<p>In this compression, 23 characters were replaced by 7, a saving of 16 characters.  Because we chose a single character that never appears in the original text, our compression can be reversed without error.  There is some overhead, however, because we also need to send the translation key along with the message.  In very long messages, there are often large and frequent repetitions that can be squeezed down enough to be worth the overhead.  If the compression / decompression rules are built in to the software, there is no need to transmit the compression key.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a simple example. </p>
<p>The number 7777722333333 can be expressed in fewer characters, like this:</p>
<p>7(5)223(6)</p>
<p>With the right &quot;decompressor&quot; program you could turn those parentheticals back into long strings of repetitive digits. </p>
<p>Another example: when you take an audio file and &quot;compress&quot; it into an MP3, one of the first things that happens is that all frequencies beyond the human range of hearing are discarded. Don't need 'em. Makes your file smaller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
