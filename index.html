Women would literally get pulled over by the police to be given a rose. Everyone had to drive with their lights on like it was the first day of school (before it became mandatory nationwide to drive like that). I had to call all my relatives that were female and congratulate them and wish them good health etc. I brought in chocolate for my female teacher. Many men went all out for this. Really the whole society went out, at least in the city I grew up in. When I moved to the US, no one celebrated and no ever really heard of it until the last few years. No one still celebrates it, more of a social media blitz and that's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It was made to celebrate the equal rights of female workers. It became especially important when on March 8th, 1917, the Russian Revolution first began. This event is the reason the day is now a public and celebrated holiday amongst many post-Soviet countries.</p>
<p>The reason you're only now hearing about this is probably due the significant media attention that this day received this year. The reason you hadn't heard of it until now is the fact that its not really a part of Western culture and it actually finds its root in Eastern Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>At standard temperature and pressure, you'd need 3 kV per mm of distance, so in your case, you would need to apply at least 1500 V in order for the gap to be bridged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Current is just the measurement of how many electrons are passing through a cross sectional area per second. Voltage is required to force electrons across a resistive air gap. Current is entirely dependent on resistance and voltage, Ohm's law, V = IR. Current just follows what V and R are, and if R is relatively constant, it depends entirely on V.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen's_law" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen's_law</a></p>
<p>If your asking about transmitting electricity across a gap, however, there are much more clever ways to do this. Assuming you're using AC current (or possibly a square wave D.C.), you can use inductive or capacitive coupling. This is how wireless charging works. It's not always super efficient, but it doesn't involve big balls of plasma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: they don't survive.</p>
<p>The life expectancy of the mentally ill is short. From the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2011/no-health-without-mental-health.shtml" target="_blank">NIH</a>, and specifically addressing Americans, mental health, and life span.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;...on average, Americans with major mental illness die 14 to 32 years earlier than the general population. The average life expectancy for people with major mental illness ranged from 49 to 60 years of age in the states they examined — a life span on par with many sub-Saharan African countries, including Sudan (58.6 years) and Ethiopia (52.9 years). Average life expectancy in the United States is 77.9 years. It would appear that the increase in longevity enjoyed by the general U. S. population over the past half century has been lost on those with serious mental illness (SMI). In fact, this drop in life expectancy due to mental illness would surpass the health disparities reported for most racial or ethnic groups. Yet this population is rarely identified as an underserved or at-risk group in surveys of the social determinants of health. </p>
<p>Why is there such a profound disparity in life expectancy for those with SMI? Disorders such as schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder are risk factors for suicide, but most people with SMI do not die by suicide. Rather, the 5 percent of Americans who have SMI die of the same things that the rest of the population experiences — cancer, heart disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and diabetes. They are more likely to suffer chronic diseases associated with addiction (especially nicotine), obesity (sometimes associated with antipsychotic medication), and poverty (with its attendant poor nutrition and health care) and they may suffer the adverse health consequences earlier.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't need good social skills to dig through a dumpster for discarded food or clothing.</p>
<p>There are also soup kitchens that might feed them as long as they behave while on the premises, even if they might still say unusual things.</p>
<p>They might have good and bad days too, like most people. Perhaps they're able to keep it together for long enough to buy some bread one day, even if they were behaving erraticly some days earlier.</p>
<p>In some areas, there are cash refunds for empty cans and bottles. Homeless people in these areas often go around collecting these, and turn them in for money. You only need to find like 15 bottles to be able to afford a loaf of bread, which might sustain you for a few days. Sure, it's not a varied diet, but it keeps you not-dead, and you can supplement it with random stuff you find (or steal) elsewhere, like the occasional fruit, or maybe even some meat if you're lucky.</p>
<p>As for water, you'd be amazed at what you'll drink if you're thirsty enough, and cities often have fountains or other running water somewhere. Maybe they'll find a half-empty water bottle on the ground now and then too. They might keep a bottle to fill up whenever they come across fresh water.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking random stuff you find lying around is of course risky. It could be contaminated with lots of stuff. That's why it's not exactly uncommon for homeless people to be of poor health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Winnipeg, one of the coldest major cities in the world; I am continually astounded that people survive the streets here. Most homeless people hit the relatively balmy West Coast for winter, but there are still those who stay, and deal with temperatures that can reach -50Celsius (-58Fahrenheit) on rare occasions, and frequently stay below -20C (-4F) for weeks. </p>
<p>They mainly sleep in shelters, but some get banned for disruptive behaviour, and some cannot pay the minimal entry fee; the cardboard recycling dumpsters here have lids, and in the very worst pinch, they provide a relatively sheltered and insulated sleeping spot, if you can hazard the chance of getting accidentally dumped in a trash compactor truck.</p>
<p>Sleep aside, no shelter provides day services, and so they must find ways to stay warm for at least half the day. In the downtown core, Winnipeg has built a series of insulated walkways between buildings, over streets and underground, to allow comfortable pedestrian movement. This helps business to stay alive in winter, but these walkways are also a way for the homeless to stay warm without being targeted for &quot;loitering&quot;; they can simply walk around in neutral spaces, where no store-owner can kick them out. All the same, there's only so many times you can do laps in the walkways before you need to find a place to sit, shit, eat, panhandle, or busk, and I can't say what they manage to do then.</p>
<p>For many years, Winnipeggers have talked about our Frequent Flyers; a few homeless and mentally ill people, less than 20 of them, who rack up massive bills for the city by calling 911 and getting a free ambulance ride and checkup; 911 operators are bound by regulation to send an ambulance if the caller lists certain symptoms (which I will not disclose); they may be on first-name basis with the caller, and be fully aware of their ill intent, but if they didn't send paramedics, they'd lose their jobs. </p>
<p>The Paramedics are similarly bound; if the &quot;patient&quot; lists certain symptoms, they must assume good faith and bring the patient to the appropriate hospital that specializes in the symptoms described; basically, this means that a free phone call can be used as a way to get social contact (fucked up as it is, they are often genuinely desperate for any kind of interaction), warmth, and a free ride to a few locations in Winnipeg. It's infuriating and ingenious at the same time; they cost us huge amounts of money, I've heard estimates in the hundreds of thousands all told, and it would be so much more affordable if we made some other sort of provision for them, like maybe bought them each a bus pass. Chances are, they'd lose or sell it though.... it is a pickle.</p>
<p>Sorry if this was a little off-topic, I got carried away. Hope it's interesting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oftentimes, homeless people wind up in jail. Not for long periods, but they are highly prone to becoming &quot;regulars&quot; in the local jail wherever they live. The homeless are locked up for many reasons: stealing is most common, but sometimes it's for harassing others, assault, or drug crimes. Homelessness, mental illness, and drug use are all correlated. </p>
<p>I work in a jail and very frequently see inmates living on the streets after they are released. But contrary to popular belief, homeless people do not relish being locked up. No one likes being in jail. They can't wait to be released because even if they have nowhere to live, they are at least free to either find more drugs or because they just hate the highly structured life that comes with being incarcerated. When they go to jail, they are fed and given medical treatment for whatever problems they have and even get a few days worth of whatever medicine they need after being released. And this is part of how they survive: jails have a fundamental purpose in keeping inmates alive. </p>
<p>I've seen one homeless person in particular with a combine five years of time in jail - but his longest sentence was only 25 days! So the average length of his stay is something like a few days at a time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Abama is like the metra station poltergeist. He's drunk as fuck 24/7. Sleeps with lit cigarettes in his mouth. And gets arrested when shit goes south for him. But he's quite funny, in like a &quot;fuck it and fuck you&quot; kinda way. Not a laugh at this drunk homeless man kinda way. So I think people give him cash when they see him. People smoke weed with him fairly frequently. I certainly notice when he gets locked up for a few weeks. </p>
<p>This one dude, whose entire understanding of the english language is &quot;Have a nice day guys&quot;. Who is always excited to be there, despite being dealt a completely shit hand in life. His like weird split second positive interjection really stands out.  He goes away in the winter though. I think he's got something figured out. </p>
<p>But there was one dude. Whose entire existence was just as like a silent mummy under a pile of blankets on wacker. Never interacted with anyone. He just died when it got too cold. Froze to death on the sidewalk. </p>

<p>Those special events we've seen that we recall for very often, the rest of our lives. The valley of the Yosemite at peak Merced River run off, with nearly 15 waterfalls easily seen dropping 1000's of feet, many of them. I was in awe for 45', saying, Oh, OH, OH!!! When we get that blast of DA, it enhances and facilitates long term memory lay downs, creating synaptically reinforced memory, which is very rarely forgotten.</p>
<p>We see this all the time. A lovely piece of music, such as Carmen Burana, the Fortuna segment, among others, such as the scherzo in the Ninth Symphony and the Chorale at the end. OR, &quot;Oh, honey, that's our song.&quot;</p>
<p>Recall specifically with my girl sitting at Loma Point, watching the sunset thru a foggy haze, where it all turned golden, and a ship sailing north, about 1 mile out, leaving a black trail behind it. Utterly unexpected and lovely. Permanent memory lay down from the DA boost it created. Sensory overload and remarkable.</p>
<p>Or a first time at Disneyland, and I recall it yet now, 60 years later. Lots of other events, the Great Pyramid seen from the Mena Palace among the date palms in Giza. Tut's golden mask, real and golden and utterly impressive in all its ancient colours.</p>
<p>It's DA release, you see. This explains a good bit of it:</p>

The author said we developed this habit for linear narrative arcs to practice and teach our offspring lessons we learned in our past in a way that is easily graspable and then subsequently practicable through forms of play. That's why a lot of our stories tend to have a moral or message at the end that is either blatantly stated or gleaned from context and critical thought.

<p>The atmosphere shields pretty effectively against cosmic rays, so they get more frequent when you're above most of it. But you should not see much of a directional dependence on the screen, as the rays don't follow your normal camera optics, they pass straight through the camera from any direction. They often hit multiple pixels, so if you see something very bright and streak-like in your video, then that would be a good candidate.

<p>The Latin American governments were mostly neutral during the war. (Even Brazil, which did side with the Allies, only committed small numbers of combat forces.) Therefore capturing and prosecuting Nazi criminals was barely any sort of priority for the governments there. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relative geographic isolation from Germany's WW2 enemies in Europe and North America. It's easier to get snatched by the Soviets or Americans if you're laying low somewhere in Europe versus in Latin America. That's not to say it made it <em>that</em> much safer- as the Adolf Eichmann operation proved- but it was a more secure alternative. </p>
</li>
<li>There were already German communities in some of these nations, particularly Argentina. This offered a opportunity to blend in and network with culturally similar people. </li>

<p>As a bonus side question: I am somewhat familiar with why objects are different colors, (we see light reflected from objects and don't see light that is absorbed) but this confuses me. For example, Cu2+ absorbs light in the 600nm region of the visible spectrum and the solution appears blue/cyan. But, intuitively, if you take all the other colors not represented by this 600nm region (the colors not absorbed by Cu2+) and mix them up, it wouldn't be blue, so I don't understand how this works. Sorry for the long post, all answers appreciated.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>edit</em> I think [upinthecloudz answer] (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5ybbqj/is_there_a_word_similar_to_resolution_in/deorpdz/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5ybbqj/is_there_a_word_similar_to_resolution_in/deorpdz/</a>) might be more pertinent to the details/bonus of the original question</p>
<p>&quot;visual acuity&quot; is the catch-all term for ability to distinguish a spatial gradient in light quality. the visual system breaks retinal images into three 'opponent channels', including bright/dark, red/green, and blue/yellow, and each of these has separate associate acuities, deriving from the different sampling of requisite wavelengths by the types of photoreceptors that feed into each channel. human visual acuity is best for gradient in absolute luminance, i.e. bright-dark gradients - there we can distinguish (at best) no more than ~50 cycles per degree of visual angle. the 'chromatic' channels have much worse acuity, topping out at between 10-20 cycles per degree.</p>
<p>a basic reference on this:

<p>there are practical upshots to this, including that you can store the color components of compressed video at lower spatial resolution and the loss will not be noticed, but if you do the same with the luminance component the degradation will be much more visible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For artificial optical systems, resolution is the right term to use when determining the minimum distance where two points of different light intensity are distinguishable in the final image, but you aren't really concerned with that in the example of Cu2+ solution, because the photons at various wavelengths are passing through the solution at every point. There isn't just one part that's passing 400nm light and another that allows 450nm light and another that's letting 500nm light through, all parts are passing all wavelengths, so the distance between various color intensities is 0, and resolution is of no concern.</p>
<p>In terms of human color perception, what you need to keep in mind is that your eyes approximate color by combining signals defining the intensity of light in various spectra (RGB cones), and also that photons add to each other.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of all the colors in the rainbow combining together to black (or dark muddy brown, or whatever), then you are thinking of subtractive color mixing, which is what happens when using pigments or light filters. This is what the Cu2+ is doing in removing red (~600nm) light.  BUT, then the REST of the spectrum will add together, so your eyes will perceive the remaining spectrum as the color inverse of the color which is the lowest intensity among your photoreceptors. </p>
<p>For each color combination this works:</p>
<p>Red: Low intensity<br />
Green: Normal intensity<br />
Blue: Normal intensity<br />
Result: Cyan  </p>
<p>Red: Normal intensity<br />
Green: Low intensity<br />
Blue: Normal intensity<br />
Result: Magenta  </p>
<p>Red: Normal intensity<br />
Green: Normal intensity<br />
Blue: Low intensity<br />
Result: Yellow  </p>
<p>This is also why ink is CMY instead of RGB, as it allows us to remove the signal to each photoreceptor separately in a printed page. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a more general sense than most of the answers, this is effectively asking about the energy resolution of an experiment. As other answers have covered, colour is how the human eye interprets different frequencies of light. With light (and actually everything else, but let's focus on light for now), it's energy is directly proportional to its frequency. So we say that the energy resolution is how finely a detector can measure the difference in the frequencies of light. This is a common measurement stated for particle physics detectors, telescopes, and most relevantly spectrometers, which characterize light by its spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would use the word 'discrimination.' As a similar example in biology, two point discrimination refers to the minimum diatance between two points touching the skin until the idividual can no longer feel two separate stimuli. Your fingertips have better discrimination and you can tell there are two points touchig when they are just 1-2mm apart. On the bottom of your feet however even if the two stimuli are 10mm apart they can still be felt as just one stimulus. The reason is due to the number, density and area of sensory neurons in the skin. You can try this yourself using an object like a compass used to draw circles  and touching the pensil tip and metal tip to your skin at different distances apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if a word exists, but intuitively I would expect the distance between the two points to be proportional to your distance to those points.</p>
<p>My reasoning is that colour is detected by a bunch of cones at the back of your eyes (which basically gives a maximum resolution) and despite the biological lens at the front we can only focus on a point so far away. This is actually similar to cameras, so you can think about not being able to see separate colours from super-close points in the same way a photo of Earth doesn't show what a specific tree looks like.</p>
<p>The choice of colours might also make an impact.</p>
<p>[edit]</p>
<p>Did some experimentation with an image I made, comparing the effects of a tiny checkerboard and a flat colour.</p>
<p>Note that this is inherently subject to bias because the image is displayed on a monitor instead of with paper, and I hand-picked the flat colour.</p>
<p>The effects are <em>extremely</em> interesting, moving your head up and down change their relative appearance.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hft8fLc.png" target="_blank">Here's the image</a> (you should right-click and &quot;view image&quot;), but be aware that it hurts to look at.</p>
<p>More to the point, if you're close enough you can see the checkerboard but if you're far away it's a solid colour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
