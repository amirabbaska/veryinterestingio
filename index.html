<p>More technically, if the state of a quantum system becomes inseparably mixed with the state of another quantum system that is too complex for us to realistically describe quantum mechanically then it is 'measured'. If we could describe the second system quantum mechanically then we'd see that the two systems actually just become entangled.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially: interaction with anything you haven't explicitly included in your quantum mechanical model. This leads to decoherence and incoherent dynamics, which are formally the same as observation. You can think of decoherence as being due to a measurement  that you are not told the outcome of, often because the measurer was an inanimate object. </p>
<p>Generally we cannot consider a quantum mechanical model for a wider environment, so some (weak) measurement effects will always be present. </p>
<p>As interactions with a wider environment transfer information about correlations within your system of interest, they also affect dynamics within the system.  If we could a big &quot;environment&quot; strongly to a small system we alter the dynamics in the system.  This can lead to the wavefunction of the system being fixed to a particular value and hence the quantum zero effect.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chksum" target="_blank">chksum</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two major reasons:</p>
<p>It gives them an opportunity to weed out applicants for a variety of reasons, both said and unsaid, while citing a polygraph failure as the official reason. When you've got 200 people applying for 3 openings, you want a quick way to whittle that down. Offering a subjective test that's masquerading as an objective test is a really convenient way to do that.</p>
<p>Second reason, and possibly the more important one; not everyone knows it's bullshit. The purpose of a polygraph isn't to detect lies. That isn't possible. It's to get you to admit to things you otherwise would not have, even if it's just admitting that you left something out of your pre-polygraph questionnaire. When a polygraph is administered, the first step is to give you a very long form with a series of yes or no questions. These questions ask all sorts of things like have you ever committed a crime against a person, have you ever stolen property, have you ever committed a traffic offense, have you ever used or sold drugs, etc. If you mark yes to any of these questions, there is usually a blank where you are required to fill out an explanation. Sometime later you are given the actual polygraph test. The examiner has a copy of your questionnaire in front of him. First he will ask you a bunch of preliminary questions that they say are calibrating the equipment. A common one is that they will write the numbers 1 through 5 on a piece of paper and then circle one of them. They will tell you to answer &quot;no&quot; to all five of the following questions and then ask you &quot;is the number one circled, is number two circled, and so on&quot;. </p>
<p>Then they will ask you roughly 10 to 20 questions about your actual past, all of these questions are yes or no. They will ask each question probably 3 or 4 times so while you might get asked fifty to a hundred questions, you might only get asked about 15 unique questions. They just repeat the same ones over and over in different orders, ostensibly measuring your body responses to those questions.</p>
<p>While they are are more than willing to use your answers to those questions as a reason to reject you, the real purpose of the test comes after that. This is called the &quot;post examination interview&quot;. They will make a big show about turning off the equipment, unhooking all the sensors and gear, probably talking to you a little bit about what you had for lunch or what football team you like, all to get you to relax. They will tell you that the test is over and that you are no longer being monitored. Here comes the important part. They then finish by asking you if there's anything you might have left out or any answers you might have wanted to clarify, anything that you may have forgotten to put on your pre-interview questionnaire, etc. They will tell you that it's far better for you to admit to things now since the test results haven't been submitted yet, that you don't want to be found out to be lying later, that it will look good if you would admit to things and that it will show that you're willing to work with them and that you want to be honest if you tell them the whole story about something that you may have not been clear on before or that you may have left out before. If you require a little prodding, the examiner will say something like &quot;I've got some indicators of deception on questions 3 and 7 regarding your possible past drug use. Are you sure there isn't anything you're not telling me?&quot; It's a lie, there are no indicators of deception. There is no such thing as an indicator of deception. It's a trick to get you to say something you would not have told them otherwise.</p>
<p>This is where they get you. The combination of feeling relaxed after the stressful examination, and the desire to appear honest and forthcoming gets a massive amount of people to admit to all sorts of things that they otherwise would not have. &quot;Oh yeah there was that one time in high school where I guess I sold a couple bags of weed to some of my brother's friends, but I didn't think it was a big deal and it's not like I'm a drug dealer or anything&quot;. &quot;I wasn't sure if I should put it on the form that I filled out because I didn't get charged or anything, but there was that time seven years ago where I did get arrested for domestic violence, but like I said I didn't get charged and nothing came of it so it's not like I actually committed a crime. I didn't think it was a big deal&quot;. </p>
<p>Thank you for your honesty. Rejected.</p>
<p>The true purpose of the polygraph is to get you to admit to things and basically disqualify yourself. Even if the things you're admitting to by themselves would not have been that big of a deal, the fact that you didn't include them in your questionnaire or you may have given one answer to a background detective previously but gave a different kind of answer to the polygraph examiner, etc. <em>They're trying to weed out applicants</em>. It's far easier to have you do it to yourself than it is to pay a background detective to research you, or possibly risk some kind of &quot;they didn't hire me because I'm black&quot; lawsuit. If they can show you said A on the form and B to the examiner, you're rejected for lying, it doesn't matter what the smoke and mirrors in the &quot;lie detector&quot; say.</p>
<p>EDIT: a number of people are responding with comments along the lines of &quot;this isn't true, the polygraph really does measure things&quot;. Yes, it does. Namely heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity(perspiration). The hand-waving comes from where they use this data to imply that you're lying about something. There is no actual evidence those data points have anything to do with lying. A question about whether you've ever had sexual contact with a minor may elicit a response because you did, because you were the <em>victim</em> of child abuse, or because the question is just shocking. The data can't tell them which it is, or if you just happen to have a stomach ache. The data they collect does not detect lies. It detects stress (and more to the point, <em>possible</em> symptoms of <em>possible</em> stress). The underlying theory is that one who is lying is experiencing more stress during the lie than they are when they tell the truth, and that has never been proven to be true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I did it!&quot;  Post-acquittal confessions are not common--most people who get away with crimes are smart enough not to draw attention to this fact--but it's not unknown.  In most cases, those people do not face additional criminal charges due to double jeopardy.</p>
<p>But of course, no legal answer can be that simple.  As other responses have noted, the doctrine of dual sovereignty means that the federal government and individual states are treated as distinct from each other, each with their own law, and each with the authority to bring prosecutions for the violation of their law.  It is therefore possible that a single set of actions can constitute crimes in multiple jurisdictions, and while a failed prosecution for one charge eliminates the ability to bring the same charge (or a reasonably similar charge) a second time, this does not mean that sufficiently distinct charges are barred, as well.  Bottom line, under certain limited circumstances, the federal government may bring a prosecution concerning the same events (though not the same charges) as a failed state prosecution, and vice versa.  In the case of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), the Supreme Court announced a rule that still applies regarding the scope of double jeopardy:  following acquittal, the government may bring a second prosecution on additional charges arising out of the same underlying events as the first prosecution so long as both the new crime charged and the prior crime each contain an element of proof that the other does not.  </p>
<p>Let's go back to the California example, where the defendant has beaten a murder charge for killing John Doe, let's call it second-degree murder.  After the state acquittal, the federal government cannot come in and bring a first-degree murder charge:  this is because while first-degree murder contains elements not present in second-degree murder, there are no elements of second-degree murder not present in first-degree murder, so the later prosecution would fail the Blockburger test.  Going in the other direction, the federal government cannot charge with a less severe offense such as battery, since battery is a lesser-included offense (i.e., it is subsumed) in murder.  However, if the federal government wanted to charge the defendant with a violation of the victim's civil rights, 18 U.S.C. 242, that would potentially be possible, because there, the crimes have substantially different elements.  Therefore, in a situation where a criminal confessed guilt after acquittal, there might still exist other crimes in other jurisdictions that pass the Blockburger test and allow for a second prosecution.</p>
<p>Further, as Jennifer Huber-Julie has rightly pointed out, double jeopardy has nothing to do with the civil system, so a failed criminal prosecution does not impact one's ability to bring a civil suit.  (Note that there are protections against civil retrial, e.g., res judicata and collateral estoppel, but a failed civil suit would not preclude criminal charges, either.)  So confessing to a crime would open the door for a possible civil lawsuit--in the case of murder, the tort of wrongful death would apply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You cannot be found innocent of a crime. You are found either guilty or not guilty. Not guilty might mean the jury  think you did it, but are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Several things might happen to you if you are found not guilty and later admit to committing the crime.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you testified you may face charges related to perjury. Depending on the severity of the crime the prosecutor might try and charge you with contempt or some form of obstruction of justice. I'm not sure they would be successful, but they would probably throw whatever they could think of at you. Even if found not guilty they would get some satisfaction of disrupting your life and possibly holding you in custody until trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could possibly be tried by a different sovereign. If you were found not guilty in state court, double jeopardy does not prevent the federal government from prosecuting you for the same conduct. </p>
</li>
<li>You will likely face a civil lawsuit from the victim or victims family. This again depends on the crime. </li>

<p>&quot;Once exposed, nausea and vomiting will begin almost immediately, and within a short space of time your tongue and eyes will swell, followed by the rest of your body. You’ll feel weakened, as if the strength has been drained from you. If you’ve received a high dose of direct exposure - as in this scenario - your skin will blanche dark red within moments, a phenomenon often called nuclear sunburn. An hour or two after exposure, you’ll gain a pounding headache, a fever and diarrhoea, after which you’ll go into shock and pass out.</p>
<p>After this initial bout of symptoms, <strong>there’s often a latent period during which you’ll start to feel like you’re recovering</strong>. The nausea will recede, along with some swelling, though other symptoms will remain. This latent period varies in duration from case to case, and of course it depends on the dose, but it can last a few days. It’s cruel because it gives you hope, only to then get much, much worse. The vomiting and diarrhoea will return, along with delirium. An unstoppable, excruciating pain seethes through your body, from the skin down to your bones, and you’ll bleed from your nose, mouth and rectum. Your hair will fall out; your skin will tear easily, crack and blister, and then slowly turn black.&quot;</p></div></div>

<p>But the bigger problem of radiation is that it scrambles the DNA of your cells.  This isn't so big of a problem until your cells get old and try to divide and make their replacement, and it finds out that the code to do so is all messed up.  </p>
<p>Your red blood cells only live ~4 months. (Technical edit#2) and they don't care because they're mindless automatons with no DNA to scramble.  But the bone marrow where they get made go from scientists to igors cranking out poorly made franken-blood. And that's real bad. So 2 months go by and half your blood is this new batch of not quite right cells.  A percentage at least, it's not like you completely stop making viable new blood.   Your brain cells are in it for the long-haul though, so that's more ok with radiation. </p>
<p>Skin cells live only 2-3 weeks. If the replacement cells are messed up, and every other cell is this mindless idiot that doesn't know how to skin then the bodily janitors who have the job of killing off and hauling them away get overloaded. There's too many corpses and the piles of them start rotting.   That's the black part. </p>
<p>Come on skin. I need you. Please don't forget how to skin. You're my biggest organ and you're critical for hugs and keeping my insides in. </p>
<p>(edit: sunburns are actually same sort of thing, just only on the surface layer of skin. That was about the worse example I could have picked)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiation damage is basically completely random: it goes through your body and when it hits a molecule, it breaks it into pieces.</p>
<p>If that molecule was something not too important (e.g. part of a cell's outer hull) and the pieces are by themselves not dangerous, then nothing much happens, the cell just cleans away the the pieces.</p>
<p>If the molecule was important for the functioning of the cell, or the pieces are harmful, then the cell is damaged and has to repair itself (which means it can't work properly for a while). If it is damaged too badly, it dies and has to be replaced. If too many cells are damaged, you die very quickly, but if it's not too many (but more than a few) you just get sick, but you recover - the &quot;latent period&quot;.</p>
<p>However, the radiation also damages the DNA (a very large molecule), the &quot;blueprint&quot; which cells need to reproduce and be replaced (also to create stuff for their daily work, but I'll skip over that aspect to keep things simple).</p>
<p>So if there has been to much damage to DNA, then cell reproduction will fail sooner or later or the new cells won't work properly. Your body cannot replace cells and instead produces garbage. This happens first with cells that are replaced quickly, such as the ones lining your digestive tract and the ones that let your hair grow. Eventually you die.</p>
<p>This is delayed because even the cells that are replaced quickly live for a few days, so it takes at least that long for the damaged DNA to show the full effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High doses of ionizing radiation are disruptive at the molecular level.</p>
<p>Your body is made up of cells.  These cells are regularly destroyed and regenerated for your entire life.  There are precise instructions (DNA) on how they're supposed to be regenerated.  Radiation poisoning basically scrambles these instructions.  So the cells stop regenerating or the regenerations are all messed up.</p>
<p><strong>These cells are regenerated at different rates.</strong>  Your GI tract contains cells that are among the faster regenerating ones.  Then your skin, hair, nails, blood, solid organs and bones (oversimplification, but you get the idea). There's a gap in the &quot;regeneration rates&quot; of your GI tract cells and the next-fastest regenerating cells.  This is where you start to better, then start to feel much worse after a few days when your next set of cells are supposed to be regenerated properly, but aren't. </p>
<p>This is basically how chemo and therapeutic radiation works for treating cancer, which is basically cells that replicate too quickly and don't destruct like they're supposed to. </p>
<p>Patients experience symptoms you could describe as moderate radiation poisoning; extreme nausea, severe swelling of the entire GI tract, excessively dry/papery/burned skin, hair loss, low to nonexistent blood counts, excessive bleeding, shortness of breath, low to no immunity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's (hopefully) temporary and recoverable, in this case.  The radiation is administered at a high enough dose to kill the cancerous cells, but not so high that your healthy cells can't recover.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like some of these posters have said, part of the reason is the cycle of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial damage that doesn't kill cells outright causes them to perform poorly while they deal with crazy molecular debris</li>
<li>Once debris is cleared they return to normal functioning.</li>
<li>When it's time for those cells to be replaced later on, there are difficulties because the delicate network of signaling proteins that regulates this has been disrupted.</li>
<li>Those cells ramp up their functioning to try to compensate but ultimately begin to brake down.</li>
<li>Bad times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The human body is amazing at adapting to, and compensating for, some crazy shit. An example is Parkinson's disease, caused by loss of cells in the Substantia Nigra. You can lose up to 70% of those cells before symptoms manifest because the remaining ones can compensate for a lot of loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

To make this easy, the cells contain &quot;instructions&quot; (in the form of DNA) for building their own replacement. Two things happen during radiation poisoning: some cells &quot;break&quot;. This makes you feel sick, but your body has ways of cleaning up the broken bits of cells, so you start feeling better.  However, the radiation also scrambles the replacement instructions inside other still-working cells, so when those start wearing out, they can't get replaced correctly, so you get sick again.</p>
<p>Imagine that your teacher is making a new homework assignment, but spills some water on it. Initially, the paper might seem ruined: it's too wet to write on. She can &quot;fix&quot; it by drying it with a hairdryer or something, which makes it look more normal. However, the water also weakens the paper. Later, when she tries to copy it for each student, the paper is too weak and the original get shredded by the photocopier. Not being able to make copies of homework probably seems good to you, but it can be fatal if you need to make copies of the cells that make up your blood, help you digest your food, and things like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of having to pee can largely depend on the state of your autonomic nervous system (ANS). Aka the nervous system you can't control. Your ANS is split into two branches, your sympathetic nervous system and your parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Your sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is commonly considered your &quot;flight or fight&quot; response. When your SNS is activated, your bladder is relaxed and you don't have a great need to pee.</p>
<p>Conversely, when your parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is activated your bladder contracts and your internal urethral spinctor is relaxed. However, you also have an external urethral sphincter that you have conscious control of that allows you to delay micturation (the process of peeing). </p>
<p>So for example when you're out running errands your SNS will be more stimulated so your bladder relaxes allowing you to hold much more urine comfortably, and your internal sphincter contracts so you don't have to consciously contract your external urethral sphincter. But when you sit down to eat or arrive home, you become much more relaxed and your PNS is activated. This causes your bladder to contract and your internal urethral sphincter to relax. Regardless of how much urine you have stored in your bladder, this will give you the feeling of having to pee. You can choose to delay peeing by contracting your external sphincter or you can pee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Many times when the situation happens that you are referring to, it is related to bladder irritation by specific substances you've ingested. When your bladder is irritated, it sends signals to your brain that it needs to empty long before you've hit your &quot;actually full&quot; threshold. </p>
<p>Commonly known bladder irritants include anything caffeinated, anything with high amounts of sugar, and alcohol (amongst many other known causes--Google it, you'd be surprised how many are out there). You'll notice that if you cut down on these substances (especially if you eliminate them altogether--even for just one day) you won't get that striking urge to go when your bladder is relatively empty. </p>
<p>Not everyone is as sensitive to bladder irritants as others, but more often than not, they are the pesky culprits behind this occurrence. Many people who have urgency issues actually are irritating their bladders with their drinking habits. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I don't think they're piggy backing off the old pheramone trails markers because those markers are pretty volatile. The way the system works is that each ant lays a trail and subsequent ants follow the freshest/strongest one, but make some slight deviations. If their deviation is faster, subsequent ants will follow that one, so they wind up with the fastest route eventually. If these pheromones weren't volatile, it wouldn't work.</p>
<p>I think it's simply a matter of independently finding that particular entry point into your home is the fastest one.</p>
<p>As for whether they would follow another ant's trails, I doubt it. Ants as a general rule seem to use both the shared, functional pheromone + a unique, colony identifying one in anything they excrete and as a general rule, ants tend to avoid those markers. While ants are territorial, they generally don't go looking for trouble (though there are some exceptions as u/lionhart280 points out below). It's a special event when an ant colony gets together for an aggressive raid,  at least in most species.</p>
<p>However, if they are Argentine ants or members of another super colony forming species, their cuticle hydrocarbons (chemicals in the ant's &quot;skin&quot; that act like a form of ID card) are so similar, that ants can wander into another colony's nest and it's recognised as a nest mate, which has lead to high levels of co-operation between those colonies. If they are super colonists, then it's quite possible they'd follow a trail laid by another, but again, the substances are volatile and have to be for them to function.</p>
<p>Time scale, species and the location of the ingress and location of the nest from the ingress points would help us answer this question better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ants can tell apart different species by their footprints. They will avoid certain species but follow prints of others, partially depending on dominance (e.i hierarchy, slavery, etc) between the species. They can also use the CHC's to tell apart colony members from foreign ants.</p>
<p>The footprints are not the same as the cuticular hydrocarbons, but will always contain them to some degree. Colony specificity has been shown in several species as far as I know. I am at home and too lazy to remote login to uni to look for papers from my dpt, but google scholar provides at least 1 example:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/prick_pomposity suggests, the colony may be far larger than you think, and you're just killing off a small offshoot of it.</p>
<p>I specialize on chemical ecology of beetles, but I've done some basic research into ants and might be able to contribute a bit. Each ant colony generally has a unique pheromone, often present as a cuticular hydrocarbon &quot;fingerprint&quot; (chemicals stuck to the body of each individual ant which have distinctive odors), but ants produce different types of pheromone for different purposes.</p>
<p>Trail pheromones are different from the cuticular hydrocarbon fingerprint. It seems that there is no hard and fast rule about whether trail pheromones are specific to colonies or even species. In fire ants it looks like it's usually not colony specific, but rather species specific or even shared between species ( <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022191076902535" target="_blank">source</a> ). You'll also find interesting vids of ants respond both positively and negatively to synthetic odors, like ink from a pen, which suggests they may have fairly broad responses.</p>
<p>That suggests that two different colonies of the same ant species may respond positively to a trail left by either. However, if they encounter each other on the trail, their cuticular hydrocarbons will differ, and they are likely to attack each other.</p>
<p>Also, there are slave making ants, in which the queen goes out on a raid with an army and attacks another colony. If successful the raiding queen actually eats the colony's old queen, and begins producing pheromones that match the old queen. This lets her control the colony - effectively masquerading as the old queen.</p>
<p>tl;dr: it's insanely complicated and no generalizations can be made. But it's very possible that the trail pheromones produced by your ant species are not colony-specific, so any individual ants of that species will follow the trail regardless of source colony.</p>
<p>Good luck on your war against the ants. As much as they are an annoyance they sure are fascinating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ants usually have thousands of eggs laid, so even if you kill the queen, there will continue to be waves of worker ants that come. I just went through this in my home. First, there were so many ants, then i started poisoning them and they went away. They came back though, but this time there were a lot of soldier ants, unusual. I kept poisoning them and eventually they went away. Now, once a week or so I get a minute wave of tiny worker ants returning to eat the poison I have laid out for them.</p>
<p>I've been studying a lot about ants in the meantime. The super organism is awesome! I've learned that ants often compete for space and resources with neighboring colonies. Often, the demise of one colony means the growth of it's neighbors. So you may very well be dealing with new ants following the trails of the old ants. Just keep poisoning them.</p>
<p>I use a cheap homemade poison of corn syrup and borax. Works great.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Film standard is actually 24.0 frames per second. The 23.976 is the framerate in digital cinema cameras. The reason it isn't pure 24 is pretty stupid. Basically, our video system in America is called NTSC. It set the standard for video signals back in the infancy of video. In black and white everything worked nicely at pure frame rates. However, when color was introduced to videoall of the broadcasters suddenly had to be transmitting color information in addition to greyscale information. Technology already in place couldn't handle this, so the engineers for NTSC devised a trick where video would now be at a slightly lower framerate, and the extra bandwidth in the signal freed up by this would be used for color information. Today, this is no longer necessary as technology has grown beyond the need for such a gimmick. However, thousands of studios across the NTSC world still have some if not all equipment that can only handle the old NTSC standard. It would be too costly to update every piece of equipment, so we're stuck with this standard for at least another decade or two.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is actually is determined by physics and it dates back to cathode ray TV's. The electron beam is scanned across the screen in two passes. It first scans the odd pixels and then the even pixels. In North America TV was broadcast with 525 horizontal rows. Which means each scan did 262.5 rows. </p>
<p>In North America each TV channel was given 6 MHz to broadcast it's programs, of which about 4.5 MHz was usable. Picture was sent, and then a small gap and then audio was sent. When color programming came out, they had to somehow fit the color data in between the picture and audio.</p>
<p>The color signal was interfering with the normal picture. Using some complicated physics, you can get rid of the interference if the gap between the picture and color and the gap between color and sound are both odd integer multiples of the horizontal frequency divided by 2. Simplifying the expressions, you can find that you need an integer multiple time the horizontal frequency to equal 4.5MHz. </p>
<p>So, going back to our 525 rows. Your horizontal frame rate is the number of rows times the frame rate. So, we need a number that when multiplied by 525 becomes divisible into 4,500,000 (4.5 MHz). That number turns out to be 29.97. This is why TV is broadcast at 29.97 FPS.</p>
<p>Okay, now with that out of the way. The 23.976 comes into play when converting from the 24FPS that film cameras use to broadcast rates. 24x29.97/30=23.976. This is called a three-two pull down. Basically they are manipulating the frames in a way that is undetectable to the human eye so that they can match the frame rate of your TV.  </p>
<p>ETA: This might seem like it doesn't add up so I'll add one last step. 23.976 happens to be exactly 4/5 of 29.97. These 4 frames can be stretched into 5 frames because of the way TV images are produced, and that is what allows the movie to be broadcast in 29.97. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/50/20044.2.full" target="_blank">fascinating study</a> looking at the gestures made by athletes blind from birth compared to blinded later in life compared to sighted people when they win or lose. They found that the V gesture of arms held up, chest puffed out, head back is really strongly preserved across cultures and even in people blind from birth/very early in life. It looks like it's a built-in movement, kind of like smiling, grimacing, laughing, etc. </p>
<p>The most popular theories for these are to do with the evolutionary benefits of being able to communicate feelings to each other. For example, sharing humour might be a bonding experience bringing a social group closer. Additionally, it might disarm potential angry responses, by showing, &quot;No! Haha! That pie in the face was totally hilarious and <em>not</em> me starting a fight with you!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In college, I developed a keen interest in psychology and sociology, and started looking into stuff like this, just to better understand the human mind. We learn a lot of 'social conventions' just by seeing other people do them. We grew up, as young children watching cartoons, where people slapped their knee, or stomped their feet while laughing. Fun fact, I interviewed an animator from disney for a college project, he said that they tend to overtly exaggerate actions, to get the point across better. Some of us also saw parents gently slap other people on the back while laughing. This turns out that it's a way (subconsciously) of sharing the moment with someone else. </p>
<p>Basically, you 'feel' like the slap / hit something response, because you learned that it's a part of laughter, from your observing of subliminal stimuli.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
