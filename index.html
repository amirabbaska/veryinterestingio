		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing i want to do is debunk something that is often repeated about Yellowstone and that is that it has some kind of regular eruption schedule. It's last 3 supereruptions were 0.63, 1.3 and 2.1 million years ago. So we have two inter-eruptive periods,  one of 0.67 and one of 0.8 million years.  Two data points is not a useful tend and there's at least a 130,000 year difference between them.  To put that in context anthropology puts the migration of modern humans out of Africa at something between 60-130,000 years ago.  So these aren't small variations in time.  Furthermore a super eruption completely reconfigures the volcanic edifice and plumbing system,  so there is no reason to expect that one supereruption will behave the same way as a previous one.  Anyone telling you about cyclicity or due dates on large volcanoes is severely misinformed.</p>
<p>Ok,  so onto how we monitor and forecast.  Supervolcanoes are problematic in that we've never seen one erupt, so we have to go on geological evidence of past eruptions,  then a lot of applied rock physics. For a super eruption to go off the first thing is that we need over a thousand cubic kilometres of eruptable magma in the reservoir.  Eruptable is an important distinction. Lots of magma can get isolated off into unconnected mushes and parts of the plumbing.  Or can intrude as dykes which relatively rapidly cool down.  We can use seismic arrays to image plumbing systems (think ultrasound imaging - similar process,  different frequency) and estimate melt volumes,  but the resolution of these is still very low.  So we can track roughly how much melt is available.  </p>
<p>Next is inflation of the volcano.  More magma underneath means the surface bulges more.  Given the the Yellowstone magma reservoir is something like 80km across this is a significant and easy thing to track (we can track surface motions of less than a millimeter with comparative ease).</p>
<p>So there's plenty we can look at.  The issue is one of context.  We've only known about supervolcanoes for a couple of decades or so.  Our monitoring of them has been similarly short and often patchy.  So understanding them is a bit like throwing a Dr in a room with a patient, and  giving them 1 minute with nothing but a thermometer and reflex hammer to diagnose their complete medical requirements and estimate their life expectancy. These volcanoes simply do not work on human timescales.  Peaks and troughs in their activity are perfectly normal.  Perhaps even more importantly these thing erupt all the time! Its just that <em>most of their eruptions</em> are not super eruptions. So increases in seismic activity are not signs of imminent super eruption (Or even,  necessarily,  minor eruption). </p>
<p>So we can be pretty confident that Yellowstone is not in immediate threat of super eruption; it's not close to what appears to be inflated enough to drive a super eruption.  And by immediate I mean in the next 10-20,000 years.  That said we have no idea what the magma recharge rate is at the moment or how it varies over time.  As i say - these things just do not operate on human timescales.       </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As u/superiorpanda has said with Mount Saint Helens there was clear growth, caused by volcanic material rising to the earths surface, on the northeast side of the cone. This is well worth looking up online as it really is extremely clear. The same thing is occurring at Yellowstone, only much more subtly. Lakes within the national park have drastically different shorelines than they did five years ago (due to the bulging of earths surface from volcanic material), as well as this the gaseous activity at many of the parks hot springs has risen significantly. This is caused by sulphur, as well as other gases, being released from sub-surface material as it reaches the earths surface. Finally an indicator that is is widely used around the world is the detection of pre-curser earthquakes - of which many have been detected in and around Yellowstone. These types of tremor tend to be much less powerful and destruction than their seismic counterpart, roughly 3-5 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>These three indicator clearly show that Yellowstone has seen an increase in volcanic activity over the past 20 or so years. This however is not a relevant time scale to geologists. Yellowstone has historically erupted roughly every 560,000 years - give or take 1,000 - 15,000. It has currently been, off the top of my head, 530,000 years since it's last eruption and so realistically I'm not sure it would be likely to erupt in our life time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I can remember, generally you know a volcano is becoming more active through earthquake swarms and physical appearance. Depending on how large the volcano Is, earthquakes will become increasingly frequent and roughly at the depth of the magma chamber underneath. This indicates that the magma is increasing causing the earth to move so it can find new cracks to fill before it actually erupts. This also causes the volcano to change shape and rise by feet to meters or develop an explosive dome where magma is building up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Thermodynamics tells us that heat loss is proportional to temperature difference, so if you let your house warm up the heat from outside enters more slowly. Essentially the product of time and temperature difference is your cooling energy.</p>
<p>There is a minor subtlety with maintenance and life cycle, your AC unit may not be designed for continuous duty, so long cool down cycles could be hard on it. Not sure if that is the case in your unit, seems like a bad way to design anything but it could be.</p>
<p>Edit: one non-thermodynamic factor is humidity and mold, which will be different at a constant temperature vs a cycling temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turning it off would be more energy efficient. The reason why this is, is that running your A/C at a cooler temp doesn't necessarily use &quot;more power&quot;. As an example, suppose you have an 1100w microwave. That microwave will on average, always use 1100w no matter if you're cooking for 10 seconds or 5 minutes. If you cook for 1 hour, you will have used 1.1 kWh. If you multiply that by 24 you will have the kilowatt per day, supposing you ran it for 24 hours. Multiply that by 1/4th of the year, 91 days, and you'd have used ~2049kWh of round the clock microwaving (Many home owners use between 3,000kWh and 20,000kWh when yearly home electrical use is totaled). The same concept applies to your A/C (can usually use 500w to &gt;2000w (2kWh)). So, your A/C will just run longer because your thermostat will be trying to keep your house at that temp. Depending on the placement of your thermostat, it may be in an abnormally warmer part of your house and just be unable to detect the temperature properly. Meanwhile, all the bed rooms may be a comfortable or colder temp.</p>
<p>Not to sell a product, but getting something like a smart thermostat would probably help a lot. They are a step up from a normal thermostat in that you can control some of them via your phone. You could leave the house at your usual time, A/C off, and then if you remember, can turn it on via phone before you're expected to come home so that your house will be chilled a little bit when you get there. Some of them have really robust means of scheduling them but anytime you don't have to run your A/C, you'd be more efficient than just running it all the time at a consistent temperature. You would save more money by turning it off when possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're paying a lot for A/C it may be a good idea to look into reducing your electrical bill by replacing it with a solar bill or see if there are more efficient AC* units.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what you describe, assuming an apartment or small home, it is more efficient and safe on the equipment to turn it off through the day.  Be sure you close the blinds or curtains to help keep it from warming too much during the day. Buy a programmable thermostat so it can cool your home only when you are there, and only down to the temperatures you need. Good devices ($50 range) can calculate how early to start cooling when you return home and run for multiple cooling cycles so it can minimize both cost and wear on the equipment.  </p>
<p>(No need for the very expensive learning-style devices unless you are truly incompetent at following on-screen instructions, although they seem to make neat toys for people who have money for them. Programming when you're up and about isn't hard. )</p>
<p>For an outdoor temperature of 85F -- which really is not very hot outside -- there is only a small temperature drop needed. Blocking light through windows and double-checking the insulation and weather seals will be your biggest help both for efficiency and cost. Assuming you closed the blinds and curtains during the day the weather you describe your home is unlikely to hit high temperatures, likely never hitting the same 85F you see outdoors. You're probably only going to cool the home 5F or so.  </p>
<p>In the general case it is a more complex answer, and it depends on the type of equipment, the difference between indoor temperature ranges and the outdoor temperature. It depends on the volume of air, a 30000 cubic foot larger home is quite different from an 7000 cubic foot apartment. It depends on how ducts are situated, if they are whole-home or zoned. </p>
<p>There are some newer systems designed to run more continuously with slower fan speeds, and there are higher capacity HVAC systems for bigger volumes and large homes, but neither sound like your setup.  Also zoned systems can require less power, but they're uncommon.  Most homes are set up for whole-home cooling, so if the room opens up to the main area the duct vents and doors should remain open to prevent frosty-cold vents with hot rooms, or inconsistent temps between rooms.</p>
<p>Most AC units work well at cooling for a block of time but not continuous duty. Running for extended times has hazards like the lines freezing up which can lead to expensive repairs, but that mostly happens for bigger temperature drops or high volumes of air to be cooled, or when there is a small temperature differential with the outside air.  Efficient systems will run for five or ten minutes, long enough to get the refrigerant flowing in a strong pattern through the various systems to deliver cold air to the blower, and the blower will take that very cold air and blow it powerfully through the entire home. Then they'll shut off before the systems start to overheat or before any of the lines approach freezing temperatures. </p>
<p>But really, most of the mid-grade or better programmable systems have all the brains to work this stuff out. You can tell it you're out for the day, and return at 6:00 PM, and it will sort everything out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything in your home is at a certain temperature. When you turn off your AC, not just the air warms and gains humidity, but also all of your building materials, finishes, and furniture.  In order to recool your home, the heat energy and humidity has to be removed from all of this mass as well as the air. </p>
<p>If you live in a wood framed structure, temperature and humidity are going to shrink and swell the skeleton of the building. This causes problems with Sheetrock, door swelling and not shutting correctly, window frames may even move and slightly break seals. This ruins the efficiency of the structure. Your HVAC system is just one part of the entire dwelling. It prevents nail pops, creaking floors, mold or mildew, and improves air quality. Turning the AC up a few degrees while you are away is not detrimental, but off will have a negative effect on all of the other systems in the structure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually depends on the type of system and the time frames involved.</p>
<p>For example, constant speed compressors use the same energy (roughly) whenever they are on.  So the energy savings is roughly a straight-line extrapolation over the time spent away from home.</p>
<p>The savings are even better if the refrigeration system uses a hot-gas-bypass to match load--this essentially false-loads a system when at part load instead of turning it off and on again to match load.  It's more comfortable, and easier on the compressor (which hates to be cycled on and off) but uses WAY more energy since any time the compressor is active, it uses full power, even if it is only putting out partial cooling.  You basically increase the hours on of your system with this type of control, so your power usage ramps up.</p>
<p>With a variable speed compressor (often found in the newer ductless split systems), however, the energy used is roughly proportional to the <strong>cube</strong> of the speed.  So, in other words, at part load, there is a very significant decrease in energy usage.  With these types of systems, it is possible that leaving the unit running to maintain temperature instead of turning it off when away, and then forcing it to run at full speed on your return home to pull the house down to temperature again will actually save energy. </p>
<p>Again, this all depends on how long you're away.  If you are away for a long time, obviously there are savings no matter what type of system you use.  No system runs more efficiently than one that is off.  But with variable speed systems, the interval at which it makes sense to turn down the thermostat is much longer than with a constant speed system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It's a big open question right now. </p>
<p>We know how massive they are, we can get that from observations of orbiting binaries.</p>
<p>To get their radius, we have to interpret other observations, or use theory. For example, we know what neutron stars are made of, so we can predict how 'squishy' the neutrons and protons in their core are. Knowing this, we can calculate the radius of a neutron star of a given mass. But we don't know <em>exactly</em> what they're made of, and we don't know <em>exactly</em> how squishy that stuff is. So we're modeling them. At present, we know they're about 11-13 km in radius or so, but hopefully we'll know it to within 10% once the NICER mission gives us some results. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Permeability is a property of solids, and it can vary depending on the liquid/gas it's interacting with. Oxygen permeates through rubber faster than nitrogen, which is why you sometimes see garages offering nitrogen inflation, because 100% nitrogen will stay inflated longer than 80% N2 and 20% O2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of different ways a tire can lose air. Here are a few common culprits.</p>
<p>If it's losing air extremely slowly and consistently over a long time, it is likely that this is only due to air permeating through the rubber, which happens on some scale in every tire.</p>
<p>If the tire pressure is fluctuating and generally decreasing slowly the cause could be change in season. Similarly, long drives to new locations with new pressures/temperatures can affect the air pressure of your tires.</p>
<p>If it is losing air pressure consistently but not catastrophically (a blown out tire, severed valve stem, gaping hole), the leak could be from several places. A bent, cracked or corroded wheel will cause a tire to lose pressure at varying rates. Similarly, if a tires rubber is corroded along the bead (where it seals with the wheel) air is likely to escape. The same could happen due to a worn or dry-rotted valve stem. Even a small puncture can cause a tire to lose air relatively slowly, and because drivers are only losing a psi every few days, they are misled to believe it must be something other than a nail, screw, staple, metal shaving, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The thickness of the inner liner is a key component to determine how eco friendly a tire is. Less pressure = more contact with the road = higher fuel consumption. </p>
<p>Legislation in many countries determines the minimum thickness of this layer. For example in Asia, this is not as strict and as a result, tires (from smaller brands) in Asia loose air much quicker, resulting in more fuel consumption.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of talk of arthropods and such, with some good references, but that's kind of missing several important factors.  It's easy to intuitively think of raindrops hitting small organisms as being equivalent to cinder blocks falling from the sky and hitting us, but that's not how it plays out.</p>
<p><a href="http://wxguys.ssec.wisc.edu/2013/09/10/how-fast-do-raindrops-fall/" target="_blank">Raindrops are not moving very fast, nor are they heavy</a>.  For a raindrop to be considered a raindrop it has to be between roughly .5mm - 6mm (about the size of a fly at the largest).  A big raindrop has a terminal velocity of about 10 m/s (20 mph), with smaller drops down closer to 0.9 m/s (2 mph).  That's basically to say that there isn't much energy in any given raindrop to do a lot of damage with.</p>
<p>Another part is that smaller creatures are quite strong and tough as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">Square-cube Law</a>.  This is why an ant or a spider is proportionally so strong and an element of this is why a mouse generally won't fall fast enough to get seriously injured whereas a horse or an elephant will splash from a long fall.  Also why a raindrop falling on a shrew or a butterfly isn't the equivalent of a cinder-block falling on a human.</p>
<p>Raindrops can certainly hinder small organisms, but that tends to be more an issue of surface tension, heat loss, splashing and water flow, and things like that rather than the actual impact of the water droplet.</p>
<p>For many flying organisms <em>fog</em> (and, to a certain degree, drizzle) is actually  much more difficult thing to deal with as the tiny water droplets are suspended in the air and they accumulate on the surface of the flying organism, adding a lot of weight.  This is why you usually don't get mosquitoes buzzing about when it's foggy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Have you ever wondered what happens to mosquitoes in the rain? A raindrop is, like, 50 times heavier than those little suckers. So getting hit by one has gotta hurt, right?</p>
<p>Well, not so much. Because researchers at Georgia Tech have found that the bugs are so light, speeding water drops simply brush them aside, without imparting much force. The results appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [Andrew K. Dickerson et al., &quot;Mosquitoes survive raindrop collisions by virtue of their low mass&quot;]</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that precipitation can be a real pain for lots of winged critters. Bats expend twice as much energy flying through a storm as in clear skies. But what about bugs no bigger than the raindrops themselves?</p>
<p>Researchers used high-speed video to watch mosquitoes wingin’ in the rain—well, through a spray of mist in the lab. They saw that when a skeeter and a water droplet meet, the insect basically hitches a ride for a bit before peeling away off unharmed.</p>
<p>So the bugs go with the flow and offer little resistance. And the drop slows only slightly, keeping its kinetic energy rather than blasting the bug. So for storm-trooping skeeters, resistance is not only futile. It’s all wet.</p>

<p>Elephants are the biggest land animals. Have you ever seen one jump? Elephants are heavy enough that they could do serious damage to their bodies by falling a few feet.</p>
<p>In a similar vein to this, think of a beetle falling off a skyscaper. Does it hurt to hit the ground? Maybe... but they just weigh nothing, so tiny creatures like this have very little to fear from heights. Even at their terminal velocity (the fastest speed they can fall with wind resistance), they may not have enough inertia to do damage to their body. We've all tried to slap a fly out of the air-- it must be like getting hit by a freight train for that fly, right? Not really. We are surprised to see them fly off, unphased. This is also part of the reason why toddlers bounce, and adults break things-- adults have four times the mass behind them when they crash into something or fall off their bike.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's tempting to think about this question in terms of scaling raindrops up to the size of excersize-ball sized water balloons, and &quot;wouldn't it hurt if...?&quot; but this is simply the wrong approach to the problem.</p>

<p>A bit off topic, but this has always fascinated me.  Hurricane Camille hit our area back in 1969.  It's been said that it was the highest saturation of rain ever recorded.  That birds and other animals outside drowned b/c they were unable to breath through the massive sheets of rain coming down.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:
There, rainfall was so heavy that reports were received of birds drowning in trees, cows floating down the Hatt Creek and of survivors having to cup hands around their mouth and nose in order to breathe through the deluge.
So much rain fell in such a short time in Nelson County that, according to the National Weather Service at the time, it was 'the probable maximum rainfall which meteorologists compute to be theoretically possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hepatitis viruses (including D and E also) were identified in a time when biologists and medical professionals knew very little about viruses, or where able to classify them appropriately. The word hepatitis means &quot;inflammation of the liver,&quot; so naturally this is what all the hepatitis viruses have in common. They all cause some form of inflammation in the liver which leads to symptoms that are similar. </p>
<p>Hepatitis A is in the picornavirus family of viruses, same family as polio. It's an illness that people get by drinking or eating contaminated foods (this is refered to as fecal-oral transmission) often in third world countries where sanitation is poor. It looks and feels way worse than it is, lasting only one month and almost never killing anyone who gets it. </p>
<p>Hep B is a member of the hepadnovirus family. It's transmitted through sex and needle sharing, making it a blood borne pathogen. It looks much like hep A at the onset of illness, resolves, but unlike hep A which has no carrier state, hep B has a carrier state which often times develops into chronic hepatitis (chronic liver inflammation) over the course of many years, and often presents with kidney failure and even liver cancer. whether or not this occurs depends on the persons immune system. Unlike hep A, when we find hep B infections we treat them aggressively with antiviral medications. </p>
<p>Hep C belongs to the flavivirus family, same as West Nile virus. It is transmitted only through blood, which makes it most common in people who share needles. Unlike hep B, hep c infections become chronic most of the time, leading to liver cirrhosis (hardening) and also liver cancer, same as hep B, but much more commonly. Infact, hep c is the most common cause of hepatocellular carninoma. We treat hep c as we do hep b, but cannot vaccinate against it (as with hep b) because the virus itself is too variable in the way it coats its outer shell. </p>
<p>In summary, the hepatitis viruses are not a family of viruses. They are a group of viruses from different famililies that all happen to affect the liver in some way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are caused by different viruses and therefore cause different illnesses. While they all cause &quot;hepatitis&quot; or inflammation of the liver, they are far from the only viruses that cause that. EBV (the most common form of &quot;mono&quot;) also can. As can CMV and other viruses...as well as many non-viral causes (autoimmune diseases, Fe overload, tylenol toxicity, fatty liver, alcohol, etc).</p>
<p>Speaking in broad strokes, Hepatits A tends to be transmitted through a fecal-oral route...meaning fecal contamination of food or water and is typically ingested. It often causes a brief illness that most people get over from,  but can be dangerous to certain groups of people.</p>
<p>Hepatits B is a virus made from DNA (the other 2 are RNA). It is usually sexually transmitted. It can also occur through blood-borne transmission (transfusions, sharing needles for IV drug use) and in some cases can even be passed from mother to child during pregnancy and birth. Unlike Hepatitis A which usually is only a transient illness, Hepatitis B can lead to immunity in some people, but other people can develop chronic disease which can eventually lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer (&quot;hepatocellular carcinoma)&quot;</p>
<p>Hep C is usually transmitted by the blood borne route. Most people do not develop immunity to it and have chronic infection which ultimately leads to either liver cancer or cirrhosis. </p>
<p>There is no vaccine for Hep C but there are new drugs that can kill the virus. Meanwhile, there are vaccines for HepA and HepB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my experience Hep A, wasn't nearly as bad as you'd expect. I somehow managed to get Mono (EBV) and Hep A (as well as tonsilitis and pharyngitis) at the same time, ended up in hospital for a week. My only real symptoms of EBV and Hep A were hot feverish sweats and headaches from EBV like a severe cold/flu without coughing and sneezing etc and yellow itchy skin coupled with really strong smelling brown urine and white excrement. Sleep was not my friend for about a month, thats to say uninterrupted sleep - even now 3 months later I can't get enough rest - what I wouldn't give for a good 12 hours sleep a day.</p>
<p>The only reason they kept me in hospital was to make absolutely certain my liver recovered ok and that there wasnt some kind of underlying illness on top.</p>
<p>For anybody interested both the hospital and my personal Dr seem to think it was caused by my work, I'm a broadband, and phone technician. I go into people's homes to fix faults, I used to have drinks sometimes when offered - not these days. Also I have to work in manholes in the street but take precautions but could also be that somehow. </p>
<p>This was probably about 3 months ago and I am still struggling with energy levels at work and home - about 1 or 2 in the afternoon I'm ready for a nap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sanitizers almost always use alcohol, which bacterial cells don’t really have any cellular means of developing resistance against.  You may as well worry about developing resistance to having a nuke dropped directly on your face.  Alcohol essentially saps bacterial cells of all moisture instantaneously, and to combat that they would need to develop characteristics which would essentially make them not even bacteria anymore (like a plant-like cell wall or a eukaryote-like complex cell membrane)</p>
<p>EDIT:  I got a few things wrong, thanks for pointing them out everyone! (no sarcasm intended).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alcohol doesn’t work mainly by sapping moisture, it actually causes the bacterial cell membrane (and eukaryotic cell membranes also) to basically dissolve.  We can put it on our hands because of our epidermal outer layer of already-dead cells which basically doesn’t give a fuck about alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bacteria actually can develop resistance to low to moderate concentrations of alcohol, by devoting more resources to a thickened cell membrane.</p>
</li>
<li>Look up bacterial endospores.  These can survive highly concentrated alcohol solutions and cause surfaces to be re-colonized under the right conditions.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what’s in the hand sanitizer. </p>
<p>The triple antibiotic soaps and hand sanitizers will absolutely cause resistance to develop. This has already been documented and it is discouraged to use those types of soaps and sanitizers. </p>
<p>For alcohol based sanitizers, the mechanism of killing bacteria is much more intense, for lack of a better word. Antibiotic resistance can be through random mutations of the targeted protein or an enzyme that sequesters or degraded the antibiotic; antibiotics act in a very specific way, so resistance is just a change in the very specific mechanism. Alcohol’s effect is far-reaching and affects nearly all aspects of bacteria. It is very unlikely that all the proper mutations will be present to resist the alcohol’s effect. In fact it’s so unlikely that it hasn’t been documented to any reasonable degree that I know of. </p>
<p>The 0.01% is most likely due to bacteria forming spores or improper technique over a tiny portion of the skin. </p>
<p>Please correct me if I’m wrong or have any assumptions I should state. </p>
<p>Edit: felt that further clarification of why spores don’t develop resistance was necessary.
You can think of spores as dehydrated cells. They have a thick cell wall that resists most extreme environments, e.g. low nutrients, low and high temperatures, low moisture, radiation, etc. so they won’t react to any stimulus at ergo they won’t acquire resistance since they aren’t really living (so to speak)
They are actually a worry when sending space equipment to other planets. How do we know if life found there is native or just a spore that decided to start populating the planet when it fell off the space equipment?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are confronted with a stressful event, your brain anticipates the energy and focus for the event. It's gonna stimulate or slow different systems in your body. In stressful situations (good or bad), you are gonna use your accelerator (sympathetic system) and pump more blood, breathe more oxygen, get more focus and make your muscles more reactive. This is you, bracing and getting ready to get through the event.</p>
<p>In an anxiety disorder, you have your foot constantly on the accelerator. Any situation can become stressful by the way your brain analyse it and adjust to it. Your brain perceives danger in a non-threatening situation or over stimulate in stressful events. This is what happens when you have a panic attack, your body responds excessively to stress.</p>
<p>Antidepressants regulate some pathways of this nervous system. It forces the accumulation of certain chemicals in your brain so these nervous pathways are not constantly stimulated. It may help to manage the disorder better.</p>
<p>Edit: Grammar, better phrasing. For all the redditors going through anxiety and/or depression: you are strong and resilient, you can adapt to everything. What you feel is temporary, nothing lasts, you are not defined by your diagnosis. Your doctor loves you, has seen you distressed and prescribed you antidepressants and/or anxiolytics to help you get through. If your symptoms or depression longers for way too long or you have difficulty to manage it, please seek help, please see a psychologist/counsellor/GP/psychiatrist. You'll be amazed by what you are capable to overcome. We love you.</p>
<p>To respond to some questions and stays in an ELI5:</p>
<p>Anxiety is your physiologic response to a stressful event. A disorder is a maladaptive response to what we consider the norm. When you have an anxiety disorder, you chronically react too much or have difficulty to come back to a normal state.</p>
<p>Anxiolytics (for benzodiazepines, most commonly used) work on your central nervous system by making your neurons less excitable, this is extremely useful to calm you down during a panic attack or in prevention when you have to confront a stressful event. Your muscles respond less to the accelerator, your heart calms down, you breathe slower, your muscles relax. Unfortunately, this is highly addictive and just treat your physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Depression is a low mood state, a temporary inability to feel excited or joy. It is normal to feel that way. What we consider not normal it's when this state last for more than 6 months or is accompanied with worthless feelings and/or suicidal thoughts. Your antidepressants medications will help you having more good feeling molecules in your brain, helping you a get through the rough events you are going through. However, this takes time to have an effect and this will make your brain produce or recapture less of these molecules (this is why you need progressive withdrawal and develop tolerance).</p>
<p>Depression and anxiety are commonly seen together. A lot of anxious persons develops depression states or juggle with both disorders. We do not know exactly all the mechanisms, different theories going on. Same with medications, we know half the exact mechanisms of very common molecules on our nervous system. That is why it seems off to put people on antidepressants with chronic pain or anxiety, but we do know there is an effect on the nervous system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a long-term patient/sufferer of a severe/chronic anxiety disorder (panic w/agoraphobia, which I assume is based on GAD because it's been so many years but I dunno).</p>
<p>I like understanding things so have asked lots of questions of my doctors and done lots of research. The following is according to my understanding, although as described, I'm not in a position to call myself an expert.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is an anxiety disorder?</strong></p>
<p>This question has two potential meanings: When do we consider anxiety a disorder? And, what causes anxiety disorders? So I'm going to broach both.</p>
<p><strong>When do we consider anxiety a disorder?</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety disorders are not singular entities. It is not a fact that you either have or do not have one in the same way as you can either have or not have a cold. There is not a single pathogen, or single physical issue, or anything we can objectively see on a scan or in a blood test that can tell us whether you do or don't have a disorder. </p>
<p>Instead, anxiety disorders are classified according to clusters of symptoms. The main 'symptom' of any mood disorder is that the mood (whether anxiety, depression, whatever) causes significant distress and dysfunction. So if you're 'a worrier' but it doesn't really bother you and it doesn't mess with your life at all, then depending on country (the US seems to enjoy pathologising from what I see/hear...) a psych is going to be reticent to call that a disorder. Generally, it's only considered a disorder if it's actually causing you pain and holding you back in life. (As an aside, this is not true for ego-syntonic disorders like personality disorders and some cases of eating disorders - e.g. people with anorexia often claim to 'choose' their disorder and do not consider it a 'bad' thing - but when it comes to mood disorders like anxiety, suffering and dysfunction are key).</p>
<p>As for the different 'types' of mood disorders, the lines are really just drawn in the sand. That's why many people have a long list of 'disorders', because there's significant overlap and you can fit into many categories at once. People with GAD often experience OCD features. Most people with GAD also have social anxiety. People with panic disorder often have GAD. Most agoraphobics have panic disorder. Most people with anxiety have depression and vice versa. This is because we're not dealing with a specific disease entity here, these labels just describe which symptoms you're experiencing at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>What causes an anxiety disorder?</strong></p>
<p>No one knows exactly. There are many theories. These span genetics, neurochemistry, and social and environmental factors (such as how you were brought up). It is generally accepted that the cause is <em>probably</em>, a bit of all of these things, but treatment normally focuses on changes thoughts and behaviours that you have learned in childhood (which have been shown to be a significant factor in either causing or perpetuating anxiety), or changing neurochemistry with antidepressants. Even when it comes to medication, most people agree that antidepressants aren't the 'cure', personal change through therapy is the more sustainable way to recover. Antidepressants are generally seen as a way to stabilise mood so that one can make necessary changes to themselves/their lives to reduce overall stress.</p>
<p><strong>How is this linked to the sympathetic nervous system?</strong></p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system is activated under stress regardless of whether you have an anxiety disorder or not. The physical symptoms of an anxiety disorder are experienced by everybody under stress, but they tend to be worse with an anxiety disorder simply because you experience them more severely and more often. </p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system governs your fight/flight response. Under stress, all human bodies will go into 'turbo mode' and start prioritising all the systems needed to help you flee danger or fight it. Your blood is directed to your muscles and away from your digestive system and skin. So you get pale/blanched skin; nausea; diarrhoea; vomiting; IBS etc. You breathe faster and your heart beats faster to get super oxygenated blood to your muscles to help them move more quickly. So you feel dizzy, faint, and get heart palpitations and sometimes chest pain (which is actually just muscle pain). With so much energy sent to them and a sudden desire to move, move, fucking move; your muscles tense up in readiness. So you get aches and pains all over your body. You also sweat to cool you down during your flight/fight. </p>
<p>So, like I say, everybody gets these symptoms to varying degrees when nervous/anxiety/stressed. But in an anxiety disorder your body is constantly reacting like this and your body isn't really made to be in turbo mode all the time, so you get additional symptoms -exhaustion, fatigue, confusion, brain fog, insomnia etc. Essentially, your body is just <em>knackered</em> and it's struggling because it's being pushed so hard.</p>
<p><strong>Why do antidepressants work on anxiety?</strong></p>
<p>No one knows. No one knows why antidepressants work on depression either. They also don't always work, but there's no good way of seeing who they will work for and who they won't. Many people find no benefit from medication; many others find enormous benefit from medication. </p>
<p>Some people believe that this may be because of a chemical imbalance in the brain; but another way of seeing it would be that when you are depressed/anxious, your brain creates/reuptakes different neurotransmitters in different amounts. What are depression/anxiety anyway in the physical sphere except a brain process? So it could be that by artificially disrupting the brain process that is triggered by stress/danger, you can reverse engineer the situation so that you 'trick' the brain into behaving as if it isn't under stress/danger. </p>
<p>This is already an overlong response so I will stop there. Hope it went some way to answering your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people will take SSRIs for only a period of time until their anxiety has settled, but to have an anxiety disorder, its a chronic imbalance. This can cause everything from stomach problems to pain, overwhelming fear, and so on. My neurologist did a good job of reminding me that when you get embarrassed, you blush, meaning that the blood vessels in your cheeks actually expand. This is just a little explaination of the effect that the hormones which control your &quot;feelings&quot; can affect your physical self.
I know this isn't exactly answering the rest of your question (cause it's already been answered), but that is really what anxiety is. An imbalance of chemicals in your brain. So any pain or nausea that comes with it, isn't someone being &quot;crazy&quot; it's a very real pain.
I just went through 6 doctors to find out why I've been having overwhelming pain, tremors, nausea, fatigue, vertigo (and so on),and two years and many ER visits, mris, ct scans, xrays, and LOTS of blood tested, I am diagnosed with PTSD. Turns out that the back of my mind is still processing things that have occured, even if the part of my mind which I can control, feels accepting of the trauma.
(This means that I have hormones running through me that are causing damage to my body) the mind is so very weird. I've been on anxiety meds for about 5 years already, and I'm soon going to be on other meds to help with the current situation.
I hope this helps to explain anxiety and stress disorders more. I have a genetic anxiety disorder and a stress disorder brought on by trauma. It's crazy stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; aspect of your nervous system is a highly evolved survival mechanism. The ability to instantly put your body in a ready state to deal with life threats has been a key factor in animal development. However, humans have two traits which have complicated this mechanism.</p>
<p>The first is higher brain function. We can form complex thoughts, thus materializing threats and confusing or overloading the reflex. Our ancestors risked becoming the prey of larger carnivores, whereas modern man risks unemployment or losing a parking space....yet our brains perceive those threats similarly.</p>
<p>The second is our domain over our environment. We've eliminated large carnivores from the equation. Similarly we've shaped our terrain into (mostly) harmless cities, suburbs, farms etc. Shelter protects us from all but the most extreme weather events. Science has uncovered the mystery of disease. Simply put, the lack of consistent life threatening stimuli has possibly de-calibrated the sympathetic nervous system slightly. (much like some experts suspect &quot;germophobic&quot; people have a higher chance to develop allergies due to lack of immune system exposures.) </p>
<p>I hope this helps in some respect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
