<p>cnn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's going on? A range of experts made clear to me that there isn't any one factor to explain the increase, but a number of issues, including obesity-related complications such as hypertension and diabetes, the dramatic increase in the number of cesarean section births, a lack of access to affordable, quality health care and more women giving birth at older ages. </p>
<p>Record-keeping changes might also explain some of the upward trend, experts say.
...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CNN article completely avoids mentioning what's going on in Texas, whereas,</p>
<p>time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Access is inconsistent: Between 2000 to 2015, Texas saw a spike in maternal mortality while the state also underwent changes to reproductive health services, including the closure of several clinics offering abortions and other services. In 2011, the state’s family planning budget was cut by two-thirds. Experts say the lack of access is probably not solely responsible for the state’s dramatic spike in deaths, but as The Texas Tribune reports, it may have exacerbated the issue. “I’ve done my best to try to investigate this as a data error and I can’t find any changes to account for it,” says MacDorman. “It’s very concerning what’s happening in Texas.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eclampsia is the onset of seizures (convulsions) in a woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction. Onset may be before, during, or after delivery. Most often it is during the second half of pregnancy. The seizures are of the tonic–clonic type and typically last about a minute. Following the seizure there is typically either a period of confusion or coma. Complications include aspiration pneumonia, cerebral hemorrhage, kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are part of a larger group of conditions known as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It deep-ends on what you mean by &quot;extremely large.&quot; Many abyssal creatures are gigantic compared to their shallow water water relatives.  Examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://eol.org/pages/2924326/details" target="_blank">Japanese Spider crab <em>Macrocheira kaempferi</em></a>: 18-feet across.</p>
<p><a href="http://squid.tepapa.govt.nz/anatomy/article/the-body-of-the-colossal-squid" target="_blank">Colossal Squid</a> up to 43 feet long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/giant_isopod" target="_blank">Giant Isopod</a> over a foot long, but compare that to the tiny pill bug relative.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/51103-giant-oarfish-photos.html" target="_blank">Giant Oarfish</a> up to 110 feet long.</p>
<p>It is very likely that new animals will be found in the under-explored deep sea.  This, along with the fact that there are many examples of deep sea gigantism, lead me to strongly suspect there are undescribed animals out there that are extremely large when compared to their nearest known relatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As an example we know that there is a beaked whale, the spade toothed whale, that does definitely exist. Until 2013 it was only known from certain partial skeletons found around the Pacific. In 2013 a mother and calf were washed up dead in New Zealand. They were at first misidentified and buried.  They  have since been dug up for examination. They are the only full specimens in the world of a species noone has ever seen alive. </p>
<p>If we can know nothing about a large animal (the mother was like 6.5m) like this that surfaces at least every hour then it is more than feasible to assume there are large animals we dont even have hints about yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large reduction in the cost came from the price of the active material used in the cells. The industry has traditionally been dominated by silicon panels and creating high quality crystalline silicon had been a pretty expensive process. What happened in recent years is summarized <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eHJPpcn.png" target="_blank">in this chart</a>. As the production volume spiked, the the price of panels based on c-Si eventually plummeted. This relationship is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson's_law" target="_blank">Swanson's Law</a>. In fact, prices have dropped so much that now the silicon only accounts for less than half the price of typical modules. </p>
<p>As for what may reduce the price even further, that gets more speculative. A key short-term goal is to cut down on soft costs associated with installing and maintaining the cells. These costs are often lumped together as balance of system (BOS) costs. Here again, a key factor that can reduce these costs is the scale and maturity of the industry. For example, Germany which has been at this game longer already than the US has significantly lower BOS costs (e.g. see <a href="http://blog.rmi.org/blog_2013_12_05_can_usa_solar_cost_compete_with_germany" target="_blank">this article</a>). </p>
<p>edit: To move further out in the long term, things get even more speculative. It is possible that eventually that a new kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_solar_cell" target="_blank">thin film PV technology</a> will complement or supplant silicon PV. The advantage of such cells is that they could be flexible and more lightweight than silicon panels. These benefits in turn could potentially cut down on material and installation costs yet further. For example, so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite_solar_cell" target="_blank">perovskite PV cells</a> have shown promise in recent years in terms of efficiency, although stability remains a major concern. In addition to the active material itself, storage is still a huge stumbling block for solar energy to gain an increasingly larger share of the grid. Better and cheaper storage is key to deliver a steady supply to the grid in spite of daily and seasonal fluctuations in how much light we get from the Sun <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZLmlPZt.gif" target="_blank">e.g. shown here for Golden, Co.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>While conventional wisdom here is 'better batteries' another way of addressing this problem is a better power grid.  </p>
<p>Not so much smarter as simply one that allow for much longer distance power transfer/markets via more high voltage lines.  This allows you to build solar in places where it's very sunny but there are few people nearby which makes it cheaper.  Same with wind.  It allows stabilizes both power sources since as you increase the area of your sample, the average power from solar and wind together is much more stable.  This is because weather generally travels in bands and averages out over distance, and wind and solar are somewhat negatively-correlated (it's generally sunny when it's not windy, and the reverse).</p>
<p>(Example from Britain of anti-negatively: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277334313_The_climatological_relationships_between_wind_and_solar_energy_supply_in_Britain" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277334313_The_climatological_relationships_between_wind_and_solar_energy_supply_in_Britain</a>)</p>
<p>High voltage power lines are not a technology that needs to be invented and obstacles are mostly political.  Example: A state doesn't want to buy all their power from a windier state next door, they'd much rather buy wind from less-windy and efficient sites in their own state for the tax revenue and jobs.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that solar energy depends on solar technology -- and like all electronic-based technologies, it continues to become more efficient and less expensive. </p>
<p>Bloomberg just posted <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuels" target="_blank">a really informative article</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>A couple of money quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason solar-power generation will increasingly dominate: <strong>It’s a technology, not a fuel.</strong> As such, efficiency increases and prices fall as time goes on. What's more, the price of batteries to store solar power when the sun isn't shining is falling in a similarly stunning arc. </p>
<p>Just since 2000, the amount of global electricity produced by solar power has doubled seven times over. Even wind power, which was already established, doubled four times over the same period. For the first time, the two forms of renewable energy are beginning to compete head-to-head on price and annual investment.</p>
<p>... Government subsidies have helped wind and solar get a foothold in global power markets, but economies of scale are the true driver of falling prices: <strong>The cost of solar power has fallen to 1/150th of its level in the 1970s, while the total amount of installed solar has soared 115,000-fold.</strong>   [Emphasis added.]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>actually, clicking the box is a rather trivial part of what those CAPTCHAs are looking for.  What they're actually looking for are things like:</p>
<p>did the 'user' instantly move their mouse to the exact coordinates of the box, or did they traverse thru the page like a human would?  </p>
<p>is the user scrolling to the box, or are they remotely executing javascript to trigger a scroll to the box?</p>
<p>how long after page load did the user find the box? Too quickly is obviously a red flag, but taking too long is also. commonly, to get around reCAPTCHA you'll need to find out 4-5 areas to click in addition to the initial click. The way that most people do this is using CAPTCHA services, which are real people solving them and returning the answer to you (i.e. for a text captcha, you'd send them the image and they'd send back the letters/numbers).  The way you do this with reCAPTCHA is sending a screenshot of the computer, and you are returned the coords that you're supposed to click on to answer the question properly. [e: apparently this method is old, and a new method where the CAPTCHA is actually served up to the person within the service that will solve it for you!] However, it usually doesn't take a legitimate human 5 minutes to answer a few questions about 9 images.  if you take too long, they'll make you do another image check challenge.</p>
<p>basically, it's really, really difficult to make a bot move the mouse, scroll, and react naturally to a page load. and even if you do manage to fool reCAPTCHA, you'll be thrown to a few image tasks which may serve to block you out from the website completely, due to the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>e: as others have mentioned, this type of stuff is only part of what reCAPTCHA relies on to determine human/non-human - particularly, your referring information &amp; whether or not you have a logged in Google account.</p>
<p>e2: there are a bunch of people claiming that mouse movement tracking is impossible to do. in chrome, hit ctrl+shift+j, paste</p>
<blockquote>
<p>onmousemove = function(e){console.log(&quot;mouse location:&quot;, e.clientX, e.clientY)}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in, and hit enter. then move the mouse. it's easily done.</p>
<p>e3: there are <em>still</em> a ton of people claiming that I just made up the ability to track end user mouse movements. <a href="http://www.javascriptsource.com/page-details/mouse-coordinates.html" target="_blank">http://www.javascriptsource.com/page-details/mouse-coordinates.html</a> is another example</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google is great at keeping its algorithms a secret, so we'll probably never know for sure, but we can make some guesses. </p>
<p>One thought is to track a users mouse and keyboard actions and see if that is consistent with a human, but I'm not entirely sure this is the system that it uses since it would be easy to replicate such actions with a simple bot.</p>
<p>I'm partial to the idea that Google is taking advantage of it's massive database of what you've been doing on the web the last few minutes. Have you checked your GMail? Made some Google searches for a new cat sweater? That's all stuff a human would do, and I am able to associate your captcha request with your previous internet requests and see you're probably human.</p>
<p>Of course, if this is a brand new computer connecting from an IP that has just been assigned, you probably don't have the sufficient background for Google to think you're human, so you'll receive a more difficult captcha to solve.</p>
<p>This means that if a bot was to check off that box, it wouldn't follow the history pattern we associate with a human and Google would return a further captcha check which the bot would fail. Usually these secondary captchas are going to be some sort of computer vision problems that would involve far too much resource intensive computing to solve.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a Google blog that gives you a bit of info (but of course nothing particularly useful) <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html" target="_blank">https://security.googleblog.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html</a></p>
<p>Edit2: Somebody tried to see if they can pretend to be a bot and see what would happen. Turns out that without having sufficient history, he was blocked out of a site he could normal access without captcha: <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/101906" target="_blank">http://security.stackexchange.com/a/101906</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As far as I've heard, Google is able to replace an actual CAPTCHA with this simple textbox only if they know enough stuff about you - This little checkbox is basically a plugin from google, thus (via cookies, sessions, knowing your IP etc) google knows on what pages you surfed in the time before arriving at that CAPTCHA. Knowing that you surfed for dank memes for the past 3 hours, Google can be pretty sure you're not a robot - having to actually click on that box is basically only for &quot;enabling&quot; that plugin.</p>
<p>If google doesn't know enough about you, they will by the way simply show the original reCAPTCHA, where you solve OCR (or street number recognition) tasks for Google (Streetview). You can simply test that by restarting your router, using incognito mode and going to a website using reCAPTCHA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I DO know that specifically for the Google CAPTCHAs, it checks if you're logged in to a Google account and if your account has had suspicious activity recently. If no suspicious activity has been logged, you'll simply receive the check box, if there has, or you're not logged in, you'll get a more difficult prompt, such as the picture matching. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually read a paper about fooling the recaptcha system awhile ago.</p>
<p>When you get the check box you're getting one of several possible &quot;challenges&quot;. To get the box challenges you must pass automated tests such as checks for common frameworks commonly used with bots, not being from an IP that's failed a challenge or answered too many boxes on other web sites among other things. As mentioned above once the chance of you being a bot is assessed to be low before page loads then you get a simple challenge. Depending on these pre assessed factors (some which are only known to google) the difficulty of the captcha is determined.</p>
<p>So as mentioned above clicking the check box is easy and there are minimal protections such as mouse movement patterns and timings however, by the time you get the check box challenge it's been determined that the odds of you being a bit are so low that the test it's self can afford to be weak.</p>
<p>In this case text is the hardest challenge, images the medium challenge and the check box the minimal challenge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My comment talks about the concept of punishment in very general terms and tells you to make your own mind up. Thanks to /u/NothingtobeDon3 for pointing out that I'd become the top comment somehow.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you're thinking about punishment, it's worth considering punishment <em>in general</em>. There are five purposes typically associated with punishments, but often we as individuals can only think of one or two, when asked. The five purposes of any punishment, whether we're talking about unruly children or criminal adults, are one of more of: incapacitation, restitution, retribution, rehabilitation, and deterrence.</p>
<p><strong>Incapacitation</strong> is <em>stopping somebody from doing it (or other unacceptable behaviour) again</em>. Suspension from school achieves this goal by taking the child out of school: there's no way that they can break school rules when they're not there! Consider also punishments like losing privileges (being forbidden from doing something, or having something confiscated if you misuse it) or imprisonment (keeping you out of the way of possible victims), both of which are incapacitating.</p>
<p><strong>Restitution</strong> is getting something back for the victim of somebody who misbehaves, to compensate them for that which they've been deprived. Suspension probably doesn't achieve this, although you could argue that in the absence of the unruly child the other children each gain a larger slice of the teacher's time and attention. But if you do something wrong and you break something of somebody else's and you have to buy them a replacement, or if you have to pay a fine part of which goes to the victim of your misdeeds, that's restitution.</p>
<p><strong>Retribution</strong> is about fulfilling the sense of 'getting your own back' that most of us feel, and it's a major part of what we as a civilisation talk about when we say we  want justice. It doesn't have to be 'an eye for an eye' - losing something the same as, or equal value to, what your victim has lost - and in practice it's more efficient to run disciplinary systems (whether we're taking about schools or justice departments) with a simple and unimaginative system of punishments: consider the sheer number of different possible crimes in your country and then consider the fact that the vast majority of them are probably punished by fines and/or prison (or depending where you are in the world, corporal or capital punishment). There's an element of this to suspension from school (excluding somebody from their social group is a form of retribution), but the retribution is perhaps mostly against the <em>parents</em> of the child, who may have to arrange other forms of childcare, for example: this in turn may encourage the application of secondary punishments from the parents (&quot;You got suspended‽ No TV or video games for two weeks!&quot;). Those who feel that our prisons are unnecessarily pleasant (or who call for greater application of corporal/capital punishment or for more inclusion of victims in the sentencing process) are often thinking that retribution is the primary objective of punishment. </p>
<p><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> is about giving offenders the means to live normally and return to the group from which they came. It's one of the hardest elements of punishment to get right. For some offenders and especially children, it can be sufficient to encourage empathy and personally provide restitution: for example &quot;You deliberately broke Alice's favourite toy: I think you should say sorry and give her <em>your</em> favourite toy to play with for today, and then tomorrow we'll use your pocket money to buy her a new one.&quot; provides restitution, retribution, and helps the offender to understand what they've done and how it affects others, aiding rehabilitation. Encouraging empathy as a mechanism for rehabilitation can be tougher in adults, and furthermore some commit crimes with no clear identifiable victim (making empathy harder), but other techniques are available. Combating the causes of misbehaviour can help, such as reducing social exclusion, teaching the skills necessary to integrate, breaking down barriers, and providing more-satisfying life opportunities. In some cases, medicine can help, by providing offenders with a balance of brain-chemicals that makes it easier to control their behaviour. Rehabilitation can be a factor in school suspensions, if we assume that he parents of the child will take responsibility for administering an appropriate programme of rehabilitation... but in practice that might be unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>Deterrence</strong> is about reducing the likelihood that misbehaviour will occur in the first place, because of the perceived risk of getting caught and/or punished. Deterrence is a major factor in many people's decision as to whether or not they will commit some offences (other offences, though, might simply be unthinkable to many of us regardless of whether or not they were considered crimes: we just consider them <em>morally wrong</em>). The risk of suspension can act as a deterrent to other children for the reasons described above, especially those under retribution and to a lesser extent those under rehabilitation and incapacitation. It's worth noting though that study after study have shown that, in adults and in children, the <em>severity</em> of retribution associated with misbehaviour does not have a very large impact on its deterrence factor: it doesn't matter whether exceeding the speed limit attracts a fine of £100 or £1,000 or whether buying drugs gets you 10 months or 10 years in prison... most of the people who were going to do it will do it anyway: there's a threshold of punishment after which increasing the punishment yields diminishing returns.</p>
<p>When you ask people &quot;What is punishment for?&quot; they'll usually only be able to identify one or two, maybe three, of these important factors, which shows that people often have very specific and sometimes polarised ideas about how we should as a society maintain discipline (whether of children or adults). But while we may disagree on the relative weights of the importance of the different factors, we must agree that they're all important in some way.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and here on Reddit, we punish people who disobey subreddit (or site) rules with incapacitation (sub bans, site bans, shadowbans, moderation), retribution (downvotes as a mechanism to exclude from conversation and to socially ostracise), and occasional rehabilitation (education as to the rules of the site, &quot;remember the human&quot; empathy building, temporary bans to give time to reflect), and maintain deterrence via the (some would argue weak) threats of the above. See: we're a society too, just like a school or a country.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: In considering what a punishment is <em>for</em>, consider it in terms of whether it achieves any or all of: incapacitation, restitution, retribution, rehabilitation, or deterrence. This provides the tools to answer not only this question but also every other &quot;why punish <em>this</em> way?&quot; question too.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Typo. Shouldn't have done this on my phone.</p>
<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Another typo. As amusing as cake fines are, I really shouldn't trust my phone's autocorrect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My son is not autistic, but he has very similar traits and is definitely a special needs kid.  He doesn't know how to properly interact with other people and has trouble controlling his emotions.  When he feels emotionally hurt, or threatened, or feels like he doesn't have control over his situation he quickly escalates to an angry and violent state.  He screams, bites, and kicks.  He tries to run away.  He is very difficult to bring back under control, so often the school staff decide to suspend him.</p>
<p>From the staff's point of view this the only way to handle the situation.  Schools are understaffed as it is, and when my kid goes off they just can't spare someone to wrangle him back under control, especially if he's being violent.  They need to get the class back in order and keep the other kids focused on learning.  They need to make sure the students and staff are all safe from harm.  Suspension is absolutely the right thing for them to do when my son is out of control.</p>
<p>However, on our side things are a bit different.  My son feels safe and comfortable at home.  He's scared of the other kids and the difficult social situations they put him in.  He resents teachers and staff he's not comfortable with taking control of his day and pushing his boundaries.  When he's home none of that pressure is on him.  It doesn't matter how miserable I make his day when I bring him home, he'd still rather be there than at school.</p>
<p>I've tried making him do all the school work he was going to do that day.  I've tried making him do a boot-camp style workout.  I've tried making him help me do chores around the house.  I've tried talking and talking with him.  I've tried yelling.  Hell, I've tried spanking.  He always looses any special privileges like TV, video games, or toys, but it doesn't help. Once he's home, nothing works.  He just can't associate the punishments at home with the poor choices at school.  His mind just doesn't make that connection.  Maybe it's too long of a delay between action and reaction, I don't know.  He can't see the punishments as consequences for his actions, so he sees it as having a hard day and then dad bringing him home and treating him like crap.  Somehow that little boy would still prefer a shitty afternoon at home to a good day at school.</p>
<p>It's a tough situation for everyone.  The school has to protect their students and staff, but at the same time they're teaching my son that if he's uncomfortable with his situation he can just hurt someone and get to go home.  Obviously that's not the intended lesson, but it's what he gets out of it.  The school knows how he perceives going home, but what choice do they have?  Being suspended is a reward for him, no matter how bad I make his day at home.  I know consciously that suspension is the right choice for the rest of the kids, but I can't help feeling a bit selfish and wishing there was a choice that was better for my son.  Also, suspension forces me to leave work, reschedule appointments, and screws up my day (or days).  I hate wasting my time just to teach my kid the wrong lesson.  The things he needs to learn are at school, not home, so it's a waste of his time, too.  The whole situation is mind bogglingly frustrating.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  Suspension can be difficult for everyone, especially if the child has special needs.</p>
<p>Edit for all the people still messaging me:</p>
<p>1- My child has been extensively tested, observed, and analyzed by both the school and a team of doctors at the local childhood development clinic.  They all agreed that he does not have autism or aspergers.  His doctor chose to give him a diagnosis of ADHD to qualify my son for special education benefits, not because it was an accurate diagnosis or reflected his actual condition in any way.  He is continuously evaluated and the doctors will revise his diagnosis if necessary.  I appreciate your stories and the support you've given, but please stop diagnosing my child and leave it to the professionals.</p>
<p>2- We already have an IEP in place.  He is getting help and I do not believe the school is failing him.  We continue to tweak the IEP to ensure his needs are met.  The staff and teachers bend over backwards to help my son.  I'm impressed with the improvements they have helped my son achieve so far and I think they're on the path to future successes.  My post was not written to complain about the school, merely to show how frustrating and difficult our situation can be.  I appreciate all the advice in this area, and I have absolutely learned things from your comments.</p>
<p>3-  I said that I TRIED spanking and other things to highlight my desperation, not to describe my daily routine.  I do not abuse my son, and I did not continue spanking him.  I don't believe I'm a failure of a parent for spanking my kid one time, but if that's your opinion, so be it.</p>
<p>4- Yes, we have tried positive reinforcement rather than punishment.  It's my preferred method of raising the kid, and seems to work well with his brother.  However, when he's giving teachers bruises and making kids bleed I HAVE to acknowledge what he's done and find a way to make him understand that it's wrong.  I did not punish him to make him feel bad for things outside of his control.  I tried to make suspension a negative thing in his mind so that maybe he'd finally make the connection that hurting people is not a solution, but a greater problem.  I know how strong positive reinforcement can be, and I appreciate the suggestions you all have shared, but my son needs more than that to realize that he can't hurt people when he's scared or angry.  My son isn't &quot;throwing temper tantrums&quot;, he's having a fight or flight response to things that wouldn't normally require one.  That's why it's so hard to teach him not to hurt, and why positive reinforcement hasn't proven to be enough.</p>
<p>5-  My son is a twin.  His brother has no special needs and does really well socially at school.  The twin has been greatly affected by the difficulties my son has had, and every decision we make about our home life or educational situation requires that we take the needs of both children into account.  Because of that homeschooling or a special needs school is just not an option.  Maybe that will change in the future.  I appreciate all your suggestions, though.</p>
<p>When I posted this reply I was just trying to show OP that yes, sometimes suspension is what the kid wants and doesn't help them learn, but is still often necessary.  I ended up venting a lot of my frustration into my reply.  I never expected it to receive 1000s of upvotes or a gilding.  I am amazed by, and truly grateful for, all the support and advice that people have shared with me.  At the same time, it's really difficult to read messages saying that my son should die or that I need to &quot;old yeller him&quot;.  Those kinds of things are fucking awful and people who send them should be ashamed of themselves.  I'm all for constructive criticism, though, so if you can disagree with me without being an asshole, by all means, go for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>17 year school admin (Asst. Principal for 10, Principal for 7) here, so I feel like it's my time to shine on reddit!  A lot of the replies here are good, but are missing some pieces.  Yes, suspension has a role, especially where the law says it's mandatory for the offense. In the case where it absolutely keeps kids safe or keeps the learning environment intact, it is a necessary thing.   </p>
<p>That said, suspension has been very, very overused throughout education history, and the thinking about it has changed over the last few years, much for the better.   In cases where the above conditions aren't true, there's really not much of a point to suspension.  It doesn't help kids learn or stay safe, it costs the offender learning, which fixes nothing, and it usually has no causality with the offense.   In non-safety/ mandatory uses, it only aims to give everyone a break, which sounds kinda nice, but is bad for actual student growth and learning.  In short, it rarely really does anything to change behavior, outside of a kid basically scared they could be suspended again.   In shorter, outside of the deterrent effect, it doesn't do shit.   </p>
<p>The goal of disciplinary systems used to be to keep order, whereas they should be to CHANGE the behavior for the better, so it doesn't happen again, and suspensions for stupid shit rarely do that.  There are MUCH better ways to educate towards changing a behavior than suspension.   Furthermore, suspension very much is handed disproportionately to students of color, boys, students at a socio-economic disadvantage, and students with special needs.   In my experience, what ends up happening is the discussion with the parents ends up being about the appropriateness of the consequence rather than what the kid actually did and what needs to change for that kid.   </p>
<p>tl;dr:  Suspensions for safety, mandatory by law stuff are fine and sometimes necessary, other than that, they're kinda dumb.  </p>
<p>Edit:   Wow! Thank you so much for the gold, and I hope the gilders have an especially great New Year.   The response for this have been crazy, and to think I was trying not to talk about work on the Winter Break.   Anyway, lots of responses from people who got suspended for dumb stuff and lots of people who see suspension as a necessary thing as well.   All good, the hope is we at least think through what effect we're creating in our kids and we have a purpose when we react to what kids do.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Removes a potentially dangerous or disruptive child from school.</p>
</li>
<li>Wake up call from the school to the parent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately most repeat offenders aren't going to care about some other scolding from mom and a chance to not be expected to go to school.</p>
<p>As a teacher though, I've found that kids that have behavior problems are the ones that typically never miss a day of school nor do they want to. For disruptive kids, school may be the only place where they're getting attention.</p>
<p>EDIT: To be clear, OSS has been found to be largely ineffective for repeat offenders (the basis of this question), though its effects as a looming consequence for others has been less conclusive. </p>
<p>Most schools nowadays are trending towards training teachers in counseling skills to attempt to deal with issues in the classroom, but these are either expensive to do right (counseling skills require sometimes extensive training, teachers I highly recommend the Flippen Group's <em>Capturing Kids' Hearts</em>) or are ineffectively taught (district sends one person to a seminar who then teaches it to others and so on). </p>
<p>However to truly bring down OSS numbers staffing of counselors is a major issue. Most schools have cut dedicated counseling positions since 2008 and the result has been disastrous. Please support your local schools by petitioning your state for an increase in funds to school districts and by asking schools boards to restore these cut positions (as well as seeking counseling training for all teachers). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has taught young and troubled kids before, suspension is more about moving the responsibility onto the parents.</p>
<p>When you're teaching a class of 40 kids and one child is being so undisciplined that you have to spend most of your time keeping him in line just to get through the day, you have to weigh your options. Do I keep trying to work with this child, knowing that all of these other kids will suffer? Or do I try to move this problem onto someone else knowing that the child in question will suffer and probably not improve?</p>
<p>I tried to never kick kids out of my classes, but there just is not enough time for it. All of those other students - those deserve your time and attention just as much. Kids who are quiet and obedient shouldn't suffer because one kid needs to constantly play the clown and impress his friends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a source right now but if I remember correctly adding a massive amount of water to the sun would actually make it burn hotter. The reason is that at these scales we can't think of water as something that extinguishes fire. What's going on in a star is a nuclear fusion reaction triggered by the massive amount of energy coming from the combined gravitational pull of all the components of the star. So by adding a massive amount of water to the star you're adding a lot of weight which means more gravitational energy meaning more fusion. You're also adding fuel that can be fused in the form of water molecules. </p>
<p>Soeone please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm by no means an authority on the subject but I remember seeing something like this on a PBS spacetime video a while ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So if it gets hot enough, some of that light is now going to be in the visible spectrum, since it will be energetic enough to produce red light (but not much of a higher wavelength like green or blue light).</p>
<p>If you keep heating it, it will get yellower and yellower as more yellow light gets emitted (relative to the other energy it is emitting).</p>
<p>Eventually it does reach a point where it emitting enough higher energy light that it has a considerable amount of green or blue light being emitted. However, at this point, so much light is being emitted (and a lot of it is still red light) that the object will just appear white to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called black body radiation. Objects that aren't at absolute zero have thermal energy. The electrons present are constantly gaining and losing energy - which is emitted as light, one photon at a time. The color/wavelength of a photon is determined by how much energy it has. An electron will emit basically any energy it gets, almost immediately. At higher temperatures, more of the electrons can occasionally attain higher levels of energy and therefore emit &quot;hotter&quot; colors, but more electrons are gaining and losing the lesser quanta also.</p>
<p>We can only see a tiny range of light energy - from red (lower energy) to blue and violet (higher energy). Infrared, microwaves, and radio are examples of low energy light, below our threshold, while ultraviolet and x-rays are &quot;high energy&quot; colors of light. Anyways, even cold objects emit this thermal radiation, and continue to emit it in addition to that red glow. When you see red-hot metal, it's infringing into the visible spectrum, but there's far more light being emitted that we can't see - red is just the edge of the spectrum of light being produced by that hot knife. As it becomes even hotter, the spectrum shifts, we see even more red light in addition to the higher energy colors.</p>
<p>Because of the way human vision works, we don't see these colors separately. Instead, colors add up to appear more white. Ever see an RGB projector?</p>
<p>On a side note, that blue sky you see is actually mostly violet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/blackbody-spectrum/blackbody-spectrum_en.html" target="_blank">interactive tool</a> illustrates it pretty well. Every object in a room emits light at not just one wavelength, but across a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Changing the object's temperature will shift the <em>predominant</em> wavelength being emitted, but the other wavelengths continue to be emitted as well. That's why you get a transition from red to orange to white to blue, rather than a full cycle through the rainbow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When something is heated the atoms or molecules respond by moving more and in different ways. Air doesn't glow a color until it gets really really hot because it can move in 3d space, vibrate, bend (such as in water vapor), or rotate (but not about an axis of symmetry such as along the bonds between oxygen or nitrogen in the diatomic molecules of oxygen or nitrogen).</p>
<p>But metals (such as steel in a knife) are bound together in a lattice, they cannot move the way air can, so most of that heat energy goes to exciting electrons or vibration. Every atom or molecule has different energy states that electrons can occupy. When the energetic electrons go back to their less energetic ground state they release the energy as a photon that often is in the red spectrum. </p>
<p>However some metals can produce other colors and any impurities would cause different colors as well. Because each of these elements or atoms can have  different energy levels available to their electrons that may or may not be available to those in iron or carbon. And a lot of energy can cause a lot of different energy levels being accessible causing a white light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
