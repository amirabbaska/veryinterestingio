		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take my example from the experimental ITER reactor being built in France, which is the largest and most sophisticated fusion experiment to date.</p>
<p>In the case of magnetic confinement fusion, the plasma itself is quite rarefied, though pressures may approach atmospheric pressure in the hottest central parts of the plasma. Moreover the purpose of magnetic confinement is to prevent fuel atoms from ever colliding with the walls of the reactor, except rarely, so near the edges of the walls a high vacuum is still maintained. </p>
<p>Note that the extremely high magnetic field exerts a net force on the plasma pushing it back from the walls and causing it's pressure to increase as you reach the center of the discharge.</p>
<p>When the confinement is working properly, most of the heating of the interior of the reactor is due to thermal radiation emitted by the plasma (generally in the range of ultraviolet and x-rays.)  This heat input is quite substantial, but manageable from an engineering standpoint.</p>
<p>Instabilities with the magnetic field may cause atoms in the plasma to impinge on the shielding at a far higher rate which can cause rapid erosion of the material through the process of <em>Sputtering.</em> This also contaminates the fuel with impurities which poses it's own problems.</p>
<p>Probably the greatest technical challenge for magnetic confinement is  controlling plasma instabilities, that may cause loss of confinement.</p>
<p>Most of the interior of the reactor is composed of thermal shielding which is liquid cooled, by water or nitrogen for example. Beneath the shielding blanket are typically secondary field coils used to manipulate the plasma in various ways. These are ordinary copper. Heating effects beneath the shielding blanket tend to not be severe unless there is a total failure of one or more of the shielding blocks. </p>
<p>Beneath that are the structural support walls of the reaction chamber.</p>
<p>In the case of the ITER reactor. The reaction chamber is, in turn, surrounded by what amounts to a huge, sophisticated vacuum chamber. That is, a Dewar Flask. This is known as the Cryostat.  The cryostat contains the superconducting primary field coil assemblies. There produce the more-or-less permanent high magnetic field that is needed for a reasonable confinement efficiency. </p>
<p>Note that a high vacuum is an extremely good insulator, one merely needs to block thermal radiation, conduction and convection heat transfer doesn't happen.</p>
<p>In ITER, the primary magnetic field coils are square tubes filled with liquid helium cooled to about 4 kelvin, and containing the superconducting windings. The vacuum of the cryostat acts as effective insulation for the helium filled coils.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>On earth we have heatsinks. We can easily use a lake as a heatsink. In space you do not have efficient heatsinks. Instead, all the energy has to be either reflected or radiated away. This is far more difficult than cooling say a few tens of megawatts with evoparative cooling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In a full-scale operational magnetic confinement fusion reactor, there will also be specifically designed plasma facing materials and shielding to prevent interactions between the plasma and the vacuum chamber walls.   Additonally, the plasma is confined by the magnetic field so that very little of the plasma will actually touch the walls.</p>
<p>The first working fusion power plants will be designed very carefully to direct energy away from sensitive components and put that energy to good use for boiling water to turn the electric turbines (if we don't perfect direct energy conversion first).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

High frequencies have short wavelengths, small enough for the electromagnetic waves to pass through the empty space in the matter.  This is why high frequencies are damaging to living cells - the wavelength is literally short enough to pierce DNA like a knife, slicing it apart.</p>
<p>Low frequencies, like HF radio, have long enough wavelengths that they pass around objects like walls unimpeded, in the same way that a small rock sticking up from the ocean floor doesn't disrupt a large wave crashing into the shore.</p>
<p>Many frequencies have wavelengths that are too long to penetrate the spaces between atoms/molecules, but not long enough to pass around the entire object unimpeded.  So they get blocked.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thinking of a photon as a particle is something of a barrier to this discussion .  Instead, think of light as a wave providing a ‘kick’ to the electron in an atom as a rate related to its energy.  The macroscopic analogy would be pushing a kid on a swing.  But not the way you’d usually push a kid.  Instead you’re pushing the child from the front and then the back and then the front and so on.  It’s not a perfect analogy but it illustrates how resonance doesn’t create an effect for high and low frequency. </p>
<p>If you push back and forth too quickly the child doesn’t go anywhere since every little push forward is immediately canceled by a push backward.  This means that the light...  er...  adult pushing the child...  isn’t having any effect on the atom’s electrons...  er...  child.</p>
<p>By contrast,  if you push back an forth too slowly you’re equally likely to be pushing against motion as you are with the motion.  Again, no effect on the electron/child.</p>
<p>Only when the adult/light pushes forward when the child/election is moving forward and backward when the child/electron is moving backward does the swinging build up height.  This is resonance.</p>
<p>The analogy of a child in a swing isn’t perfect because the person pushing has their own internal energy source (chemical entry from food). For electrons in matter, if there’s a build up of motion in the electron then that energy has to come somewhere.  The source of this energy is a reduction in the electromagnetic field’s energy which you think of as the light being absorbed by the material.  More material means more absorption, but only if the material can interact with the field at just the right rate.</p>
<p>TL;DR - if the electromagnetic field jiggles electrons too quickly or too slowly they won’t respond with an increase in motion which means the light passes right through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more ELI am a teenager. I'm sorry, but it's the best I can do.</p>
<p>When a material fails, it can fail in two different ways. One way is for the material to deform which is caused by the atoms in that material moving past one another. This is called plastic flow. The other way, is for a crack in the material to propagate all the way through the material cleaving it into two different pieces. This is called crack propagation.</p>
<p>In general, failure of a material is heavily dependent on its atomic structure. In some types of materials their susceptibility to fail from plastic flow is heavily temperature dependent, while its susceptibility to failure through crack propagation is not. When these types of materials get cold they lose their ability to fail due to plastic flow (which is synonymous with their ability to deform), and so crack propagation takes over. When a material fails through crack propagation instead of through plastic flow, we call this a brittle fracture. Materials that show this change in susceptibility to plastically flow are said to go through a <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/source/html/50809/media/fig1.png" target="_blank"><em>&quot;ductile to brittle transition.&quot;</em></a></p>
<p>What this means is that some materials when they are warm fail due to plastic flow but when they get cold they begin to fail in a brittle fashion.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I will add that almost all materials become more brittle as they get colder, but some materials still stay what we would consider ductile as their temperature drops. This is due to the fact that plastic flow becomes easier when atoms are further apart which is the case when a material is warmer. Atoms are vibrating more quickly, and so on average they are farther apart from one another in a warmer material. Because of this they can slide past one another more easily, which is essential for a material to deform. Conversely, a material that is brittle will fail without deforming much at all... It will simply crack all the way through.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, it’s more of a question of <em>when</em> a material gets brittle, not if.
That said, the reason the temperature varies is that the atoms can be arranged in different ways that can then move (dissipate energy) in different ways. The best example I can think of is casserole.
Imagine a casserole made of small regularly shaped noodles like penne. Put it in the refrigerator. If you tried to break off a piece with your hands, it’d be pretty easy (brittle). Now imagine making be same dish but using spaghetti...suddenly when you try to break off a piece, it is tangled with the rest of of the casserole and doesn’t break off as easily or cleanly (ductile)! That said, if you put it in the freezer instead of just the fridge, it’d probably break in either case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Y’all need to chill about brittle transitions and glass transitions. You need to take it back to what’s causing all of this in the first place.
Energetics and kinetics. </p>
<p>Yes bcc metals will often be more ductile than hcp bc of slip planes in the system. Yes metals are more ductile bc of metallic bonding. Yes polymers experience a glass transition that allows for polymer flow to begin. Sure whatever fine. </p>
<p>Elit: But the reason materials fail in a brittle fashion in colder temperatures is because it’s more convenient to break bonds than it is to create more disorder in the system. </p>
<p>go look at a stress strain curve and take the integral. The area under the curve is the toughness of the material, how much work it can take before failure. Work and heat are the similar, and heat capacity is dependent on temperature. Hotter the material, more work can be done. How much the heat capacity varies in temperature determines how much more brittle it will be as it gets colder. </p>
<p>Then compare to what is favorable, adding entropy in forms of dislocation, or break a bond. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The sunscreens with chemical active ingredients are usually cheaper than the ones that contain physical active ingredients. You can find out why if you research more, as it gets more involved! </p>
<p>Edit: someone also pointed out that physical ingredients are classified as &quot;inorganic&quot;, and chemical ones &quot;organic&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sunscreen works by combining organic and inorganic active ingredients. Inorganic ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium oxide reflect or scatter ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Organic ingredients like octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) or oxybenzone absorb UV radiation, dissipating it as heat. Some sunscreens protect us from the two types of damaging UV radiation: UV-A and UV-B. Both UV-A and UV-B cause sunburns and damaging effects such as skin cancer.</p>

B causes more apparent damage and A causes less obvious damage like eye damage and skin cancer. UV B is a shorter wavelength and in turn is higher energy. Imagine a tiny little wrecking ball. UV C also exists but is involved with the ozone layer. Hope this helps explain what exactly is being blocked. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The depressed mind is severely hindered in making new connections. New connections between new experiences and memories are how we function and grow as people. We're wired to crave novelty and to learn. We are also pattern-matchers without peer. </p>
<p>Unable to make connections, the depressed mind turns to pattern-matching instead. Every sad and horrid thing that happens just confirms to the depressed mind that the world is a horrible place. Everything that might challenge that is dismissed or written off as a fluke. This is called confirmation bias, and it is a very powerful thing. And nothing challenges it, because they cannot make the new connections necessary to shift their thought process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are portions of the brain, however, that relate to specific visual fields. These neurons would be repurposed in an individual with vision loss. </p>
<p>For someone with one-sided hearing loss, they would lose the ability to determine location of sounds, since the brain uses the minuscule time difference between the sound arriving in each ear to determine location. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/304/eyes1.gif" target="_blank">http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/304/eyes1.gif</a></p>
<p>Notice how its wired up. </p>
<p>So when neurologists investigate how sight works, they may use a screen that blocks one half of the visual field of both eyes, left and left or right and right, thus blocking imagery going to one half of the occipital lobe.</p>
<p>So, you'd have to read with one half of an eye or half of both eyes to investigate differences in visual processing. As far as I know here's no difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of rational mathematical constants but the only ones most people have usually heard of are the ones that are given special names.</p>
<p>It is because mathematical constants are only given special names, such as π because they possess a feature called transcendentality. This means that there is no way of expressing them using rational numbers and the operations of division, multiplication, addition, subtraction or exponents, which means, in order to use them, they must be given special symbols or names to identify them.</p>
<p>Since transcendentality implies irrationality, since by the definition you can't express transcendental numbers by the quotient of 2 other rational numbers making them also irrational, this means that most numbers the general public have heard of are irrational</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because almost every number is irrational. If you randomly choose a number, then there is a 100% chance that it will not be rational (doesn't mean that it can't happen, but you probably shouldn't bet on it). So unless there is a specific reason that would bias a number to being rational, then you can expect it to be irrational.</p>
<p>EDIT: This is a heuristic, which means that it broadly and inexactly explains a phenomena at an intuitive level. Generally, there is no all-encompassing reason for most constants to be irrational, each constant has its own reason to be irrational, but this gives us a good way to understand what is going on and to make predictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of folks noticed that the plume looked a lot like a contrail at first, then ballooned outwards later.</p>
<p>As the rocket reached higher and higher altitude, there's less ambient air pressure to push against the rocket exhaust coming out of the engine, so the plume is able to expand much farther - this is what gives the plume its characteristic balloon shape.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Since a lot of folks are asking what the &quot;bright dot&quot; was on the inside of the balloon structure:</p>
<p>That was the separation of the reusable primary stage. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE5C3O71Xqo&amp;t=2m18s" target="_blank">In this high-res video</a> you can actually see the primary stage end (when the thrust goes dark), the secondary stage ignite (when the thrust goes bright again), and then the bright dot of the separated first stage lagging behind and dropping a bit. Note that it doesn't just drop like a rock, since it's also on a ballistic trajectory - it takes some time to lag behind and start falling. If you look closely, you can also see some spiral waves coming out from it, presumably because it's tumbling around while thrusting a bit to control its eventual descent.</p>
<p>Eventually that first stage will land and be used again. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/69PZxU9.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a schematic</a> of how all of the above actually works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Great view of Sunlight plume. Probably the best view people has ever seen of a rocket launch. You only see this when you launch at a late hour just after sunset or in the morning just before dawn. Try imagining where the sun is in the video and then you get why its only lighting up high flying objects or exhaust plumes in this scenario. When the earth rotates another hour, the sunlight would be blocked completely be earth and we would see only the fire from exhaust not the smoke light up like in the video. When rockets launch at daytime, the smoke plume gets illuminated just as in this video. But against an already bright sky it does not look super bright or glowing.﻿</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the videos going around, the plume changes and then has wisps inside of it due to the first and second stage separating, and possibly to the fairings getting jettisoned.  The second stage plume is hitting the first stage and/or fairings.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello, I worked at a satellite operator for some years, so I should hopefully be able to answer this :)</p>
<p>Satellite operators (people like Eutelsat, SES, etc.) are the people who will take a big loan of hundreds of millions of £s/$s and order a satellite from a satellite manufacturer (such as Airbus Defence and Space, Thales, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc.). The operators will also pay for the launch vehicle (provided by Arianespace, Krunichev, SpaceX, etc.)… depending on how big the satellite is they either have to buy the whole rocket, or maybe they can split the cost with another operator… but the big telecom satellites usually take up a whole rocket.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 2-3 years: the satellite the operator ordered has been manufactured, tested and launched into space. After launch there is a period of time where the satellite operators will manoeuvre the satellite to its correct position: for telecom satellites this is usually somewhere in the geostationary arc, an orbit with an altitude of 35,786 km, which allows the satellite to orbit with just the right velocity, such that from the POV of someone looking up at it from the Earth, it seems to stay stationary. Once the satellite arrives at its “slot” there will be a period of commissioning where they test all the various systems and ensure nothing broke during launch! Commissioning usually takes a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>THEN! They’re up and running! The satellite and the launch cost hundreds of millions, and GEO satellites usually only last 15-20 years before starting to malfunction / running out of fuel and requiring them to be “retired”. So the operators have got to sell the services and make their money back plus profit before this expensive asset fully depreciates.</p>
<p>You asked about telecom satellites, so I’m going to assume this satellite is one which can provide two-way data services, i.e. internet for Bob in Mount Everest, who has a special dish on his house. How do they do this? Well the satellite operator has not only gone and bought a satellite and a launch vehicle, but they also have a “gateway” (aka &quot;teleport&quot;) – a massive dish on the Earth that is very close to an internet exchange / has fibre-optic lossless connections to an internet exchange. The gateway also has fancy modems called “hubs”. Using the TCP/IP protocol, desired data is routed from the web to the hub, but it must then be somehow sent to the satellite, for subsequent retransmission to Bob in Mount Everest who is waiting to receive his data via his small dish and modem. How is this done? Well the data is “modulated” onto RF spectrum! Don’t want to get too technical… but you basically encode 0s and 1s onto a RF wave by altering the “phase” and/or “amplitude” of the wave… There are actually rules for this (see DVB-S2 or DVB-S2X). Anyway, the data has been modulated onto a physical signal, and the big dish on the gateway transmits that towards the satellite.</p>
<p>The satellite receives the signal, sends it to some electronics that changes the frequency (because you can only use certain frequencies for Earth-to-Space link and different ones for Space-to-Earth links) then amplifies the signal and retransmits it. This chain of electronics on the spacecraft, this ability to receive a signal and retransmit…  is called a “transponder”….. and this is where the operators make their money.</p>
<p>There is a relationship between how much data in a given time period is required to be sent (i.e. Mbps), and how much spectrum is required to achieve this. Transponders on the spacecraft are defined by chunks of spectrum (36 or 54 MHz wide chunks most commonly). What happens is small ISPs, usually dedicated to providing internet to rural areas, will lease a certain number of transponders (or a portion of a transponder), and when they do that, the operator will also ensure they sort out access for the ISP at their gateway (i.e. allow the ISP's router in the exchange to talk with their own routers in the exchange, which in turn link back to the hubs in the operator's gateway, and also configure their hubs to send the ISP's data to the spacecraft). Operators can also provide to the ISP the dishes that the ISP’s customer will need, acting as a wholesaler effectively.</p>
<p>And that how it works! ISP sells Bob in Mount Everest a small dish and modem. Bob pays lots of money for a capped link (capped down and up) and gets pretty constant coverage (pending extreme weather.. maybe Mount Everest wasn’t such a good example!). The ISP has leased capacity (transponders) off a satellite which is owned by a satellite operator. The transponders have coverage over Mount Everst. The ISP pays $/MHz/month usually, and the more Mbps they need, the more MHz (i.e. transponders) they need to lease.</p>
<p>This explains the &quot;forward&quot; link, namely Bob downloading something. But the same thing happens for the &quot;return&quot; link (Bob uploading something / requesting data from a web page).. just in reserve.. Bob's computer requests data, this is sent to Bob's modem, which modulates the data onto an RF wave which is subsequently transmitted by Bob's dish. The satellite receives this, changes the frequency of the signal, amplifies and retransmits towards the gateway. Gateway receives, demodulates and hooks into the web at the internet exchange.. the satellite is almost transparent, except for the increase in latency.</p>
<p>TLDR; satellite operators buy, own, launch and operate satellites. ISPs lease capacity on these satellites and use it to provide data to their own customers. ISPs make money from customers, operators make money from ISPs.</p>
<p>Edit: corrected some rogue apostrophes.. and just wanted to say thanks for the Reddit gold!</p>
<p>Edit2: added a final paragraph to talk about the return link, added a TLDR, and made minor edits/spelling corrections</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, now the real answer </p>
<p>There’s a lot of satellites up there with a lot of capacity. It’s a very mature industry and capacity is always available. There’s actually a lot more space than the sat owners can sell at market rates. </p>
<p>Space/capacity on the satellites are leased out to other companies. It’s actually not that expensive. In fact tons and tons of companies big and small lease space on the various satellites up there. This is standard procedure. You can even pay companies to do all your uplink and downlink too, and again, this is quite mature industry and totally normal and reasonably priced.  Nearly every company that isn’t a satellite company just leases space and pays someone else to deal with the uplink and technical stuff. </p>
<p>Actually launching a satellite?  Well, unless you’re literally a satellite company, you don’t need as much space as you put onto a satellite, so it’s kinda a waste, you’d just have to rent out the rest of it. Instead you just lease space on someone else’s sat. </p>
<p>Think about it like you building an apartment building vs renting an apartment in the building  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're talking about the communication satellite industry.  There are several other ways to make money with satellites, but comm sats seems to be your question.</p>
<p>Every satellite that launches contains a range of frequencies of RF energy they can broadcast pointed at the earth.  If I'm a small telecom company, I talk to the satellite owner to lease some of that frequency space -- leasing bandwidth.  That bandwidth correlates pretty closely to a data rate that can be passed through those frequencies.  The higher the data rate the higher the bandwidth, but the more I can do with it. Low data rates might be something like satellite phones, higher data rates might be something like video conferencing.</p>
<p>For instance, Gogo Inflight Internet, available on many of the major US airlines, leases bandwidth from (I believe) Inmarsat to provide inflight Internet.  They pay Inmarsat to use those frequencies, and make money by charging fliers to use the internet. Inmarsat spends a lot of money up front to do the launch, and a small amount of money per year later to maintain the service.  So the longer a satellite is on orbit the more money they can make.</p>
<p>Recently, satellite companies have been expanding their reach.  Lower frequencies that have been in use for a while (think C-band), broadcast across the entire earth, so you can really only use those frequencies once.  Higher frequencies have shaped footprints on the earth, allowing re-use.  In the Inmarsat example above, Gogo leases Ku frequencies which are only broadcast onto North America (and in some cases, only the US).  That allows them to use the same frequencies to service South America.  Ka, even higher frequencies, result in even smaller footprints -- on the order of a couple states -- allowing much more re-use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Essentially everyone and their mother is trying to put a satellite in space which creates lots of competing companies trying to do it with the best cost to risk ratio. That, combined with the development of &quot;small tech&quot; (think smart phones), made satellites compact and efficient rather then massive and expensive. Got a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around? You could have your own spy satellite.</p>
<p>Also any small telecom company is relatively large compared to most small business. They're bound to have at least a few million in capital. They could negotiate deals to use existing satellites or send their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a stage surrounded by a huge stadium, with famous singers from several different countries all there on stage and singing to the audience. The audience, while all mixed together, can hear exactly who they want through magic earphones. </p>
<p>The stage is like a satellite chasis, and the singers are what we call the 'payload' (because it pays the bills har!). It's the part of the satellite that broadcasts down to earth some useful service.
The payload can service a HUGE number of people, several different countries or half the planet sometimes, and for decades in some cases, so it's like the stadium will constantly sell tickets to a lot of people for a long time to fund the initial cost of getting everyone together and singing. </p>
<p>Compared to some other services like having a small party with all those singers (say, fiber optic internet to a small village), satellite service can be much cheaper than alternatives through economy of scale. </p>
<p>So small telcoms can be represented by just getting one or two singers into the show, and not having to set up the whole production.</p>
