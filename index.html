		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://www.squawkfox.com/peanut-butter-recipes/" target="_blank">this web site</a>, it's much cheaper to make peanut butter at home than to buy it ready-made, which would go against your premise.</p>
<p>But then I found <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/make-or-buy-peanut-butter-153019" target="_blank">this site</a> which backs up your premise, and showing it costs a lot <em>more</em> to make peanut butter at home.</p>
<p>So why the discrepancy? The second link might shed some light on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: I used all organic ingredients for the homemade version and was somewhat limited by what was available at Peapod. If you have access to bulk bins or un-shelled peanuts, you can likely bring the cost of the peanuts down by quite a bit...</p>
<p>I feel sure that more cost-effective sources of peanuts can be found at local markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems like the answer is to buy un-shelled peanuts, in bulk. You're paying a premium when you buy peanuts because they've been shelled and packed into small packages. This a) pushes the cost of manufacture up, and perhaps more importantly b) means we are prepared to pay more for the convenience of having them this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The food that you buy whole (e.g. peanuts, tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries) are the best of the crop. The food that you buy processed into some other form (e.g. peanut butter, tomato sauce, tater tots, strawberry jam) are the small or bruised or misshapen or damaged parts of the crop. The appearance or condition doesn't matter because it's not going to retain that form when processed anyway. </p>
<p>People will pay more for nicely formed, pretty produce. So the stuff you buy whole in the supermarket (or <em>lightly</em> processed, like a jar of roasted nuts) is more expensive than the produce that goes into highly processed foods (where highly processed = it doesn't retain any of it's original shape or form). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The price of an item doesn't have to be directly tied to the cost to produce it; often times a business is more interested in the price customers are willing to pay for an item. If customers are willing to pay more for unprocessed peanuts than they are for the equivalent amount of peanut butter, then a company will gladly charge more for the peanuts even if they don't cost more to produce.</p>
<p>(An example of this came from a previous thread about child rates at movie theaters -- it costs the same to have a child in your theater as it does an adult, but they still charge less because families may not be willing to pay full price for all their children.)</p>
<p>There may be other issues such as peanut quality specific to peanut butter as well, but I don't want to speculate on those. I know more about pricing than I do about food processing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Freedom is scary to a lot of people because it means you are responsible for your own errors and decisions in life. Thats why its land of the free and the brave. Because freedom requires bravery, bravery to deal with your own problems and whatever life throws at you. To be the hero in your own story instead of the guy who asks the government to fix all your problems at the detriment of all around you. Given that the government is an institution of non-voluntary action.</p>
<p>But in practice the USA has for the most part forgone that ideal and it just like all the other western countries but instead sniffs its own farts with rhetoric it has abandoned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fundamental difference between American and European Freedom^^TM is the concept of negative vs. positive freedom and where we get our rights from. </p>
<p>Negative freedom is the freedom FROM government action. It's a restriction on what the government can to do you. In the American concept you have the freedom of speech, to own a gun, to privacy, of religion, of the press, etc. The government doesn't say, you can't say that, you can't own that, you can't hide that, you can't worship that, you can't print that. The government is prohibited from action. </p>
<p>Positive freedom is the freedom TO government action. Look at European governments on what the government must do for you. You are free to not be offended, not be unsafe, not be bothered, not be sick, etc. You have a freedom TO be something, but it is a compulsion of the government to provide it. In Germany the government is tasked with protecting the equal dignity of all. So that means the government can impose upon others to ensure your  (positive) freedom.</p>
<p>America is unique as it is the only country which takes negative freedom to such an extreme. America says &quot;yes, literal not even the neo- version, NAZIs have a right to march through Jewish neighborhoods to celebrate the holocaust.&quot; There's not this government having the ability to compel some social norm or protection. There's this government having the mandate not to restrict someone else's rights. </p>
<p>Second, America has a vastly different idea of where rights come from. Rights, especially in Europe are seen as derived from some agreement or some historical moment or something along those lines. Rights, thus, can be created, amended, or done away with when times change. In America, rights are inherent in your being. You don't have the right to say whats on your mind free from government interference because it was a good idea in the 1780s-1790s, you have that right because it is God-given.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; <strong>that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;</strong> that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not government, its a state of natural existence, that people have rights. These &quot;unalienable&quot; (because what government is equal to divine providence?) rights are part of you and the government either recognizes and protects these rights, infringes on the rights, or its not a right. </p>
<p>And because these rights are granted by the creator, divine providence, the supreme being, or God... they are contained within His creation and not within government (creation of man) or the behavior of others so it's a rejection of positive freedom. Because freedom, in the American sense, is self-contained (you can act as YOU wish because YOU have free will) and government is not the final power or arbiter on what are rights government can not impinge on your self-contained free-will (so be an asshole, no freedom not to be offended).</p>
<p>So that's the two ways it mainly differs from other countries. </p>
<p>Edit: Sorry, I know I'm late to the party but the foremost explanation of what I'm trying to say comes from the Virginia Declaration of Rights, mainly the first clause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 1. That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The placenta is actually only formed by the blastocyst  (very early fetus) so is 100% fetal DNA.</p>
<p>The placenta acts as an exchange for maternal nutrients to the embryo. The blood vessels of the mother bury into the placenta and pass very closely to the fetal blood vessels which allows for the exchange over the vessels. This allows the mother to give all yhe oxygen, nutrients and immunity to the baby while it is in the womb. The mother also has a reduced immune system during pregnancy which prevents most possible immune reactions.</p>
<p>However,  sometimes a mother can be &quot;sensitised&quot; to the fetal blood. This happens when mother who has a specific blood type, called rhesus D negative, comes into contact with blood that is rhesus D positive. The mother's immune system will create antibodies to the D positive blood (because her body has never encountered D positive blood and treats it as an &quot;invader&quot;, like your body would treat a bacteria). The exposure to the Rhesus D positive blood most often happens during a first child birth. If the same mother were to have a second child that was also rhesus D positive, her immune system would recognise the same &quot;invader&quot; as last time and will create antibodies to fight it. These antibodies are small enough to cross over the boundaries between the maternal blood vessels and the fetal blood vessels. Once the antibodies are in the fetal circulation, they attack the fetus' red blood cells which carry the Rhesus D positive marker.</p>
<p>To stop that from happening, a rhesus D negative mother needs an injection after giving birth to stop her body making antibodies against the blood she may have been exposed to in childbirth</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Glycodelin has been shown to actually induce apoptosis (programmed cell death, basically a 'tidy' way of getting rid of a cell in a managed way) in activated T cells, which are one of the components of the immune system. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has actually been a question that has long perplexed medical researchers...and the truth is, it still isn't fully known. But fairly recently (2012) it was discovered that when the embryo implants in the uterus, it sets off a process that ultimately turns off a key pathway required for the immune system to attack foreign bodies. As a result, immune cells are never recruited to the site of implantation, and therefore don't attack and cannot harm the developing fetus. </p>
<p>A central feature of the body's immune system's defense against foreign tissues and pathogens is the production of chemokines as a result of localized inflammatory response. These chemokines recruit various kinds of immune cell, including T cells, which accumulate and attack the 'intruder'. The chemokine-mediated recruitment of activated T cells is an integral part of the immune response. During pregnancy, the foreign antigens of the developing embryo/fetus and the placenta come into direct contact with cells of the mother's immune system, but fail to evoke the typical tissue rejection response (what causes some organ transplants to fail, and the reason for the need for anti-rejection meds). </p>
<p>Professor of Pathology and lead investigator in several studies in this area, Adrian Erlebacher, MD, PhD, along with his research team, found that the T cells, poised to attack the fetus as a foreign body, were unable to perform their intended role. This prompted them to wonder if there were some sort of barrier or obstruction preventing the T cells from reaching the fetus. They turned their studies to the decidua, a specialized structure that encases the fetus and placenta, and there they found the answers. </p>
<p>The onset of pregnancy causes the genes responsible for recruiting T cells and other immune system cells to the sites of inflammation to be turned off in the decidua. As a result, T cells are not able to accumulate inside the decidua, and are therefore unable to attack the placenta and fetus. Implantation of the embryo changed the packaging of certain chemokines in the nuclei of the decidua's stromal cells. The change in the DNA packaging &quot;silences&quot; the chemokine genes, and as a consequence the chemokines are not expressed and the T cells not recruited. </p>
<p>They further posited that inappropriate regulation of this process could cause inflammation and the accumulation of immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface, which could then be the source of complications including preterm labor, spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), preeclampsia, and a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A more aerodynamic shape would help fuel efficiency some, but not that much for two reasons. First, buses don't travel that fast and drag (air resistance in this case) becomes a bigger deal at higher velocity. </p>
<p>Second, there are two different types of drag: drag from pushing air out of the way and drag from air passing over the surface of the vehicle. For a short car, there isn't much surface for air to pass over so pretty much all of the drag comes from pushing air out of the way. That's also the sort of drag an aerodynamic shape helps with. For a long vehicle like a bus, drag from air passing over its surface area is a bigger deal. There's still more overall drag on a bus from having to push air out of the way, but skin drag is a much bigger component than it is for cars. This makes the drag from having to push air out of the way in the front less important for buses.</p>
<p>Those are just reasons why an aerodynamic shape won't help a bus as much, though; they're not reasons to not do it. The reason buses are designed with a flat front is that it maximizes volume and a flat front and window allow the driver to see better, especially when turning. The increased space and visibility are more important than any small increase in efficiency from a more aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>tl;dr - Buses benefit less from aerodynamics because of their long shape and they would be hurt by a more aerodynamic shape because a flat front maximizes space and driver visibility.</p>
<p>Edit: In response to the multiple comments saying that some buses go fast, we know that. But most buses do not and when buses are designed it's usually not clear exactly how they'll be used. And even for the ones that get on the freeway, the flat front is better for volume and for turning once the bus inevitably leaves the freeway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interior space efficiency is more important than exterior aerodynamic profile in busses as they generally travel at low speed. Aerodynamic drag increases as the square of velocity, so at low speeds it is less important. A more aerodynamic nose shape generally requires an overall &quot;pointier&quot; shape, which means you can generally fit less into it inside. This space could be used to fit more seats, so the bus can haul more people in the same foorprint. So at a low speed where aerodynamic drag is almost negligible, interior packaging profile is prioritized. It's also a maintenance issue. Flat parts are also easy and cheap to both make and replace, much more so than contoured aerodynamic shapes. Busses hit things and get hit fairly often, so having cheap exterior panels is a big plus. Long haul and tour busses that travel for extended times at speed make more of an effort at aerodynamics, by adding some rake angle to the forward face and having more contoured panels. But the lower the speed the bus operates at, the higher the priority of packaging and ease of construction/maintenance, hence simple flat faced city busses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>A customer is unreasonable and/or abusive, and makes a complaint. Despite evidence of the opposite (including cameras and other employee witnesses), why does HR or management always opt to punish the employee rather than ban the customer? Alternatively, why are abusive, destructive, or otherwise problem-causing customers given free stuff or discounts and invited to return to cause the same problems?</p>
<p>I don't know much about how things work on the HR side, but I feel like it takes more time, energy, and money to hire, train, write tax info for, and fire employees rather than to just ban or refuse to bend over backwards for an unreasonable customer. All you have to say is &quot;no&quot; and lose out on that $1000 or so that customer might bring every year rather than spend twice that much on a high turnover rate.</p>
<p>I know multibillion dollar companies are famous for this in the sense that they don't want to &quot;lose customers&quot;, but there are plenty of mom and pop or independently owned stores that take a &quot;no BS&quot; policy with customers and still stand strong on the business end. </p>
<p>Where did the idea of catering to customers no matter what start, and is there a possibility that it might end?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this question confuses 'The Customer is Always Right' with 'Customer abuse of Employees'.  Those have always been two separate things.  I'm speaking from the experience of working at Customer Service Desks at two different supermarkets:  Whole Foods and Wegmans.</p>
<p>'The Customer is Always Right' is the general approach to a customer complaint or concern.  There are a couple of things going on.  First, if it is a matter of bad product, the cost of the product in question is usually trivial compared to the buying power of any given customer.  So if someone comes in with a dozen eggs and says one is cracked, I would tell them to go get another one and mark it paid.  I don't know if it cracked in their car going home or it was cracked in the store, but it doesn't matter.  I just spent a few dollars to make that customer spend a lot more dollars in the future.  </p>
<p>Could that system be abused?  Yes.  And people do abuse it.  It happened on occasion that someone would buy prepared food and eat it in the store, but return to the customer service desk with half a plate and complain the food was bad.  Of course you know they're angling for a free meal.  But again it is risk/reward.  The cost of appeasing an abuser is usually less than the cost of accidentally rejecting a real complaint.  It also serves to get that customer out of the store as quickly as possible.  If they create a scene, it will make other customers unhappy too.</p>
<p>Another case is an angry customer.  Either they felt like they were treated rudely, or bad product had ruined some plans, or any of a myriad of reasons.  'The Customer is Always Right' in this scenario means deescalation.  You need to resolve the anger first before resolving the issue.  The quickest way to get this done is appeasement and empathy.  Tell them you understand and you apologize and that they're right:  it never should have happened.  You invite a manager into the mix - which also has the benefit of outnumbering them.  People shopping in supermarkets often don't want to be there.  Go in with the assumption that someone is having a bad day and you're usually right.  If you can make them happy and they leave happy, well then you're the one bright spot in the otherwise crappy day.  This brings them back to the store tomorrow.</p>
<p>'Employee Abuse,' however, was NEVER tolerated in any place I worked.  Cursing out an employee, yelling and screaming, inappropriate behavior (I had one guy lie down on the service desk as if to take a nap once), or anything physical would get a customer escorted out of the store.  At Wegmans, that would have involved a cop and Whole Foods had their own security.  Whenever a customer got abusive, the customer was always wrong.  It's a health and safety issue at that point.  And yes, people do get banned for life.  Both stores also have their own 'inventory control' people:  essentially undercover shoppers looking for shoplifters or scammers.  You didn't want to confront shoplifters yourself, but notify a manager who would notify these folks (we rarely if ever knew who they were).  </p>
<p>Why does this work at big retail chains and not Mom and Pop stores?  It's really economy of scale.  Large retail stores are making a lot more money per transaction and doing a whole lot more of them, such that they can absorb the cost of a 'Customer is Always Right' policy.  And in the end, you encourage people to return and spend more money with the policy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some decent posts here but I think one key thing is missing.</p>
<p>As a business owner, you do not control the impact that a dissatisfied customer has on your business when he or she recounts the experience. A customer can be 100% wrong in their interaction with a business. You could ban that customer or simply ask him or her to leave. However, when they go out into the world and recount their experience to their friends and family, those people will only hear the customer's side of the story. You as a business owner don't get a seat at they table to explain what actually happened. This can easily dissuade other people from visiting your business and buying from you. </p>
<p>So it often makes sense to placate a customer who is not &quot;right.&quot; That customer leaves satisfied and may even realize later upon further reflection that he was being a jerk. If he ever recounts his experience to another person, his story is now unequivocally positive. &quot;Man I was super pissed off the other day after a long day at work. Went to Mike's tacos, and I accidentally ordered the wrong thing. When the waitress brought it I was kind of snotty and told her she better fix it. She did it with a smile even though I was being a dick. She went out of her way to try and give me a good experience. Those are good people at Mike's Tacos.&quot;</p>
<p>Word of mouth is extremely important for local businesses and really any place that has direct customer interaction. Since you can't control the customer's message to the outside world, sometimes it is worth taking a small loss of a rude or wrong customer to help your reputation. This doesn't excuse those people for being assholes, but it is the reality of doing retail business. </p>
<p>This doesn't always apply and some customers can really take advantage of satisfaction policies. Repeat bad customs are often banned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: I've been informed by some alarmingly angry profanity enthusiasts that the origin of the phrase does in fact refer to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_customer_is_always_right" target="_blank">customer service usage</a>. </p>
<p>So instead please refer to the original answer below as the most USEFUL version of the phrase, rather than the original. </p>
<hr />
<p>The &quot;customer is always right&quot; is an often abused and misunderstood sentiment.</p>
<p>The &quot;customer is always right&quot; originally meant that what the customer wants (and thus buys) is more important than what you think.</p>
<p>For instance, you're a shoe store. You stock green boots, black boots, and pink boots. Green is your favorite color. You always wear green boots.</p>
<p>However, your customers only buy black and pink boots. Those green boots sit dead on your shelf, but you keep stocking them. Even when you could be using that money to stock more black and pink boots.</p>
<p>The customer is always right means it doesn't matter that you like green boots. Buy more black and pink and suck it up.</p>
<p>The saying got twisted through misunderstanding into some kind of customer service truism that it was never intended as.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have widely misconstrued what &quot;the customer is always right&quot; axiom actually means. Not surprisingly, the party mostly responsible for this has been... consumers. We live in an entitled culture. (In the West, anyhow. Sometimes the rest of the world isn't so lucky.)</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century and before, shopping for a lot of items was not a self service affair. You were helped by a salesperson or shopkeeper, who was counted on to be more or less knowledgeable about whatever the product in question may be. Even if that item was mundane (a sack of flour, or a pound of nails) it was probably located behind a counter or in a storeroom or otherwise inaccessible. Naturally the customer would tend to turn to this person for advice, particularly with goods like clothing. &quot;The customer is always right&quot; really means that despite what the salesperson's opinion or prior experience may be, he should ultimately sell the customer what they ask for. Regardless of how silly or unfashionable it may look on them, or if there is a higher quality version or another product that would earn a fatter commission, whatever -- if the customer wants a specific item, that is what you sell them.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the 1960's and 1980's, possibly due to the rise of chain stores, corporate culture, and the possibility for bad word of mouth to spread fast and far via the telephone, TV, nationally syndicated letters to the editor, etc. this got twisted around to the current &quot;bend over backwards and do anything to prevent the customer from complaining&quot; compulsion. That's what everyone thinks it means now, but that's not what it originally meant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You may be selling a superior product in every way but if the customer is only buying the inferior product, then you are wrong.

<p>If you were designing for aerodynamics alone, you wouldn't bury the engines or have anything but a short round inlet in front of them. Engines don't want to be buried or forced to suck through a straw. That's why commercial aircraft, which care about efficiency and performance above all else, look the way they do. </p>
<p>But, since round holes are fantastic radar scattering sources, and so are fan blades...low radar observability is achieved by hiding the engine face(s) and shaping the inlet aperture so that it has particularly-shaped edges. Everything you're seeing about a modern fighter inlet is a way of achieving other objectives while (hopefully) compromising aerodynamic performance as little as possible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a repeat of previous comments, but yeah, the general inlet shape is  to reduce the radar cross section (RCS) of the aircraft (i.e. make it stealthier). As Raymer (Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach, 4th Ed.) explains, &quot;One of the largest contributions to airframe RCS occurs any time a relatively flat surface of the aircraft is perpendicular to the incoming radar beam....Aircraft cavities such as inlet front faces and engine exhausts create a radar return perpendicular to the plane of the opening. All around the opening there will be small perpendicular bounces. When the threat radar is at a direction perpendicular to the opening, those small bounces will be 'in phase' and so will sum to a single large return. This is avoided by sweeping the plane of the opening well away from the expected directions of threat radars, as can be seen on the F-22, B-1B, F/A-18E and other designs. To further reduce this RCS contribution, the inlet lips are often treated with radar absorbers.&quot; </p>
<p>(As a side note, this is why early stealth planes, like the F-117, look so funky and angular. They are designed to avoid faces perpendicular to expected threat radar. As computing power increased in aircraft design, smoother shapes could be made that would achieve the same purpose.)</p>
<p>In another section, Raymer goes on to explain, &quot;Other huge contributors to the RCS for a conventional aircraft are the inlet and exhaust cavities. Radar energy gets into these cavities, bounces off the engine parts, and sprays back out the cavity towards the threat radar. Also, these cavities represent additional surface discontinuities [surface discontinuities are prone to accumulating and discharging radar energy]...More recent stealth designs allow the radar energy into the inlet duct but use [radar absorbing materials] to absorb it as described above [RAMs will absorb some but not all the radar energy so you want to make sure that it will bounce off several RAM-coated surfaces so the signal will be too weak to be picked up.] Also, if the radar energy is allowed inside, some provision must be made for hiding any direct view of the engine front face from the outside. This can be done by extreme snaking of the duct, or by putting curved vanes or an onion-shaped bulb in front of the engine.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The B-2 Spirit is arguably the most stealth aircraft currently flying and has a similar gap under its top air intakes. The B-2 sucks the boundary layer into this gap for two reasons. The boundary layer is over expanded and cold. And sucking it off from the wing improves aerodynamic efficiency by minimizing drag created by this turbulent air. The boundary layer is mixed with the B-2's exhaust before it is expelled, reducing infrared signature. So this gap between intake and fuselage serves, in stealth aircraft, to minimize IR signature, and improve aerodynamic efficiency by pumping the boundary layer off the fuselage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason for the small and wedge looking air intakes on supersonic jets is to induce a series of oblique shock-waves instead of a normal shock-wave. When the air intakes are designed this way it creates a series of oblique shock-waves that slow down the air that enters the turbines and prevents a shock-wave from damaging the turbine. Basically the air needs to be subsonic for the turbine to work and the only way to slow down the air when flying at supersonic speeds is to use shock-waves. Also, the gap in between the fuselage and the intake is to prevent turbulent boundary layer air from entering the intake. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They will always be dismissed as a minority opinion and troublemakers. It is about getting a larger group of constituents (the ones who would never actually go to the protest) interested with the issue.  It is about attention and media coverage and creating a groundswell.  You hope by having 100 people show up you get 5000 to write their congressman.  You hope by staying in place for a month that you get 50,000 to care.  In short you hope to influence a larger group, create pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's about the impact they have on the public, more than the entity they protest against.<br />
In Milan, in Italy, the public transport company employees were asking for better conditions, to no avail.<br />
They organized a strike, which lasted for less than a day, but that was enough.<br />
The economy of the city, which is the most important economy in Italy, was struck so hard that the transport company gave in to their demands.<br />
There wasn't even need to go on the street shouting, they just didn't show up at work, <strong>none of them</strong>, and the municipality told the company to fix it...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>
<p>In most of the case the government, the corporation, the whatever don't give a shit about protest. I've read that there is like 1500 demonstration a year in Paris, obviously most of them are 3 hippies asking for piece and free love or 2 nazi asking to deport the <del>jews</del> muslim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big protests  are a place where some people go for the festive aspect, teenager having an excuse to skip school, student going there to smoke pot and ask for the peace, worker bored of the machine wanting to do something else, and demonstration are full of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6_7Mbp76jU" target="_blank">happy people singing for a better world</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big protest are a place for political activist to do some networking, <em>you are interested in global warming, that's great we're organizing a conference where African peasant will talk about how the climate change affect them</em>  which let political group hiring new members and spreading their ideas (As I became older during demonstrations I don't buy drugs to a weird punk but books from various think-tanks) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a way for parties and union to show their relative strength which is important for the various elections </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are representing 1 000 000 people who accept to leave their home to go protesting on Sunday morning you have a certain credibility to talk in the medias and can at least get appointment with government officials, sometimes it's possible to negotiate something sometimes nothing, As an elected body you have to think about these 1 000 000 voters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually after at most few weeks, the protest stops, worker have to earn money, students have exam to pass. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, it really doesn't, and that's rarely talked about. We notice when it does, and notice less when it doesn't (which is more often), which through confirmation bias leads us to (wrongly) believe that it's a lot more effective than it is, and more often.</p>
<p>In reality, protest of any kind needs to be unusually prominent (usually meaning very large scale) or sustained or widespread to get meaningful attention from anyone who's in any position to effect any actual change that it calls for. Most of the time, it's reported on the news but shrugged off by decision-makers as just a bit of whining (which, let's be honest, is often the case), if they even know about it at all (which they often don't).</p>
<p>In terms of energy and time invested to meaningful gain derived, public protest is often the least efficient way possible to get desired results. However, it does have its place, so I'm not knocking it. Just pointing out that as a go-to tactic, it's usually (but not always) misguided.</p>
<p>Decision-makers will commonly tune out small-scale protest as fringe-group whinging. Because, as I said, if often is. To get real results, you need at least the implication of a large-scale movement of some kind -- something sufficient to have real democratic effect. Decision-makers aren't doing this because they're assholes who don't care, but because let's face it, humanity as a whole is kind of childish and reactive, and they're trying to deal with it the way parents do. If you jump every single time the two-year-old screams, you'll never get anything done, and the kid will never figure out how to solve things on their own.</p>
<p>There must be reasonable balance between what's really called for and what's just someone's bored complaining. College kids, especially, are very good for manufacturing drama. (Anyone tempted to downvote me for saying that, spend a few years living in the shadow of any urban college, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.) There's even a very reliable market built around that well-known effect: Glenn Beck didn't schedule and publicise a book event walking distance from Brown because he was unaware that they'd likely protest it. He was counting on that free marketing, and he got it.</p>
<p>None of which is to say that protest is pointless or that decision-makers are all good and decent people. Some protest really does work, and plenty of decision-makers are assholes who need it. But by and large, the majority of protest I've ever seen is cathartic street theatre with little or no productive value, and sometimes the opposite. If the public's not largely already on your side, you can earn a lot of new opposition by blocking roads and irritating people.</p>
<p>Historically, public protest was a show of force, demonstrating that large numbers of citizens were ready to Do Something about something they objected to. Before modern times, that had real and immediate political effect because it was, in essence, a possible rehearsal for civil unrest and violence. For the better part of a couple centuries, though, it's pretty much inconceivable that any mass of people could really threaten 'government' in the way that they used to. What <em>is</em> true in our time, though -- and wasn't in those earlier times -- is that <em>very</em> large-scale protest demonstrates a very real <em>democratic</em> threat, and is therefore taken seriously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>As far as I can tell, people block personally identifiable information from pictures out of respect for people it would help identify. When you post a picture on the Internet you have to assume it will be available for <strong>all to see</strong> for <strong>all eternity</strong> (an oversimplification but you get the point). And although a situation can seem very innocuous, the fact that a given vehicle can be identified as being at a specific location at even an approximate time can have a huge effect on some people's lives.</p>
<p>Governments can use this kind of information to track people. In (civil) court cases this can be used to prove a person's location at a given time - this could be used in divorce cases, for example. Just because it's not extremely easy for the average joe to identify someone from a license plate now does not mean it will not become easy in, say, 10 years time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spiders are a diverse order, with close to 50,000 described species in more than 100 families, so there is no answer to this question that will apply to all spiders.  Any particular spider's preferred temperature will depend on a variety of factors, including its habitat (climate, substrates, etc.) and its predatory habits.  Some species prefer warmer temperatures (examples: <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.13156/arac.2007.14.1.45" target="_blank"><em>Pardosa</em> species</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3543678?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Phrurolithus festivus</em>, <em>Euophrys frontalis</em></a>) while others prefer cooler temperatures (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2435.1997.00040.x/full" target="_blank"><em>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</em></a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3543678?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Stemonyphantes lineatus</em></a>, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3543911?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank"><em>Agelenopsis aperta</em></a>, <a href="http://www3.uah.es/pedrovillar/Docencia/Ecologia%20Grado%20Biologia/Archivos/Articulos%20para%20practicas%20de%20campo/Seleccion%20de%20habitat/Seleccion%20de%20habitat%20por%20arana.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Oecobius navus</em></a>).  It's also worth pointing out that as ectotherms, many spiders adjust their behavior/location to gain heat when they are too cold but will also adjust to lose heat when they are too warm.</p>
<p>If you're wondering whether spiders will instinctively move into the warmth of your house during cold weather, the answer is generally &quot;no.&quot;  Even for species that have a preference for higher temperatures, spiders that live outdoors are generally well-adapted to deal with weather swings, and will endure the cold rather than move into a completely different ecosystem where they are likely to have difficulty finding food and water.  There is little overlap between the lists of species that are commonly found in/around people's homes and those that live outdoors in nearby natural areas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Common House spiders and Barn Funnel Weavers (European domestic house spiders) will prefer the temperature and humidity commonly found in people's houses, which often gives people the impression of being heat seekers, especially when it's cold outside.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It might be worth pointing out that spiders (like any other animal) have more than one motivation. And heat means more than one thing.</p>
<p>Their prey might prefer heat, which in turn means their preferred hunting / webbing grounds are near heat. It might also simply be the difference between a temperature that keeps their prey active and a temperature that keeps their prey dormant.</p>
<p>Heat can mean the difference between liquid water and frozen water. Even though spiders get most of their moisture from their prey, they can and do drink.</p>
<p>Heat means temperature differential. Temperature differential means air currents. Spiders that build webs in particular like air currents because building their web in a current is like putting a neat in a stream.</p>
<p>Anyway my point is that even if they're attracted to warmer areas, it might not be the heat itself that attracts the spider. Also people don't realize just how many spiders there are around us. Even if just a tiny number wander into homes by accident, it'll make you think spiders are seeking it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Why would someone when presented with irrefutable proof that their belief is wrong continue to believe that thing? I can't wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>*Edit: I'm not talking about belief in things like ghosts, aliens, or god, for which there is merely no proof of their existence. I'm talking about believing something that is false on its face and easily provable as such.</p></div></div>

<p>Do you have any examples for this? Most things in the world today require you to put your trust in someone else who is an expert, or require you to become an expert yourself.</p>
<p>Consider the concept of the solar system. I absolutely believe that there are 8 planets (and Pluto), but I have only personally seen four of them. I'm choosing to trust astronomers and scientists and physicists who tell me that there are more, and I have no issue with that trust, but there's always a possibility that they are lying. </p>
<p>Throw in 20 years of action/crime/drama movies where nothing is ever what it seems, and huge organizations all have agendas and manipulating the herd is how people get ahead, and then remove a great education that teaches you to think critically and you can end up with a natural distrust of everyone who isn't exactly like yourself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been grappling this and I wish I could give you an answer.  I'll respond to it, but I've been hoping to understand this more myself. </p>
<p>Opinions seem to be tied very closely to people's identities.  So if you provide people with data that refutes their claims or beliefs, they would have to admit that the premise on which they've based their identity, their purpose, and their goals we're all a sham.  I dont think people consciously have this thought.  I believe it's an automatic psychological defense mechanism. </p>
<p>There is something called the 'Back fire effect.'  Check it out here. <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/" target="_blank">https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/</a></p>
<p>It basically states that when you present proof suggesting a person's opinion to be other than correct, they will grow more convicted in their views.  Basically the opposite of science!</p>
<p>What really boggles my mind is when I see this behavior in college educated people.  Not because I believe non-college educated people are less intelligent.  Far from it actually.  But a college degree, more than anything, should confer upon a person proof to society that they know <em>how</em> to think.  That is to say that I hold them to a higher level of responsibility, that their opinions should be backed by facts, with room to be flexible should new facts be presented to them.  In practice, proof (however it is presented) should affect a person's conclusion.  But unfortunately, that is applies to theory more than reality. </p>
<p>I see this mostly happen mostly with political views.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have faith in our caregivers:  Caregivers are looking out for our best interests</p>
<p>We have faith in our senses: Seeing is believing  </p>
<p>We have faith in our memories: &quot;I remember when it happened&quot;</p>
<p>And Faith is a virtue.</p>
<p>When suddenly confronted with irrefutable evidence it is easier to reject the new information than it is to lose faith because losing faith makes me weak. And it means that either my caregivers were wrong, that my senses were wrong, or that my memory is flawed.</p>
<p>It is easier to me to go with what I know than to question my reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm not being snarky. That's why. People's &quot;opinions&quot; are so wrapped up in their identities these days, admitting to backing the wrong idea is tantamount to calling your whole worldview into question. It's <em>way</em> simpler to just go &quot;<em>LALALALA</em>&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would argue it's a lack of interest in properly educating oneself. I had 2 conversations with a 20 year old delivery driver the other day. In the first he was absolutely DUMBFOUNDED that Hawaii was a state and not a continent/country.</p>
<p>In the second I had to explain that germs cause sickness, not cold weather. Cold weather will weaken your immune system to some extent but you need to get germs in your body to get sick. He basically just said he didn't believe me, then when he saw me wearing a light jacket the next time I went out for a cigarette he said &quot;cold huh?&quot; in a very snarky tone.</p>
<p>This is what you get when you combine the NYC public school system, a lack of interest, and an already &quot;not the sharpest razor in the cookie jar&quot; kinda person.</p>
<p>On the plus side, after explaining the germ thing further he did say &quot;learn something new every day!&quot; so I think he knew I wasn't looking down on him. I hope this doesn't come across as hubris or a holier than thou up on a high horse kind of mentality but I feel like it's partially on me to help get him interested in learning these basic sorts of things. It's up to you too, assuming you can do it without being condescending. I can't speak for anyone else but if someone explains something well to me that I previously didn't understand, or gives me evidence that disproves something I already believed, I always appreciate it. I think most people do as long as the other party isn't being a jerk about it.</p>
<p>I guarantee that a large percentage of people who cling to these falsehoods do so because there's an animosity toward people who talk to them like they're stupid for believing it in the first place. I'd wager there's a ton of people reading this who still think urine is sterile. You're not stupid, you just never double checked. That's ok, cuz guess what? You learn something new every day!</p>
<p>Or you don't...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
