		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming by &quot;asleep&quot; you mean the prickly / tingly feeling, that's actually your nerve being cut off and your brain partially losing connection to the nerve endings in that limb. Next time it happens, poke the limb with your hand. You'll notice the sense of touch in the sleeping limb is muted or sometimes even gone entirely. </p>
<p>Long term, this isn't very likely to cause any harm - if you've ever woken up in an odd position and lose all feeling and control over one arm or something, it's the same thing, pinching off a nerve, but you held that position possibly for hours because you were asleep.</p>
<p>Now as for actually pinching off the flow of blood, that can definitely do damage. I think some cells in your body don't need oxygen, but most of them do, including muscles and skin, which are literally everywhere in or on your body. So if you pinch the blood off of a limb, all the cells that need oxygen would starve and eventually die. I don't know exactly how long it would take but considering it only takes a few minutes of oxygen deprivation for permanent brain damage to be likely, it would probably be measured in minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out &quot;Saturday Night Palsy&quot;. This can happen if you fall asleep with your arm over a chair and don't move it through the night.</p>
<p>So the nerve running down your arm is squeezed for a long time. Imagine a frayed telephone cord- the message isn't traveling from your brain to your hand (muscle control) or from your hand to your brain (sensory) This can cause loss of feeling, loss of movement, or hand deformities from muscle wasting as the nerve can't feel messages from your hand and can't communicate messages to the muscles in your hand.</p>
<p>There's a sheath around nerves and then the nerve itself, depending on how damaged the sheath is or if damage is done to the nerve itself you can have different degrees of damage. Recovery time depends on the level of damage. Recovery of 6-8 weeks: neuropraxia. Recovery of several months:Â axonotmesis. Nope: neurotmesis. </p>
<p>Edit: I think the lack of blood flow causes damage from cell death</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hard to ELI5 this, but here we go:</p>
<p>Many things happen when your nerves are starved for oxygen and none of them are good and it gets worse the more starved they are.  This happens when their blood flow is interrupted.</p>
<p>'falling asleep' is the lowest thing on this list and is the most neutral for your nerves - its not painful and goes away in seconds to minutes.  The nerves recover quickly and go about their business. Basically the signal they send goes all wonky when they are initially starved and then get oxygen again when pressure is released (sensory - signal going up to brain).   They are also hard to move (motor - signal going down to limb).</p>
<p>more severely, we have <a href="http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/neuropathy" target="_blank">neuropathy</a> which has symptoms similar to 'falling asleep' but can become permanent and hurt more than 'falling asleep'.</p>
<p>If starvation is nearly complete and goes for a long time, the nerves can die (actually the starved, and therefore damaged, axons of the neurons degenerate - the neuron cell bodies themselves survive in all but the worst cases) which can take months to repair in a good case or never in a really bad case.  This entire process is an active area of research.</p>
<p>to answer the second part: hours to days depending on how complete the constriction is</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>far more likely is that the cause of the limb falling asleep has other effects that are far more dangerous. constant pressure to a small area, a joint held in a stressful position, etc. these things can cause damage on their own if they persist for extended periods, regardless of your limb being asleep or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

A lot of toxicity in humans is caused not by the chemical itself, but by what the liver breaks it down into. For example, ethanol(drinking alcohol) is converted to acetaldehyde in the liver while isopropanol(rubbing alcohol) is converted to acetone. One of these(ethanol) is 'relatively' safe for us to consume. The other is fatal in pretty small doses</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry what? A gall bladder has nothing to do with it. The reason why certain animals don't have gall bladders is generally their dietary habits - hind gut fermenting animals that are grazers don't all have a gall bladder (horses for example). </p>
<p>The gall bladder stores bile created by the liver and discharges into the small intestine. Animals without a gall bladder (and I assume people too) still create bile it just doesn't get stored - it trickles into the small intestine at a more constant rate. </p>

But the toxicity is due to &quot; an inability to inactivate neural sodium ion channels resulting in continuous increased vagal tone&quot;. This mechanism is the same in humans and animals, and since I don't see a relation to the gall bladder I'm going to say yes it would still be toxic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gallbladder has nothing to do with breaking down toxins, it's sole purpose is to store and concentrate bile that was made in the liver (though some waste products are excreted in bile). Toxin management is the liver's job (and to some degree the kidneys). If it's true that deer can eat poisonous plants it's because they have a specific enzyme that is able to break the toxins down. Different animals have adapted to eat different things, e.g. termites can digest cellulose because their gut has cellulase which breaks it into more simple sugars, humans cannot (we just poop it out - which is why fiber is good for constipation - it stays in your gut and pulls water in to keep your stool hydrated/flowing).
If you had you're gallbladder out, don't try eating poison...you're gonna have a bad time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Global winds and ocean currents on planets are based off numerous factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The tilt of the planet (not just seasons, but if influences the amount of sunlight at the equator and the poles)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positioning of continents (alters ocean currents)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positioning of continents (warm and cold air)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed of the planet rotation (Coriolis effect)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size of Planet</p>
</li>
<li>What 'substances' are being involved (we still don't know for sure what is in the Great Red Spot).</li>
</ul>
<p>If earth contained only land at the poles, and was just ocean from 60S to 60N, you would see some systematic weather. Earth (with continents) has ocean currents surround our continents and impact our climates.</p>
<p>An example: Western Europe should be Taiga (as Taiga forests usually occur around 60N and 60S). However, the Gulf Stream which hits the Eastern United States Seaboard provides warm currents to Europe; Europe, as we know, contains deciduous forest.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now about Jupiter and other planets:</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for gas giants to have bizarre weather. There is little 'atmosphere', let alone friction from the surface of the planet. We still don't know what makes the Great Red Spot 'exist'. A theory is that hot gases rise to higher levels, eddies form, and ultimately fuel the Great Red Spot.</p>
<p>Anticyclonic storms, or storms which 'spin' in the wrong direction (like Great Red Spot), are not impacted by the Coriolis effect because they are so 'small' compared to the planet's size. We know this because tornados on Earth can sometimes spin backwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sort of related - if ocean temperatures were much higher (&gt;120Â°C), you could get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercane" target="_blank">&quot;hypercane&quot;</a>, which is a extremely large and persistent hurricane and which some propose could have existed immediately after an asteroid impact, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were once some smart guys that realized that math problems that can be solved by humans can also be solved by machines if we can come up with some kind of sequence of steps to tell the machine what to do to carry out the computation. This set of instructions is called an algorithm. Church-Turing relates computability (i.e. the potential for a problem to be solved by a machine) to the properties of the machine and the underlying algorithms that the computer is operating on. </p>
<p>Specifically the machine must satisfy these conditions: a) it must support abstract assignment of numbers and b) it must support bounded AND potentially unbounded iteration. Basically this means that you can tell the computer what symbols represent what (like saying &quot;x = 3&quot;) and you can tell it to do something over and over until some condition is met (like saying &quot;while x is TRUE: do y&quot;). If a machine supports these physical functions it is called a Turing machine. If a programming language supports programming this kind of behavior, it is called Turing complete. Today, we take it for granted that all computers are basically Turing machines and all languages are Turing complete. I say basically a Turing machine because a Turing machine is a math model for a real computer. A Turing machine is not constrained by run time or memory bounds (which real computers are).</p>
<p>Now the deeper, philosophical implications of Church-Turing is that it goes both ways, meaning that not only can any algorithm on the natural numbers be programmed for execution on a Turing machine, but humans <em>can only discover algorithms that could be executed by a Turing machine</em>. It makes a lot of sense, because you basically can't describe an algorithm to another person, or even yourself, without assuming some basic formalities on how the steps will be executed. Church-Turing outlines these basic formalities and relates it to the physical properties of a machine that is designed to solve any math problem. </p>
<p>Hope this answer is good. My understanding of this thesis comes from my CS minor and the book Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglass Hofstadter. I highly recommend that book if you're interested in computation and its relation to human activities and philosophy. It really is a gem of non-fiction.</p>
<p>edit: Forgot to mention the Turing test. The test is supposed to be the benchmark for a computer being indistinguishable from a human. However, we have built machines that pass the Turing test (at least on some samples) that are most certainly not intelligent. You can look up the rules for The Turing test, but modern computer scientists don't really take it seriously anymore because we've realized that the rules for the test are much too lenient to really serve as an identifier of an intelligent machine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Church-Turing thesis is a proof of what computability is.  It basically says that if you can write a program to do something, that program can be written as a Turing Machine and as the 'Lamda-Calculus'.  Both the Turing Machine and the lamda-calculus are not particularly useful for actually computing stuff because they are sort of just mathematical constructs, but it is important to be able to ground computability in math.  It also says that there are certain tasks that computers are incapable of solving, but that's a bit more minor.  The Turing test is a completely different thing that deals with knowing whether or not an AI is actually intelligent, or, at least how good it is at pretending to be a human.  I'm happy to go into more detail about either of those things if you would like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing Test</a> and what it's point is:</p>
<p>At one point, some people said that you could make a computer intelligent.</p>
<p>Some other people said that a computer couldn't really be intelligent, because there was something special about humans that let them be intelligent but wouldn't let computers be intelligent.</p>
<p>The argument got bogged down in philosophical questions over what really counted as &quot;being intelligent&quot;.  Some people thought that this wasn't really important.  One man, Mr. Dijkstra, summed this up as &quot;The question of whether machines can think is about as relevant as the question of whether submarines can swim.&quot;  People were simply arguing over what the definition of intelligence should <em>be</em>, instead of what we could actually make computers do.</p>
<p>Mr. Turing wanted to break this argument, because he didn't think that it was very important.  What Mr. Turing proposed was the idea that if a computer acted in a way that externally, we couldn't tell it apart from a human, then we should not get hung up on what's happening internally in the computer, and just say that the computer was intelligent.  That is, we should <em>define</em> &quot;intelligence&quot; by what we can see externally and not by trying to analyze the way the artificial intelligence works.</p>
<p>I like to compare this to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism" target="_blank">behaviorism</a> movement in psychology.  Psychology used to have all sorts of mystic and dubious ideas attached to it, and had people not really doing a good job of measuring things.  Part of the effort to make it more of a real science was the introduction of behaviorism, where we stopped asking people to try to describe what was happening inside their head and simply started measuring how people actually acted, since this could be externally-measured.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is a famous counterargument against using Mr. Turing's test as a definition for intelligence from a philosopher named John Searle called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room" target="_blank">Chinese room argument</a>.   Mr. Searle proposed an example that most people would agree does not intuitively &quot;feel&quot; like intelligence to us.  However, it could pass the Turing test, and so it could be an argument against using Mr. Turing's test to treat something as intelligent, since it would include some things that don't &quot;feel&quot; intelligent to us.</p>
<p>There are also some contests that computer scientists have for fun where people try to make computer &quot;pass the Turing Test&quot;, and fool someone into thinking that they are human, but that's not really the point of Mr. Turing's proposal.  He wasn't trying to really have computers pass or not pass -- he just wanted to say that whether they're intelligent or not should be judged based on how they act, not how they work internally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Church-Turing thesis says that if a computer has certain basic properties (defined  as Turing machine), it is capable of computing anything that can be computed.  Given sufficient time and resources, your phone can do anything a network of supercomputers can.</p>
<p>The Turing Test is something completely different.  Turing posited that if a computer's responses were indistinguishable from a human's, that could be taken as sign of innate intelligence.</p>
<p>Note that the Turing Test is <strong>extremely</strong> misunderstood.  It is not some sort of threshold to intelligence.  When computers first started to be useful, there was a philosophical question whether or not machines could think.  People offered all sort of objections to the notion, computers were not conscious, computers had no souls, computers could not be creative, computers cold not learn, etc.  In his landmark 1950 paper, <em>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</em>, Turing used the Turing Test as sort of a thought experiment to help dismantle these objections.  He never intended it to be any sort of rigorous test of a computers capabilities.  In fact, today the test is less about a computer's ability, and more about human psychology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It mostly boils down to cost.<br />
Natural fruit juice is expensive and usually does not have a long shelf life (longer shelf life is usually a good thing because it leads to less waste and more important less write-offs (a write-off meaning a product has reached the sell-by date and now either has to be 'sold' for free or thrown away, depending on laws and store policy).<br />
Even if they have high amounts of actual juice it's often concentrated apple juice because apple juice is relatively cheap (especially if it's from concentrated juice) and it also has a quite neutral taste so it doesn't overtake the other fruits in taste.<br />
This way they can legally claim &quot;80% real fruit juice&quot; even though 95% of that is apple juice and only 5% is the actual fruit they are marketing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's marketing. All marketing. Some here have said cost but if it was done <em>exclusively</em> for cost, said juice would not even be in there. HFCS and sugar was way cheaper on a <em>solids</em> basis.</p>
<p>As far as the other ingredients in there, some ingredients (ascorbic acid (vitamin C), sucralose, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) are effective at very low doses (think milligrams &amp; micrograms worth).</p>
<p>If you're drinking tea that you've purchased, there's a good chance that there is only a small amount of &quot;spray dried&quot; tea in there and caramel color added.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, they don't. In fact, it is notoriously difficult to get female mosquitoes to feed on a hemotek in the lab; this is a system, with a membrane, in which the blood is heated to body temperature and left on mosquito cages in the dark. Field populations have to be 'weaned' onto this system to become lab colonies, initially they will only arm feed. Mosquitoes in the wild require host cues to take a blood meal, little is known about these other than carbon dioxide, heat and a volatile called octan-3-ol are attractants. People have a very complex array of volatile chemicals on the skin, and different combinations of these make people more or less likely to be bitten. As mentioned above, mosquitoes can be completely sustained by sugar, and feed on nectar in the wild, a blood meal is necessary so the mosquito can become gravid and lay eggs. It may be worth mentioning that most mosquitoes do not preferentially feed on humans, live stock, dogs, birds etc. are bitten a lot, the preference for humans leads to some species' extreme competence in transmitting disease.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Mosquitos don't use blood for sustenance but to gather the material necessary to reproduce. So likely it would be less than useful to them with many of the nutrients already absorbed by the previous holder. Mosquitos don't work cooperatively or share anything to my knowledge instead focusing like most creatures on their own reproduction. Mosquitos use sugar for true nutrition and to maintain themselves rather than using blood for it. Usually a blood meal is followed by reproduction and then death fairly quickly seemingly between 24-48hrs in my experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several of the explanations here are wrong.  Beware!</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>As Tesla kept saying and saying, <em>it wasn't radio.   It had nothing to do with radio.   The inverse-square law did not apply, because radio waves weren't being sent from an antenna.</em>  He wasn't using his giant Tesla coil in radio-transmitter mode.  He wasn't broadcasting his waves into outer space like Marconi did.  Anyone insisting differently, they're simply wrong, and remain clueless about Tesla's actual plans.</p>
<p>But, they're wrong for good reason.  It's because Tesla kept secrets.  Today we know quite a bit because Tesla did give many details in a private 1916 legal deposition (Marconi radio court case,) but that wasn't published until 75 years later.  Much else being said about Tesla's wireless system was either uninformed speculation, or was taking Tesla's furtive and semi-misleading comments about secret inventions as being complete explanations. Before 1992 you had to go to the Tesla Museum if you wanted to know the truth.  Instead, most authors just made s&amp;'t up about Tesla.  Or, they lifted their information from earlier books which made s&amp;'t up about Tesla.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all this wrong speculation ended up in books.  And if books clearly state Tesla's wireless plan, it must be true?  And it's even more true when many books say the same thing?  Nope.   That's pure BS.   It's &quot;game of telephone&quot; where books repeat earlier books with distortion, and the info in earlier books came from even earlier ones.  And the original info was speculation to begin with!   Instead, read original Tesla docs with Tesla's actual statements (which remained inside the Beograd Tesla Museum until finally published by<br />
Leland Anderson 1992 &quot;<a href="http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/nt_on_ac.htm" target="_blank">Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy...</a>&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>Ok ok, <em>WHAT WAS TESLA'S PLAN?</em>    It was very simple:  make a conductive path all the way up to the top of the sky, to the conductive ionosphere layer.  Then power the ionosphere with a fifty million volts power supply, as if the entire sky was one giant plate of a capacitor.  The ground serves as the other plate.  The sky-plasma was his power-line, with the Earth being the return conductor.  Giant tesla-coils with 100 megavolts on the upper terminal would create the vertical &quot;plasma tower&quot; to conduct current to the sky itself.  They'd also supply power to every Tesla-type power-receiver on Earth.</p>
<p>Very cool idea: we're in the gap of Tesla's giant capacitor, the size of Earth's atmosphere.  It's as if all of human society was placed inside a microwave oven operating at low frequency.   Hold up a fluorescent tube, and it glows wirelessly, anywhere on Earth.   (Well, his planned power level wasn't high enough for that.  Tube-lamps would need a few yards of vertical antenna and a small coil before it would glow wirelessly.)   One engineering paper in the 1980s estimated that such a system would consume a millon watts entirely in wasted energy, but these losses would be constant.  That means 10 megawatt system would be 90% efficient, while a 100MW system would be 99% efficient.  Note that large power grids tend to be under 70% efficient &lt;edit, wrong might be more like 94%&gt;</p>
<p>Only one problem.   HOW THE EFF DOES SOMEONE MAKE CONNECTION TO THE IONOSPHERE?  Carbon-fiber space-elevators?!!!  Tesla said he would &quot;break down the atmosphere&quot; between his tower-electrode and the conductive layers far above.   So, a lightning bolt.   Only needs to be 30KM tall.  Roughly.</p>
<p>So, all the Tesla-skeptics were never able to properly scoff at his wireless-power system.   Tesla had them all gnashing and frothing about inverse-square falloff and near-zero efficiency, when his system actually wasn't using radio waves at all.  It was an invisible power line, an odd type of beamed-power using plasma.   </p>
<p>They should have been scoffing about Tesla's ability to create the 30KM vertical spark needed for his system to work.  Well, spark, or a glow-discharge.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/nt_on_ac.htm#Section_7" target="_blank">Tesla's lab-scale protoype of Wireless Power xmission</a>, build for Patent model</li>
</ul>
<p>From the above diagram with the glass tube, we see that Tesla's system was based on conducted currents in glowing air, not on radio waves.  Those current paths would glow at night.  It was only &quot;wireless&quot; in the way that neon signs are &quot;filament-less.&quot;  In modern words, Tesla was going to use tens of kilometers of glowing plasma as his power grid.</p>
<p>Interesting trivia: when Tesla was discussing this in an interview, the reporter said why not just guide your lightning discharge up to the sky using ultraviolet spotlights.  Tesla changed the subject!   Decades later Tesla said that the UV spotlights placed atop Tesla Coils were his first goal, but he then tested it and found that the discharge-length remained far too short.  He abandoned the carbon-arc searchlights, and instead discovered another method which he claimed was successful, and he'd fully tested it on his giant coils at Colorado Springs.  A side-effect would be to make the entire sky above the transmitter glow like a vast Aurora.</p>
<p>He never said what this method was.   Later he changed his mind about making it public, because he said it had major weapons possibilities.  It could &quot;render uninhabitable&quot; any selected spot on Earth.   &quot;It would be like giving a knife to an infant.&quot;   Whatever was the trick was, or, whichever way Tesla was fooling himself, he took the secret to his grave.</p>
<p>Therefore, don't laugh about Tesla's system being &quot;too inefficient,&quot; or because &quot;Tesla didn't even know about inverse-square law.&quot;   That's just ignorant.   Instead, laugh at Tesla for suggesting that he'd actually excited the Earth's entire ionosphere using a vertical gas-breakdown path many tens of KM tall   ...late at night out in Colorado, so nobody would see the sky-glow aurora effects it created.</p>
<p><em>I saw that I would be able to transmit power provided I could construct a certain apparatus -- and I have, as I will show you later. I have constructed and patented a form of apparatus which, with a moderate elevation of a few hundred feet, can break the air stratum down. You will then see something like an aurora borealis across the sky, and the energy will go to the distant place. ...I came to the conviction that it would be ultimately possible, without any elevated antenna --- with very small elevation --- to break down the upper stratum of the air and transmit the current by conduction.</em> -N. Tesla 1916 </p>
<p>Well, one thing's certain.   Tesla was exactly right in insisting that, it wasn't radio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here keep referencing the tesla coil as his method of wireless power transfer. While partly true that was not his complete idea for low loss wireless power transmission across large distances. Most Tesla's ideas involved constructive resonance through a medium. </p>
<p>Tesla's idea was to use the earth and atmosphere as a medium. He believed that he could use the earth itself as a conductor by taking advantage of resonant frequencies and using the atmosphere itself as to complete the circuit. Essentially people would put a wire into the ground and a second &quot;antenna&quot; up into the air and they could power their home without wires connecting to a grid from his power station towers. </p>
<p>Wikipedia has a nice, imho, simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer" target="_blank">eli5 explaination</a> I will leave here: </p>
<p>&quot;The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allowing alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance it at any point on Earth with very little power loss.[116][117][118] His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would &quot;break the air stratum down&quot;, eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit.[119][120] Tesla would go on the next year to propose a &quot;World Wireless System&quot; that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide[121][122] and attempted in 1901 to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York. By 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make current (flowing electrons) in a wire, you need a magnetic field moving across that wire (you can also have the field stay pit, and move the wire, relative motion is the key). </p>
<p>Magnetic field do not travel very well though. They dissapate very quickly the further you go.  An electromagnetic wave, on the other hand, will travel much further. The electric part of the wave reinforces the magnetic, and vice versa. </p>
<p>The key problem, is that the power of the wave drops off with distance. Given a transmitter of a fixed amount of power, say 100 watts, at 1 meter from the transmitter, that 100 watts is divided across a sphere that has a surface area of ( 4 <em> pi </em> r^2 ) call it 12 square meters. At 2 meters you have 48 square meters to divide the 100 watts. At 3 you have almost 120 square meters of surface are to 'fill' with the same amount of power output.</p>
<p>Tesla thought you could overcome this drop off by using resonance. If the field vibrated at the same frequency as the earth/atmosphere system, the transmission efficiency would be greatly enhanced. As far as anyone is aware, he was not able to make this work on a large scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tesla believed that a spherical conductor (i.e. The Earth), can support <em>surface waves</em>.  They look a little <a href="http://www.teslaradio.com/pages/compare_files/image029.gif" target="_blank">like this</a>.  They hug around the outer surface of a conductor, and in the case of the Earth would continually diffract around it.    Surface waves (also called creeping waves, ground waves, Sommerfield-Zenneck waves) do exist.</p>
<p>He thought he could transfer power around the Earth using these waves - exciting them using his Tesla coil.  It would create a standing wave around the Earth -the waves would be emitted from his transmitter, go around the Earth, converge at the anti-pode, and then come back.  If you know anything about standing waves, they are caused by a transmitted and reflected wave, which is what would happen here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Tesla coil when Tesla was building them, wasn't about generating lightning, the lightning was an unwanted side effect of his transmitting coil.  A Tesla coil is like a swing, but with electromagnetic fields instead of mass, gravity and a pendulum.  Energy is pumped into the coil at its resonant frequency, and like a swing set,  swings further and further as you add energy at its resonant frequency.  These swings of the electromagnetic energy sends out electromagnetic waves through the air.  Tesla coils are very efficient at generating electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>Back in Tesla's day, electricity in the home was all about lighting.  There weren't many home appliances and industry mainly still used diesel, steam or water for powering their machinery.  With fluorescent lighting, energy put into the tube causes it to emit uv radiation.  That radiation hits the white phosphorus coating in the inside of the tube and is absorbed and re-emitted as visible light.  In the electromagnetic field given off by a Tesla coil, the tube will also give off light.  Tesla wanted to build absurdly large Tesla coils to light up fluorescent tubes at huge distances instead of running wires from the generating station to homes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Activation of the sympathetic nervous system actually shuts down saliva production, digestion and other rest and digest functions so you can use all your available energy to fight or run away. Some people think the nervous swallow is because saliva was building up before production was shut off, I personally believe it's a nervous reaction like saying 'umm'. It gives you that extra second before you need to respond. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
