In those games players consistently work out optimal winning conditions. Pardon the pun but we might find meta information in the meta.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trust me, if that were the case, we would be hearing about it. </p>
<p>Google's program is not &quot;solving&quot; Go in the strict CS sense. It is not evaluating every possible outcome of every possible board state. It is using heuristics to choose some possible moves to sample, and it is using other heuristics to evaluate the outcomes of those moves rather than calculating all the way to the end of the game. In a certain sense it's an approximation algorithm, but it's not entirely clear to me what it's approximating because its objective is to beat its opponent, not to play a &quot;perfect&quot; game.</p>
<p>Technically, P vs NP doesn't come into play at all because the board size is constant and therefore the set of possible moves is bounded by a constant. We can't say that the algorithm is running in polynomial time unless we answer &quot;polynomial of what?&quot; The neural nets are running in constant-bounded time on problems of constant-bounded size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The core thing the Google Go team tried to do, was to make an algorithm that could look at a go board state (e.g. all the pieces, how many captured, whose turn) and &quot;score&quot; that, to tell who is winning.</p>
<p>Once you have that, you can evaluate which moves are better (since they change the board state).</p>
<p>Step 1: It watched a whole lot of professional go games</p>
<p>Step 2: It looked at who won those games and used that as a mechanism for going back over all the moves of the game to &quot;score the board&quot; so that the AI could tell which board state was &quot;better&quot;.</p>
<p>Step 3: It then played a lot of matches against itself, with some of the &quot;players&quot; using different &quot;board state&quot; algorithms.</p>
<p>Step 4: It then used the results of those games to better predict board state.  Rinse and repeat back to Step 3.</p>
<p>Now, I have cut out some steps for brevity.</p>
<p>But it is an incremental algorithm improvement, often using highly parallelized random tree-walking to test out <em>a lot</em> of states, but no where close to all of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Just imagine your computer's available memory being your skin. In order for it to run smoothly, you don't want to clog it up by running a ton of unnecessary programs. In regular use, the computer does its job by allocating memory needed to run programs and allow you to multi-task. But if you try to render a 3D-model, while playing a game at its highest settings, while bitcoin mining, while aggressively compiling that stupid powerpoint with ugly wordart, all at the same time, you stress out your computer's memory. It has a harder time allocating/managing your memory resources, just like your immune system has a harder time managing the resources necessary to clear the acne-bacteria at its normal rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Acne is caused by bacteria, and if your body is having a harder time fighting that bacteria then it will spread and get worse.</p>
<p>Your body does a whole lot of different things at the same time, but it also has the capacity to 'redirect resources' from things that aren't that important towards things that seem to be really important right now. Stress is usually a symptom of your body focusing on something, for example, you have been staying up late and spending all your free time studying for a really important exam. Your body has recognized that you aren't sleeping well, that you probably aren't eating well and that you are using your brain a lot. In response, your body has redirected resources from your immune system to your energy production system so that there is enough energy to keep your brain and body working while you aren't sleeping and eating properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All antidepressants have to be rigorously studied in double blind trials against both other antidepressants and placebos, before they can be approved for clinical use in most countries.  </p>
<p>However there are a lot of criticisms about those research studies:  sometimes the same drug will do well in one trial and poorly in another, and in the past only the good trials were made public.  When independent researchers demanded the data from the unpublished trials, it showed the effectiveness of the drugs was overstated due to this selective publication.  Now all drug trial data is expected to be made public, even if the drug performs poorly. Also the drugs can have side-effects, and the placebos often don't, so patients can sometimes tell which they are receiving, and just knowing they are not getting a placebo might cause them to feel a little better. That might make the drug seem  more effective than it is. Also the drugs are usually studied in trials of 6 or 8 weeks, and other treatments like cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) might have benefits that are more obvious months later. </p>
<p>To find specific studies, try going to pubmed.com which searches the US National Library of Medicine, and typing in the generic name of an SSRI, eg. paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, etc, and key words or terms like &quot;efficacy&quot;, &quot;clinical trial&quot;, &quot;double blind&quot; and &quot;major depressive disorder&quot;. Putting the terms in quotes helps narrow the search.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Superconductors do expel magnetic fields, but they distort the outside field in the process (see the middle image in <a href="http://images.iop.org/objects/phw/news/16/3/21/antimagnet1.jpg" target="_blank">this figure</a>). So since the magnetic field is still distorted, I would imagine that the metal detector would go off with just superconductor. However, if you were to put a <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/mar/22/how-to-hide-from-a-magnetic-field" target="_blank">magnetic cloak</a> through a metal detector (in which the 'pushing out' effect of the superconductor is perfectly cancelled out by a ferromagnetic material 'pulling in' the field) you could pass through undetected. However, airport security might still flag you for additional screening if you carry a box of liquid nitrogen through the metal detector.</p>
<p>Edit: As I understand it, the perfect cancellation also assumes a static magnetic field, and I'm not sure how a time dependent field (as is present in many metal detectors) would effect it. <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9931" target="_blank">This article</a> suggests that its possible in a dynamic field however, you may just have to tweak your cloak to fit the field and frequency range that the metal detector operates at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mucus comes directly from the surface of your nose, called a mucous membrane because it produces mucus to protect itself and as lubrication. This mucus is a combination of long, stringy proteins and water, which allows it to stick to most surfaces.</p>
<p>We produce a ton of it while we have upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold because our immune systems are trying to isolate the virus causing the infection and prevent more from getting in. This measure isn't actually that effective, as  it only slows down viruses and bacteria can swim right through it, but we do it anyway. Allergies do the same thing because they are an attempt by the immune system to attack something that isn't actually a disease, like pollen. We are less clear on why allergies happen, but some hypothesize that they occur due to infants and children living in environments that are far too clean. Their immune systems don't have anything to fight, so they start fighting random things instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if posting this too late but I had some follow up questions. I never really seem to breathe out of both of my nostrils. One seems to always have a swollen nodule and it is usually my left notril. Sometimes throughout the day they will switch sides. I am wondering if it is a common occurrence.       </p>
<p>Second to that is I always have what I am guessing is post nasal drip. Throughout the day I have to cough to clear my throat of mucus and to me it seems totally gross. People think I am sneezing. When I first wake up in the morning I have to cough quite violently because I will have a small dried gobbet stuck to the back of my throat and it will take quite a while to get cleared up. Sometimes I give myself a sore throat because of it. It is always dark brown or green  in color and maybe about 2 cm in length. Doctor put me on some anti-histamines last month but they didn't do a thing. </p>
<p>I figured it had something to do with being a smoker but I quit smoking cigarettes in 2013 and still have the issue. Then again I do vape. Been having this problem now for maybe 13 years now. </p>
<p>Edit: Thank you so much for the feedback guys. Suppose I will be asking to be referred to an ENT soon about the drip.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>See, your sinuses are inflamed when you're sick.  When you blow your nose, you kind of flex them as well so they get a bit narrower to let stuff out.  Then when you're done blowing/flexing those muscles, they swell back up.</p>
<p>That's why you can repeatedly blow your nose, have just a little bit come out, but still feel like you need to blow again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It then goes into security mode. </p>
<p>SHUT. DOWN. EVERYTHING. </p>
<p>While your skin does a great job at keeping most everything out, you obviously have openings all over. Your nose is one such place, but unlike your ears or mouth, it cannot be closed off/is closed off already (you have to breath). </p>
<p>So our mucus membrane produces mucus. It does this already, and just like your ear wax its job is to keep foreign stuff out of your body (for the most part). </p>
<p>When you get sick, your body doesn't want any more bad things getting in because it's already fighting one thing. This is when you are arguably at your weakest. So it produces extra mucus to keep the entrance stopped up. </p>
<p>Unfortunately your body has no way of knowing just how far to take its defense. It is an all or nothing response. So even if it is a virus you will be over in a day, or simple pollen in the air, it turns things up to 11 and </p>
<p>SHUTS. DOWN. EVERYTHING. </p>
<p>But to be honest, I'd rather go hard on something than take that chance. </p>

<p>The sinuses are really just voids in your bones, and typically do not change significantly in size. They don't produce most of the mucus that comes out when you blow your nose. The sinus <em>tissues</em> (their lining) can become inflamed and sensitive, perhaps due to infection, not suprising since they are dark, moist, and flesh-lined structures deep in your body, perfect so microorganisms can thrive. Making things worse, most of the sinuses have only small 'openings' to the rest of the nasal cavity.</p>
<p>It is actually the turbinate structures and their tissues which people are describing as 'expanding' (swelling) and 'blocking the nose'. These structures and other surfaces in the nasal cavity produce most of the mucus that comes out.</p>

<li>What is the largest technical challenge that the SETI program is faced with (computing resource availability, or signal detection techniques, etc)?  </li>
<li>Would you be able to give us an idea of the funding SETI receives from governmental sources?    </li>

<p>On a personal note, SETI's mission captured my imagination from the moment that my AP physics teacher discussed it in class (I believe it was around the time that SETI@home was released).

<p>Let's say you try and reverse engineer an iPhone. </p>
<p>You need to know what each component is made of, this is NOT easy at all and requires some fairly high level analytical skills. </p>
<p>You also need to know how each component talks to each other. An iPhone isn't just the solid stuff, and then OS installed; there is firmware that controls how say the capacitance from the screen is delivered to other bits of circuitry. There is software that controls the battery.</p>
<p>Another example would be say a grain mill! You could build something that looks the same easily; a stone with an axel and then another stone on a pivot that can roll along in a circle. But if you don't know how to use it (the software) it's useless. </p>
<p>With modern stuff the material becomes a big factor!! Touch screens are made of very special materials for one. Military hardware? Can also be very exotic composites, it's not just steel etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It depends a lot on the complexity of the object and if there are critical parameters or tolerances.</p>
<p>Reverse-engineering a simple table with square legs is easy. Now think of a nice table with a pattern lathe-turned into the legs and a stain. It may be difficult to determine the wood under the stain and the stain color. It will also take much longer to figure out the lathe tooling setup to replicate the legs. If the replica isn't exact, it could still be a nice table. </p>
<p>When you consider mechanical and electronic items,  the process is more difficult for a number of reasons. Electronic components are exponentially more complicated. If you can identify all the pieces, you still have to arrange them precisely. Imagine trying to copy a complete road map of Texas with a pencil and protractor - no tracing. If you manage to build the thing correctly, you still need to develop firmware and software so that it runs as closely as possible to what you are trying to reverse-engineer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is talking about the manufacture of something, and they are explaining why copying things isn't easy...but that isn't reverse engineering.  That's just trying to duplicate something.  Copying stuff is easy.  </p>
<p>If you look at a piece of electronic equipment, a good chunk of the chips and processors are off the shelf.  You can go and buy them and slap them all together and there you go.  But that isn't reverse engineering, that's just assembling something.</p>
<p>If company x builds a cool thing, and company y can't figure out how they did it on their own, company y then needs to buy the thing from company x and do a complete analysis of it.  Reverse engineering isn't about copying something.  So company y brings in the engineers to look at every single component and wire, and then write up the full specs based on what they see in the hardware.  Going back to everyone's house analogy, it's basically looking at a house and then drawing up blueprints.  It's not nearly as complicated as figuring out how to manufacture steel, but it isn't easy.  It's time consuming and tedious.</p>
<p>This is what reverse engineering is.  Looking at a product, and then figuring out exact specifications for it.</p>
<p>After you get your full list of specifications, you hand that off to another completely clean and brand new team to actually design something based on those specifications created from the original product from company x.</p>
<p>Now company y has a product similar to company x, but they have plausible deniability that they copied anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said about the work monks do to support themselves (teaching, making jams/fruitcakes/coffins/honey, etc.), there is the daily running of the Abbey.  </p>
<p>Sacristans take care of the church and religious services.  Guest Master welcomes and sees to the guests.  Kitchen Master oversees the meals/menus/kitchen staff.  The porter answers the door and maybe the main phone line.  The business manager oversees the financial office(s).  There is often an Infirmarian who may be a nurse or nurse practicioner who oversees the in-house infirmary and/or nursing home.  Then you've got the choir master who outlines the liturgies (religious ceremonies) and works with the choir and instrumentalists.  You've got an Oblate Director who manages/organizes programs with people who live on their own, but have a strong, committed tie to the Abbey.  The Development director oversees things like endowments and publicity.  Then there's the monk who oversees the groundskeeping and maybe indoor maintenance, though they may be two jobs, depending on how large of an Abbey it is.  There is the Abbot who is like president/rector of the community who is overseeing it all and has the big picture in mind.  Also, there is the Novice Master who works with new members who join, and the Vocations Director who engages with people out in the world who are interested in learning more about joining the Abbey.  I am sure I am forgetting some others...</p>
<p>In Catholic monasteries, which I'm mostly talking about, some monks are priests, so they will often serve in priestly roles at local parishes, hospitals, prisons, schools, convents, etc.  </p>
<p>So, you've got the stuff that the monks do to support themselves and then the basic housekeeping stuff that is required by a religious community.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here. The weather has a serious effect on aviation so it's extremely important to understand how it works.</p>
<p>Many of the answers in here are either saying &quot;It's because clouds only form in warmer air&quot; and &quot;The clouds insulate the ground preventing the heat escaping. Believe it or not, they are both as accurate as much as they are inaccurate and neither explanation is technically incorrect.</p>
<p>Here's the straight dope though: Clouds have no bearing on whether or not it will be hot or cold, regardless of the time of year or where you live. So what dictates whether it will be hot or cold? That would be the sun and it's position.</p>
<p>In short, clouds are a symptom of a warm day, the clouds themselves do not cause it to be warm. Equally, a lack of cloud does not cause it to be cold. A lack of clouds is <strong><em>because</em></strong> it's a cold day.</p>
<p>So to your question then. Why does it always seem colder when the sky is clear during winter? And why are people insisting that the clouds insulate the earth and make it warmer?</p>
<p>It's actually all to do with air pressure.</p>
<p>Air like all forms of gas has mass and weight. You can't see it but its a physical thing you can touch and move. And like most gassy things on earth, if you heat it up it expands. And by expanding it becomes thinner. This means hot air is thinner and less dense than cold air.</p>
<p>So cold air is thicker and heavy, thus the &quot;pressure&quot; of its weight is high, therefore we have &quot;High&quot; air pressure. Warm air is lighter and less dense and rises more easily, therefore it weighs less and thus its pressure is low, so we have &quot;Low&quot; air pressure.</p>
<p>Us pilots love cold days because the air pressure is high and the air is nice and thick. It makes for some good flyin'. Especially if your in a smaller aircraft, you get to save some fuel too as you can lean your fuel mixture back a bit more! Your also at reduced risking of icing up to a certain point on a cold day (Which surprises most people) which is important because icing is very, very bad on a plane.</p>
<p>The other reason that we like cold days is because clouds cannot form generally below a certain height. This is a massive simplification but clouds form when moisture in the air rises with warm air higher and higher until the air begins to cool down and cools to a point where it can no longer carry the moisture. This is referred to as the &quot;Dew point&quot;. It then forms a cloud. If this process continues long enough to a critical mass within a certain amount of time it becomes rain at some point.</p>
<p>Warm air carries more moisture than cold air because its thinner (Thus lower air pressure). Beyond a certain temperature cold air carries very little moisture indeed. If the air is too cold to carry this moisture (Water vapour) up in the first place, clouds simply cannot form and thus this is the reason you never see clouds on a really cold day.</p>
<p>So why are people banging on about clouds insulating the ground and why are they both right and wrong??</p>
<p>Firstly, as the sun shines on earth, it heats the earth up and some of this heat is radiated back out to space, this much is accurate. However whether clouds have any bearing on this process depends on the time of day.</p>
<p>During the day, if cloud forms it actually prevents the majority of the sunlight from reaching earth and thus absorbs or radiates the heat back into space at the cloud level. The heat never makes it to earth and the effect of this is the day feels cooler. However during the day, cloud itself does very little to insulate the earth's heat because that's basically where clouds are coming from as a I described above.</p>
<p>At night though it's a different story. As the part of earth you're on moves out of the sun's rays and starts to cool, the heat that was absorbed by the planet radiates back out to space. With no cloud coverage, this process happens very quickly and the night becomes quite cold.</p>
<p>However if there are clouds, they absorb some of this radiation and slow the process down and the night feels warmer because it's taking longer for the absorbed heat to be released back to space.</p>
<p>However the rules of cloud creation still very much apply, so if it was cold to begin with during the day, there is likely to be very little cloud in the night. It all depends on how much moisture is in the air.</p>
<p>In order to simplify this I have left quite a bit out of this including how wind is formed from differences in low and high air pressure and hot and cold fronts which complicate things tremendously but you now have a base knowledge of cloud formation in a static atmosphere.</p>
<p>I hope that gives you a greater understanding of it but if you need a TL;DR then that would be this: Clouds form because its warm and do not form when it's cold. If it's a cold day, that is the reason your not seeing any clouds, it's not cold BECAUSE there are no clouds.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you for the gold kind stranger. Also thank you to /u/devilscolonic who pointed out a paragraph I've messed up somehow by deleting part of it when I added a comma which totally changed its meaning, it was supposed to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Especially if your in a smaller aircraft as the plane just wants to climb and its performance is enhanced versus a hot day, though riding thermals on a warm day is fun and you get to save some fuel too as you can lean your fuel mixture back a bit more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To those who asked (Many!) I mostly fly a Piper PA28 Warrior II and a Cessna 182 these days.</p>
<p>THE EDIT'S EDIT: Many asking various questions so I will respond here. I can't recommend any particular school to learn to become a pilot because I am in the UK and most of you asking are in the US or elsewhere. Also I am biased. However what I do recommend is if you are able to do so, learn on a &quot;Intense&quot; course where you have your lessons as close as possible. There's nothing worse than having a lesson once a month or something like that and your flying instructor has to go back and cover old ground with you because it's been so long since your last lesson. Sporadic lessons probably ends up being more expensive because you need more lessons to cover old ground, even if intense tuition costs more initially.</p>
<p>The best source of information to learn aviation meteorology is the documents your flight school give you or official aviation publications. We tend to use <a href="http://imgur.com/a/yDKCB" target="_blank">this one from AFE</a> (It changes its appearance a lot so this is what it looks like currently) but bear in mind it's got a European slant (Pressures in millibars, UK/European air laws) but the met in it is valid everywhere.</p>
<p>How much to learn to fly? Varies massively depending on skill level. There's a minimum flight time requirement too. I can only quote for the UK but it's gonna be around £6'000 to £8'000.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm simplifying because we are talking about radiation, wavelengths and it may be complicated but long story short it's a matter of radiation balance: the air temperature is the result of the radiation received from the environment. All the radiation comes from the sun  BUT part of that is reflected by (basically) the soil, back towards space and part &quot;stay&quot; on earth (again we're simplifying) . </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>on a cloudy day the reflected part begin a table tennis game between earth and the clouds, effectively being &quot;trapped&quot; and heating the environment</p>
</li>
<li>on a clear day the reflected part isn't blocked by anything and , bye bye, begins its journey in space to infinity and beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>hope it is clear (the explanation, not the weather).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two parts to this. First, clouds act as a heat blanket keeping in all the heat that would otherwise escape. Generally, a clear day is preceded by a clear night, and without a protective cloud blanket, heat escapes into space. Snow would add to this, as on a sunny day the heat from the sun is reflected and not trapped. Second, colder air can hold less moisture, discouraging cloud formation, meaning fronts of colder air are less likely to form clouds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat is always in motion in our atmosphere. </p>
<p>Most heat arrives from the sun, and leaves from the surface of the Earth. The ground and water act like big rechargeable heat batteries, soaking up heat from the sun during the day but is ALWAYS releasing it back into space (both day and night).</p>
<p>The amount of heat that the Sun emits is fairly constant (ELI5), and the amount of heat that escapes the surface is fairly constant to a particular location (leaving wind out of the equation and sea level). </p>
<p>Temperature varies with how much heat is arriving minus the amount that is leaving. Practically speaking, assuming you are at a constant location the rate at which heat leaves is constant. So how much heat is arriving is more important. The closer to the Sun more heat arrives (closer to equator/summer). If you are further from the Sun less heat arrives (poles/winter).</p>
<p>Clouds change both the amount of heat arriving at the surface of the Earth and the amount of heat that can leave. They reflect some heat from the Sun back to space and trap some heat close to the surface. How much heat they reflect versus trap depends on how thick they are and how close to the surface they are. High, thin clouds don't trap much heat. Low, thick clouds trap a lot of heat. </p>
<p>When you have a day that is cold and clear it is not because there are no clouds. More heat is getting to the surface than would be trapped (by about 20%). It's because (again assuming no wind and at sea level) you are experiencing the unadulterated balance of heat for your location/time of year/time of day. </p>
<p>Clouds are a symptom of how much water there is in the air and what the temperature is at that point in the atmosphere. Since heat moves through the air both vertically and horizontally it is difficult for someone on the ground to correlate the presence or absence of clouds with the temperature they experience at ground level. It could be warmer or cooler above you and there could be more water or less water in the air in layers above you as well. You will experience cloudy days that are colder than clear days and vice versa.</p>
<p>It's because people think of heat rising straight up (boiling water on the stove) and that you can't see how the air above you is moving without clouds revealing wind speed and direction that it gets confusing to try to correlate the two.</p>
<p>If you live somewhere like Seattle it's even trickier because there is a lot of water and mountains nearby that can cause the air to compress (and warm up) or expand (and cool down).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on where you live, cloudy/overcast days may correlate with wind direction coming from a large body of water. Large bodies of water are usually warmer in the winter than land, so the air coming from that direction will be warmer. Sunny weather correlates with dry continental air, which will be cold.</p>
<p>Another reason is that clouds trap warmth. On clear days, all the warmth gets radiated out into space quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
