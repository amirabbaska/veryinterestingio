<p>The &quot;number of states&quot; is an integral over phase space. There <em>is</em> a continuum of possible configurations for a classical gas.</p>

<p>It seems like there are two separate questions here. One of them is just asking how you count states in quantum statistical mechanics. For quantum systems with discrete spectra, the &quot;integral over phase space&quot; just becomes a sum over discrete states. I don't see how Pauli exclusion relates to this question.</p>
<p>The second question is how does Pauli exclusion work for identical particles in &quot;similar&quot; states? If you have a free electron in space, its quantum state can be written as a spatial wavefunction and a spinor. If you now consider two electrons, and ignore their spins (or prepare them so that they have the same spin state), antisymmetrization forces the spatial part of their combined state to be antisymmetric.</p>
<p>In other words, the spatial wavefunction must take the form</p>
<p>Ψ(<strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em>,</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>) = [φ<em><em>1</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>1</em></em>)φ<em><em>2</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>) - φ<em><em>1</em></em>(</strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>)φ<em><em>2</em></em>(</strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em>)]/sqrt(2).</p>
<p>It's clear than that this is identically zero if <strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em> = </strong>r**<em><em>2</em></em>. If they are not exactly equal, then the terms don't exactly cancel, at least not everywhere in space.</p>
<p>When you calculate any kind of matrix element of a two-body operator in this state, you'll end up with integrals over all space of some function multiplied by products of these wavefunctions. If <strong>r**<em><em>1</em></em> is close to </strong>r<strong><em><em>2</em></em>, the two individual electron wavefunction overlap strongly, and there will be strong exchange effects. If </strong>r<strong><em><em>1</em></em> is far from </strong>r**<em><em>2</em></em>, the cross-terms in the integral will be very small, and exchange effects will be negligible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is actually only a finite number of ways for a fixed volume.  Look at it this way.   Let's say you take a box and randomly insert a particle into it such that no position in the box is favored.  What's the probability of any one position being selected?   Well it's simply 1 divided by the volume.   1/V</p>
<p>Now put two particles in the box.  What's the probability of selecting two positions?  It is again 1/V for both particles which gives a (1/V)^2  since the selection of the two positions are independent.</p>
<p>But for the two particle case we now have to worry about if the particles are degenerate.  IE if the two particles are indistinguishable. If they are then you have to multiply by 2 since there are two possible ways to arrive at the same configuration.  Likewise when we go up to three we get (1/V)^3 and 3! since you now have 3 positions and 6 possible ways to distribute the particles to those positions. </p>
<p>You basically end up with the total number of states being equal to N!/V^N</p>
<p>When you are dealing with probability on a continuous space (which statistical mechanics is very much a probabilistic theory), you need to stop thinking in discrete terms.  You can have an infinite phase space while still only having a finite volume.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Basically you're heading towards a rediscovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_paradox" target="_blank">Gibbs' paradox</a> here. There is no correct classical answer, and there is <em>not</em> in fact an infinite number of ways (that <em>count</em>, literally), and the entropy of a gas is not infinite. Indeed quantum mechanics comes into this, it lead to one of the earliest quantum-mechanical theories before QM proper (along with e.g. Planck's blackbody curve and Einsteins' work on the photoelectric effect), namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackur%E2%80%93Tetrode_equation" target="_blank">Sackur-Tetrode</a> equation. Which is the correct (but not classical) entropy of an ideal gas in the classical limit. Basically the key concept here is that because particles are fundamentally indistinguishable, and the quantization of momentum space.</p>
<p>The Pauli principle isn't involved here -there's still a difference between quantum statistics (whether Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac) and classical Boltzmann stats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a quantity &quot;density of states&quot; that describes how many states per unit volume and per unit energy electrons can assume.  The Fermi-Dirac distribution describes the probability of an electron or other particle subject to the Pauli exclusion principle occupying a state based on its energy level as compared to the Fermi level, or chemical potential, which is the energy required to place another electron in the volume (and thus raise the Fermi level).</p>
<p>The way the states are counted is to usually start with a simple shape such as a box, and try to see how many electrons you can fit in the box.  Let's take a &quot;one dimensional box&quot; where the electron can only assume many states in one dimension, but can only  assume one state in the other two dimensions.</p>
<p>If the electron is confined to the box, its wave function is zero at its boundary, as it can not be found in the wall of the box.  Because the electron is a wave, it has a wavelength.  The longest wavelength the electron can have with its wavefunction zero at the boundary is half a wave period along the length of the box.  Any multiple of half wavelengths can be fit into the box.  Each additional half wavelength we add to the wavefunction adds an additional possible state. </p>
<p>The momentum of the electron is inversely proportional to the wavelength as in $p=h/\lambda$.  Nonrelativistic quantum mechanism tells us that $E=p^2 c^2 / 2m$.  Putting these together $E = h^2 c^2 / 2 m  \lambda^2 $.    We can solve for wavelength in terms of $E$, $\lambda = \sqrt{h^2 c^2 / 2 m E}$.  We can then differentiate to find $d\lambda/dE$ which is the change in wavelength of the electrons as they are added to the box as electrons are added at an energy $E$ up to an energy $E+dE$.  This is more easily done in terms of the number of half waves $n = 2 L/\lambda$ so that $n = (L/2)\sqrt{2mE/h^2 c^2 } and therefore $dn/dE=(L/2)\sqrt{2m/h^2 c^2 } 1/2 E^{-1/2} $, so that this is the number of half waves per unit energy.  You can do something similar for 3 dimensions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>In classical statistical mechanics, the number of microstates is actually uncountably infinite, since the properties of classical systems are continuous. For example, a microstate of a classical ideal gas is specified by the positions and momenta of all the atoms, which range continuously over the real numbers. If we want to define Ω, we have to come up with a method of grouping the microstates together to obtain a countable set. This procedure is known as coarse graining. In the case of the ideal gas, we count two states of an atom as the &quot;same&quot; state if their positions and momenta are within δx and δp of each other. Since the values of δx and δp can be chosen arbitrarily, the entropy is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an additive constant. (As we will see, the thermodynamic definition of entropy is also defined only up to a constant.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked on Y2K.  Hell, anyone in IT at the time worked on Y2K.</p>
<p>In reality, it was a lot of work to find and fix any programs that used a date in a 6 digit format (MMDDYY) and change it to an 8 digit format (MMDDYYYY).</p>
<p>One issue was that software is not always well documented and lots of code doesn't get touched after it's initially written.  That made it hard to find all the dates in millions and millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>Another issue was that there were many companies using legacy software, i.e. software that had been purchased/created 20 years previous and no one had looked at it or touched it in a long time.  Most of the time, companies just replaced that software with something newer and supported, but there were companies who would not replace the software because it was so customized to their exact needs.  Those companies hired programmers to review every line of code and find any dates.</p>
<p>Y2K also resulted in better programming discipline.  Instead of embedding constants (dates) into code, more and more shops insisted on using variables declared at the top of the program and then assigning values to those variables as the first step of the program, which made the code easy to maintain.</p>
<p>In my case, I worked for a subsidiary of GE Capital.  My boss made the entire IT department work on New Year's Eve in case we'd missed anything in our software.  We didn't.  He was a dick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We solved it by giving us more room to write the date and the solution was not complete.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to write down the date. In the early day of computing space to write things down was expensive so lazy programmers and those who didn't expect their creations to still be around in 2000 simply just wrote down the last 2 digits of the year.</p>
<p>Humans have used this space saving format informally for quite some time. Like you sometimes say that something happened in '74 or in the '80s and it is assumed that it is clear from context that you meant <strong>19</strong>74 and the <strong>19</strong>80s.</p>
<p>With humans one could expect, that when they got a date like '00 that they would understand from context that this now meant 2000 rather 1900.</p>
<p>Computer weren't smart enough to make that guess. They were programmed to assume that the first two digits were always 19 and they went with that.</p>
<p>At some point people realized that the programs written in decades past were still around and that computers that used this method would still be around by the years 2000 and that this might cause them to act as if they were a hundred years in the past and cause all sorts of bugs.</p>
<p>The media liked to paint pictures of airplanes falling out of the sky but professionals were concerned with much more mundane issues.</p>
<p>A world wide effort to find and fix the problem in systems that had it was undertaken.</p>
<p>For the most part this was a huge success. The general public which had been promised Armageddon by the media was quite miffed that the problem had been fixed without causing he fall of human civilization and declared that the warnings must have been wrong rather than that engineers had worked hard to see that it didn't come to pass.</p>
<p>So the Y2K problem was mostly averted. Here and there some systems that had been overlooked created some funny error messages but nothing big happened.</p>
<p>However keeping accurate date/time records in computers is a very, very complicated issues (mostly because the way we tell time as humans is much, much less regular than the average person thinks) and there are a number of problems similar to the Y2K problem that  will become an issue at some point. </p>
<p>UNIX based system tell time by counting how many seconds have passed since the beginning of January 1st 1970 UTC (called the unix epoch) and then they take this number of seconds and use a complicated system involving looking up timezone and adding anything from leap days to the occasional leap second to figure out what time and date that is in the local time.</p>
<p>Currently we are at 1506870661 seconds since the Unix Epoch. The space the computers store that number of seconds in has room for up to 2147483647 seconds, this corresponds to a date in mid January 2038.</p>
<p>When that time is reached computers will try to add another second to that number, not have enough room and end up creating a date with -2147483648 which is as far in the past of 1970 as 1938 is in its future.</p>
<p>This will obviously result in problems for anyone trying to make use of these dates. Already some computersystems that work with stuff more than 20 years in the future, may encounter the problem.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes that all the old system that still use this way of telling time will no longer be in use 20 years from now or will have been upgraded with patches.</p>
<p><em>fun fact</em>: Don't try to set you phone a electronic toy to any date before 1970 or after 2037 to avoid risking breaking it. Nobody expect these things to last that long so they are not currently able to handle such dates.</p>
<p>There are a number of similar problem from many different systems that handle dates and almost all of them will at some point run out of space to write down the date.</p>
<p>Almost nobody who was involved in fixing the y2k mess by switching from 2-disgts for the year to 4-digits for the year, seemed to care about what would happened on December 31st 9999 when we would end up needing 5 digits for the year if we make it that long and keep using their fix until then. We are mostly just pushing down the problem for future generations of humanity to fix if they manage to survive that long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to add that besides the &quot;raw&quot; energy of the new particle you usually &quot;use up&quot; more energy because of conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>Imagine you shoot one proton with a kinetic energy of 1.8 GeV at another proton at rest. This process can create a proton-antiproton-pair while preserving the two original protons. The mass of the proton is equivalent to about 0.9 GeV. So is 1.8 GeV of kinetic energy actually enough? No, because the proton and antiproton would &quot;use up&quot; all the kinetic energy just to be created. This means that all four particles would be at rest. The total momentum would be zero as well and conservation of momentum would be violated.</p>
<p>The actual kinetic energy required is 6 times the rest energy of the proton so nearly 6 GeV!</p>
<p>That's also the reason why it is more &quot;economic&quot; to collide particles moving at each other heads on instead of shooting one particle at a stationary target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a licensed professional engineer in HVAC, there are a variety of factors that have mostly been touched on already.:</p>
<p><strong>Radiation:</strong> You radiate heat to everything around you. When the temperature of everything around you decreases (such as the walls and windows would in the winter) you'll lose more heat. </p>
<p><strong>Convection:</strong> When the walls and windows are colder than the room, the air near them will cool, and this cold air will fall to the ground and move around your feet (Called a draft). In the summer, warm air goes up to the ceiling and unless you're 9ft tall, you won't feel that as much.</p>
<p><strong>Humidity:</strong> In the winter the air is often more dry in your house because the outside air can't hold as much much moisture. The sweat that you're always producing on some level will evaporate more quickly with low humidity, making you feel colder.</p>
<p>In general, temperatures don't make us comfortable. A certain level of <strong>heat transfer</strong> makes us comfortable. </p>
<p>There's actually a standard in our industry: ASHRAE standard 55 for thermal comfort that goes into great detail on this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is relative humidity (moisture level of air), not all 60 degree temperature is equal, you are constantly losing moisture through your skin, and for that moisture to boil off (evapourate) it saps energy from you, cooling you down.</p>
<p>In the summer, there is a higher relative humidity in the air, slowing this process, if you heat yourself up enough, you will noticeably sweat as this moisture is having a slow evaporation process</p>
<p>In the winter relative humidity is drastically lower, causing this process to almost immediately draw moisture off of your skin cooling you rapidly, therefore making you colder, even though the air is still 60 degrees. This is more common in older homes that don't have a vapour barrier, if you install a humidifier, (or even have a hot shower or two without running the fan to raise levels) you may see noticeable improvements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s due to heat transfer from radiation. There are three types of heat transfer: convection, conduction, and radiation.  Convection and conduction both transfer heat linearly with changes in temperature, but radiation’s heat transfer is to the fourth power of temperature. </p>
<p>So basically if it’s 90 degrees out and you have a window pane, the inside of the glass may be 85 degrees, and it is radiating heat towards your body at a constant rate. Drop the outside temperature to 60 outside, and the drop of radiation heat transfer drops an absolutely massive amount. Remember, it’s not temperature you feel but the amount of energy that’s being transferred to your body ( think a 60 degree pool vs 60 degree air) </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean. Two different forms of your question:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> If you were to start walking from mean sea level (as defined as the average position of sea level at a given point over a several year period to account for tidal and storm variability) at a specific point to a specific mountain peak now vs 100 years from now, would the total vertical distance you travel be different?</p>
<p>Generally, yes. Because the total mass of water in the ocean is increasing and the volume is also increasing via thermal expansion, mean sea level is rising (in most places, there are important local variations due to variations in gravity, bathymetry, and isostatic rebound in response to melting of glaciers/ice sheets) the total vertical distance between mean sea level and mountain peaks will decrease between now and 100 years from now.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Will the elevation on maps of mountain peaks change between now and 100 years because of sea level rise?</p>
<p>No (with a caveat). While conversationally people refer to topographic height as a value above 'mean sea level', unless you're referencing an old map, this is not really the case in that these elevations are not referenced directly to measurements of sea level. When describing a position, whether that's a horizontal or vertical position, this position needs to be referenced to something. This is equivalent to simple plotting in cartesian coordinates where everything is referenced to the origin. When talking about geographic/topographic coordinates, the reference points are called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum" target="_blank">datum</a>. For heights, a <a href="http://gisgeography.com/vertical-datum/" target="_blank">vertical datum</a> is what we're concerned with and you can see from that link that we can kind of think of three broad categories, 'tidal datums', 'ellipsoidal datums', and 'geodetic datums' (also sometimes called 'orthometric datums'). While a tidal datum is tied to actual measurements of mean sea level height in several areas, a geodetic datum is tied to a specific point, that may or may not coincide with a place where we have measured mean tidal heights. For a geodetic datum, heights are essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthometric_height" target="_blank">orthometric heights</a>, so heights above the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid" target="_blank">geoid</a>, which is an equipotential gravitational surface which represents what sea level would be if only influenced by gravity and earth's rotation, then referenced to our zero coordinate which is specific to that datum. Ellispoidal datums are reference heights to an ellipsoid, so a mathematical approximation of the shape of the earth without topography. There are <a href="https://community.esri.com/groups/coordinate-reference-systems/blog/2014/08/14/mean-sealevel" target="_blank">lots</a> of different vertical datums that vary by place, for the US we currently use <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/vertical/" target="_blank">North American Vertical Datum of 1988</a> which is a geodetic datum. Because elevations are referenced to the height of a specific point (with corrections for the height of the geoid as a function of location) changes in sea level have no influence on the vertical datum. Now, the caveat would be that NOAA or the equivalent body for another country could decide in the future that they want to update their geodetic datum so that they choose a new zero point based on the new sea level height in some location, but there's not really a reason to do this. Vertical datums do get updated (though not incrementally, a vertical or horizontal datum is not changed once it's established, but a new one can be introduced, an example as described on several of those pages is the switch from the tidal datum of 1929 to the geodetic datum of 1988) but this is driven by better and more precise measurements of the gravitational field of the Earth and not changes in sea level, and in fact the US vertical datum <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/newdatums/index.shtml" target="_blank">is set to be replaced in 2022</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, speech and swallowing therapist here. A mix of good  and off-the-wall answers in the thread. I wanted to add a bit of anatomy to clarify.</p>
<p>Your airway and esophagus are right next to each other. They are separated by a teeeny bit of tissue. Both start at the back of your throat, below the base of your tongue. It's almost like there is a floor that has 2 holes in it, right next to each other. </p>
<p>When we talk about the airway, it's useful to break it into 2 parts: upper and lower. The dividing line betweeen upper and lower is your  voice box, aka your vocal cords. You can find those by finding your Adam's Apple (even women have a small one). Your vocal cords are just onthe other side of that bump. </p>
<p>Your upper airway (voice box and above) is very sensitive. When stuff goes down the wrong way and it feels stuck in your throat, it's in this area. Drinking water can remove stuff in this area and flush it into the esophagus where it's supposed to go.</p>
<p>Your lower airway (below your vocal cords, including trachea and tubes that go down to your lungs) is not very sensitive. Have you ever seen someone with a tracheostomy tube? There is a tube in their trachea and it doesn't hurt! The trachea is made of cartilage. It doesn't have a lot of blood supply or nerves. So you really don't feel stuff in your trachea.</p>
<p><strong>TL; DR When you think you are feeling something in your trachea, it really isn't in your trachea. It's way higher up.</strong></p>
<p>Hope this clarifies a little. And I'm happy to answer any other questions about breathing and swallowing. It's literally my job.</p>
<p>edit: changed a few words about the quality of other responses because i realized a lot of answers in this thread were really wacky! No we don't get hydrated because water passes over our cells. Our throat cells stay moist because of mucus. Lots of mucus.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2: I'm getting a lot of PMs and questions about your personal swallowing and speech issues. Keep in mind I can't diagnose or treat you over the internet.  Also, a lot of folks wanting to know if they should get professional help for their medical issues. The rule of thumb is if an medical issue is affecting your life and makes you change how you're living, then it's time to get treatment. If your swallowing problem is making you too embarrassed to eat in public, or you have to avoid eating certain foods - GET HELP. If your speech problem is keeping you from getting or keeping a job, or makes you anxious to talk in public - GET HELP. Talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a speech therapist. We're here to help. We're just way more effective in person.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in saying that drinking water would not help if the problem was in your windpipe (at least it would not help until the water circulated through your system). The problem with a dry throat would likely be because of your mucous membranes drying out (although being sick can also make your mouth/throat feel dry). Drinking water would help to revitalize them.</p>
<p>If the reason you are coughing is because some food or something went down the wrong pipe, water would not help in that instance. When you are coughing, you are building up air behind your vocal folds, which close in order to allow that buildup, and then the air is blown out in a burst to expel the object. Drinking water would not help here, only if the problem is in your throat and not your windpipe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time an irritant is somewhere in your pharynx (the area behind your nose and mouth but before your voice box; the back of your throat). This irritant will cause you to  cough even though it's not a problems in your lungs or trachea themselves. Water passes over most of your pharynx on the way to your esophagus, and can relieve the irritation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the time it's some foreign particle that's stuck to the throat. When you drink water or some liquid like that it washes the particle down with it removing the irritant, or in the case of dry throat rehydrating the mucous layer. But for stuff such as tears or some kind of a wound you need something that either provides local anesthesia or something with consistency of a syrup which can stick to the area lubricating or protecting the region long enough for the active ingredients to start working.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;throat&quot; is essentially the pharynx which leads to the esophagus for digestion. In the pharyngeal cavity, however, you have the laryngeal cavity including the epiglottis, and larynx , that leads to the trachea. So the pharyngeal cavity in its entirety gets wet (though the epiglottis shields the entrance of the airway ). Drinking water wouldn't help if water had entered the airway causing aspiration and choking, and causing the cough. However if you have a dry pharynx or an irritant that is causing a cough, water may help moisten the pharyngeal walls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>That said, there are drawbacks.  Being softer than copper, handling aluminum wires means they're susceptible to breakage.  Aluminum also expands more when heated than copper does, and over time this can work wires out of connectors, causing arcs that can start fires.  Another issue is that while copper and aluminum both oxidize, copper oxide is conductive, whereas aluminum oxide isn't so much. This can change the properties of the transmission line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of high-voltage transmission lines are already made from aluminium (with a steel core for strength). It does a pretty good job and is cheap.</p>
<p>In reality, we will never run out of copper for the applications where it's most valuable - the solution would just be to reuse old copper and/or use it more efficiently. The cost of the copper in something like a generator is a very small fraction of the cost of a power station or wind turbine. </p>
<p>Other uses like domestic plumbing and wiring might see alternatives used since the copper is less important - e.g. copper pipes could be replaced with HDPE. Aluminium would do a fine job in plenty of areas - there'd be a slight increase in labour and manufacturing costs along with the lower material price but it wouldn't be a huge problem.</p>
<p>Silver and superconductors are also viable replacements for copper in some niche applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem here is the white blood cells, or WBCs. They have a nasty tendancy to attack everything they don't recognize. When you get a transfusion, the blood is taken from the donor and put into the recipient's body - meaning they'll start going berserk and attacking everything in sight until subdued. Riot time! It doesn't really matter in small quantities, as the recipient's WBCs will quickly overpower the donor's WBCs. But in the case that you are giving a lot of blood or the recipient has a weak immune system (aka is <em>immunocompromised</em>), the donor's WBCs will wreck havoc for a while. Not good. </p>
<p>To prevent this, there are a few means for getting rid of the WBCs. You can use a filter / centrifuge to physically get rid of them, or you can irradiate the blood to kill the WBCs off. This is possible because only WBCs have nuclei (DNA) that can be damaged by the irradiation. Red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (plts) do not, and so are unaffected. Since we are generally doing transfusion for the RBCs this works out pretty well.</p>
<p>And of course, no WBCs means no immunity, so nothing gets transferred in the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is possible to achieve something called passive immunity by giving someone immunoglobulins from someone with acquired immunity. </p>
<p>The easiest way to explain the difference is that someone with acquired immunity is a person that their immune system has seen the antigen before and has created an immune response. One of the reasons breastfeeding is stressed so much is that a certain class of immunoglobulin is passed through breast milk (it is called IgA). So, mom passes immunoglobulins to baby which are short lived, but offer some protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/voidwing had a good description of a transfusion reaction.</p>
<p>To add to that, part of the way we achieve immunity through vaccination is by training our immune systems to recognize a pathogen. Normally when we get sick, it can take a few weeks to develop an antibody response. If the immune system has already seen that pathogen, it can respond much faster.</p>
<p>One way the immune system responds is by the activity of plasma cells. Plasma cells are little antibody factories - they are trained to fight one very specific piece of a pathogen and then each cell will sit there and make antibody against that piece for the rest of it's life. Antibody circulates in the blood, and when it finds the thing it was built to destroy, it basically tags that thing for the rest of the immune system to attack.</p>
<p>A blood transfusion might provide some of your circulating antibody, but that has a limited lifespan in the blood. What you really need is the plasma cells to provide a constant stream of antibody. These stay embedded in your tissues, and won't be transferred in a blood transfusion.</p>
<p>To add to that, even if you did get an infusion of trained plasma cells, your own immune system would destroy them because they are recognized as &quot;non-self&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Blood types and immunology get much more specific, but you can't confer your immunity by just sharing some blood. Bone marrow (our printing press) is what produces cells ($ bills) specific to our body, and even though they can sometimes be exchanged with other people, our bone marrow doesn't learn how to &quot;print&quot; these different cells just by being exposed to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
