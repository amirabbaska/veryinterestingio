		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm three months into quitting smoking cold turkey, so all traces of nicotine should have gone from my body, and from what I've read it seems my nicotine receptors should have returned to the state of a non-smoker too (&lt; as you might be able to tell, I'm not entirely sure what this means, just something I read). </p>
<p>I admit there was a day last week when I lost the will and had three cigarettes :( Since then, the cravings have become 24/7 and I'm tense all over. The withdrawal has been almost as bad as the first week. (I have learned my lesson...)</p>
<p>A non-smoker who had three cigarettes would not experience an intense withdrawal (I assume); so is my experience because:</p>
<p>a) I have the &quot;brain&quot; of a smoker and my chemical addiction persists (physical);</p>
<p>b) Having a cigarette just kinda reminded me of how nice smoking is or reignited an old habit, so now I want to do it all the time (psychological);</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>c) Something else.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to know if any brain changes are permanent. Would a smoker who had a cigarette 30 years after their quit experience the same intensity of withdrawal? Would they get (re)hooked on cigarettes more quickly than someone who had never smoked? Or is there a point where your likelihood to become addicted to smoking falls to the same level as a never-smoker?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a reason  many drugs have such high relapse rates with some, like methamphetamine, having over 90% relapse rates.  The memory of the drug is very powerful.  Not only do you have the reward associated with the drug itself, and its effects on dopamine, but you also have a myriad of &quot;cues&quot; that act as part of the reinforcement of the memory. For instance, drinking alcohol in the bar with your friends can create a reinforcing cue that means watching a TV show (like &quot;How I met your mother&quot; where basically the whole show takes place in a bar) can flood the brain with cues that trigger craving.  This phenomenon is consistent across drugs (e.g. cocaine, opiates, nicotine...) and is known to be mediated by interactions between two specific brain regions (the ventral hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens). In animals cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking behavior can be manipulated by stimulating or blocking these specific regions.  There are many other brain regions involved, but this is a simple breakdown.  Further, there is good evidence for relatively long-term changes in many brain regions using techniques like functional connectivity analysis with fMRI.  There is also evidence for permanent changes in brain volumes with some drugs like cocaine.   In short, there is quite a bit of evidence for long-term changes in brain structures and networks.  Some of these changes may abate with time but this aspect (i.e. how long it might take) is not as well studied, but in the case of smoking anecdotal evidence suggests that the urge for cigarettes does abate over time.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Worldwide, the largest reason why people don't eat meat has always been (and still is) being too poor to afford it. As large parts of global population are getting out of poverty, they're starting to consume large amounts of meat - for example, the per capita (so, ignoring population growth) meat consumption in China has doubled in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>If anything, today the global % of meat-eaters is larger than ever before, simply because more people than ever can afford to eat it and not just the cheap staple crops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For every member of the first world who decides to eschew meat, there is a population increase of much more than that.</p>
<p>Even discounting the population growth's effect on meat production, per capita the figure increases to grow.  Worldwide, per capita meat consumption increased from 41.3 kilograms in 2009 to 41.9 kilograms in 2010. (<a href="https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm" target="_blank">Sources regarding this figure vary</a>)  So even if a growing percent of the population in your country/part of the world is avoiding meat consumption, the ones who are left more than make up the difference.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start at the beginning. A Fourier series is a sum of sine and cosines with different frequencies that approximates a function. The more frequencies you include, the better the approximation. The exact weightings of the sine and cosine terms depends which function you are trying to approximate. The weightings are called the amplitudes or Fourier elements (FE's). </p>
<p>The Fourier transform (FT) can be thought of as a way of working out the amplitudes needed to fit a Fourier series to a function, and then arranging those amplitudes in order of frequency.</p>
<p>The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is an algorithm that computes the FT for discrete data. Naively, you can just replace all the integrals with sums (as integrals are just the continuous version of sums). To compute the DFT you need to solve <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4acd06c17c67fbd594f829780417ab92c978cfc0" target="_blank">this</a> equation for each data point. This is slow because if you have N data points, you need N^2 operations (N for the sum in the equation*N data points).</p>
<p>The FFT refers to any algorithm that can compute the discrete fourier transform (DFT) in O(n log n) time. One algorithm relies on the fact that each DFT of N data points can be found by combining the DFTs of half the data (i.e. N/2 data points). Finding the DFT of two shorter lists is a factor of four more efficient that finding the DFT of one large list, (N/2)^2 vs N^2 operations. Repeating this process until you only have one number in each list gives you an O(n log n) complexity. This 'divide and conquer' method is used in other algorithms such as quicksort.</p>
<p>Technically with the above algorithm you can only compute FFTs when N is a power of two, but there are other algorithms without this limitation and you can always pad your data to the nearest power of two.</p>
<p>I hope that quick overview is helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's how I like to think about it, and how I would probably try to explain it to a 5 year old...</p>
<p>The Fourier Transform is a bit like series of mathematical sieves. Each sieve has uniquely sized/shaped holes, you put your input through each of the sieves one-by-one, each time you do, only the parts of the what you put in that match the particular size/shape of the holes in your sieve come out the bottom.</p>
<p>My background is in audio/acoustics, so here is a simplistic description in that context:</p>
<p>You have a digital time domain signal, you bring along your set of sieves that have holes that are shaped/sized corresponding to different sine or cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies (the number of sieves depends on the N points of your [F]FT operation). As you take the time domain signal and pass it through each of the sieves in turn, the amount of your signal that passes through each of the sieves tell you how much of a particular frequency is present in your input signal.</p>
<p>If you plot those amounts (y-axis) against the sieve hole shapes/sizes or frequency bins (x-axis) you'll have a frequency domain representation of your original time domain signal.</p>
<p>I'm a bit rusty now that I've left academia, but that is the way I always thought about it. Hopefully it's a useful analogy!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The inverse operation works too. It only works on a chunk of data that is exactly a power of 2 in size (256, 512, 1024 etc.), because of the way it divides the data repeatedly. Matrix mathematics and Fourier transforms in general are beyond ELI5 explanations, sadly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like any Fourier transform, we are recording something, such as a one-dimensional signal (sound) or two-dimensional signal (image) not by recording the values that occur at each time or in each position, but, rather, by remembering how these values fluctuate as time and position change.</p>
<p>If something changes rapidly, then it has a higher frequency component than if it mostly stays the same.  If you are transforming sounds with bass, vocal and cymbals (or a picture of a building with doors/windows and also siding / bricks), you will have a variety of detail changing at different frequency.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fast Fourier transform is a version of the discrete Fourier transform which is computationally much faster. Normally a Fourier transform involves performing the operation on a function. However often instead of a continuous function you have a set of discrete data points which have been sampled. This is where the discrete Fourier transform comes in handy.</p>
<p>When calculating the discrete Fourier transform, there are certain symmetries that arise. The Danielson-Lanczos Lemma states that a discrete fourier transform of length <em>N</em> can be written as a sum of two discrete fourier transforms of length <em>N/2</em>. One is formed from the even points, the other from the odd points. By applying this recursively the number of calculations required becomes exponentially smaller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is another issue that no one has mentioned - it depends on the phase of sleep the adult or baby is in when the noise is made. There are many reports of people sleeping through fire alarms going off. When you are deep sleep it can be very hard to wake up, even shaking and yelling may not be enough. In other phases of sleep you can be woken by leaves rustling . . .</p>
<p>We also trained our kids to sleep through noise by not being quiet when they were sleeping. My teenager was sleeping through me hammering nails on the porch 10 feet from his room yesterday morning!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>These are generally caused by crumbs of food still being in your mouth after you're done eating.  As they sit there, they feed bacterial growth at that spot and the acidity from the bacterial metabolism causes sores to form.</p>
<p>That's not the only cause, but that is one of the most common ones. If they are generally forming near the gums, that is the most likely cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you talking about kanker sores? If so then I've had thousands of them since childhood. I have one that just healed a actually. Although the Internet and the medical community are dumbfounded by the ulcers I have noticed some things about them over the decades. Obviously if you bite/cut the inside of your mouth you're pretty screwed. That's how I got most of mine as a child. When I got older I would seemingly randomly get them. I think I've narrowed it down to mild dehydration. My theory is that if you let your mouth dry out while your sleeping you get micro lesions or 'cracks' in the soft tissue of your mouth. These in turn become ulcers. No one has figured out where they come from yet but they can be prevented. </p>
<p>Brush the living hell out of your whole mouth every day. And not just your teeth.  All the soft tissue in your mouth. Every last crevice. </p>
<p>If you feel one starting focus on that area while brushing and put some salt on your finger tip and press against it. I recommend this only if it hasn't  'opened' yet. </p>
<p>Drink more water! If you wake up and your mouth is super dry then you're not getting enough water. Try to start with a minimum of 2L a day. I think that's half a gallon or so if you're American. </p>
<p>Limit sugary drinks like pop and alcohol. They dehydrate you. Also I found if you limit you citrus drinks that also seems to help, not sure why.</p>
<p>I'd like to note I'm not medically trained or anything. I've just had then my whole life ( I'm 36 now). I hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adenosine does build up, and this does contribute to making you feel tired.  But what determines whether you feel sleepy / go to sleep is much more than just one thing.  If you think about it, this makes sense:  You wouldn't be very good at surviving if your body being tired made you fall asleep no matter what.  There are multiple different things that can push/pull you towards sleep / wakefulness.  Correspondingly, the neural circuitry that controls sleep is <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7zEuyCC1adLPFMgkkyVogVcPDBRE3G76u_p1hc6EBhW9bL3uhYnH8p5YNvyv3A8SiR_r1IQ8da6_jFefPctCCH7BtEsWmA8tWvfoCEDUZyVvqTDaidUA4xt28YkPZee4OtyW-O6gMGvBfEQT" target="_blank">complex</a>.  Broadly speaking, it functions like a see-saw, where many different factors can push down on either end to swing the balance towards sleep or wakefulness.</p>
<p>In the case of insomnia, the problem is that other factors (anxiety) are pushing down on one end of the see-saw and swinging it further towards wakefulness than it should be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One additional factor at work can be the length of the internal circadian rhythm. This is sort of like your body reading out a very long complicated instruction manual which ideally takes 24 hours to read, and then restarting as soon as its read it. This is part of why you tend to get tired at roughly the same local time (hence jet lag), and why you can feel a bit better in the day even if you didn't sleep at night. </p>
<p>In some people with insomnia, this circadian rhythm can take a slightly different period of time (like 23.5 hours or 24.5 hours), and this means you slowly get out of sync with society in general. I probably have an example of this - left to my own devices I tend to &quot;drift&quot; later and later into the day, often until I don't go to bed until sunrise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Ozone only 'lives' for about an hour, but it is constantly being replenished by the interaction of UV rays from the sun and atmospheric oxygen. A photon of UV hits an O^2 molecule and splits it in half, leaving two free oxygen atoms floating around. These readily bind with whole O^2 molecules, creating O^3. This absorption of UV is what makes the O^3 layer so important. </p>
<p>EDIT: I worded the last part poorly. Ozone itself is very good at absorbing high energy UV. Oxygen is good at absorbing lower energy UV. The photodisassociation of the oxygen is not part of the absorption process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is what produces the smell of lightning or other electric sparks. However ozone is very reactive and will quickly react with other elements. So even though ozone is heavier then oxygen you will usually not find it far from where it is being created. The reason there is a layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere is because oxygen will react with ultraviolet light to create ozone. And the upper atmosphere gets a lot of ultraviolet light from the Sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The name makes it sound like its a band of just ozone (like what you get when you pour different density liquids into a glass and they seperate) when in reality its just normal atmosphere with a tiny bit more of o3 in it (caused by UV radiation). It just exists in higher concentrations than at lower levels because there is more UV radiation from the sun penetrating higher up which creates it, it then decays pretty quickly which is why its such a small quantity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's not that there isn't ozone near ground level because you're right it has a higher density.  It's that ozone is typically formed in the upper levels of the atomsphere due to O^2 reacting with free radicals of oxygen which are generally formed from the solar radiation that is constantly shining on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already replied to your question, but this is an important detail: even if a molecule is heavier than another per se, it doesn't mean the actual material composed by those molecules will have a higher density. H2O is a tiny molecule but water has a higher density than a vast majority of organic compounds like diethyl ether, methylamine, ethyl acetate... it all depends on the packing of the molecules.</p>
<p>Edit: on the other hand, with gases, you can guess their relative density by looking at the molecular weight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, by looking at a whole bunch of YouTube videos of trials and sentences being read out to defendants for both petty crimes and very serious crimes, there are some things I really struggle to grasp:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Judges almost always seem to include their own, personal opinions and give a &quot;moral lecture&quot; to the defendent. The judge takes up a lot of &quot;space&quot; with his or her own personality, so to speak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They seem to be able to &quot;make up&quot; punishments to some extent, e.g. sentencing the defendent to carry a sign with a humiliating message on it. Is this actually the case? Are these punishments explicitly defined in the law, or does the law in these cases give judges the freedom to come up with &quot;appropriate&quot; punishments?</p>
</li>
<li>Judges sometimes seem to subjectively change the sentence depending on what they feel like, e.g. someone being disruptive or insulting the judge: add 6 months of prison. A judge having a good day: remove (part of) a fine, or shorten a prison sentence. Is this actually the case? </li>
</ol>
<p>What's the reasoning behind all of this? How much of it is accurtate? Does it differ a lot by state?</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking is because in Sweden, the judge has a much more passive and low-key role. While they of course still are the head of the court and responsible for the process and the order in the court, there is A LOT less focus on the judge.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At trial:</p>
<p>There are two types of trials, jury trials and bench trials. There are two types of questions - questions of law and questions of fact. In a jury trial, the jury is the factfinder. They get to determine whether the defendant is guilty or innocent by determining whether the defendant did what he was charged with based on the evidence. In a bench trial, the judge determines guilt or innocence. In either case, the judge also determines questions of law. They get to see whether legally, a certain piece of evidence can be introduced, certain questions can be asked, or certain witnesses are called. </p>
<p>In sentencing - the judge determines the sentences based on statutory guidelines. Sometimes there are mandatory minimums - for certain crimes (generally repeat offenders), the judge HAS to give at least the minimum sentence. In cases without mandatory minimums, the judge has discretion to reduce (or increase) the sentence due to mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Of course, they have to generally follow the guideline of no cruel and unusual punishment, so they cant impose a 10 year sentence for shoplifting a shirt. </p>
<p>For your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Judges generally want to give justice. In many cases, they will talk to the defendant and lecture them. But in sentencing, judges can explain why they sentenced the way they did. On top of lecturing the defendant, this is all recorded as part of the court record. That way on appeal, the judge's reasoning is nicely laid out in the transcript. If the appeal's standard is, &quot;did the judge abuse their discretion,&quot; having all the reasons laid out on record about why the punishment was given helps them not get overturned. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These cases are VERY rare. These cases are also not explicitly defined in the law. But they arent unlawful, per se, as long as they arent cruel and unusual. If someone decided to appeal the conviction based on the sentence and actually get it overturned because the punishment was cruel and unusual, then future judges wont/cant/shouldnt impose these sentences. But most people would rather hold up a sign for a couple hours than pay thousands of dollars in fines (plus hire a lawyer for an appeal, which can take years) or spend time in jail. </p>
</li>
<li>Its possible. If the defendant is being disruptive or insulting the judge, the judge might impose a higher sentence. But their reasoning will never be, &quot;because they insulted me.&quot; They will say, &quot;the defendant showed little remose and didnt respect the justice system.&quot; Whether the judge is being petty or not is probably unknowable. But on the flip side, a lot of judges are willing to find mitigating factors as well - if the person is remoseful, checked into rehab, apologized or paid back the victim or whatever, the judge will often reduce the sentence, or sometimes throw out the case altogether for some of the pettier stuff. </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>As for why the difference - Sweden is a Civil Law system, where only Legislative Acts are law. The United States is a Common Law system based on a principle called &quot;stare decisis&quot; - meaning that judges create precedent for future judges to follow. Neither system is better than the other, just different. </p>
<p>For example, take the crime of Conspiracy. Conspiracy is generally defined as, &quot;two or more people agree to commit a crime and take a step in trying to commit the crime.&quot; Lets pretend both the US and Sweden have this law. Say we have a drug buy. One person sells, one person buys. Technically the selling and buying of drugs can fit under &quot;Conspiracy&quot;. However, both systems realize that this isnt the type of crime that the &quot;Conspiracy&quot; law was meant to tackle - its not conspiracy if the crime necessarily needs at least 2 people to be committed. In the US, a judge can say that in their opinion. Their case changes the current law of Conspiracy to not include these types of drug buys. In a Civil System, the Legislature needs to come forward and make this part of the law, which can take up more time. But on the flipside, they also get less abuse of power, and finding the current law is a lot easier (in the US, you might have conflicting legislation and judge-made precedent, so you might go go digging to find the most recent law and determine how much power the most recent law has). </p>
<p>From what I understand, Judges take a more active role in Civil Law systems for factfinding (calling witnesses, asking questions, presenting evidence) but less in sentencing. In the US Common Law system, the Judges rarely ask questions or present evidence. The lawyers are the ones to present all the evidence, and the Judges are there to make sure the evidence is legit. </p>
<p>EDIT - I should add that most (like 90-95%) cases are resolved with a plea bargain. There are very few guidelines for a plea except for other sentences imposed by the judges before you, and judges often subvert mandatory sentences by accepting a plea. Also, accepting a plea is considered to be a mitigating factor to reduce sentences -
since youre willing to accept responsibility for the crime (which in practice is a lot more complicated, but thats a different problem), the judge takes that into consideration. </p>
<p>And the word &quot;sentences&quot; can mean many different things that isnt jailtime. There have been a huge history of ways to give shorter/less severe sentences for crimes - things like suspended sentences. For example, a possible sentence is &quot;1 year suspended for 2 years.&quot; That means you have 1 year of jailtime, but you dont actually go to jail. You go on probation for 2 years, and if you make it through probation, you dont have to spend that year in jail. If you screw up on probation, you go to jail for the full year. \</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Sometimes the law forces the judge to impose a certain sentence, these are usually called mandatory minimums. For the most part, though, the judge has the power to decide the sentencing (except for the death penalty, that usually has to go through) the jury.</p>
<p>Also, the federal court system has sentencing guidelines that aim to standardize the process and take away some of the judge's discretion. A few states have guidelines too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They can't sentence them to hold up a sign as the punishment for the crime. They can however offer it as a condition of probation.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, they can offer almost anything except torture as a condition of probation. &quot;No computer use for 4 years&quot; is a fine deal if the alternative is a 10 year prison sentence, even though it's borderline impossible to survive without a computer (and this has been ordered often in hacking cases).</p>
<p>The key there is that the convicted person agrees to wear a clown wig rather than take the standard sentence. They don't have to agree, in which case they'll get the standard sentence, which in America at least is usually very draconian.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For most offenses other than first degree / capital murder there's a range of suggested sentences based on the crime, any aggravating or mitigating factors, and prior convictions rather than a strict schedule. For example the sentencing guidelines for a home invasion might be 5-10 years, for possession of heroin fine/probation to 60 days, etc. In some cases judges can deviate from those if they have a good reason, but that's likely to set up an appeal. For the most part they do stay within the guidelines. But 5-10 years is a big range. What the sentence is depends on how tough on crime the individual judge is, how the defendant behaves, whether the judge is having a bad day, etc. </p>
<p>Imagine a defendant breaking down crying in front of a judge saying how much he regrets his acts, combined with a judge that believes in short sentences to primarily rehabilitate, on a Friday afternoon, with support of his family after the judge has just won $1000 in lottery tickets. Then take a defendant on a Monday morning how hurls f-bombs at the court, says he didn't do it or his victims deserved it, in front of a judge who's tough on crime who just wrecked her car on the drive into court that morning. </p>
<p>The really creative punishments make news because they're so rare. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The &quot;from X miles away&quot; formulation is meant to demonstrate just how sensitive their noses are.  </p>
<p>As in, &quot;If you took some amount of blood and freely mixed it in water until it was highly dilute, then the shark could still pick it up at [impressive] distance.&quot;   It's not meant to imply that the shark can detect the blood from that distance even in the absence of the particles actually getting there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
