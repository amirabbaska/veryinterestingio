		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lobbying in its current state evolved from a more acceptable practice of simply getting advice from people knowledgable in a given field.</p>
<p>For example: If you are trying to enact reform on law enforcement, a congressman who has little interaction with the police would have a hard time drafting legislation to address any of the prevalent problems. Therefore lobbyists would come to the Congressman to give their perspective. </p>
<p>Activists from groups such as the NAACP or ACLU might give their opinion on the problems with how law enforcement currently affects people negatively, so he would know what problems need to be fixed. Representatives from the police union might give their opinion on the reasons officers act with the protocols they use. The congressman needs this kind of information to do their job effectively.</p>
<p>The reason lobbying in it's current form is often thought of as pseudo-corruption is that the theoretical lobbying described above requires access to politicians and open communication. This is also more or less a given due to constitutional freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is somewhat of a necessity to have an organized media campaign and infrastructure if you want to run for office on a large scale, such as when running for a congressional district that expands far beyond your own city. As a result, most politicians need to spend money to campaign, and the law thus allows people to donate to politicians.</p>
<p>While this may seem like it invites corruption, consider the alternative: The law cannot restrict an individual from spending their OWN money on a television ad to promote themself, due to freedom of speech. So if there was no mechanism for politicians to raise money, almost all large scale political campaigns would be inaccessible to anyone who was not privately wealthy or famous. Allowing fundraising makes it theoretically possible for anyone to run an effective campaign so long as they have supporters.</p>
<p>The result of these two things:  The open access of politicians to lobbyists as a necessity of the job, and the legality of fundraising as a necessity of campaigning, means that anyone can make their wishes known to politicians and can donate money to them if that politician ends up doing what they wish.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, there is a simple way to avoid corruption in the legally culpable sense: If you do not make an explicit or legally binding promise of payment as a result of a specific action on the politician's part, it is not a bribe. You are simply exercising your legal right to talk to your local government representative, and your legal right to donate money to that candidate.</p>
<p>The loophole comes from the fact that even if your candidate fulfils their promise, there is no guarantee that you will actually pay them, despite your informal promise. Or inversely, if you donate to a candidate there is no guarantee that they will take the actions you desire. Without such a direct provable cause/effect, you can't definitively prove corruption.</p>
<p>EDIT: To address the common responses in the comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am not trying to advocate or condemn the current system. The question asked why lobbying isn't legally corruption, so I explained what the current system is and the reasoning for how it resulted, and did so in a neutral tone, but I don't make any claim as to whether this is a good or bad system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many bring up Publicly Funded Elections, where the government gives all candidates money to run. This already exists, to a degree. For example, any political party which achieves a certain threshold in a presidential election gets federal funding in the next cycle. The reason that this alone can't solve the problem is that the Constitution can't stop an individual from campaigning on their own money, so even with public funding a wealthy person is very advantages over a poor person.</p>
</li>
<li>As for WHY we can't block individual spending on a campaign, this was the interpretation of the supreme Court on the case of &quot;Buckley v Valeo&quot;. Due to the wording of our constitution, such a law would be invalid here, Despite it being legal in some other countries. Obviously the Constitution can potentially be amended, but that's a broader conversation than I am focusing on with this comment.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why is lobbyism normal in the US?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, you need to ask, what is lobbying?</p>
<p>The 1st Amendment to the Constitution of the US says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and <strong>to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we all have the right to go into our local politician's office and be heard. If I want to go to the office of my House Rep, he has to hear what I have to say. It's my right to <em>petition</em>. Same goes for my city councilmember, mayor, State Rep, Governor, Senator, and even the President. They all have to hear what US citizens have to say.</p>
<p>Now, as an example, let's say you want to see a Congressman. There are 435 Congressional Districts in the US, each representing populations of 711,000 people. Imagine the queue you'd have to make if everyone in the district wanted to <em>redress grievances</em> with their Congressman!</p>
<p>So, to make things more efficient, people created companies that, when hired, would petition your politicians for you. This is called lobbying. This is why lobbying is legal, and population (and geographical) sizes is why it's normal. It's very hard for an American in Hawaii to visit their Representative in Washington. And it's very hard for 711,000 people to be heard all at the same time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the difference between lobbying and corruption?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lobbying is associated with corruption because special interest groups would donate money to politicians who are open to their ideas. For example, let's say Congressman A is in favor of the oil industry, the oil industry lobbyists would be more willing to donate money to Congressman A's re-election campaign. In contrast, the solar industry lobby would not only abstain from donating to Congressman A's campaign, but they'd be more willing to donate to Congressman B's campaign, because Congressman B is a proponent of solar power as an alternative to oil!</p>
<p>This looks like corruption because it appears that money is being exchanged for votes. But, can we prove that's the case? Or is it the case that these Congressmen already agreed with a particular position, and lobbyists are simply endorsing these candidates because they agree?</p>
<p>The law makes a very clear distinction: if money is given in exchange for votes, then it's corruption. So, if you say to a candidate &quot;Vote for this bill and I'll give $500K&quot;, that's corruption; it's a bribe.</p>
<p>However, if the lobbyists says, &quot;Remember that bill we talked about the other day? I saw you voted the way we like. It is clear that your worldview and ours are compatible, and since we like you so much, here's $500 for your campaign&quot;, then that's not corruption. It is perfectly legal.</p>
<p>It's a fine line, to be sure, but the law has drawn the line there, and in that fashion. Right to petition is an important right for any free society to have. </p>
<p>In the United States, congressmen have been investigated and arrested for bribery. In other words, the US <em>does</em> prosecute outright bribery. So lobbyists and politicians need to be very careful to not cross the line. The good news is that the line exists. The bad news is that many people disagree about where the line is currently drawn, and believe it should be drawn elsewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that Lobbying is just talking to your representative, and you can be representing a group of people when you do it.  You're informing a politician of your group's wants and needs.  That's it.  There doesn't need to be money involved.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the US Supreme Court determined that restricting money = restricting speech (this is colloquially known as Citizens United if you want to see more info).</p>
<p>Now, you still can't put money directly into these politicians' hands.  But you can give it to a group that supports them (A Super PAC, which they can <em>almost</em> do whatever they want with the money.  It's very flimsy, as far as regulations go).</p>
<p>The practice of lobbying by itself isn't corrupt, but because money = speech in the eyes of the law, that allows for corruption to happen legally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What's so bizarre to me about most of the responses in this thread, is that 'in the US' has been consistently interpreted to contextualize intra-US politics. To be more specific, I was surprised that comparisons are not being made to other countries ie 'what does lobbying look like outside the US?'</p>
<p>This is a fundamental question to ask, because many Americans don't realize that many countries around the world do not distinguish between lobbying and bribery. In fact, when US media outlets talk about bribery happening in other countries, the legalistic offenses often relate specifically to &quot;lobbying&quot; efforts. Read more cynically, the reason the US political system is thought not to have endemic corruption is because we have redefined what it means to be corrupt - not because we have uprooted corruption itself.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> In many other countries, lobbying <em>is considered the same thing as</em> bribery.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> A lot of replies appear to confound free speech and lobbying. There's a difference. I'm not trying to argue that actual free speech directed at politicians is necessarily lobbying. Ironically, this thread demonstrates why we have such issues in the first place around bribery. The courts in the US have exploited this to manipulate the definition of lobbying, political donations, etc (this is why we can't just say 'lobbying' in the US is the same thing as 'lobbying' in other countries). Funny how there was a Chomsky thread that hit the front page on the same day. <em>Actually, /u/BrotherPazzo explained this point much more concisely, so go check out his comment!</em></p>
<p>Also, most responses have referred to western democracies in their rebuttals - but see that's exactly my point. While there are western democracies that criminalize the equivalent of lobbying in the US, there are a great many countries (democratic ones!) outside the west that do the same. Apparently, we're not supposed to take their laws seriously.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an Italian lawyer, i can tell you that in the vast majority of cases it would be considered corruption in here. The objection is &quot;but it's not guaranteed the politician will actually do x&quot; would just make it attempted corruption (still a crime).</p>
<p>I'll give you an example.
Say a local group has an interest in the local administration to green light a project, something like modernizing a harbor, because they'll profit from it (construction companies, unions). They make sizeable above the board perfectly legal donations to candidates, that need that money to run for office in that administration. That's lobbying in the US and textbook corruption in Italy.</p>
<p>You can try to rationalize it all you want, but the simple truth is that politician in the US need money to run for office, this is provided by donations. Now why would that person/ group donate again if the promises made don't get fullfilled. So you have a politician that needs to fullfill, or at the very least do his best to fullfill, the promises made to the donor, and the only difference with corruption is that you have a legalized system in place and a different name for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of stuff is that net neutrality and net privacy are not the same things at all.  I'll try to paraphrase by memory how the two things were explained to me as if they were different. </p>
<p>Net neutrality became a buzzword for a specific thing that ISP providers were doing to other corporations and how that affected us as customers of those corporations. To give an example, TimeWarner would block all access to connection to websites for Verizon because they didn't want their ISP clients to search for better deals from a competitor. Sometimes it even became a sort of extortion racket. An ISP could block a website from their customers and then demand payment for &quot;reparation of excess stream useage&quot; from the website before they would unblock the website for their customers. </p>
<p>The most common example of net neutrality issue was that some ISP providers were throttling and restricting streams from Netflix because they were &quot;using too much bandwidth&quot; which is an issue because all ISP's like to tell you that data is a rare and expensive limited natural resource that they must carefully regulate before we use it all up faster than it can replenish iteself! (rolls eyes). </p>
<p>Back to serious topic, another thing ISP providers were doing were charging huge surcharges to companies like Netflix to refrain from throttling their streams, or to customers to allow &quot;extra streaming capacity&quot; to use Netflix. The major reason ISP providers did this was because again, companies like Netflix were competitors. If you stream video from Netflix, the chances are higher that you will cancel your cable bill, or something similar. So the &quot;neutrality&quot; part of the FCC laws that were enacted was to stop this sort of thing, because ISP's should have no right to filter or throttle what content you want to consume out of the desire to interfere with fair market trade. This is especially true when you consider they often have a monopoly in their markets. If you don't like what your ISP is doing, most people don't have any options to find some other provider in their area. This is a whole other issue that needs to be dealt with. </p>
<p>The net privacy issue is the one that concerns people because of the bill was just passed by senate and house. It's a bit more complicated than that, because the bill is actually a repeal and replacement of some points of another bill that was started last year, and also the relocation of jurisdiction from one overblown bloated government regulation department to another. But that's really not &quot;the issue&quot;. The issue is that the concept that Google, Facebook, and now your ISP should have some right to monetize your own personal activity on your internet time in order to generate ad revenue, or sell the data to massive analytics companies that use the data later for targeted &quot;marketing opportunities&quot;. </p>
<p>The thing about this bill is that previously, it didn't stop Facebook from such practices, or any other website company where you had to create an account. The concept behind that was if you wanted to keep your life private, simply don't use those social media type websites because there are other alternatives. The new bill is basically giving the same opportunities to ISP providers who you purchase your internet access from, because they complained that websites aren't regulated and have an unfair advantage in opportunity. </p>
<p>The concern is further than the concept that they might just sell what you do to advertisers, but say, they could sell your health searches like &quot;lung cancer&quot; to insurance companies who can then see what you're searching and prepare to raise costs and premiums against you personally based on that data that you might have lung cancer issues and thereby avoid the law in the Affordable Healthcare Act which requires that they cannot raise costs to customers based on previous conditions. Again though, this is nothing that Google wasn't already legally allowed to do before now anyway. </p>
<p>I used to work for this guy, this really shady guy in the late 1980's who did a mailing advertisement scheme. Some of you may remember, how you'd get these envelopes full of coupon printouts trying to get you to go take your business to a lot of other places, like $5 off coupon for a drycleaner's shop, buy one steam carpet room and get a second free offers, stuff like that. Well that's a mailing ad scheme. The people who print the coupons purchased mailing names and lists of people and their addresses from phone companies, or other middle man companies that laboriously copied it all from phone books and stuff. Then they'd sell the concept to businesses that we can send coupons in the mail to all these people on this list for x amount of dollars to bring you new business! And the advertising/publishing company that did all this purchased block lists of names and addresses, like 500 dollars to get 2000 addresses with x zip code, etc. This is really not any different than what's going on now. People have been selling your personal information for profit since before there ever was an internet. The truth is, large companies have been invading your privacy for almost a century now, regardless of the technology involved. </p>

If it lives at all, unless it changes its principle reason for opposing you in the first place, it will go away, regroup, retrain, strengthen, then attack again.</p>
<p>That's how it is with everything in this representative republic. If you value something strongly enough, you must continue to fight for it to keep it alive, and teach your children and grandchildren why and how to effectively fight for it as well.</p>
<p>Imagine the thing you value as being a plant. If you stop watering it, it will die. If you don't keep pests away, it will be consumed. If you don't protect it, it will die. If you don't fertilize it properly, it will get sick and die. If you don't trim and prune it properly, it will become overgrown, consume all its available resources, become anemic, and die. Keeping your plant alive and healthy requires regular attention and maintenance, and, sometimes, 100% focus on defending it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because our victories on net neutrality have been really weak. </p>
<p>The bills that we've been fighting, like PIPA and SOPA, weren't voted on. They were withdrawn. </p>
<p>The 2015 FCC regulation on net neutrality was just an administrative reclassification of Internet service providers as &quot;common carriers&quot; which then subjected the ISPs to rules that prevented paid prioritization under Title 2 of the Communications Act. Hillary Clinton in 2015 described this as merely <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/233722-clinton-backs-fcc-on-net-neutrality" target="_blank">&quot;a foot in the door. It's a values statement. ... [The FCC] is hanging this on Title 2 because it's the only hook they've got.&quot;</a></p>
<p>What we really need, in order to make a victory on net neutrality stick, is to pass a law through Congress. We need a majority of Representatives in the House. We need a majority of Senators in the Senate. We need the President to sign it into law. </p>
<p>We don't have that yet, and the majority party in Congress is on the other side, so we have to keep fighting for net neutrality and privacy every year just to prevent laws that would make things worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-011-0515-5" target="_blank">This article [1]</a> talks about how four legged animals are more vulnerable to lightning strikes because ground current has high chances to go through vital organs. It also describes how large animals such as giraffes and elephants have higher chances of deadly strikes. There is the obvious thing about the fact that they are tall so even under a tree there is a non-negligeable chance that lighting could <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iYzL85H.png" target="_blank">jump directly to their head</a>. The other less obvious one is that even if they are not directly hit, the large distance their legs span increased the voltage (and potentially the current) going though them (as described in<a href="http://i.imgur.com/JkPWM1K.png" target="_blank"> this figure</a>). Sadly the article lacks hard numbers on strike frequency depending on the species. </p>
<p>This <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/07/15/mammal-deaths-by-lightning/" target="_blank">blog post</a> seems to suggest that giraffes getting killed by lightning is not that uncommon. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1996 and 1999 the Rhino and Lion Reserve near Krugersdorp, South Africa, had two of its three giraffes killed by lightning – the third animal (a juvenile) was also struck but survived. Betsy the giraffe was killed by lightning at Walt Disney World in Florida in 2003 (in front of lots of witnesses).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A juvenile giraffe at Louisiana’s Global Wildlife Center, named Dusty, was killed after lightning struck a nearby tree. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there! Patreon is how I make <a href="http://patreon.com/fek" target="_blank">my living</a> (Weird / NSFW), and I've also had successful campaigns on both Kickstarter and GoFundMe.</p>
<p>So the main differences between Patreon and other crowdfunding sites (like Kickstarter and GoFundMe) are:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Patreon is about <em>recurring</em> donations.</strong> You don't just make a $20 pledge, you make a pledge to donate $3 every month. And while there's nothing stopping you from just unpledging whenever you want, most people don't. They're there to support the artist over the long-term, not just with a one-shot donation.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Patreon has looser terms than Kickstarter and GoFundMe.</strong> Kickstarter and GoFundMe campaigns are structured for people/teams who are making a single, actionable, deliverable product. Patreon is structured for <em>people</em>, not projects. As long as you're a person doing something creative, you can use Patreon.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Patreon has a fairly lenient policy on adult content</strong>, and has actually fought many battles on behalf of their adult content creators. For instance, Patreon recently struck a deal with Paypal to allow Paypal payments on adult projects, something that Paypal is normally <em>very</em> averse to. To the best of my knowledge, this is actually the first time Paypal has officially allowed its service to be used for the purchase of adult goods and services.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure of the mechanics of gofundme, but the way Patreon works fits youtubers quite well and it's a matter of market share. Patreon did a few very smart things though:</p>
<p>1) They branded themselves as a means to support &quot;artists&quot; which appeals to the creative spirit and ego of youtube video creators whether they are particularly artistic or not. </p>
<p>2) They also tailored their service to the format. Patreon followers can pledge, for example, $2 per video released per month up to a maximum of $10 or $25 per video per month with no max. Or just donate once. It makes it highly customizable to fit every budget. </p>
<p>3) They've enabled creators to give bonuses to patreon followers at different levels. It's like a PBS fund drive in that way. Donate $5 per video and you get a tshirt, but $25 gets you a bloopers DVD. That sort of thing. </p>
<p>3) But most importantly, they had some youtubers who made a lot of money using their service and that caught the attention of other creators. I follow a sailing channel, for example, that at one point made something like $10,000 per video they release because of their Patreon followers, which is just incredible as far as I'm concerned. They get to sail the world and make incredible HD videos, and they make $40-50,000/month. Makes me feel like going to school for 19 years and amassing $200k in debt wasn't such a grand plan after all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Patreon, Kickstarter, and GoFundMe are three separate services with three separate purposes.</p>
<p>GoFundMe is intended to be charity work for the donators. One person or group has a need for money, and people give it to them. There is no expectation of reciprocity.</p>
<p>Patreon and Kickstarter are services to be used by a business.</p>
<p>Kickstarter was based on the idea of &quot;I have an idea and a design, but I have no capital to produce my first line of product. If you invest in me, you'll get one of the first products I make.&quot; If the project makes enough to justify the production run, then it gets made. If not, all money is returned to the donators and the project goes unfunded. It's a one time purchase for a one time return.</p>
<p>Patreon is aimed toward continuous content creators in a subscription-style service. For a monthly payment, users (&quot;patrons&quot;) gain access to a profile where the content creator posts media accessible only to various levels of patrons based on their monthly subscription amount. Some patreon profiles release their content for patrons early before releasing it for free on another platform (YouTube) but patrons get to see it early. This is more common when Patreon is a supplemental source of income, or when Patreon is seen as a &quot;donation box&quot; in exchange for the work the creator has done that they intended to be free from the start.      </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference is in a GoFundMe it's a one time thing you set up a campaign collect money for that one thing and then that's it.  Pateron is ongoing support.  So you set up your page and people agree to give you $X per month or per video or whatever.  They can support you as long as they like.  </p>
<p>Youtubers like it because the ad rates on youtube aren't great.  If you are supporting yourself solely on Youtube ads you need about a million views a week to have it be a full time job.  Pateron lets people with passionate fans keep youtube their full time gig when they can't get that many views.  Maybe their videos are niche so there aren't 100,000 people that will watch ten videos a week of quilting but the people that do love quilting videos really love them.  Maybe the videos take a long time to make like animations so even if a million people watched each video they only come out once a month.  Maybe it takes a team to make the video like a web series so you'd actually need 4 or 5 million views a week to support everyone as full time employees.  One $1 patron is worth more then 1000 views and a lot of people donate more then that a month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just Youtubers, you can find virtually any sort of artist, content creator.  </p>
<p>Yes, Patreon is kind of like Gofundme, except instead of giving a single amount to a project you can effectively subscribe to someone donating a planned amount each month.  In exchange the content creator is expected to provide additional benefits to their supports (usually in the form of exclusive content or early access).</p>
<p>Thinking about it another way - people have been doing this for a very long time.  Being a <em>Patron</em> of an Artist in the Renaissance meant giving them money or resources to continue to make their art.  Patreon is just a modern version of that, crowd funding money so a popular artist can devote more time to their art.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a very big impact crater on the far side. Probably you meant lunar maria. They formed when impacts were big enough to break the lunar crust and reach the molten interior, so lava came out and later solidified in a relatively smoother and darker surface. The impact on the far side just created a big crater with no mare as the crust is thicker.</p>
<p>There are two theories about this. They do not contradict each other so they could even be both true.</p>
<p>One of them says that when the lunar maria formed, Earth was still hot and emitting lots of infrared. So the near side of the Moon was kept warmer, with a thinner solid crust.</p>
<p>Another theory is based on the giant impact hypothesis. Some background: A Mars-sized body (called Theia) is supposed to have impacted Earth at a relatively low speed. The collision created a disc of debris that eventually coalesced and formed the Moon.</p>
<p>Back to the maria: the other theory says that from this disc of debris it was actually <em>two moons</em> that formed. But since they were sharing the same orbit in an unstable configuration, eventually they crashed at a low speed and the smaller moon &quot;pancaked&quot; over the larger one, creating a thicker crust on that side. Then the Moon gradually became tidally locked and the thicker crust happened to be on the far side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll start with explaining what each thing is, then talk about the athletic body.  </p>
<p>The lungs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidal volume is the air moved for every inhale or exhale phase of each breathing cycle, this ranges from 0.4-1.0L of air per breath, but the average is about 0.5L</li>
<li>Breathing rate is simply the frequency, or how many breaths you're taking, per minute. For most people, this is about 12 breaths/min</li>
<li>Minute ventilation is a simple calculation:
Minute Ventilation (Ve) = Breathing rate x Tidal volume
So substituting in the values [Ve = 12x5;] Ve = 6L/min
AT REST - In the athletic body there really isn't much of a difference from sedentary (people who don't exercise) people; both groups of people breath the same amount of air and same frequency leading to about the same minute ventilation (6L/min); now these values can all be quite individualized, but it gives a good ballpark figure to have.
(the respiratory system (lungs) is kind of over built in our bodies, meaning when you exercise and feel really tired and have to stop it's typically not because your lungs aren't getting enough air in (unless you have a pathological reason, like exercise induced bronchitis or vocal cord dysfunction), it's generally due to the heart and blood vessels system and the muscles not being able to take enough oxygen out of the blood) </li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the Heart, I'll start with cardiac output and work back:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiac Output (Q) again is a simple calculation (but measuring these values can be a bit tricky):
Q = Stroke Volume (SV) x Heart Rate (HR)
And what it really tells us is the capacity of the cardiovascular system; the fitter you are the higher you can get your Cardiac Output, meaning you can pump more blood to working muscles to increase performance. When you're not doing anything your tissues don't really need much oxygen, so you can pump less leading to smaller Q.
At rest for everybody (active or not), your cardiac output is ~5L for males, women are typically closer to 4L (this is primarily due to size differences).</li>
<li>Cardiac volume - Now I'm going to assume you really mean stroke volume here; Stroke volume (SV) is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart each stroke. This is the biggest change to occur between an athlete and an inactive individual and is the most complicated, I'll try my best to keep it simple.
Athletes hearts get better at filling with blood when the heart is relaxed, as well as better at emptying during contraction of the heart. Another factor that improves SV is with training your blood volume usually increases (you have more blood in your body), which helps to increase the filling of the heart at rest. You also see less resistance to flow in the peripheral vasculature (your arteries). This means your heart pumping at X amount of force can push the blood further than if there was more resistance in the tubes (arteries). </li>
</ul>
<p>[SKIP THIS IS NOT INTERESTED] I read in the comments someone saying your heart hypertrophies (gets bigger); I'll explain this a bit more in depth. Google heart anatomy if you aren't familiar with ventricles and atrium (its straight forward don't worry, you just need to be familiar with left ventricle). So with training, there is remodelling of the heart, meaning things change to the cardiac muscle. You see the left ventricle (LV) (which is the really important one since it's the ventricle that has to push blood all over your body, so it's the strongest) increase in its wall thickness, to make sure the total volume of the LV doesn't decrease the heart expands slightly; we call this eccentric hypertrophy since the growth in cardiac tissue is a result of blood flowing into the heart and cause the tissue to stretch before it contract (this is seen in endurance athletes like cross country skiers, bikers, runners etc). You can also have concentric hypertrophy where the LV increases in wall thickness without the subsequent increase in heart size, this is more typical in powerlifters. If your heart is growing too much it'll start to hit the pericardium, which is just a tough outer shell surrounding the heart, this will cause issues with pumping. This is really only seen in clinical patients who have growth hormone imbalances or from genetics, not an issue for most population and IS NOT a result of exercise!</p>
<ul>
<li>Heart Rate (HR) is the number of beats per minute, how many times your heart pumps; in an athletic heart you typically see a decrease in the heart rate, this will be explained below</li>
</ul>
<p>For an inactive person to have a resting cardiac output of 5L, with a resting heart rate of about 70bpm, you can estimate their stroke volume to be about 71mL
In an athlete at rest, you still have the same 5L for cardiac output. But your stroke volume is typically much higher, up near ~100mL. This means that to maintain the 5L cardiac output your heart can pump fewer beats per minute, allowing athletes to have lower resting heart rates. Personally,  I'm in the low 40s. I've heard of elite cross-country skiers can get down to 30bpm or lower at rest</p>
<p>TLDR; no difference in lungs at rest, Q=SVxHR, athletes have bigger SV, so there HR can be smaller for a given Q at rest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Athletes have had their heart pumping at greater speeds for longer periods of time than most people, and have thus worked harder to pump more blood than most. When you work out a muscle harder, the cells grow, which is called hypertrophy. Athletes hearts slightly hypertrophy and thus can pump more blood in one beat than before (higher stroke volume). However their resting heart rate will be lower since the heart no longer needs to beat as fast when it pumps more blood per beat. Overall cardiac output = (stroke volume x heart rate) so as heart rate increases the cardiac output increases during excercise, and although stroke volume decreases slightly it does not decrease enough to decrease cardiac output until you reach a very high heart rate as you no longer give the heart time to fill. As far as breathing goes, when you heavily excercise your metabolized Co2 goes up and oxygen goes down due to consumption for ATP, thus increases breathing is required to breathe off co2 and breathe in o2. To do this more efficiently you take deeper breaths rather than faster ones to give air time to get to the alveoli and for gas exchange to occur. Thus tidal volume is increased and resting ventilation is lower. </p>

The heart is a muscle after all, regularly 'working out' strengthens the muscles, like any other, making the exertions of pumping blood around the body a little easier. Just as lifting heavy weights becomes easier with time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a small educational YouTuber, so I can't promise that this covers all the bases, but I can give you an idea of how we make money.  There are really four or five revenue streams, and the composition differs depending on the creator.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>YouTube pre-roll, mid-roll, and text ads.
These are the ads that you typically think of when you think of YouTube ads.  The ones you can skip.  Unless you get millions of views, this is not going to be a major source of revenue.  The CPM (cost per one thousand views) is just too low usually.  It ranges from $1-4 dollars per thousand views, and is way more beneficial to YouTube than to YouTubers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baked-in ads.  Did one of your favorite creators recommend SquareSpace or Audible to you?  They got paid for that.  Depending on your viewership and engagement, an ad spot like this can range from several thousand dollars to several hundred.  This is often a major revenue stream for people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patreon.  It is a service where fans pledge a monthly donation for benefits or merchandise.  Depending on the creator this can be almost all of their revenue (some turn off ads as a Patreon goal) or literally none of it (they don't have a Patreon).  Some creators get upwards of $20,000 dollars a month off of Patreon (TeamFourStar makes $11,000 a month, CGPGrey makes $18,000 per video) but most successful YouTubers get between $500 - $2000 a month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online store merchandise.  Just like it sounds, people buying shirts, mugs, etc.  This is way too variable of a revenue stream for me to summarize.</p>
</li>
<li>Only very specific types of YouTubers who are well-respected and  famous get this, but events and guest appearance fees.  Some YouTubers host shows, tours, and conferences (Nerdcon, Vidcon, RTX, etc.). For example, Michael from vsauce is touring with Adam Savage from myth busters.  Ticket sales and merch at these events can be a great source of revenue.</li>
</ol>
<p>There might be other minor money makers, but these are the big five at least.  Being a YouTuber is hard, but some of the really top tier guys are multi-millionaires from it.  It all depends on how smart of a businessperson you are, and how engaged your audience is (and how large it is).  I hope this gave you an overview of the revenue sources available to YouTubers.  There are sites that estimate how much YouTubers make, but it is all guesswork usually.</p>
<p>Edit: another source of revenue that I would wrap into #1 is YouTube Red.  Based on how many Red viewers you have, you get paid.  It is weird, complicated, and difficult to ELI5.  YouTube also handpicks some creators to make YouTube Red Originals, and they pay for parts of production and I assume pay those creators fairly handsomely.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Grey just made $18,000 dollars as I was discussing his income.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Amazon Affiliate links also make some YouTubers money as /u/lionheart2189 mentioned below.  It is usually not that significant unless you review products on your channel.  I don't, and don't chat with any YouTubers who do, so I didn't think of it right away.  Linus Media is an example of a company that makes a large part of their revenue through this method.  (LinusTechTips, Techquickie, etc.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are going to tell you that they make their money through ads, and for some people that is where all their money comes from. But for properly run channels, ad revenue normally only accounts for about 10% of the total revenue (this is obviously a very broad generalization, but it's what I've seen consistently). </p>
<p>As far as ads go, content creators get paid based on something called CPM, aka cost per mille, aka cost per thousand. Their CPM is how much they make for every 1,000 monetised views. If someone is watching with adblock on, their view isn't monetisable. If the video is deemed not advertising friendly, then none of the views will be monetised. The CPM is bassed off of how much advertisers are willing to pay to show an ad on that video, so if you're video is on how to choose the best car insurance, insurance agencies are willing to pay a lot to have their ad on the video, so the CPM will be much higher than if your video is about cheap meals to cook. The CPM is also effected by where your traffic is coming from. If your videos are popular in T1 countries (rich, developed countries who speak English, like the US, Canada, Australia, UK) then your CPM will be much higher than if the traffic is all coming from India and Bangladesh. CPM can vary so much that there really is no limit to how high or low it can go, but the average CPM will be around the $1 - $2.50 mark. Unfortunately CPM is on the decline, and we have been seeing a steady drop in CPM over the last few years. </p>
<p>Smart creators diversify their income streams with things like Patreon, affiliate marketing, sponsorship's, product placement, and selling physical or digital goods (like clothes, or books). To a smart creator, these things can make up 90%+ of their revenue, and if they aren't utilizing them, they are leaving money on the table. Gone are the days where you could just put a video up and make decent money. </p>
<p>I've seen people with 60,000 subscribers making $200,000+ a year from their social media, or people with 1,000,000+ subscribers making less than $80,000 a year. If you're smart and business savvy, you can make a lot of money from a small audience. But if you neglect the business side and just want to be a creator, then chances are you'll struggle to make money.  </p>
<p>As a small case study, let's look at Geek and Sundry's twitch, which has had most of it's success thanks to a live stream of D&amp;D called Critical Role. In about 2 years they have grown to 35,000 paying subscribers, each of these subscribers pay $5 a month, which means they are bringing in over $2,000,000 a year just in subscription fees. That's before the 2 sponsorships they have, and before all the youtube ad revenue, and before all the merchandising. </p>
<p>I've got 10 years experience with online marketing, mostly social media, and am planning on launching a big YT channel within the next 4 months, so feel free to ask any questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few good answers in here regarding ad revenue but they're somewhat difficult to follow in my opinion. For the sake of making things easier to understand, let's say we have a monetized video that currently has precisely 100,000 views.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Step 1. CPM</h2>
<p>To start, a company is running an advertisement campaign and they are paying $6.00 for their advertisement to be shown 1,000 times, and another company is paying $5.67, and another is paying $6.13. The average of this is called &quot;CPM.&quot; CPM stands for Cost Per Mille, &quot;Mille&quot; meaning thousand. CPM generally means how much you are paid for showing people's advertisements 1,000 times.(Note: This changes <em>all</em> the time, because advertisers will pay more for their ads to be shown first. Take November or December for example, where ad rates are their highest.) Right this instant, for my channel, <a href="http://imgur.com/sUhwsLO" target="_blank">CPM seems to be $6.09.</a> This is pretty normal.</p>
<h2>Step 2. Monetized Views</h2>
<p>Now let's get back to the video with 100,000 views. Just because the video has been seen 100,000 times doesn't mean an advertisement has been shown 100,000 times. People have adblock, or sometimes it just doesn't show an ad. When an advertisement is shown, it is considered a &quot;monetized view&quot; in the analytics page of your channel. Generally, monetized views are about a third of the amount of video views. My channel, for having <a href="http://imgur.com/CAprzdF" target="_blank">45,129,607 views,</a> has had <a href="http://imgur.com/IkR0vxB" target="_blank">15,100,731</a> monetized views. With this same ratio, a video with 100,000 views might have around 33,000 monetized views.</p>
<h2>Step 3. Combining the Two</h2>
<p>At this point is where we combine CPM and monetized views. With the CPM (cost per thousand monetized views) currently at $6.09, and a video with 33,000 <em>monetized</em> views, that means the video has earned $200.97. BUT, YouTube has to take their share, of course, so they take their half, and you're left with <strong>$100.48 earned from a video with 100,000 views.</strong></p>
<p>*<em>This is also incredibly specific and can be different for other people. Different genres have different advertisements, ad rates are different every month, etc. but you get the general idea.</em></p>

<p>Ad revenue is near $180 for every 100,000 views you get. At some points in the year, like December, you get much more money-per-view because of something called CPM. CPM is basically the number that is decided by the amount of advertisers trying to buy ad space on youtube. In months like December, where every advertiser is running hundreds of ads, i get somewhere around 4X revenue during that period, no matter my views.</p>
<p>I also like to work with companies to do brand deals / sponsorships. They'll pay you to put sponsored content in your video. Usually you're approached by about 10 companies a week (through email) to see if you're interested in being sponsored by them, so there's a HUGE market there. </p>
<p>Amazon associates is a very easy way to basically make passive income as well. I put all of my computer's specifications/parts in my descriptions of my videos with amazon links to those specific parts. Amazon pays me a percentage of any purchase made after the user clicked on those links. So if a person wanted to buy the camera I use, they could go to amazon through my custom URL and purchase it, and because i brought them to amazon, i get a small cut of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a YouTuber from Germany. There are several revenue streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Google Adsense: YouTube pays 55% of all of the revenue that your channel creates with the preroll ads in front of your videos etc. (unless you have adblock ;((
This usually amounts to about 1€/$1 per 1000 Views but can be higher if you make longer videos (above 10min you can put a lot more ads in) - or if you have content that is easy for specific advertisers to target (like a Gaming, Beauty or Film channel), its also higher in December, because brands advertise more for Christmas. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brand Deals: &quot;Influencer Marketing&quot; is very popular. Brands will pay big money to sponsor individual videos, series or entire channels. People like Casey Neistat are also actual testimonials for brands like Samsung, like Jonny Depp is for some watch or perfume brand.
In Germany we are talking up to 80€/$80 per 1000 views for a single brand integration for one video. As far as I know, big US-channels can earn a lot more than that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merchandise/Books/Products/Music/Movies/Events - Many YouTubers sell their own T-Shirts or have products that fit their content (your own make-up line as a beauty channel i.e.). Many YouTubers nowadays also try to release songs or sell straight to DVD movies like Grace Helbig, or sell tickets to a standup show etc, work with Netflix or YouTube Red on exclusive Pay-Per-View shows etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crowdfunding: A lot of more creative channels use platforms like Patreon to fund their videos through audience donations.</p>
</li>
<li>Livestreaming: This is a combination of ad revenue through platforms like Twitch and viewer donations/subscribtions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would say these are the most common ones - nowadays many YouTubers have their own companies, providing services for brands or media companies, producing YouTube commercials etc.
Many YouTubers als get paid to speak at company events about social media or even straight up advice companies about their brands YouTube channels. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just going to Copy-Paste from another thread I replied to:</p>
<p>Ok, I do netsec &amp; net eng so without going into super specifics let's give this a whirl:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but is it now also possible Google to sell my browsing data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It always was, and they do. Google makes it's money by creating user profiles, and selling them to ad agencies, or running ads themselves. That is where their money comes from.</p>
<p>The thing is google doesn't have all your browsing data. Google has your search history, any tracking done through their ad services, your email, your location if you use google maps, and basically anything you do on chrome or stock android, especially if you are signed in.</p>
<p>Now google themselves uses this information to provide a very good service. Ever wonder why google searches tend to be the best? Well not only are they the biggest, but because of their user profile, they know what you want.</p>
<p>Take a member of /r/the_donald and /r/politics. Have those two users both search the word &quot;impeach&quot; and they will get two different suggestion lists. While both will likely have &quot;Impeach Obama&quot; and &quot;Impeach Trump&quot; they will likely be in different order.</p>
<p>This is because google is predicting what you want based on previous search history &amp; email keywords (yes google scans your email).</p>
<p>Now google provides <strong>excellent</strong> service, but there is a price to pay for it. On the internet if you are not paying for something you can assume you are the product being sold.</p>
<p>Unless of course google is your ISP. Then they get everything, because they can see everything.</p>
<hr />
<p>Onto what <em>YOU</em> can do about it. Get yourself a VPN (Virtual private Network).</p>
<p>There are many providers, I myself use NORDVPN, but they aren't the most popular due to some customer service issues, and they aren't the most secure if you aren't running on openVPN. The upside is they are relatively cheap, very simple to use, and have a lot of nodes all over the world.</p>
<p>But if you are just looking to anonymize your traffic, circumvent region locks, and maybe hide some torrenting I think they're great.</p>
<p>On to the technical side, who is a VPN and what does it do?</p>
<p>A VPN basically creates an encrypted traffic tunnel &amp; routes all your internet traffic through that.</p>
<p>So instead of seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>workacct1484 connects to reddit.com </li>
<li>workacct1484 pulls down images from /r/unxpectedjihad</li>
<li>workacct 1484 receives torrent traffic from <nodes></li>
</ul>
<p>my ISP instead sees:</p>
<ul>
<li>workacct1484 blarglblarglc'thulhuharblehoggglyfthagn to <Server></li>
<li>workacct1484 blarglblarglr'lyehharblehoggglywtagn to <Server></li>
<li>workacct1484 blarglblarglph'ngluiharblehoggglymglw'nafh to <Server></li>
</ul>
<p>So my ISP has no idea what I am doing on that connection, only that all my traffic is going to that server. So while they <em>could</em> sell my browsing data, it would be useless.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.limevpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/banner.png" target="_blank">Diagram</a></p>
<p>Now you might say to yourself, &quot;Self, what if the MPAA suspects workacct1484 of torrenting. Can't they sue &amp; subpoena the VPN provider for their logs?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, they can. Which is why you need a VPN provider that does not keep logs. Many of them don't and what happens is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>MPAA sues &amp; demands VPN logs</li>
<li>VPN provider says Ok, but we don't have them. We do not keep logs. We cannot give you something we don't have.</li>
<li>MPAA curses</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you start torrenting too much (like actually releasing the new content as node 0), or start doing more shady things like drug deals, and the FBI needs to get involved, you may be in trouble. Because a VPN can be compromised. It's not a 100% guarantee. But security isn't about being unbreachable, it's about being more secure than the attacker cares to break.</p>
<p>How do we get around this? TOR:</p>
<hr />
<p>TOR the onion browser, a necessary tool in the fight for privacy.</p>
<p>What does TOR do? Well TOR encrypts your traffic. At every. single. network hop.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Well you don't connect to reddit.com. do a traceroute to even google.com &amp; you will see many hops. Each hop TOR re-ecnrypts your traffic.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.linuxreviews.org/images/7/72/How_tor_works.png" target="_blank">Diagram</a></p>
<p>This does create a slow connection but a much more secure connection. It is not 100% secure though. If someone controls both the first &amp; last node you use, they can do reasonably well finding out your traffic with some other information. I won't get into the specifics, but suffice to say it is <strong>NOT</strong> easy, but it <em>CAN</em> be done.</p>
<hr />
<p>So if you really want to ensure privacy what do you do? Well first off, stop using chrome. Use an opensource browser like opera or firefox.</p>
<p>Second get a VPN.</p>
<p>Third use TOR over that VPN.</p>
<p>Fourth, start calling your representatives &amp; telling them how you feel, then GET OUT &amp; VOTE. Representatives can see who is registered to vote, if you call or email and bitch, but aren't registered to vote, they do not give a single fuck about your opinion.</p>
<p>Finally, realize you lack the money &amp; expertise to stop a truly dedicated attacker with any sufficient backing.</p>
<hr />
<p>And finally what does this mean for you?</p>
<p>For the average person. Nothing. You will not really see an impact from ISPs selling your browsing data to advertisers. Because it's already happening. And it's not just ISPs. It's google, microsoft, apple, amazon, onstar, basically everyone does it. Especially facebook. </p>
<h1>GET THE FUCK OFF FACEBOOK IF YOU CARE AT ALL ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY.</h1>
<p>They are literally public enemy #1 when it comes to privacy.</p>
<p>But why should you care?</p>
<p>Because these people are often very careless. Not because they choose to be, but because they honestly don't give two flying fucks about your data. And if they get compromised other people may be able to view your data. Maybe your company buys your data &amp; sees you looking for a new job &amp; fires you. Maybe your neighbor buys your history &amp; sees that you frequent /r/clopclop (NSFW) and uses that to blackmail or embarrass you because you called them out at a school PTA meeting. Maybe an identity thief sees you going to <Local Credit Union>.com and now can focus their attack.</p>
<p>If you don't think your internet history matters, then post it here. All of it. Oh and everything you cleared. And everything done in &quot;private&quot; browsing modes.</p>
<p>And because, personally, I just don't think it's right. You should be allowed privacy. You shouldn't be tracked, and monitored, and sold like cattle. You are a person, not a commodity. And because very often people do not have choice in ISPs, you need to actually fight for your rights because the market is not &quot;free&quot; and there are no realistic competitive options.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could mean invasion of internet privacy, more information for third party affiliates (ADs, blackmail) that come from you.</p>
<p>Plus National Agencies that bulk search your information, all this is controversial and not publicly admitted nor should be taken to heart in truth but the very fact that ISP does this opens a lot of doors.</p>
<p>Australia has some of the worst internet in the world, they also have a law in which meta data (websites you visit) can be kept up for 2 years by your ISP.  This is usually so the our agencies can get some private information to link you dangerous things or advertisement data selling.</p>
<p>As other have said, having a VPN protects you in a small way against a small threat, it will encrypt your traffic and make it harder for the ISPs to figure exactly what traffic, what website you are on. But some ISPs do have tools that narrow it down to exactly kind of data, not what data but what kind if you are using text, video, torrenting. Nethertheless, unless you have leaks, they shouldn't find out anything about what you are doing.</p>
<p>Commerical VPNs are not the trustworthy in the sense of absolute security as they could be monitored, bought but they do protect you from ISPs as they usually don't have the power nor interest to chase your data.</p>
<p>Either ways, a VPN is not absolutely secure but it should provide doubt and shouldn't link you to any data that the ISP can use. If they tell you to stop using a VPN or link you to something. That's a basic invasion of privacy and would recommend switching. What ISP is directly selling browser history anyways?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The FCC Privacy regulation would have prevented ISPs from selling your social security number, medical information, information about your children, and similar extremely personal information without your express consent.  This regulation would have come into effect later this year.  The FCC is now prohibited from trying to make similar regulations in the future.</p>
<p>So there's no actual change to the status quo: ISPs are able to sell any information they have about you.  Your ISP may allow you to opt out of this; I recommend searching for <ISP> Residential privacy policy, and searching for &quot;opt-out&quot; on that page.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually wrote a somewhat indepth post regarding what the rollback means and what you could do to protect yourself: <a href="http://infinitejestexcellentfancy.blogspot.com/2017/03/fcc-rollback-what-just-happened-and.html" target="_blank">http://infinitejestexcellentfancy.blogspot.com/2017/03/fcc-rollback-what-just-happened-and.html</a></p>
<p>Very basically: your internet service provider ISP  (meaning Verizon/AT&amp;T/T-Mobile...) can now collect, store and sell your internet browsing history, the content of your messages and emails (if these are available), your geo-information (GPS data on your phone), and which apps you used on your phone (and when, for how long...).</p>
<p>This data comes with your name (or potentially, social security number) and will be used by advertisement companies for targeted marketing.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, advertisement companies know nothing about keeping databases secure, so we run the risk of someone leaking this information. At which case everyone is getting doxed.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
