		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I'm far from an expert on complexity theory, but I can give you some idea of the magnitude of the effects we're talking about.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's ignore recent developments for a bit, and discuss the hypothetical question.</p>
<p>Knowing BB(10000) means you are in possession of an algorithm which gives you, simultaneously,</p>
<ul>
<li>the computable enumeration of the halting Turing Machines with (less than) 10.000 states,</li>
<li>the computable enumeration of the <em>provably</em> non-halting Turing Machines with (less than) 10.000 states,</li>
</ul>
<p>on a blank tape.</p>
<p>The trivial corollary is that if you have an arbitrary TM that describes a certain system and has less than 10.000 states, you can look it up in this enumeration and proclaim (as loudly as you want) whether it halts or not. Since we can restate many problems in CS in terms of the question whether a TM halts or not, this is a very useful result. You could use it to trivially verify many a piece of software, by looking them up in that enumeration.</p>
<p>While this can certainly have value, it doesn't seem as useful as Eliezer claims. It's certainly painstakingly difficult to construct TMs for simple problems spanning more than a couple tens of states. Is it hyperbole?</p>
<hr />
<p>Not so fast (no pun intended). Let's take into account actual historical developments again.</p>
<p>The Busy Beaver functions result in some absurdly Big numbers. We know exactly only up to BB(4)=107 (Brady 1975), and we have some <em>lower</em> bounds on BB(5) ≥ 47.176.870 (Marxen and Buntrock 1990), BB(6) ≥ 7,4 × 10^(36.534) (Kropitz 2010), BB(23) &gt; Graham’s number (“Deedlit” and “Wythagoras” 2013).</p>
<p>In April 2016, Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson described a TM with N = 7918. They noted that enumerating the theorems of ZFC would need a big number of states. They used a graph theoretic statement proved by Harvey Friedman to be equivalent to the consistency of a theory that implies the consistency of ZFC. By defining a new high-level language that is easily compiled down to Turing machine description, they built a machine that would halt, <em>if it found a counterexample to Friedman’s statement</em>. Therefore this TM's behaviour (when run on a blank tape) can never be proven from the usual axioms of set theory, under reasonable consistency hypotheses. See <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/busybeaver.pdf" target="_blank">Yedidia and Aaronson (2016)</a>.</p>
<p>So <em>if</em> you had a memory card with a number for BB(10000) in it, you could waltz into the offices of the IMU, declare set theory (and Mathematics) as we know it null and void, and request a Fields Medal and whatever monetary award you saw fit. Possibly all other sorts of ridiculous things. Fortunately, nobody'll ever have it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Perhaps more relevant is the Fat Body.</p>
<p>Insects have an organ called the Fat Body. Lipids (fats) are stored here in adipocytes in the form of triglycerides (same way mammals store fat, essentially). These lipids are consumed during periods of high energy demand (like when flying), and are replenished in periods of food abundance. </p>
<p>Some insects have been shown to increase the size of the Fat Body in the winter, as a mechanism to enhance survival. Other insects (like house flies) don't seem to be able to store extra fat. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure whether you're still interested in yet another person telling you, but here I go:</p>
<p>Insects have an organ called the fat body, which is located on the ventral side of the abdomen. This is a kind of functional equivalent of the liver and is also used (as the name suggests) to store fat as an energy reserve.</p>
<p>In our experiments, we could always very clearly see the difference between fat bodies of starved vs non-starved locusts.</p>
<p>Fat isn't only stored in the fat body though. While that's the main site of storage, you can also see fat in all body cavities.</p>
<p>The reason why an insect doesn't get literally fat is because they are often filled with air sacs, filling the body cavities. When the organs grow (because of fat storage, production of eggs,...), these air sacs simply deflate and become smaller.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a large difference between insects, and logically also a large difference in the time you can starve an insect. Our locusts could easily make it two weeks without any food. Several of them would make it over a month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>All arthropods have areas of membrane between their sclerites (the panels of exoskeleton) and when they have so much fat body (insects equivalent to our fat storage, it also does other things) that their sclerites aren't anywhere near touching anymore and their semens of membrane are stretched thin... they are fat.

<p>However, the momentum of the light is very small in comparison to the mass of the flashlight.  Sure, a flashlight would propel itself across outer space, it's just a lot slower than other things of that mass.</p>
<p>Solar Sails have to be very, very large and very, very light.  Such things can be built in space.  Then you can make them go with a massive laser on the ground, or a star.  Both of those power sources are much too massive to take with you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have some good explanations of your main question.</p>
<p>I'd like to just make a little note about the wording of your question.</p>
<p>Forces exist only as the interaction between two objects. An object cannot therefore &quot;have&quot; or &quot;carry&quot; force. Inertia and momentum are things we can consider an object to &quot;have&quot; that are sometimes meant when people say &quot;the force of&quot; an object. </p>
<p>I like to keep this straight by always referring to a force as &quot;The force object A exerts on Object B&quot;, so it's really clear which two objects I am saying are pushing or pulling on one another. For example, my weight is a result of the force Earth exerts on my body. A car skidding to a stop is a result of the force the road exerts on the car's tires.</p>
<p>Thinking of it this way can help us not get tricked into thinking a force exists when it does not or confuse force for another thing that might be involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In hot planet with high mass transport, you would get a more uniform distribution of elements.</p>
<p>The reason you see stratification of elements, like gold in California, is because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Earth has cooled to the point where different elements have stratified in the macroscale.  For instance, the plant has a core of hot metal, then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth" target="_blank">series of different spherical layers going outwards until you come to the crust</a>.  Each layer has a different composition related to its relative energy (pressure and heat). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small fluctuations, on a geologic-scale, act to unevenly mix the layers.  For instance, volcanoes allow the mantle to bring material to the crust in localized areas.</p>
</li>
<li>Chemical and physical properties of localized areas of the crust act to concentrate certain compounds.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" target="_blank">For example</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Over time, the crust can be re-dissolved into the mantle, such as at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction" target="_blank">subduction zones along continental plates</a>, which keeps the process of local distribution going indefinitely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The simple answer is fractional crystallization. Many of these elements are highly incompatible. This means that rather than  forming nice crystals, they stay in the melt phase. As a large amount of melt cools, the concentration of incompatibles in the melt phase increases. At the end of fractional crystallization you get left with a small amount of fluid that is highly concentrated incompatible elements. This fluid then goes on to form veins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before there was the Earth, or any of the other planets in our solar system, there was basically a large dust cloud surrounding our star. Over time, that dust coalesced into larger and larger clumps which eventually combined into the planets. Due to gravity, the heavier elements tended toward the center. </p>
<p>As the mass grew the pressure at the center became higher and higher. High pressure equally high temperature and so the center of the mass liquified. Because the cloud that formed the earth was spinning, and because of lots of collisions with other masses, the earth spins at a pretty nice clip. </p>
<p>So the ball of liquid metals and other elements at the center of the earth is a pretty dynamic place with lots of mixing and moving around. If you've ever tried to mix things you know that some mix easily, others won't mix at all, and some combine to form new things. The metals and elements in the earth's crust are no different. </p>
<p>The part of the earth we live on, the crust, appears to us to be pretty solid, but in reality it is fractured into &quot;plates&quot; and quite thin in places. This is why there are volcanos, geysers, hot springs, etc. In many places the crust is simply not strong enough to contain all the heat and energy of the core. So it breaks through and comes out. Sometimes that's dramatic, like a volcanic eruption, but most of the time it's slow and barely noticeable. Along the boundaries of the plates you have places where they are <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/jimbrau/BrauImNew/Chap07/7th/AT_7e_Figure_07_15.jpg" target="_blank">literally spreading apart</a> with material from the core filling in the gap. </p>
<p>The reason what comes out is not an even mixture is that elements and compounds are all different. Some bond easily with other compounds or grow into crystal formations, others do not. Some will dissolve into water at certain temperatures and then leave when it cools down, others won't dissolve at all. Gold, for example, will dissolve into water at very high temperatures. As the water heads towards the surface, it cools and the gold is deposited into veins. </p>
<p>There are also heavy elements that came to earth after the planet was formed. Space is full of rocks including some made of heavy metals. When they smash into the earth they leave those metals more or less at the surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are a couple articles I just found. I was actually researching this a month ago because I was looking until gold and where it comes from. Unfortunately, I'm not finding the exact articles I read at the times.</p>
<p>I know that we thought that gold and other heavy metals (above iron) were formed by supernovas, but recent studies suggest that this isn't the case (the conditions for large amount of heavy metals aren't meant in a supernova). The merger of two neutron stars is actually where the majority of the universe's heavy metals come from. </p>
<p>So, neutron star merger = lots of concentrated heavy metals. Supernovas = small amounts of even distributed heavy metals.</p>

But it may be mainly just one of those  100s that give a distinct flavor. So you would analyze the plant, figure out the chemical structures of what make up that plant. This is done using different methods and is like solving a puzzle without a final picture. You have a bunch of pieces of Information and you try to see what they can make. Once you know what the structures that make up a taste are you can try to make a few. This is done using experience from the past on how to put chemicals together to get a certain result. For example we know if we have an alcohol, and we add oxygen, we often get an aldehyde or keytone, ( a double bonded oxygen instead of a single bonded oxygen). also alot of guess work. Maybe one of the structures you produce sort of tastes like what you want to flavour. Then you can produce that taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you go to the Wiki page you can see which compounds produce which smell.. it says they're also used in food to produce taste. There's probably a separate page for tastes somewhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They only really help if you have a complete absence of some nutrients; you'll get enough to get by if you eat a variety of non-junk foods like most of us do.</em></p>
<p>With a terrible diet, such as if you're a senior citizen that can't cook and eats very small portions or you live off of low-end ramen noodles or something, you're simply missing out on a ton of nutrients, particularly vitamins but also protein and fibre. </p>
<p>Since you're not eating any greens or organ meats at all and stick to inexpensive pre-prepared foods with soft drinks on the side only, you're not going to get any Vitamin A, C or K, for example. The first is important for a lot of stuff like vision and immune system, the second helps keep your blood systems healthy, and the last is critical to avoid a condition known as scurvy (but doesn't actually do much else despite what the marketers tell you). </p>
<p>(Omega-3's are needed in there too, but it's kind of overstated as to how much they help unless you have cardiovascular issues. Bad if you don't eat any fish at all ever, usually okay otherwise if you get a trace of 'em from that Tuna Helper casserole or have anchovies on that pizza.)</p>
<p>And there's lots of similar vitamins that can be missed if you go the other route and stay completely uniformly vegan too.</p>
<p>So if you have a really shitty diet, that once-per-day vitamin pill gives you SOME of those vitamins when otherwise you don't get any at all. That's good and helpful...</p>
<p>...but most people don't need them if they have a mixed salad once in a while or eat &quot;fortified&quot; foods which have them added. In that case, they get arguably limited value out of multivitamins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Way back when, television was an analog signal. More accurately, it was a <em>series</em> of analog signals that your 100%-analog color television could use to produce a picture. You have three signals for color (your TV only looked at one if it was black-and-white) and a &quot;timing&quot; signal that indicated when it should start drawing a new line. The &quot;vertical hold&quot; was a sometimes-manual synchronization to that signal.</p>
<p>&quot;Scrambling&quot; was really just that. Some of the signals were inverted, some of them were switched. But, fundamentally, you couldn't <em>add</em> in junk or actually do significant <em>math</em> to obscure the signal, because televisions simply didn't have the ability to un-do that and produce a working picture for your paying consumer. Likewise, before relatively powerful integrated electronics became available, it wasn't economically feasible to give a customer a powerful computerized set-top box just to watch some television.</p>
<p>So your &quot;encryption&quot; was a scheme with only a few variables. Throw off the synchronization here, swap a color field here, and it would make the picture &quot;off&quot; enough to be unwatchable. But, likewise, once someone figured out your mechanism, they just had to create a relatively simply &quot;decoder&quot; to bring that signal back.</p>
<p>TLDR: Analog encryption wasn't terribly complicated, but it was analog, so it required <em>hardware</em> as opposed to something digital, which might be more complex, but also could be done with a wider variety of hardware. Nowadays, everything is digital (because computing power, even for high-definition video, is so cheap) so analog encryption/decryption isn't a thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Later, with the DirecTV systems, people hacked the plug-in cards that came with the box.  The programming hardware was technically illegal in the US, but was about $80USD from a Canadian company.  A friend was part of a &quot;dark web&quot; hacker group, and every time DirecTV changed the codes, they would be hacked within hours.  Reprogram your card and you had everything.  One thing you had to remember was that your box couldn't be connected to the telephone line, else DirecTV could &quot;call&quot; your box to see what it was doing.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the digital age, things work somewhat differently. </p>
<p>The encryption itself usually isn't broken but some other part of the hardware might have a flaw that lets you access the key data, be it a season interface, an firmware dump or just insecure key distribution. Once you get ahold of a valid key, you can rather easily emulate most common cryptography systems (in the end it's just some protocol plus AES) either in hardware or nowadays more commonly in software. Nagravision2 had such a major flaw that any key change would lock out pirate decryption for a few hours tops. Most paytv networks will weigh the suspected amount of pirate decryption against the tremendous costs of implementing a newer encryption system (usually that requires at least a smartcard change, tough luck if they went cardless and now have to exchange all the boxes). As long as the illegal decryption process is complex enough to deterr the average teenager, requires expensive hardware or at least some sort of fancy setup, they'll let people get away with it. </p>
<p>More recently, cardsharing has been the typical way to go. Essentially, there's one valid and paid subscription in a cardreader connected to some sort of server (cable boxes, RasPis, full blown x86 servers, even internet routers like ddWRT boxes have been successfully used) and they handle the requests from the clients that connect via internet. Depending on the card in question, a dozen individual viewers is fairly easy to handle, using two or three cards can even result in as many viewers as your internet connection can handle (and that's a lot since only a few kbytes are sent and received every couple seconds). </p>
<p>Recently though, providers have been switching to systems that pair the card with a particular box or have gone cardless alltogether - really annoying for people who simply want to use better hardware than the usually crappy provider boxes and do nothing illegal otherwise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If hair is just a structure that gets &quot;extruded&quot; by a hair follicle, then all differences in human hair (at least when it exits the follicle) must be due to mechanical and chemical differences built-in to the hair shaft itself when it gets assembled, right? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what are these differences, and what are their &quot;biomechanical&quot; origins? In other words, what exactly are hair follicles, how do they take molecules and turn them into &quot;hair&quot;, and how does this process differ from hair type to hair type. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if some of that was redundant, but I was trying to ask the same question multiple ways for clarity, since I wasn't sure I was using the correct terms in either case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit 1: I tagged this with the &quot;Biology&quot; flair because I thought it might be an appropriate question for a molecular biologist or similar, but if it would be more appropriately set to the &quot;Human Body&quot; flair, let me know.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Clarified &quot;Edit 1&quot; wording.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a forensic scientist, I can tell you that the reason hair is either wavy/curly/straight has to do with the shape of the hair. Straight hair is round, but wavy/curly hair is oval shaped. The curlier the flatter. Also, you can check out the pigmentation as little nodules within the hair under a microscope. Different amounts of pigmentation cause lighter/darker hair. Also fun fact, you can easily distinguish hair of different animals because it forms differently. For example, cat hair looks kind of like a stack of crowns while deer hair is straight with big ole vacuoles in it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The hair shaft is made up of the cell bodies themselves which are filled with very strong, highly cross-linked proteins.  It's not that a substance is squeezed out like a tube of toothpaste (although that would be really cool!).  Mice have different types of hair with names similar to what you described (e.g. guard, awl, zig-zag). I don't know the precise mechanism causing the different shapes is known (at least when I was writing my thesis). Length is controlled by how long the cells producing the hair remain proliferative (if they stay in the growth phase for longer, you get longer hair.).  The hairs go through a cycle (called the hair cycle) of growth (anagen), regression (catagen, where the follicle regresses) and rest (telogen) phases.  Depending on the relative lengths of these phases of the cycle you can end up for more or less long hair.  </p>
<p>I think a reasonable analogy as well is that the hair is like the top layer of your skin (the white, flaky part) in that it is made up of dead skin cells that are very strongly linked together.  For the hair, they just grow in tube.  Of course, there are different proteins (structural pieces) that are specific to the hair, but the general principle holds.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Has there been any study to the effect of Chemotherapy on hair follicles?   I've heard from a few different people that have gone through it that their hair grew back coarser and curlier.   I'm finding confirmation on <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/in-depth/hair-loss/art-20046920" target="_blank">Mayo's website</a> but they list the effect as temporary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may take several weeks after treatment for your hair to recover and begin growing again. When your hair starts to grow back, it will probably be slightly different from the hair you lost. But the difference is usually temporary. Your new hair might have a different texture or color. It might be curlier than it was before, or it could be gray until the cells that control the pigment in your hair begin functioning again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find lots of studies on the hair loss portion of Chemo, but I'm not having a lot of success on finding studies on the returning hair after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's not a lot of difference. Some manufacturers will add materials that have certain properties, but in real-life use, those properties will be minimal.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Whitening toothpaste contains a higher level of <del>surfactants</del> abrasives, essentially &quot;scrubbing&quot; the surface of the tooth clean. This can damage enamel over time. They may also contain bleaching agents.</p>
<p>&quot;Enamel repair&quot; toothpaste contains calcium-based substances that are reputed to replace the surface layer of enamel. They are essentially a stopgap, and the material that's deposited will be removed pretty swiftly. We cannot replace enamel manually, and the body doesn't produce any more over time.</p>
<p>Cavity protection will be through addition of sodium fluoride, which is proven to help with strengthening of the enamel. So that actually does work, but the vast majority of toothpastes have sodium fluoride in them anyway, so claiming &quot;cavity protection&quot; is redundant.</p>
<p>Put simply, just buy a cheap, fluoride-containing toothpaste, and use it. The physical action of brushing is far, far more important than the type of paste you use.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p><strong>Holy crap</strong>, inbox asplode. Thank you for gold, kind mystery redditor.</p>
<p>All of the above still applies, but I thought it might be useful to add in some information that others have stated below, or that I left out.</p>
<p>So, first off, things that <em>do</em> affect dental hygiene and effectiveness. First and foremost, since it's the single most important thing - brushing technique. The vast majority of people don't have great brushing technique with manual toothbrushes, so it's commonly recommended that everyone uses electric toothbrushes, which do the &quot;hard bit&quot; for you and provide the most comprehensive brushing possible. This technology is gradually evolving over time, but the rule of thumb is to go for one that has three key movements - rotation, in-out vibration, and oscillation. These three things have been proven to effectively clean the tooth surface, and stimulate the gum line, resulting in improved overall oral health.</p>
<p>/u/tcmaresh and /u/unsanitary_napkin made an excellent point - toothpastes that say &quot;9 out of 10 dentists recommend&quot; only say that because dentists recommend that people use toothpaste. That's it. They're not recommending a brand, they're recommending toothpaste in general. Additionally, in order to be approved by the dental association, they have to work, and not do any harm. Those are the only two requirements.</p>
<p>Next - flossing, and interdental brushes. The general consensus is that brushing <em>and</em> flossing is better than either one or the other, but there is a growing body of research that suggests flossing is not as effective as interdental brushes (again, when used in combination with normal brushing). Do some reading up on ID brushes, and give them a try if you want to. But if you're flossing regularly (or not) and your dentist has told you your teeth are in good shape, just stick with what you know.</p>
<p>Now, on to other toothpaste ingredients. As some have stated, brushing <em>without</em> toothpaste actually removes just as much bacteria, food particles and tartar from the surface of the tooth as brushing <em>with</em> toothpaste. However there are some ingredients that prolong the effectiveness of brushing, give fresher breath, assist with gum health, etc etc. So, some examples below.</p>
<p>&quot;Sensitive&quot; toothpastes. This includes Sensodyne. There are some ingredients, particularly Novamin, which do appear to significantly help with tooth sensitivity. These do not aid with overall oral health, but they <em>do</em> help with your teeth not feeling like they're being ripped in twain on a daily basis. Worth using if you suffer from this affliction.</p>
<p>Fluorides. Whilst sodium fluoride is the &quot;standard&quot; substance for fluoride delivery to the enamel, as various people have stated, there are others. These include stannous fluoride, one that's still used in certain brands. All of them have the same mode of action, which is to deliver fluoride to the surface of the tooth. Some make it more &quot;available&quot; than others, but the difference appears to be fairly minimal. Stannous fluoride can give some people problems, including tissue sloughing (bits of skin coming off the inside of your mouth), gum whitening, and tooth staining. Ultimately though it doesn't really matter what type you use, as long as you use it. Note that all OTC main brand toothpastes will typically contain the same amount of fluoride. Prescription toothpastes are different, and contain more.</p>
<p>Antiseptic agents - this includes Chlorhexidine and Triclosan. These remove bacteria from the mouth, and can assist with gum health and cavity prevention; they also hang around in the area, preventing bacteria from returning. Antiseptic agents can be beneficial, but some studies have suggested that we need to maintain the &quot;good&quot; bacteria in our mouths, which assist with prevention of halitosis and tartar buildup. So approach with caution, but they are generally good to use (this includes mouthwash).</p>
<p>Enamel repair. This has come up a lot. There are some substances which appear to promote remineralisation of enamel. However, having done some reading up of my own, this effect is minimal, and occurs over a long, long period of time. It may still be beneficial for some, but consuming acidic foods or drink will quickly reverse the process, so diet control is needed alongside use of these substances. As per my original response, just brush your teeth. If you want to include enamel repair toothpaste (at a significant price), feel free. But it's not essential.</p>
<p>Xylitol. This is a sugar substitute that is included in a lot of chewing gum, and some toothpastes. Its key benefit is that it cannot be digested by bacteria, so it offers an excellent sweetening alternative. Some studies have shown that xylitol can remineralise enamel; but these studies have been done using 20% xylitol solutions at 37^o C, over two weeks (with constant application), which isn't really relative to the real world. But yes, it has its benefits. It's in a decent number of toothpastes already, so feel free to use if you want.</p>
<p>Foaming agents. The most common foaming agent in toothpaste is Sodium Laureth/Lauryl Sulphate, the same stuff that is used to make liquid soap foam up. It's an irritant, and can cause problems in people with sensitivity to it, including ulcers (canker sores), lesions and general irritation. If you are susceptible, find a toothpaste that doesn't contain it. The amount of foam a toothpaste produces does not relate to its cleaning ability.</p>
<p>Baking soda! This stuff is present in Arm and Hammer and some off-brand products - it's basically an abrasive, and aids with whitening of teeth. The same caution applies as with all other whitening agents - it damages enamel. So approach with caution. Baking soda also neutralises acid in the mouth, but that effect will be negated as soon as you consume anything acidic. So very much a temporary solution.</p>
<p>/u/FranDankly very kindly <a href="https://www.lincolndentalcenter.com/relative-dentin-abrasivity-rda" target="_blank">provided a link</a> which covers the abrasiveness of various well known brands - it may prove useful for some. Note that abrasion is still beneficial in most cases, but excessive abrasion ain't good. Worth noting that most whitening toothpastes are on the higher end of the scale!</p>
<p>I think that's about it for now... but regardless of all the added info above, the action of brushing is <em>still</em> far more important than anything else (whether or not you combine with flossing). Brush dem teefs!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My daughter JUST did a report on toothpaste for school so this info is fresh in my head.  :-)</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Generally speaking there are no differences that make any one toothpaste better than any other toothpaste <em>at the job of being toothpaste</em>. All of them (or, funnily enough, none of them) will get your teeth equally clean, and any ancillary benefits that a toothpaste may claim have no effect on their ability to be toothpaste.</p>
<p>Full explanation: Toothpaste is considered a <strong>parity product</strong>. A parity product is any product that's functionally equivalent to any other competing product that may be offered by a competitor. Products like nails, peanut butter, gasoline, and soap are parity products because they are all functionally identical to products offered by competing companies.</p>
<p>Any differences in parity products are largely superficial, perceived, or add no <em>measurable</em> or <em>functional</em> benefit to the product. For example, some oil companies will tout how their pumps are equipped with special filters to make sure the gasoline coming out is more pure, or how they've got special additives to help engines run cleaner and more efficiently. The veracity of these claims are supported by the use of wiggle words like &quot;more&quot; or &quot;help&quot;, but fundamentally the gasoline from any given oil company is 100% identical to gasoline from any other oil company. Any difference in price between two competing gas stations has to do mainly with the effectiveness of their advertising. Lots of people would consider paying a bit more for gasoline from Dinoco than they would from MomsNPopsGas if they <em>thought</em> that Dinoco gas was better.</p>
<p>In specific regards to toothpaste, there are generally four ingredients in virtually all toothpastes: water, abrasives, sulfactants, and fluoride. Individual products are differentiated by colors, flavors, task-specific additives that aren't strictly necessary for the task of <em>toothpaste</em> (e.g., hydrogen peroxide as a whitening agent, or potassium nitrate as a desensitizer), and of course packaging (striped toothpastes are popular). It's these non-purposed variations that give rise to the ten thousand different tubes of toothpaste in your supermarket.</p>
<p>Fun Fact: In the world of parity products, any competing product can legally call itself &quot;the best&quot; in its genre for the purposed task. Toothpaste's job is to help keep teeth clean (Another Fun Fact: brushing with or without toothpaste has no bearing on the amount of plaque removed from teeth) so if they all have the same <em>functional</em> ingredients then there can't be any one product that's better than any other; ergo, all products are &quot;the best&quot; at being toothpaste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So all the top level answers are awesome and perfect but I do want to add an explanation about monofluorophosphate, sodium fluoride, and stannous fluoride.</p>
<p>The three substances listed are all fluoride ions but they are different. Stannous fluoride in particular is famous for its odd BUT benign side effect of staining the gums white temporarily. In some clinical studies, stannous fluoride was show to be slightly more effective than monofluorophosphate or sodium fluoride. However, the difference is largely negligible.</p>
<p>Basically as others have pointed out, as long as fluoride is present, toothpastes are more or less the same. Sulfate ingredients will make toothpaste extra foamy and baking soda or hydrogen peroxide will aid in removing surface stains. And of course sensodyne is perfect for those with sensitivity issues. </p>
<p>Tl;dr there are slight negligible differences between stannous fluoride, monofluorophosphate, and sodium fluoride.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It turns brown because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelization" target="_blank">caramelization</a>.</p>
<p>Now, caramelization in itself is a poorly understood process, but we know a few things about it. It is, simply put, the degradation of sugars under heat. Now, these sugars break up into simpler sugars, dehydrate, fragment into aldehydes and ketones, polymerise and undergo several other reactions. Don't concern yourself with the details of the reactions unless you want to - just understand that there are many reactions simultaneously occuring at that temperature.</p>
<p>For the compounds we are interested in, we can broadly separate them into two categories - volatile compounds and polymers. (It's a lot more complex than this but these are the two important classes).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Volatile compounds like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacetyl" target="_blank">diacetyl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxymethylfurfural" target="_blank">Hydroxymethylfurfural</a> etc. are released which gives caramel its characteristic smell/flavour.</p>
</li>
<li>The polymers (30+ carbon atoms/molecule) formed are grouped into three classes: Caramelans, Caramelens and Caramelins. They contribute to the brown colour of caramel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearing out some misconceptions</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Caramelization is not the same as the Maillard reaction (browning of bread, meat etc). <em>The Maillard reaction requires amino acids to react with sugars, whereas caramelization does not</em> (it is simply the degradation of sugars with heat). They both involve browning and can occur simultaneously, on the same food base, and with similar results on the taste buds, so they are quite easily confused.</p>
</li>
<li>It is not brown because of carbon. That sort of burning requires a much higher temperature than the caramelization reaction. If you try to caramelize on too high a flame, you will see it turning black and tasting charred. That is carbon (see pyrolysis/carbonization for such reactions).</li>

<p>Think of sugar like a pyramid of Lego bricks, you start heating them up in a frying pan and start by breaking them into single bricks, this is your melted sugar. As you keep heating, your going to start melting some of your bricks that are touching the frying pan. Clearly these melted Lego bricks aren't going fit back together, maybe you can get a few together but you can't stack them like you could before and some of them might start melting together, these are your browning products and flavors in your sugar (caramelisation). If you keep heating your eventually going to burn your Lego, turning it black (pyrolysis).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
