		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specifically how is likely a state secret, as it's bad policy to show exactly how your security works. However, there are presumptions that can be made.  </p>
<p>Faraday cages and other high-science interference techniques can prevent all but particular frequencies working, and someone can listen for activity on those frequencies.  If someone's sending data from the Oval, they can check to see if Trump is on his phone or not to deduce if there's a rogue sender in the room. </p>
<p>If we assume all data via the White House wifi and cell signals is being heavily tracked and monitored, that means getting any recording data out has to be done via physical means like a spy pen with a Micro SD card. Logically, that means someone of with motive to record has to have access to plant the device, and access again to pick it up.  All without looking suspicious, all while secret service and people who are genuinely good at their jobs are watching you the entire time.  </p>
<p>Further complicating this are the extremely professional and experienced White House maid staff that clean the most presidential bits you're probably wanting to record each day. They reset the rooms, dust everything, and make sure each item is in pristine condition.  It's easy to presume that they know what each item looks and feels like and are trained enough to spot a new listening device or hole in the couch.  I am willing to bet nothing stays in the Oval's couch cushions for very long so good luck getting your spy pen back.  </p>
<p>I'm not saying it's impossible, but to successfully record the president, and extract the information in a timely enough manner to actually use it is really tough.  Especially when the risks far outweigh the rewards.  </p>
<p>Sure you may get some blackmail, or good intel, but if it comes out that Sweden's housewarming gift to Trump of Ikea's latest soap holder was secretly a recording device sending out presidential nudes, that's cause for war and dissolution of several treaties.  Better to just tweet him publicly or submit an official request to the state department and see what happens.   </p>
<p>The real people you want to bug are those feeding the President information.  They know everything before he does, and getting a heads up that Trump is about to find out you are the leak allows you to get ahead of the issue and skip town or spin the narrative before that report hits his twitter feed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Little anecdote (or: cool story, bro!):</p>
<p>in summer/fall of 1989 I worked as a messenger at the U.N. to help pay for my college expenses. At the beginning of the General Assembly, President George H.W. Bush came to deliver a speech as every American president has done since the U.N. was first formed.  There were snipers and spotters on top of every building in the neighborhood.  </p>
<p>I went out at lunchtime to grab a slice of pizza to bring back with me.  As I was walking back, just as i got to the driveway, two US Secret Service guys approached and asked me to follow them.  I followed, downstairs, through the garage, and into the staircase that everyone in the place knows is a bomb &quot;tube&quot;.  Basically it is a vertical tube, solid reinforced concrete, that stretches the entire height of the Secretariat building, opened on top, and the staircase going around its perimeter.  Anything explodes in there, and the shockwave will go straight up into the air, not affecting the rest of the building.</p>
<p>Anyway, once there, they asked to see what I was carrying.  I showed them the pizza, made a joke about how they may be overreacting about how bad the stuff is for my health, and they weren't even close to laughing.  They told me an unusual amount of metal was detected on my person, and asked, always politely, if I was carrying anything they should know about.  I was recovering from a serious accident, and had big, medieval-looking steel braces on both knees.  Looked like something out of a torture museum, or S&amp;M catalogue.  I told them, and without hesitation, dropped my pants for them to see it.  They apologized for the inconvenience, thanked me for my understanding, and let me go.</p>
<p>I had not gone through any metal detectors, or even indoors in any way.  27 years ago they had the means to detect an unusual amount of metal on a person walking outdoors in a city where one is never far from a whole lot of metal.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly through physical screening and controlling access, is the short answer. Regarding the Oval Office specifically, you have to be invited in by POTUS, though each has a list of exceptions (but these are his most trusted aides). Even during tours, the Oval is specifically roped off. </p>
<p>What's important though is that the Oval isn't intended for discussing highly classified information. Of course, sensitive political information is discussed there all the time, but you could, if you were invited, bring your phone into the Oval without a blink from anyone. Yes, they likely sweep it regularly when POTUS isn't using it, as a good hygiene practice, but it's not the most sensitive space.</p>
<p>That's not true with Situation Room, however, which is a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility). The Sit Room likely has a host of countermeasures in place, many of which are listed in other explanations. You're not allowed to bring your phone in to a SCIF as well, and again, access is very tightly controlled.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Tightly controlled access and occasional screening; but more importantly, good OPSEC practices mean the most sensitive info isn't being discussed in the Oval, but rather the Sit Room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Journalists don't really get to go into the Oval Office on any kind of regular basis. Certainly not as part of their regular functions as members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Correspondents%27_Association" target="_blank">White House Correspondents' Association</a>, which subjects them to an extensive credentialing process before recommending them to the White House Press Secretary for admittance to regular briefings. So while journalists may, from time to time, make it into the Oval Office, they'd most likely be there with a standing similar to any other visitor.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Everyone</em> that goes into the White House is subjected to a rigorous security screening. Once inside, non-employees are not permitted to just wander around unsupervised. Anti-surveillance sweeps aside, it's exceptionally unlikely that anyone would be able to get a bug into the White House, and even less likely that they'd have an opportunity to effectively plant it anywhere as sensitive as the Oval Office. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there.</p>
<p>The biological processes of bone healing are the same in both horses and humans. The problem is in their weight and behavior. And it depends on the location of the fracture whether or not the horse may need to be euthanized.</p>
<p>When humans break bones, they can take weight off by sitting down, using crutches, etc. Horses don't have this option. If they take the weight off of the leg by themselves by favoring the leg, especially if they are young, the other limb may become deformed due to the increased burden. Even if they do lie down, the act of standing back up can cause the fracture to break again. Smaller horses may heal from fractures better, and a few cases may do well with amputation, but these cases are few and far between.</p>
<p>Even if the leg is stabilized, it takes a very long time to heal. During this long time of inflammation, the horse may develop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminitis" target="_blank">laminitis</a>, which causes, in a word, the hooves to fall off. This is similar to having your fingernails pulled off, and for an animal that relies on supporting all of its weight on its &quot;fingernails&quot; this is incredibly painful and debilitating. (This is actually what happened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbaro" target="_blank">Barbaro</a>). Here is a look at <a href="http://www.two-views.com/celebrity/barbaro-leg-xray.html#sthash.uUMadT8t.dpbs" target="_blank">Barbaro's radiographs</a> and how they attempted to stabilize his distal limb.</p>
<p>Also, practically, many horses have jobs (racers like thoroughbreds/standardbreds, work-horses like draft horses, etc), and their lives are sometimes seen as an investment. If the owner cannot afford to keep them on pasture, if it isn't a financially viable option, they may elect to euthanize.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And another point: horse physiology is designed so that blood flow to the foot and leg is partially accomplished through pressure to an area on the sole of the foot called the frog. When horses don't move regularly and put pressure on this surface, it can damage circulation in the hoof wall and cause reduced circulation in the entire injured leg.</p>
<p>What's more, the additional weight on the non- injured feet frequently causes a condition in the weight-bearing feet called laminitis, where circulation is damaged and the hoof wall begins to detach. This is a condition that is frequently the cause of permanent and severe lameness and often requires the horse to be put down. </p>
<p>So ultimately it is not the broken leg that is the problem, but the cascade of other problems that results in the horse being euthanized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You can mend the broken leg, but it is very costly to do so and has no guarantees that it will work.  The horse has to be kept stabled and supported in a sling (horses cannot lay down for days on end or they wont digest food).  Some horses simply cannot tolerate this (horse moves too much) and as such people don't put in the expense of the surgery knowing that it may not work.</p>
<p>There have been a few horses fitted with prosthetic limbs though - but mostly as an experiment to see if it will work.</p>
<p>Many horses are &quot;pets&quot; and the owners don't have the money for this knowing that the horse wont be of use to them for a very long time - and a racehorse will have its racing (money earning) carrier ended after a leg break.</p>
<p>The main thing is trying to keep a horse in a resting position to allow for healing is VERY tough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a high risk of infection, and the horse may not sit still long enough for the bone to heal.  Infections are most likely when the animal suffers a compound fracture, in which the bones tear through the skin of the leg.  In this case, dirt from the track will grind into and contaminate the wound. </p>
<p>To make matters worse, there isn't much blood circulation in the lower part of a horse's leg. (There's very little muscle, either.)
A nasty break below the knee could easily destroy these fragile vessels and deprive the animal of its full immune response at the site of the injury. </p>
<p>It's not easy to treat a horse with antibiotics, either.  Since the animals are so big, you have to pump in lots of drugs to get the necessary effect. But if you use too many antibiotics, you'll destroy the natural flora of its intestinal tract, which can lead to life-threatening, infectious diarrhea.  You also have to worry about how the antibiotics will interact with large doses of painkillers, which can themselves cause ulcers.</p>
<p>If the horse manages to avoid early infection, he might not make it through the recovery.  First, he must wake up from anesthesia without reinjuring himself. Not all horses are willing to sit around in a sling, and the antsy ones can thrash about and break their limbs all over again. </p>
<p>A horse after surgery would face other obstacles:  Potential to develop laminitis in the opposite hind foot;  chance of infection;
possibility of impaction colic from physical and mental stress;
reinjury because of the tendency of an ultra-fit horse to be too active while confined; and unsatisfactory healing.  If he starts favoring his wounded leg post-surgery, he may overload his other legs, causing a condition known as laminitis  If that happens, the hooves on the other legs will start to separate from the bone, and his weight will be driven into the soft flesh of the feet. He may also develop life-threatening constipation as a side effect of the anesthetic.</p>
<p>Laminitis explained further: When a horse places weight on a foot, it registers a negative blood flow, actually forcing blood away from the coffin bone and through the back of the foot through tiny blood vessels called microvasculature. A horse with an orthopedic injury that spends too much time standing on the opposite leg causes the blood flow to diminish in that foot, which can lead to laminitis. Doctors will often put down a horse that develops a nasty infection, reinjures its broken leg, or develops laminitis in its other hooves.
A horse that's unable to stand will develop nasty sores and can be expected to die a slow and painful death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because messaging used to be a secondary product. The primary Facebook usage used to be the status updates, commenting and the stuff. People were active Facebook users who went to a website, entered their passwords and logged in, played games - and then, used the messaging function at the bottom right. The rise of IM services like WhatsApp made people realize that it was far easier to just message without jumping through all those hoops. Not to mention, Facebook isn't as exciting or popular as it was 5 years ago. It isn't an organic network of friends like it said on the cover. It is mostly an RSS feed of your favorite bands and shows and people. People don't post anymore. Nobody is going to all that trouble of logging into the entire Facebook (both the website and the app) just for messaging which is just text. </p>
<p>The competition started including additional features like stickers, calls which was not possible to include inside the Facebook app. So they made the smart choice of making it a seperate app that allows them to use it as a distinct developement platform for making bots, turning into a money transfer service, and a formidable communications app in itself. One tap and you cut directly to the chats. No noise like status updates and comments here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The real answer is that we have no idea. Some people will say that it has to do with pressure changes in the atmosphere and how that effects scar tissue or healing fractures. However, this doesn't pan out when you actually try to look at it. Not everyone gets this sort of pain, and even people who do get this pain don't always get it with pressure changes. Such as airplanes, traveling to the mountains, etc. It's completely unpredictable. However, it is totally a thing. It is absolutely a real phenomenon that people experience. We just have absolutely no idea as to exactly why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

During development in the womb, the pieces get shuffled around a little bit but cannot create new nervous tissue (the neural crest cells have already migrated so unlike blood vessels which can be made throughout life to some extent the nerves are pretty fixed {this is also the reason that vascular anomalies are common in people but nervous ones are not} ). All this to say that sticking stuff in your ear will give your throat a scratchy feeling.
Here's a YouTube of the early development (long but it explains it well)

<p>When it comes down to it, freezing anything with water in it (which is technically everything that needs to be frozen) changes the nature of the cells. Specifically, water <em>expands</em> when frozen - this shouldn't be a surprise to most people, but what <em>should</em> surprise most people is that things generally <em>shrink</em> when frozen <strong>not</strong> expand. Water is different, and it's some of these qualities that make water so important to life.</p>
<p>Pack to the ELI5, since there's water in the cells of meat, freezing the meat tends to destroy the cells - either by rupturing them or by pulling the water <em>out</em> of the cell -dessicating it. It's one of the (several) reasons that cryogenically preserving people doesn't work - imagine that happening to your BRAIN CELLS!</p>
<p>Even if only a few cells out of a bunch get destroyed, it changes the taste. And if air can reach the meat at the same time it'll dehydrate it quicker and cause more of a change to the flavor - check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezer_burn" target="_blank">freezer burn</a> for some more info.</p>
<p>edit - really cool freezing fact: some animals can survive deep cold by partially freezing. In the case of the <a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/21/how-the-alaska-wood-frog-survives-being-frozen/" target="_blank">wood frogs</a> they use aptly named &quot;cryoprotectants&quot; to <em>lower</em> the freezing point of the cells in the body, reducing the formation of ice etc.etc. They also slow/suspend many bodily functions so that they don't need ...well... anything. Cool stuff!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When thawed, the contents of cell walls leak out, leaving a shell and a mess on the floor.  Macroscopically, this leads to mushiness.  Taste, which is the contents of the cells, is greatly leaked out.</p>

I know this, because I worked in a grocery store in high school that also makes the &quot;never frozen&quot; claim. You don't have to call something 'frozen' as long as it's never stored below 0 degrees F. However, at what temp does water freeze? 32F. So as long as you store the meat/whatever low enough to actually freeze but not go below 0 you can make the &quot;fresh, never frozen&quot; claim.</p>

<p>For someone who has been driving a lot, most of what you are doing is basic motor functions; scan the road, move the steering wheel left/right to keep inside the line, follow the speed of the car in front of you.

<p>Sometimes when we perform a routine behavior our brain decides it doesn't need to commit the events to long term memory. </p>
<p>It's a fairly infrequent phenomenon but can be startling when you pull up to your driveway and suddenly realize you do not have any memory of getting home. You weren't necessarily zoned out, you probably reacted appropriately to traffic, it's just your brain decided to stop recording for a few minutes </p>
<p>Similar to getting black out drunk... It's not a failure to recall memories, it's that the memories were never recorded in the first place </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;The researchers suspect this apparent paradox is likely a function performed by a specific part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC.</p>
<p>Pavlidis says that the ACC is compensating for our distractions, and it automatically kicks in when the need arises. In the case of driving, the ACC counterbalances a strong jitter to the left with an instant and equally strong jitter to the right, and vice versa. The ACC works to offset all this veering, resulting in exceptionally straight driving. Remarkably, we’re largely unaware that this is even happening.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

With how we currently probe high energy regimes, there is a fundamental limit to the energies we can obtain from collisions, related to accelerator designs (including size). But it is, pedantically, a technological limitation, because the science doesn't say &quot;the only way to test string theory is to use your current understanding of accelerator physics to build a very large accelerator,&quot; rather it says &quot;if you want to avoid building a very large accelerator, you need a breakthrough in how you probe very high energy regimes.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a &quot;technical&quot; limitation in the sense that there's no reason why we couldn't build one that big. </p>
<p>But, although this is an often-made claim, it's really a quite misleading one. It's based on the idea that there's a certain &quot;characteristic&quot; energy scale associated with string theory, and in order to <em>directly</em> test string theory, we need to create particles of this energy, which requires a ridiculously large particle accelerator. These claims are true, but they are not the whole story.</p>
<p>Think about it like this. Suppose you have a ruler. Let's say this ruler is only accurate to 1mm. That is, you can't use it to measure distances smaller than 1mm. Any measurement that falls between two different mm marks, you round to the closest mark. </p>
<p>With this ruler, you can never measure something smaller than 1mm. Even if you try to do something clever, like make a lot of measurements and average them together to get a really accurate measurement, it won't work, because you always rounded to the closest 1mm mark.</p>
<p>This means that, with this ruler, you can never <em>directly</em> measure distances smaller than 1mm. This does not mean, however, that you can not use the ruler to <em>indirectly</em> measure distances smaller than 1mm.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you have a microscope that magnifies an image by a factor of 1000. You could then pick something that's smaller than 1mm, magnify it by 1000 using the microscope, measure the magnified image, and then divide that length by 1000. This allows the ruler to indirectly measure distances much smaller than it can directly measure.</p>
<p>There are lots of other ways you can come up with to use this ruler to indirectly measure very small distances.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are lots of indirect predictions of string theory that do not require enormous particle accelerators. In fact, there are so many of these predictions, and they are so structured, that pretty much all string theorists at this point are convinced in its correctness. (Mostly, the problem is in getting the theory to make predictions of the specific quantities you'd like to study, which is hard because the theory is complicated.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, something I actually have a response for! Someone with 6 years of Jesuit schooling here, and I actually posed this exact question in a Theology class:
The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The concept of marriage in its most basic sense is that you are wedding this person to help them live a better life as their partner. However, since the purpose of heaven is to be infinitely close to God, any bonds or attachments to people you have on Earth are basically null. Your husband/wife would be someone you view fondly and had a close relationship with, but they would no longer be your wife/husband.</p>
<p>I don't really agree with all this, but I'm not going to insert personal opinion here. Hope this explanation helps!</p>
<p>Edit: removed the part saying &quot;The reason for this is explained as 'it would be a distraction from why you're there.'&quot;</p>
<p>/u/_Silly<em>Wizard</em> offered a better explanation, saying that instead of remembering people fondly, it's more akin to everyone is married in the sense that there is perfect unity with God.</p>
<p>Edit 2: figured it would be more credible if I actually included some sources. Here's a passage from the Catechism on the issue:</p>
<p>1618 Christ is the center of all Christian life. The bond with him takes precedence over all other bonds, familial or social.113 From the very beginning of the Church there have been men and women who have renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he goes, to be intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to please him, and to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is coming.114 Christ himself has invited certain persons to follow him in this way of life, of which he remains the model:</p>
<p>&quot;For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.&quot;115</p>
<p>Edit 3: To all the atheists arguing in the comment string below, keep in mind that just because someone is speaking on religious doctrine, it doesn't mean they're trying to 'biblethump' or 'spew nonsense'. Regardless of God's existence, you CANNOT dismiss that faith is historically integrated into culture, and the texts still provide profound lenses through which you can view the world. Stop acting like bloody conspiracy theorists and saying that everyone involved in the church is colluding to create some massive smokescreen. Religion has been around for tens of thousands of years--basically since humans started keeping a written language. And you think that you're some intellectual crusader who's saying &quot;Gods not real bro.&quot; for the first time? Congratulations! There's no God! Now good luck wishing away the millennia of texts, scriptures, parables, and doctrines that he created.</p>
<p>Real? That will always be debated.
Impactful and crucial to understanding western civilization? Abso-fuckin'-lutely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far, everyone has given a religious reason from a passage of Scripture about Jesus's comments on the afterlife (an answer to a trick question he was asked by some Sadducees, members of a Jewish sect that didn't believe in an afterlife).</p>
<p>But that's not the real reason for the wording of the marriage vows. It has to do with the fact that you are free to remarry if your spouse dies.</p>
<p>The exact wording of the vow varies according to the denomination, but here's one version used by the United Methodist Church (in the form of a question from the pastor to the couple):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you have this woman/man to be your wife/husband, to live together in holy marriage? Will you love her/him, comfort her/him, honor, and keep her/him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, be faithful to her/him as long as you both shall live?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from the context, it's all about living together with your spouse and being faithful to them; but obviously, that only applies if you're both still alive. If you die, your spouse can hardly &quot;comfort&quot; you, or &quot;keep&quot; you &quot;in sickness and in health&quot; -- how would that even work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, in the Bible there was a similar question posed to Jesus himself. Some of the religious leaders of the Jewish community at the time asked Jesus if a woman had 7 husbands that all died before she did, who would be her husband in heaven. Jesus' response (boiled down) was that we would be &quot;like the angels.&quot; Though there is debate as to what that actually means, the implication is that we would have no relationships like that in heaven and that we would only he interested in our worship of God. The passage is Luke 20: 27-40 if you're interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised (unless I missed it) no one pointed out the purely pragmatic reason for &quot;'til death do us part&quot;: until recently, death at young age was common, so the vows needed to clarify that the surviving spouse can remarry, have kids with a new spouse, etc. So a more precise if inelegant vow would thus be &quot;'til the death of one of us parts us, at which point the survivor may remarry.&quot;</p>
<p>Point being, the clause isn't a theological one about &quot;when you die, you're no longer married&quot; but rather a pragmatic one about &quot;when one of you dies, the other may remarry.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we believe that marriages performed in the temple do transcend this life. This is made possible by the sealing keys. For example, when Jesus gave these keys to the apostles he said &quot;whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot; (Matt 18:18 KJV) </p>
<p>In lieu of the words &quot;Til death us do part&quot; we opt for the phrase &quot;For time and all eternity&quot; in Temple marriages. </p>
<p>That being said, many Christian religions do not believe in marriage after this life because of Matt 22:23-30. In these verses the Sadducees (who don't believe in the resurrection) are trying to bait Jesus by asking him a question about a woman who has been married 7 times, to 7 brothers . They ask which of the brothers shall be her husband in the afterlife, to which Jesus responds, &quot;Ye do err... for in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>He is not directly answering their question, but explains that they do not understand the question themselves (Matt 22:29-33). Still many people get caught up on the line about not being given in marriage during the resurrection. So it really comes down to this: did Jesus mean what he said literally and does it apply to all marriages? Or did he give an oversimplified answer to men who were not ready or willing to listen? This is still being debated by many Christian scholars. </p>
<p>Edit1: grammar </p>
<p>Edit2: Matt 16:19 is the verse where Jesus gives the keys specifically to the apostle John. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
