		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not in most medical situations.</p>
<p>X-rays behave roughly the same as normal light, but have a much higher energy. This means they go through objects easier, which is how we're able to use them to look at bones and other things. This is obviously handy for medicine and engineering, but not very useful for taking photographs with them.</p>
<p>There are ways of steering and focusing x-rays, that usually work with a complex array of mirrors as it's easier to reflect the x-rays than change their direction using normal lens effects. This is both complex and expensive though, and is usually only used for very specific applications. As always, more info on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>To get around this problem, most people use a very large sensor, or piece of film, and place it directly behind whatever they want to look at. If the x-rays come through straight enough, you can get a sharp enough image to be useful.</p>
<p>So to answer the original question, yes, x-rays can have a depth of field, but only if you're working with focusing x-ray optics systems, which most people don't.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, there is no lens used to create an x-ray image, so there are no depth of field problems. Ideally the part of the body that you are imaging is placed directly on the imaging detector, and then you get an accurate image caused by an attenuation pattern. There are a whole bunch of other exposure issues, but these are related to other issues such as the amount of radiation used, and the energy of the x-ray photons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of misconceptions in many of the answers here. X-rays are just light. They are electromagnetic waves. The same equations dictate how light works at all wavelengths and energies. People just don't seem to know much about cutting edge x-ray imaging.</p>
<p>Medical x-rays project from a small source, through your body, onto a detector. That's called &quot;point projection.&quot; There is blurring but it's not a &quot;depth of field.&quot; Blurring in point projection comes from the source not being a point, and from the subject not standing still, and from diffraction of x-ray light through the subject.</p>
<p>Beyond medical x-rays, scientists have <em>numerous</em> ways of controlling x-ray light. At synchrotron and free-electron lasers, the source is incredibly bright, and incredibly small. They can even generate coherent light, like a laser. X-rays have diffraction, interference, attenuation, just like any light.</p>
<p>The most common x-ray lenses are <strong>curved, glancing-incidence mirrors.</strong> They work by a phenomena called &quot;total internal reflection.&quot; Think about visible-light and water (or window glass). At normal incidence, water (glass) is mostly transparent. But at glancing incidence (like when you're at the beach or on a boat) light at low angles is strongly reflected. The same thing happens with x-rays. At normal incidence, reflection is weak. At glancing incidence (think 1 or 2 degrees, or smaller), the reflection can be strong, <em>if the surface is exceptionally smooth</em>. So if you put a smooth curved mirror into an x-ray beam, you can steer the light to a focus. A two dimensional version is a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror pair: one for horizontal and one for vertical, often displaced along the beam.</p>
<p>Another way to focus x-rays is with <strong>refraction.</strong> This typically works at high energies only. The index of refraction is slightly less than 1 for x-rays, so refractive lenses have a shape that's <em>the opposite</em> of regular lenses. Think of an empty space in a material that the x-rays can penetrate. So take a block of Beryllium, or Aluminum, drill some holes in it, and the x-rays will bend and focus.</p>
<p>Another way is to use what are referred to as <strong>Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP) lenses.</strong> They are typically alternating rings of light and dark (i.e. binary) or alternating phase-shifting material. They work by diffraction. So if you know how a diffraction grating works, imagine making one that's circular or cylindrical. Tune the line density so that all the rays focus to one point. FZPs are essentially holograms of a simple, single lens. Because of the short wavelengths involved, FZPs are typically small. There are big ones beyond 1 cm, but most used for high quality imaging are well under 1 mm.</p>
<p>Another kind of x-ray lens is called a <strong>multilayer laue lens</strong> (MLL). It's similar to a zoneplate, but made in a different way that allows the zones to be smaller.</p>
<p>All of these are ways to focus x-ray light: reflection, refraction, diffraction. They all have a wavelength, numerical aperture, a focal length, and a <em>depth of focus</em>. The diffractive ones are miraculously good, but suffer from chromatic aberrations, meaning that the properties change with wavelength.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are different energy ranges called x-rays. Medical x-rays are called <em>hard x-rays.</em> At lower energies there are <em>tender x-rays</em>, and below that <em>soft x-rays</em>, then <em>extreme ultraviolet</em> and <em>vacuum ultraviolet</em> before coming to the parts you're more familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>Why do scientists care about x-rays?</strong> Good question. Soft x-rays are amazingly good probes of matter. Every element, and every chemical has a signature in the absorption spectrum that allows us to identify very minute amounts of materials, and to see how they are bound to their neighbors. With circularly polarized x-rays you can study magnetism. With their short wavelengths, you can take x-ray images and resolve features down to about the size of chromosomes, around 10 nm. You can label biological samples and probe them at that length scale. You can make non-destructive measurements of things like soil samples, batteries, and comet pieces captured in space. Another killer app for x-rays is protein crystallography. The wavelength is close to the spacing between atoms. So you can take a small amount of something like a new drug or a protein in the body, and with diffraction and reconstruction, you can see precisely how the atoms are arranged, structurally. You can see how proteins fold and give molecules the properties they have.</p>
<p>TD;DR: X-Rays are awesome. They are also just... light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With typical radiographs, the biggest factor in the &quot;focus&quot; of the image is actually what's known as geometric unsharpness. </p>
<p>The geometric unsharpness is determined by the source size (smaller is sharper), source-to-object distance (farther is sharper) and object-to-film/detector distance (closer is sharper). </p>
<p>It works much the same way as casting shadow puppets on your wall. Moving the flashlight away from the wall and your hand closer will produce a sharper shadow, while moving your hand away or the light closer will cause enlargement and loss of definition of the shadow. </p>
<p>There are other things, like using lead screens, which reduce the number of low-energy photons that interact with the film, which can help produce a sharper image. </p>
<p>Additionally, an improper film development process can ruin what should have been a sharp image. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible to do, there's a few challenges.</p>
<p>First of all, both your wifi and cellular interfaces will have different IP addresses, this means that for any connection that needs to maintain a conversation, it will only be able to do so with one of the two.</p>
<p>Other kinds of connections, like http requests that aren't dependent on the session or state CAN use both interfaces to help speed up downloads etc.  But you might also run into situations where there is an expectation that everything happens over one address, and that could cause technical issues too. </p>
<p>But I think another real issue is expectation and billing.  Most places charge very different for cellular data than residential internet packages.  If you're at home watching youtube videos on your phone and your residential internet slows down, and your cellular data kicks in to keep you watching that stream in full 1080p without you realizing it, you might end up with unexpected data charges. </p>
<p>It's a lot easier conceptually (and technically) to just switch to one network or the other for all data. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE-WLAN_Aggregation" target="_blank">LWA</a> and it's coming. </p>
<p>Basically the Industry has a bunch of challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware - requires a smart, power hungry chip in the device</li>
<li>Software - needs also to be smart and user-agnostic</li>
<li>Licensing - big money in these technologies. Fights ensue (see Everyone vs Qualcomm)</li>
<li>Network - need backend to know what's going on on the device</li>
</ul>
<p>So all these manufacturers (Apple, Samsung) and infrastructure vendors (Ericsson, Huawei), chipset makers (Qualcomm, Intel), and network service providers (AT&amp;T, China Mobile) get together with the standards body (3GPP) and argue for years over what the &quot;customer&quot; needs. Then they publish a standard (e.g. 3GPP Rel. 13) and sanction what everyone ALLOWED to do. </p>
<p>Then 12-18 months later, 1-2 network vendors deploy 1-2 live networks in 1-2 service providers that 1-2 OEMs support. Then there's a waterfall effect that rolls out more broadly, and by that time the next release is out and a new standard is being chased. </p>
<p>TL;DR money+time = everything happens eventually. </p>
<p>Also, for everyone saying &quot;smart network switch&quot; - that's definitely not it. That is a &quot;switching&quot; and it's a marketing deal developed by Samsung &amp; Qualcomm. Simultaneous (50/50) is only possible through Aggregation, and is only a Rel. 12 and Rel. 13 feature (2016 and beyond). Several have pointed out that there are two radios and therefore only one can be active at a time. This is true, but again, only up until 2016 when the Aggregation standards were published to combine the radio frequencies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are two different physical devices, one radio for WiFi signals, another radio for cell signals. They speak in different languages, and would have to decide between themselves which 50% of traffic each will handle. The signals also wouldn't reach the phone simultaneously, so there would be a delay while it builds a buffer. Your phone uses them both, but not simultaneously; it switches back and forth. </p>
<p>It's very hard to ELI5, but imagine you are holding a walkie talkie in one hand, and phone in the other. The person you are talking to speaks German into the walkie talkie, and Italian into the phone. They switch between the phone and walkie talkie while they're speaking, sometimes saying the first half of a word in German into the walkie talkie, and the second half in Italian into the phone, and sometimes you hear the last part of the word before the first part. How hard would it be to actually understand that conversation?</p>
<p>Edit: source: former DevOps engineer for the R&amp;D department of the largest mobile semi-conductor company.</p>
<p>Edit 2: The functionality everyone is saying currently exists is analogous to holding only the walkie talkie or phone, putting one down when picking the other up. OP is asking why we can't hold both up, one to each ear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you are laying down head on the pillow, don't think about life.  This has messed up things for me for years, I never tried to control my thought patterns.  Today I will not let my mind wander and I do this by using a trick.  Think back to a time you took a hike, walked a route to school, were driving a familiar route etc.   Then force your mind to &quot;revisualize&quot; that walk.  For instance, I remember my old bus route when I was a kid. I picture myself lying there, listening to the Diesel engine, looking out the window at the trees etc.  It's made a world of difference for me but takes some getting used to- if you find yourself reverting to life thoughts again, stop and start over.  I'm sure this will get buried, but I just wanted to throw it out there for anyone like me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's a lot of things that can influence this beyond whatever your genetics say about you. </p>
<p>On-the-job conditions in a lot of fields such as in armed forces or emergency room workers can teach you to sleep wherever you can whenever you can.</p>
<p>Your nighttime habits are a big factor - you're gonna be tired for sure if you frequently Reddit until 3AM. </p>
<p>And there's your body's physical stuff like your level of exercise and fitness, and your eating habits and blood sugar levels, that can influence things. A couple quarter-pounders for lunch and by 3PM you can barely keep your eyes open.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I made a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6FPtBKYpto&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video to answer your question.</a> If you don't want to watch the video I'll sum up why I think it's easier to nap than sleep. Or why you have problems sleeping:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Naps can be great, but they can also be the cause of the problem. See if you can cut the naps out, and if you find it easier to fall asleep then that's great!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) may also be the problem. This is a problem with some teens and young adults, but it can persist in later life. This makes it harder to fall asleep, and acutally pushes the time it takes to fall asleep back by 2 hours. This can be problematic as your brain can start to wander.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most peoples day structures around working/studying in the day and then getting home. You are then exhausted from this and fancy taking a nap. However, you spend the rest of the evening relaxing so you're not exactly tired at night! Technically not tired anyway, a good way to combat this is to not have a nap so you're still exhausted or do some excercise!</p>
</li>
<li>It could be diet, if you are eating/drinking sugary items a few hours before bed this could have a negative impact on your ability to fall asleep. This goes with caffeine too, it can impact on your sleep even 6 hours after consuming!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helped, I also hope you enjoyed the <strong>joke</strong> at the end of the video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I work a 6 AM shift and I have never been a morning person. It seems you're either a morning person or a night owl by genetics. Fellow groggy co-workers agree that after 15+ years they are still not 'morning people'. </p>
<p>Companies like 23andMe.com ['found 15 genes that are associated with being a morning person'] (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/do-you-have-the-genetic-profile-of-a-morning-person/" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/do-you-have-the-genetic-profile-of-a-morning-person/</a>) after conducting a survey of nearly 90,000 people. There is even a cool map of <a href="http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Morningness-Map-23andMe-1024x532.png" target="_blank">Proportion of Morning People by State</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with most replies below: It's <strong>also</strong> about sleep hygiene, diet, fitness, etc. One cannot ignore the science as well, especially when as a kid I used to sleep until 1PM on summer break and I felt great!!! Guess I am a night owl.</p>
<p><strong>TIPS on getting more sleep</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get the software (Win/Android) <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank">f.lux</a> which manipulates your monitors color temperature to match the sunrise/set.</li>
<li>Enable <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/23/how-to-set-up-use-night-shift-mode-iphone-ipad-video/" target="_blank">Night Shift</a> on iOS.</li>
<li>Stretch in the morning</li>
<li>If sleeping for less than or equal to 5 hours, eat a big breakfast as soon as you wake up.</li>
<li>Start a sleep prep routine such as: turn off all lights, put phone to charge and leave it there, prep for the morning, brush teeth, floss (underrated skill), sleep (without picking up your phone)</li>
<li>Find a bulb that also shines at a warmer color temperature, I have a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PLR3M0M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">GE Align PM bulb</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the tips will work if you do not make a conscience choice to prepare yourself mentally and physically for a good nights rest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a couple of things I have noticed about myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the afternoon, you have things to do that you possibly don't want to do. It's easier to want to procrastinate this way, including procrastinating by falling asleep. For the longest time, it was hard for me to relax unless I was ignoring my work. When I had no work, I could hardly relax. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may have gotten a not-so-good sleep the previous night, so you are tired during the afternoon. By evening, you've eaten and been moving around so you're energized and feel more awake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light concentration. Daylight seems &quot;duller&quot; to me than having the bright laptop in an otherwise dark room. This concentrated light seems to be more intense and make me want to keep my eyes open longer. I also read something about the blue light from screens messing with your internal sleeping machinery, so that's possible.</p>
</li>
<li>It's cooler at night, which makes me less relaxed than during the day. The warm air and heat makes me sleepy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any or none of these could apply to you, OP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cautionary tale time: I starved myself from the beginning of high school til my mid 30s. To help with the hunger pains, I would take Dexatrim (an appetite suppresant) and drank alcohol. I sometimes took laxatives, to look extra good for special events. My weight was always yo-yoing, it was part of my charm. Until one day, nothing in my closet fit me. No big deal, I thought, I'll just cut down my intake a little more. But I kept gaining weight. A year later, I had gained 130 pounds. I started developing food allergies. I would break out in hives every day, mostly on my face. The mornings were brutal. I would dart to the bathroom, blast the toilet with a fire hose of diarrhea and then flop back on the bed in the fetal position, moaning from the terrible ache in my abdomen. Because my thyroid was struggling so much from malnutrition and alcohol, I was in a very serious clinical depression that lasted...well, we're now in year 7, but I'm finally heading back in a better direction. I quit drinking alcohol and taking medications, especially ibuprofen, I started eating natural whole foods, I removed the things from my life that prevented me from happiness (bad husband) and did a bunch of inner work, focusing on self love and body acceptance. To date, I've lost about a hundred pounds and my mental clarity is coming back. Most importantly, I will never again treat my body like a toxic waste dump. I hope your friend can realize how beautiful her body is before things get bad. The worst part was being invisible when I was over weight. I was used to getting a lot of attention from men, and then suddenly, they would go to great lengths to avoid looking directly at me. I could always tell they were judging me for not putting down the fork. I wanted to tell them: I never eat anything!...but it turned out that was why I was large. Your body tries to handle what you throw at it for as long as it can, but then at some point a switch gets flipped. And then you're royally screwed. The best, and my sincerest love to your friend. Please tell her she's loved and she's always been good enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago before probiotics became popular someone explained them to me like this: &quot;you have a village of helpers in your intestines. If you take a laxative they all get flushed away. If you do not eat vegetables, fruit, or yogurt then they will not come back and the only way you can poop is to use more laxatives. The human body itself is incapable of digesting food. We utilize the poop of the bacteria in our intestines. So the bacteria eats the food we eat and we eat absorb their poop. Just like the earth worms in a garden. Dirt is the result of earth worms eating everything in the ground.&quot; If she cannot be healthy for herself maybe she can think of her gut as a playroom for pets and keep them healthy. She can grow her own bacteria and maintain their health with fruits and vegetables. She can grow bad bacteria that feed on sugar and junk food and be over weight and unhealthy. She can flush all of them away with laxatives and bring about a myriad of health problems because her body has no access to nutrition or the food she did eat whether healthy or not due to the lack of probiotics in her gut. I hope she does seek your advice in the future. You are a good friend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From the former anorexic/bulimic section here... I can truthfully say that it doesn't even work that well, other than really fucking up your body. I've tried it a few times, when I was doing better with my eating habits but still wanted to lose weight/terrified of gaining, and it honestly didn't seem to make any difference in my weight. How long has she been doing it? She may even realize herself that it's not working, and is harming her body. (The constipation when your body gets dependent on laxatives SUCKS. And is extremely painful.) Even knowing, medically, the harm it could cause didn't stop me... it was the realization that it didn't work and was causing me pain that made me stop. </p>
<p>Good luck with your friend, and to your friend. I read your other comments, and it looks like she has a long road ahead of her.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is this voltage, not the resistance of the coils, that restricts the amount of power the motor draws. And as this is an impedance, it doesn't generate heat. The power - the current in the motor pushing against this voltage - is what turns the motor.</p>
<p>When the rotor is locked, there is no back EMF to impede the flow of current through the motor. All the electricity flowing through the motor is converted to heat by the resistance of the windings. This quickly overheats the wiring, melting insulation, creating shorts, reducing the resistance and further increasing the current, until some wiring melts and blows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason this happens is because the rotor is locked and there is no rotation to induce counter electromotive force (EMF) in the motor. I see others have called it &quot;back EMF,&quot; but it is the same thing.</p>
<p>To understand counter EMF, think of Newton's Third Law. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When a rotor rotates, it induces an electromagnetic force opposite of the direction of rotation. In an ideal situation the two forces balance out when there is a constant load and that is how you get your running current. Starting current is much different. As others have pointed out, before the rotor begins to turn and generate counter EMF the stator (armature) windings are essentially a short circuit. Those windings are not rated to handle that amount of current outside of starting surges. Because of a phenomenon called copper loss, all conductors generate heat as current flows through them. The amount of heat generated is proportional to current and calculated as P=I^2 * R. As you can see, the power dissipated (heat) grows exponentially with current. With nothing to limit the current flow in a locked rotor it is only a matter of time before any stator (armature) windings heat to the point of failure. If you are curious, there is a document that exists that explains a lot of these principles. The &quot;Applied Engineering Principles Manual&quot; can be found at <a href="http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Portals/103/Documents/NNPTC/Electrical%20Eng/applied_ee_v1.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Portals/103/Documents/NNPTC/Electrical%20Eng/applied_ee_v1.pdf</a> and you would want to start reading at around page 23 or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=MotorSpeed&amp;section=SystemModeling" target="_blank">This</a> is a good description of a typical motor model.</p>
<p>If you look at the diagram, you see the armature circuit. That's what you connect your power to. It has a resistance, an inductance, and a back EMF. The back EMF is proportional to the rotor speed. The resistance is typically small. The motor I have here on my bench measures around 4 Ohms. </p>
<p>If you put in a constant voltage, you ignore the inductor part. If you hold the rotor steady, you ignore the back EMF part. All that's left is the armature resistance; input current is V/Ra. </p>
<p>This can be a problem because 1. 100% of that energy is dissipated in the winding, when some of it was supposed to be put out as mechanical energy, vibration, noise, rotor friction, etc. That's more than the armature is typically built to handle. And 2) it is, by definition, the maximum current the motor can handle. You're maximizing power in and minimizing efficiency, meaning the power goes to things it wasn't supposed to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What is actually happening is that the spools of wire inside the motor, although they look like bare wire, are insulated and too much current causes the wires to heat up and the insulation melts and shorts the wires together. The smell of a bad motor is the plastic insulation having melted and one or more if the &quot;legs&quot; has grounded out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with the counter EMF that allows more current that many people have mentioned, the motors typically have a small fan to cool the motor components also. This is usually a problem when you use a VFD (varies frequency of power going to the motor to speed up or slow down the motor) on a motor not rated for that use.</p>
<p>So basically more amps and less cooling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that all tree stems eventually die; trees MUST grow to survive, so a tree will inevitably grow itself into a precarious situation, either outstripping its nutrient or water supplies, or growing to big to support its size. The longest living single stem trees are bristlecone pines, which another poster covered in this thread, but in a nutshell, those trees will eventually die because they get too big for their environment to support. </p>
<p>If we count root systems as trees (I do as a forester), then the oldest living tree is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_\(tree\)" target="_blank">Pando</a>, which is essentially a single large root system that creates numerous genetically identical stems. But even this tree is considered to be in decline. At some point, it is likely that this tree will lose its vigour (either through a disease or insect attack) and die. </p>
<p>Without outside interference, there isn't really a good answer for how long a tree like Pando could live. Trees do not age the same way animals do. Root propagating species like aspen seem capable of repairing genetic damage. Furthermore, trees do not appear to get cancer and the cancer like defects (galls and burls) do not have a long term impact on tree health. </p>
<p>So in a nutshell; a pine or redwood cannot live forever. A root propagating species like aspen <em>might</em>. </p>
<p>Edit: Apparently I forgot that redwoods can root propagate! Make me wonder if there is a really old root system in California somewhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is nothing on earth that can live forever. Just like every other living thing, the process of cell replication that happens in plants does damage to the replicated DNA stands. Over time, the repair mechanisms stop functioning as well, errors creep in and the plant as a whole begins to show signs of age. Plants just have different rates of cellular growth, and sometimes more efficient cellular mechanisms. </p>
<p>Like Dolly the sheep, the DNA eventually degrades to a point where it simply can't replicate properly anymore. With Dolly, the DNA was already old and worn, so even though it was chronologically young at a cellular level, at a DNA level it was already old. </p>
<p>Still, several thousand years is an imposing time on this planet, given that the average lifespan of most mammals is rarely more than 20. </p>
<p>Tl;Dr - No, nothing lives forever. Not even the universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: When you mail a letter some place, you usually put a return address on it. However there is nobody that actually checks to verify the letter came from where you say it did. You could live in California and pretend to be from Washington, and if you use a re-mailer service the post marks will even show it's from Washington. </p>
<p>It is the same with telephone numbers in the digital age due to the ability of many voice over IP customers to change the phone number displayed when they call someone, much like setting a fake return address above. This allows scammers, robodialers, telemarketers, even bill collectors, to call a person without revealing their real phone number, or even pretending to be somebody else like the IRS, a neighbor, the police department, or a business.</p>
<p>Detailed explanation: Telephone systems used to work using a protocol called SS7 or signalling system 7 which uses point codes instead of ip addresses. SS7 packets contain information about the source point code, the destination, and information on who placed the call, and where the call is destined. Because the telephone company had exclusive access to this network, it was not possible to fake a telephone number. </p>
<p>Then came voice over IP which uses TCP/IP networking to send telephone calls over a data network using things like SIGTRAN or SIP (thanks for the correction Databeast) which helps establish calls over IP networks. </p>
<p>SIP information can be sent by the telephone company, but if you have access to a SIP provider, then it is possible to change the displayed number and make a telephone call appear to come from any phone number you wish, the same way changing the return to address on a letter can. </p>
<p>This allows spammers and scammers to hide their real telephone number, and make the call appear to come from any phone number they wanted. For instance the IRS 800 number, your local police department phone number, friends or family, or even your own local area code and prefix so they could pretend to be a local call. </p>
<p>This makes it very easy to abuse the telephone system in a hard to trace manner while remaining anonymous so your victims have little information to find or incriminate you. </p>
<p>This is why telephone abuse is becoming more prevalent even on national call blocked numbers. Some people have asked why the phone companies don't block them and the answer is it was against the law and they could incur FCC fines for disrupting telephone calls. The FCC is working on new rules that would allow a user to give their phone provider permission to block these type of calls without incurring fines. </p>
<p>It is a good policy to set your phones default ring tone to silence or 24 hour &quot;do not disturb&quot;, and specifically add phone numbers of friends and family to the exclusion list so the phone will still ring when they call. </p>
<p>And if you see a phone call placed from the first 6 digits of your real phone number, it is guaranteed to be a scam. If your phone number is 210 855 4444 and you see a phone call from 210 855 1234 it's a scam. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll tell you what I do about it that seems to help tremendously. I do this for the Microsoft style scam calls and the ones asking things like if I had a bladder mesh surgery and want to join a class action suit. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned, the cost is so minimal nowadays that for all practical purposes, it costs them nothing. But, the one thing they don't have is unlimited time. Therefore, I drag it out so long that it makes it very inconvenient for them to call me. First, I play along and play dumb for as long as possible. They ask if I'm a homeowner, yes. They ask if I'm a renter, yes. They ask if I have been exposed to asbestos, yes. You get the picture. </p>
<p>Then they finally catch on that I'm wasting their time. Many of the outright scam artists come from countries where family is very important. I start telling them how they embarrass their families by being dishonest people. If this doesn't bother them, I move on to how their parents must be so embarrassed that they are such failures that being a scam artist is the only type of job they are capable of because they are such pathetic people. I'll tell them they are dumb, pathetic losers who aren't capable  of legit jobs. Their parents must be so embarrassed by what failures they are. While everyone else brags what their kids do, their parents have to stay silent to their friends because they are such losers that they shame their family. I'm not going to lie, I get downright vicious. </p>
<p>They will most likely become hostile at this point. Then I move on to insulting their penis. If they say anything back, I flat out taunt them. They work as scam artists in 3rd world countries, it's not like they have the means to get on a plane. I insult their dignity and their manhood. Eventually they get do pissed they hang up on me. I do this all over a good 10-30 minutes. I make it so hostile, uncomfortable, and time consuming that it no longer makes sense for them to contact me. Whatever scam  outfit that person is from, they typically will not contact me again for a good 6 months to a year.</p>
<p>Sorry this isn't an official this works to report them to authorities who will care and do something about it. However, I've found this to be the most efficient way to get these people to stop bothering me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why, exactly, but it has to do with how gullible people, in general, are. Working in law enforcement, I encounter calls from citizens being scammed like this, about a dozen everyday. The most recent one I remember was a man in his 20s or 30s and transient; he got a call from the IRS on the day after Tax Day. The person on the other line said he owed money to the IRS and if he didn't pay, there will be a warrant out for his arrest and local PD will be out to get him (nevermind that he's transient and doesn't have a stable address for them to come get him, but I digress). He believes this and agrees to pay. They tell him to pay with $400 worth of iTunes cards and send the numbers or whatever to a particular account or number, and he does so. He realizes several hours later that he might have been scammed.</p>
<p>He asks me, with hope in his voice, &quot;ma'am, is this true? Does the IRS typically accept that form of payment?&quot; Because in spite of everything, he honestly believed them. It was kind of sad.  </p>
<p>Instead of saying what I really wanted to say, I just posed a question: &quot;what is the IRS going to do with an iTunes gift card?&quot;</p>
<p>Then it struck home. </p>
<p>Remember folks, if the IRS needs to get in touch with you, they will contact you through mail. And they will definitely find better ways to fuck you out of your hard-earned money than to demand iTunes cards!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My job at work is to caption phone calls for the deaf and hard of hearing. About 30-40% of calls that we connect to are either telemarketers, cardholder services, pre-recorded charity drives, warranty chasers, and PC scams. Occasionally we do get dangerous calls like the ones that call and pretend the person's grandson is in jail in Mexico or that they won something and they're demanding $250 bucks through Western Union before they can get their millions. </p>
<p>There is nothing we, the interpreters, can do about that. FCC regulations clearly defines that we have no business intentionally altering the conversation to alert the poor old biddy that gets drawn in to these kinds of things. We can only caption verbatim. I know a lot of colleagues who become distressed after certain calls because they have to just sit there and listen to someone get scammed out of their money.</p>
<p>However, if you do have a relative that has a captioning phone, interpreters are allowed to collect the call IDs that we suspect as scams and patch it through to operations. This is a relatively recent addition and our marketing team sends out newsletters to customers just to at least warn them of such calls. Personally, I've told my parents and my grandparents to always come to us should they get any calls that demand money from them and stay clear away from those Microsoft scam fuckers because they are literally the worst.

Waste their time.    </p>
<p>The scam only works because it's fast to sort the rubes from the non-rubes, even though the probability of finding a rube is very low.     Change this balance even slightly, and the scam becomes unprofitable.   </p>
<p>You can't lower the percentage of rubes in the population, but you can increase the time it takes to find them: by keeping the scammer on the line even though you know it's a scam.    </p>
<p>The scammers hate this. They're trying to make a fast buck, and you're slowing them down.  As a result, they furiously scrub their lists for time-wasters.<br />
Nothing else works.  Hanging up doesn't work - that costs them nothing. Being rude doesn't work, that just means they hang up and cut their losses - they'll still call again.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where you live.</p>
<p>In BC, Canada, where I live, parking violations are civil bylaw infractions. They have nothing to do with your driver's license. If you pay, they go away. If you don't pay, you get sent to collections. You can never go to prison for parking tickets in BC. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK there is the criminal offence <em>Leaving a Vehicle in a Dangerous Position</em> , for example on a blind corner. This can be punished by 3 'penalty points' as well as a fine. That wouldn't apply to things like parking in disabled spaces though. Accumulate 12 penalty points in 3 years and you normally get banned from driving. Drive while banned and you can be put in prison. For some context, other common offences that earn 3 points are mild speeding and running red lights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
