		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll expand on the existing answer a bit because there is an important distinction that wasn't fully explained. In frequentist statistics, it is regularly assumed that you are determining the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false given some observed data. This is wrong. What frequentist statistics can actually tell you is the probability of your data (or data more extreme) emerging given the null hypothesis is true (or by chance, if you want).</p>
<p>It's a subtle but very important distinction for the types of inferences you can reasonably make. Frequentist statistics cannot ever actually say anything about the truth or falsehood of the null hypothesis, only about the data observed.</p>
<p>Bayesian statistics, on the other hand, allows you to determine the probability of the null hypothesis given the data observed-- something they call the posterior probability (i.e., the probability of a hypothesis being true after data has been observed).</p>
<p>The posterior probability, p(hypothesis given data), is obtained from the prior probability of some hypothesis before the experiment or observation, p(hypothesis), and the likelihood of some data occurring given the hypothesis under question, p(data given hypothesis).</p>
<p>Now the prior probability can rarely ever be known exactly, so instead Bayesian statisticians use models to determine a distribution of likely prior probabilities. And you might recognize what Bayesians call &quot;likelihood&quot; as exactly what frequentist statistics provides.</p>
<p>So, the ultimate difference between the two schools is that the Bayesian tradition goes beyond the likelihood of the data given a hypothesis (which the frequentist tradition is limited to) and instead weights it by prior knowledge of the likelihood of that hypothesis.</p>
<p>Both traditions have strengths and weaknesses, and the relative value of either depends on the type of question you are trying to answer and the types of uncertainties and biases you're willing to accept in your inferential process.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also <a href="https://xkcd.com/1132" target="_blank">obligatory xkcd</a>. Bayesians condition their expectations on the occurrence of the event--while frequentists look at the raw frequency of the event. Is the event rare enough to say we think the null is false (freq) vs what's the likelihood given our expectations/observations (bayesian). </p>
<p>Bayes rule: p(b|a): p(a|b)p(a)/p(b) where p is probability and a and b are events. So the likelihood of b given a is the likelihood of a given b time a over b. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A frequentist probability is a relative frequency. That means that if you have a probability p of some event occurring, and you observe infinitely many trails, the fraction of the time that your event will occur will be p. It's an objective value.</p>
<p>Bayesian probabilities are subjective &quot;degrees of belief&quot;. That means that they depend on your knowledge of the situation. And when you take some more data, you can use it to update your degree of belief to include the new information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose I shuffle the a deck of cards look at it and set it on the table without letting you look at it.  What's the probability that the deck is in order?</p>
<p>One reasonable answer is to say that the deck is either in order, or it's not in order, so the probability is either 1 or 0.</p>
<p>Another reasonable answer is to say that (assuming a proper shuffle) the deck has a 1 in 52! chance of being in order, so that's the probability.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, that corresponds to the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian viewpoints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal clinical setting, a person with malnutrition will be monitored very closely for changes in electrolytes. These electrolytes, usually potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium in particular, will probably need to be supplemented. Thiamine (Vitamin B1) should also be supplemented. Fluids should be monitored and may need to be limited at first. When you first start feeding someone that is malnourished, you &quot;start low and go slow,&quot; mainly in regards to carbohydrates which will affect the metabolism of those electrolytes. This process is typically the first few days of feeding a malnourished person. </p>

I'm a 6 foot tall guy, so obviously that's a dangerously unhealthy weight. The key is pacing and content. I was forced to stick to easily digestable food, like oatmeals, toast, soft fruits, rice, stuff like that, and i was basically told &quot;eat until you feel full and then stop.&quot; Then i had to wait a certain time period before i was allowed to eat again, give my body time to digest, and then hopefully next time I ate, I would eat more. It was a slow process, and there was a lot of vomiting involved when I ate too fast or didn't give myself time to digest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called refeeding syndrome. It's not that you can't digest the food, but that your body reacts to the increased calories by making enzymes to break down the food. But you're so malnourished that you don't have the right building blocks so you end up with all sorts of electrolyte disturbances which can cause arrhythmia and stuff.
Basically you have to introduce them to food very slowly, and/or monitor them and replete the electrolytes that they need asap.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starving kids in African countries are fed Plumpy'nut, which is basically peanut butter with added vitamins and nutrients. They use peanut butter because it's fairly easy to eat, doesn't require a lot of chewing, etc., and peanuts are easy for the body to digest. They also help build up fat quickly, which is necessary for survival in periods of starvation.</p>
<p>So starving people pretty much just have to be introduced to food very slowly, a little bit at a time. Peanut butter or something similar seems to work well, so long as the starving person doesn't eat too much at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually being experimented with right now. Designing new coral and zoozanthellae is still in the realm of science fiction. However, there are numerous labs working on artificially selecting heat and co2 tolerant genotypes of important reef building corals. The hope being, that we can accelerate the process of natural selection to keep pace with our changing environment. </p>
<p>This is contingent on numerous factors, however, that are difficult to overcome. </p>
<p>1) Sexual reproduction in corals is a tricky thing to get right in a lab setting, although we are getting better at it.</p>
<p>2) this is a new field and it's just getting off the ground</p>
<p>3) It's very expensive and there is still very limited funding</p>
<p>4) we don't know if it is going to work. It's possible that the species we are losing are simply not going to be able to survive the conditions they are facing.</p>
<p>5) our government is not willing to accept the magnitude of the problem</p>
<p>There is still hope that coral reefs can be saved world wide. They won't be the same ecosystems that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years, but they may hopefully still exist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from some good (and bad) answers others have given, there's a chicken and egg argument.  Lots of voters in these states think that federal funding has <em>harmed</em> the private sector and as long as the government continues to, in their mind, poorly spend money in their state, it'll keep it dependent on federal funding and be self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>They think that if the federal funding stopped, there would be a period of pain but then the private sector would be better positioned to help the state and make it stronger than before.  Whether you believe that or not- or maybe do in some cases but not in others- is up to you.</p>
<p>Side note: this is often a talking point about Brexit, too.  People that are against it will point to the UK's economy doing worse right afterward as an indication that leaving the EU was/is bad for the country.  People who are pro-Brexit will look at the exact same economic downturn and say &quot;Yeah, that the EU has that much influence over our economy in the first place is <em>exactly</em> the problem.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body and brain and part of the same system. Your emotions impact your body, just like your body impact your emotions. </p>
<p>A section of your nervous system lines your digestive tract: the enteric nervous system. It is full of motor neurons that contract and relax muscles all the way from the esophagus to the anus to get your food into your stomach, digested, and eliminated (among other functions). Normally you wouldn't notice it working away, but if things go into overdrive, your stomach can feel weird.</p>
<p>[There is quite a bit of overlap between nervous system and the gastrointestinal system. Neurogastroenterology is the focus of a lot of research right now because there is a lot we simply don't know.]</p>
<p>Anxiety or stress causes muscle tightness all over the body--it readies the body for fight, flight, or freezing. There are muscles all over your chest, so you feel it as tension or tightness. This response also increases blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and other functions. The result is that you can feel like your chest is heavy, feel your heart racing, feel your heart pounding, feel shortness of breath, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is a small medical saying, &quot;Half your brain is in your gut&quot;.  So, when you're excited when that first special someone touches your hand.. you feel you could almost throw-up.  And then later that year (or night) when that person dumps you.. you feel like you could throw-up, it's all &quot;spiked&quot; and &quot;depleted&quot; neurotransmitters affecting not just your brain/emotions, but how your gut physically feels.  </p>
<p>This is also where tropes like &quot;nervous people get ulcers&quot; or &quot;stressed people poop a lot&quot; are <em>sort of</em> accurate.  But not really.  Also.. it's why some many people &quot;eat their emotions&quot;.  Eating relieves stress (through a complex mechanism mind-you).. but it's in the same world, stimulation or depletion of these neurotransmitters.   </p>
<p>P.S.- also, it ties into a lot of what some of the other responses are saying. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's fairly likely. There are certain astronomical events which involve intense neutron flux that result in production of super heavy elements. These include things Plutonium, Nobelium, even up to the 110s and beyond most likely. Those elements decay rapidly however so they don't stick around long enough to be studied.</p>
<p>There are a couple core problems in studying such things, however. One is that those elements would make up only a tiny, tiny minority of the mass of the debris from such events, so the signal in the spectral data would be almost impossible to detect. The other is that the elements would decay so rapidly (in the case of 119 and 120 likely in a matter of milliseconds or less) that there's almost no way to be lucky enough to study them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The closest any atom comes to another is when they have a covalent bond. A double bond is slightly closer than a single, a triple closer than a double. </p>
<p>There are other types of bonds, like hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds, where electrons are loosely shared, but the atoms are farther apart than you'd find in a covalent bond. </p>
<p>When I poke you in the face and your cheek squishes, I'm obviously touching you, but, our atoms are not &quot;touching&quot; they are reaching a point where the force pushing them together is less than the force they exert to push apart. </p>
<p>Think of this as if you had two magnets and you're trying to push them together, the same thing is happening on a microscopic (if you've got an electronic microscope) level. </p>
<p>You generally don't bond at a molecular level to things that you touch, but let's say that you lick a pole in the middle of winter. Your tongue gets stuck to the pole right? </p>
<p>The pole is covered in a layer of crystalline water, your tongue is covered in a layer of liquid water, when the two come into contact, the water on your tongue crystallizes and binds to the ice on the pole. Your tongue gets stuck as water on your tongue that was liquid is now ice and at a microscopic level the ice is inside thousands and thousands of tiny crevices on your tongue and the tiny amount of force needed to pull away adds up quickly. </p>
<p>There's also the theory that the coefficient of static friction is due to the small scale ionic(?) binding between two surfaces when they're in contact. Like static electricity holding a balloon to the wall, that same force is why it's mathematically more difficult to start moving the wooden crate across the cement floor of your garage than it is to keep moving it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you could visualize it, you would see a band of relatively empty space. Think of it like the separation between oil and vinegar in a basic Italian salad dressing.</p>
<p>Now it and you are wet, things get interesting because the water molecules can form temporary bonds between some other types of molecules called hydrogen bonds, so in this case, the sharp distinction becomes somewhat blurry. Your skin cells are mostly hydrophobic, so there would still be repulsion from the hydrophobic parts, but there are proteins and enough other things that can interact with the water to make things messy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>1) Quantum entangled particles ARE correlated in some non-classical way.  If they weren't we wouldn't have needed to come up with quantum mechanics.  </p>
<p>2) Quantum states absolutely experience time/age.  Time evolution (through unitary operators) is pretty central to quantum mechanics and quantum wavefunctions, on top of regular time dependence that classical particles have, also have a phase that change in time.  This actually even allows for types of time dependence, like Aharnov-Bohm, that classical particles don't have. So one could argue that they're even MORE time dependent than classical particles. If they weren't you couldn't build something like a LASER.</p>
<p>However, there is an inherent problem in mixing measurement paradox thought experiments with special relativity.  Namely, such thought experiments are phrased in the language of quantum mechanics (bra-kets and states) but QM is not actually the most fundamental form of quantum theory and, crucially, is incompatible with special relativity (not to be confused with incompatibility with general relativity, which is the case of all quantum theories and is one of the biggest open questions in physics).</p>
<p>Conversely, the more fundamental version of quantum theory that IS compatible with special relativity, quantum field theory (QFT), does not lend itself to such simple little thought experiments about state and measurement.  For example, I honestly have never seen a QFT treatment of the popular spin-singlet measurement set-up and I'm not sure if one exists (again, hopefully someone knows more).  More specifically, in QFT, not only do you not even have a wavefunction, but particle number is not even a concrete number in any real system.  That's not to say that entanglement doesn't occur in the more &quot;fundamental&quot; QFT, it does reduce to QM in certain limits after all, but rather the formalism makes tackling the issue far more complicated, which is why people choose to almost exclusively work in the &quot;approximation&quot; of quantum mechanics when talking about such things.  However, talking about SR and QM is a no-go.</p>
<p>There actually is something called &quot;Relativistic Quantum Mechanics&quot; that is essentially the first effort to make QM compliant with SR, but it was eventually abandoned after it was realized it could never work, and the entire quantization procedure itself had to be changed - which lead to QFT.  Though I do wonder if it works well enough that you might be able to consider something of your problem, but I'm hardly an expert on such defunct theories.</p>
<p>You can maybe get an idea of the problem as such, in QM you have an individual particle's behaviour modeled by a wavefunction and the behaviour of two particles governed by some linear combination of a product of two wavefunctions (don't worry about this).  These wavefunctions, like all waves, obey Heisenberg's Uncertainty which can be said, in a certain form, to say:  the variance/uncertainty in the time interval in which a system is considered multiplied by the variance/uncertainty in the system energy, must be equal to or greater than some number.  This means that if the time interval becomes arbitrarily small, the energy variance/uncertainty becomes arbitrarily big.  That's what QM says.  However, SR says E=mc^2 .  So if the system has enough energy, then new particles can be created (i.e. if energy is greater than mass of two electrons times speed of light squared you can make an electron-positron pair, for example). So putting the two (SR and QM) together you arrive at the notion that you have a theory of &quot;one particle-one wavefunction&quot; but depending on the time interval of consideration, one can have arbitrarily large energy variances implying that the number of particles is not only not fixed, but dependent on the interval of consideration.  So you could not possibly have a theory of one particle-one wavefunction that was accurate to arbitrary time and energy scales.</p>
<p>So QM and SR don't play nice, in QFT this issue is avoided by throwing out the concept of particles altogether and instead talking about quantized excitations of fields (an electron isn't a particle but an excitation of the electron field).  And QFT, although the most accurate scientific theory developed by humankind and entirely compliant with SR, is really set up to allow things like scattering probabilities to be calculated and doesn't treat state in such a straightforward way like QM.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that your thought experiment involves  BOTH SR and GR (general relativity). With SR alone there is no Twin Paradox, as how does one know which twin is younger and which older?  SR says all (inertial) reference frames are equivalent so where one twin heads off in a space ship at 0.9c, from that twin's perspective it's the Earth zooming away at 0.9c.  The symmetry is broken by the fact that one twin, and only one twin, entered a non-inertial frame, which is to say they accelerated.  Such acceleration is not described by SR and one needs GR.  Thus, although it is a point often skipped over, the Twin Paradox is actually a result of SR+GR.  Of course one can ignore this and use QM and just demand by fiat that one part of the spin-singlet is time evolved more than the other, but I'm fairly certain that will just lead to garbage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The particles do not actually have a physical link or connection, it can only be said that by knowing the state of one of the particles , you are able to know the state of the other, without having to be communicated that state, and visa versa. There is no communication between entangled particles, and no violations of causality. Nothing is &quot;collapsing&quot; but our ignorance of the actual state, all other postulated manifold possibilities (arrived at using imprecise models, at best) are excluded once an interaction occurs/a measurement is obtained. The distance, time, frame of reference, etc, are not material to this effect. If I've seriously erred here, someone please correct me!</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm wrong about the details of entanglement (see below), but I still think it's true that OP's conditions on the communication are not relevant because there is no communication (at least no one tore me a new one about that part, yet, haha).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be use the wrong mental model for entanglement. It is not some kind of wire that transmits information between both particles, so that one tells the other when to collapse. In particular, the (non-existent) wire does not keep a record of when (or in which reference frame) it was created, so that it would know to wait the appropriate amount of time to collapse the other particle that stayed at Earth.</p>
<p>It is hard to find a good classical analogy for entanglement precisely because it's so nonclassical. The closest one comes is a correlation between two random variables, but even that is wrong, as the correlation is information calculated by someone who is keeping statistics, whereas entanglement is something physical, that does not depend of whether anyone is making measurements or not.</p>
<p>The clearest explanation I know for what actually happens when an entangled pair of particles is measured is the one given by the Many Worlds interpretation. According to it, the entangled pair is a superposition between two potential worlds, one where both particles &quot;point up&quot;, and another where both particles &quot;point down&quot;. Then when one of the twins makes a measurement on one the particles, it creates two copies of himself, one in the &quot;pointing up&quot; world, and another in the &quot;pointing down&quot; world. When the second twin does his measurement, he will also create two copies of himself, one in the &quot;pointing up&quot; world, and another in the &quot;pointing down&quot; world.</p>
<p>This explanation makes it clear that the copy of the first twin that saw &quot;up&quot; in his measurement will meet the copy of the second twin that also saw &quot;up&quot; in his measurement (and the same for &quot;down&quot;), without any information being send around, or any conflict with relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In the sense that if they changed, it would amount to interacting with the state and therefore destroying the entanglement. Entanglement is actually most easily done with particles at light speed, since most experiments use entangled photon pairs. So to answer your question.

<p>There are several ways to find such voids, we can detect them by drilling when the bit drops unexpectedly, if they are close enough to the surface using ground penetrating radar, from orbit if they are large enough by temperature variances where none should be there, or using a technique to measure electrical resistance across a given section of dirt in areas with the right soil type and moisture content (the void space doesn't conduct electricity so the value is lower than a solid chunk)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many 'caves' that have no opening to the outside will likely be filled with hostile gasses from hydrogen sulfide near fossil fuel areas like the Permian Basin, or just regular carbon dioxide, so they would be fatal to visit simply because they can't exchange air with the atmosphere. These caves wouldn't have the stalactites and stalagmites as that also requires outside air for the CO2 to degas from the water droplets so they can drop their mineral content. These voids are basically toxic spaces, but there is no way to know how many there are. Some are quite deep too, like 1,000 feet below the surface. Carlsbad Caverns, for instance, has 5 main floors. They all formed with no connection to the surface until the uplift of the Guadalupe Mtns about 8-10 million years ago lifted the gypsum filled voids out of the acidic water table. Once the entrance collapsed in, air could exchange and the scenic formations began to grow, the bats moved in, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
