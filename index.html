<p>Not really. It is important to note that time is not an assurance that improvement will arrive, that is just an expectation from our advances in other areas.</p>
<p>It turns out that steam turbines are just really good at producing electricity from a heat source. That isn't to say there have not been advances, but it is more in the form of better steam turbines rather than a fundamental shift in techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you think of traditional energy sources, hydro and wind are kinetic energy sources (water and air are not reactive in generating their own electron). Natural gas and fossil fuel have a lot of chemical energy but they excel in combustion. Heat generally doesn't change chemistry but make them more energetic so we are still trying to harness kinetic energy.</p>
<p>But then look at solar and fuel cells, light is a electromagnetic wave and are not kinetic energy, so we can tap into that directly. Fuel cells work through electron exchange, so we can also ignore kinetic energy.</p>
<p>I think the way we harness energy is more source dependant than it is technology dependant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For most, this does no long-lasting harm. This is not true for more social and hierarchically organized species.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4UMyTnlaMY&amp;t=1s" target="_blank">this video</a> where he describes the research on baboons that won him the MacArthur Genius Grant. </p>
<p>The tl;dw is that baboons are hierarchical and mean to one another. Lower-order baboons have rates of heart-disease comparable with modern humans, despite not eating like we do or watching Netflix all day. It's due to the constant stress of being on the low end of a social hierarchy. However, this is culturally learned and can be culturally unlearned. Serendipitously, he wound up studying a troop where all the aggressive males died at once. The only males left were social and nice, both to one another and to the troop's females. This changed the culture of troop. Not only that, but new males entering the troop were acculturated to the new norms of the troop. Their health improved once the culture of extreme hierarchy and cruelty stopped. It's a pretty life-affirming 10min lecture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert- and this isnt answering the question directly but more adding onto better answers. In the book Sapiens, the author briefly mentions that humans were very much prey and the jump to predator was pretty quick by evolutionary standards. The theory is that we still have prey instincts that we havent fully dealt with. So its very possible that we share fear traits with most animals - but its possible that 'predators' like wolves, bears, lions dont feel that fear/anxiety. When these types of animals have never seen humans or only seen friendly humans they tend to not be very worried. The Selous safari park in Tanzania for example is split into two parts: a hunting section and no hunting section. The animals in the hunted section will all run away if they see a car/human - meanwhile the ones on the other side are used to seeing humans and are completely unfazed. I noticed the zebras/antelopes/grazers etc were way more skittish and suspicious of us- whilst the lions acted like we weren't there. I was 1 meter away from a lioness, my heat was beating fast and my adrenaline was going off even though I knew I was safe but that lion couldn't have been more chill. Makes me wonder if hierarchy plays a role in this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The mountain lions of inland North San Diego County, for example, have been hedged in by 10 lanes of Interstate 15 dividing their mountain habitat. Wildlife cameras and biologists have witnessed lions coming to the side of the massive interstate highway, stressing out, and turning around. This isolated population is now showing genetic effects of inbreeding, including &quot;kinked tails.&quot; </p>
<p>Happily, land conservationists have just completed the purchase of a big wild parcel next to I-15 that will allow the construction of a wildlife bridge across the huge highway, as recommended by two science panels: <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sd-no-wildlife-crossing-20180413-story.html" target="_blank">http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sd-no-wildlife-crossing-20180413-story.html</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple mechanisms that help mammals adapt to stress, I've focused on the endocannabinoid system and it's role in mediating stress so that mammals are able to think clearly and survive in stressful situations. One interesting element of PTSD in humans is that it seems that endocannabinoid levels (like anandamide) increase under stressful situations, causing upregulation of CB1 receptors. In the same way that alcoholics upregulate GABA receptors, mammals seem to upregulate CB1 receptors when their endocannabinoid levels remain high for prolonged periods of time. When they are removed from the stressful environment, endocannabinoid levels are reduced, however the increased amount of CB1 receptors are lacking in endogenous ligands to bind with them. That's where FAAH inhibition through exogenous cannabinoids like CBD has proven to be helpful in mediating the effects of PTSD, both in mice and humans. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4119220/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4119220/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4119220/</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is made of little balls called molecules, which are made of smaller balls called atoms.</p>
<p>Now, light can interact with molecules (really the atoms) in 3 primary ways: reflection (like a mirror), refraction (like how light is bent when looking from air into water) and diffusion, aka scattering.</p>
<p>Diffusion is similar to reflection, but instead of reflecting the light in a single direction, it scatters it in every direction. It's the interaction we are most used to, nearly all materials scatter light. It's why a piece of paper is white, no matter what angle you look at it from. The light doesn't need to reflect into your eye, because the paper scatters the light in every direction.</p>
<p>Gasses can scatter light too, though! Both oxygen and nitrogen, which make up a lot of the air, are good at scattering blue light. The sun appears yellow (and not white) because some of the blue gets scattered as it passes through the air, and the yellows, reds, oranges, etc all keep travelling straight, until they hit your eye.</p>
<p>This blue scattering makes the rest of the sky is blue, and this causes the sky to be blue.</p>
<p>Now to answer your question: as the sun rises and sets, there aren't as many reds/yellows/oranges as the sun isn't shining as intensly down, it needs to travel through a LOT of air to get to you since it's coming in from an angle. This means that a lot more blue light gets to you and the surrounding area. And when there's snow on the ground, snow reflects every color (since it's white), and since there's not as much of the reds/yellows/oranges, it scatters even more blue.</p>
<p>EDITS: changed a couple &quot;diffusions&quot; into &quot;scattering&quot; to be consistent and understandable. Also changed a typo of &quot;matter&quot; to &quot;water&quot; (in refraction)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light diffuses (understand deviated) when propagating in the air. How much it diffuses depends on the wavelength (its color).</p>
<p>The sun emits a wide array or wavelength, and its &quot;blue rays&quot; are among the most disrupted by air. That is why the sky by day is blue. They are so much deviated that they look like coming from where the sun is not, giving the sky its opaque blue look. (Imagine air particles acting like tiny mirrors in random directions, reflecting only blue light)</p>
<p>Now imagine the sun being slightly beyond horizon. Rays that makes the light look &quot;white&quot; are for the most part not reaching you. Except blue ones.<br />
As they are redirected by diffraction, they reach places the other ones do not have a direct path yet/anymore. That is why before dawn/after dusk everything is blue-ish. (Snow only makes it more noticeable because it's white.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

These are special animals that come in all different colors and what color they are determines how far they can jump. The redder animals can jump really far while the bluer ones can only jump a little. So as they run through the field the red animals are able to jump over most of the rocks while the blue animals keep bumping into them and getting knocked off course. </p>
<p>The animals represent what are called photons. These are little bits of lights and like our herd of animals, the light is made up of photons of all different colors. The field is the air. While we can't see them with our eyes, the air is really made up of tiny little particles called atoms. These atoms are our rocks. Just like the animals, some photons are better at getting around them than others. Blue is not very good at getting around the rocks so they tend to cause blue photons to get bumped around and as a result we see more of it in certain cases. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The mosquitoes studied appear to survive the impacts well due to their &quot;strong exoskeleton and low mass...

<p>The short answer is that rain is not really much of a problem for insects.  It's fog that is the bigger problem.</p>
<p>Here's my old comment in full:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of talk of arthropods and such, with some good references, but that's kind of missing several important factors.  It's easy to intuitively think of raindrops hitting small organisms as being equivalent to cinder blocks falling from the sky and hitting us, but that's not how it plays out.</p>
<p><a href="http://wxguys.ssec.wisc.edu/2013/09/10/how-fast-do-raindrops-fall/" target="_blank">Raindrops are not moving very fast, nor are they heavy</a>.  For a raindrop to be considered a raindrop it has to be between roughly .5mm - 6mm (about the size of a fly at the largest).  A big raindrop has a terminal velocity of about 10 m/s (20 mph), with smaller drops down closer to 0.9 m/s (2 mph).  That's basically to say that there isn't much energy in any given raindrop to do a lot of damage with.</p>
<p>Another part is that smaller creatures are quite strong and tough as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">Square-cube Law</a>.  This is why an ant or a spider is proportionally so strong and an element of this is why a mouse generally won't fall fast enough to get seriously injured whereas a horse or an elephant will splash from a long fall.  Also why a raindrop falling on a shrew or a butterfly isn't the equivalent of a cinder-block falling on a human.</p>
<p>Raindrops can certainly hinder small organisms, but that tends to be more an issue of surface tension, heat loss, splashing and water flow, and things like that rather than the actual impact of the water droplet.</p>
<p>For many flying organisms <em>fog</em> (and, to a certain degree, drizzle) is actually  much more difficult thing to deal with as the tiny water droplets are suspended in the air and they accumulate on the surface of the flying organism, adding a lot of weight.  This is why you usually don't get mosquitoes buzzing about when it's foggy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>And before anyone says the mouse/elephant thing is taken from a youtube video, it's not.  It's from &quot;<em><a href="https://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.pdf" target="_blank">On Being the Right Size</a></em>,” by J.B.S. Haldane published in 1926.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>
<p>You might be able to do certain jobs despite your disabilities (like say answering phones, or just limited hours) but would lose every benefit and thus end up in a far worse situation for doing so. As such while you could be part of the workforce you are not part of either statistic.</p>

<li>
<p>You may have given up, or simply not have been able to find anything yet; after 5+ weeks you're no longer unemployed for purposes of us all being told the unemployment rate's gone down on the news!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might be under one of those nasty non-competitive clauses in certain tech sectors that prevent you from finding anything else for a few months or years.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot has already been covered in regards to this, but I might have something to add. </p>
<p>The participation rate of an economy (60-65% in a lot of developed countries) is those people who are either employed (involved in 1+ hours of paid work per week) or unemployed (actively seeking work), out of the working age population. </p>
<p>As others have noted, retirees, stay at home parents, etc are above the working age, but neither employed or counted in the unemployment calculation. Similarly, people who have given up looking for work as they believe they cannot find it, or people who cannot look for work due to health issues, are not counted. </p>
<p>Thus, the disparity between the two numbers is explained by the fact that unemployment is calculated as a proportion of the participation rate, while employment is calculated as a percentage of the working age population (everyone 15+). Hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In 1942 the US <strong>built an entire city</strong> just for the purpose of enriching Uranium for the Manhattan project.  They used <strong>60,000 acres</strong> to build the necessary factories, and <strong>70,000</strong> people were housed in Oak Ridge to build and operate the factories.  All told, this 3 year effort only produced enough enriched Uranium (about 100 lbs) for <strong>ONE BOMB</strong> (the other two bombs were plutonium based) by the end of the war.</p>
<p>Now, I imagine that current technology has probably advanced this process somewhat, but it is still something that has to occur on a massive industrial scale.  You can't hide construction like this from a spy satellite.  And you can't hide purchases of some of the specialized materials needed to build the equipment.  And you have to buy the raw materials from somewhere - raw Uranium is fairly rare and its purchase is carefully tracked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Enriching uranium requires you to take the rare U-235 out from the common U-238 and discard the rest.</p>
<p>Firstly, you will need to purchase large amounts of uranium. This is pretty obvious to look for, everybody will know when large quantities are being shipped to/within your country. Unless your processing lab happens to sit on an undiscovered uranium mine you can’t access it.</p>
<p>Secondly, you will generate a lot of radioactive waste (the common U-238). You need to dispose of it somewhere, preferably away from the population centres and where your processing lab is. This can be easily detected by satellites / random people with Geiger counters.

<p>Thirdly, you will need to hire nuclear Engineers. Oh suddenly all the nuclear Engineers in the country started working for the military/disappeared? Pretty big sign of a nuclear program.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, you'll need quite a bit of uranium, likely more than your own country could mine in a few years time, unless you're in North America which has large reserves.</p>
<p>Natural uranium contains only 0.72% of the isotope U-235, which is the one that can undergo fission, and the one that is useful for power reactors and weapons.</p>
<p>Except for microscopic traces of other isotopes, the rest is U-238 which is not directly useful in weapons or reactors</p>
<p>(However U-238 can slowly be converted into plutonium by absorbing excess neutrons.)</p>
<p>So, to produce, say, 100 kg of material that is highly enriched in U-235, you would need a very minimum:</p>
<p>100kg/.007 = 13,889 kg.</p>
<p>In reality you will need at least an order of magnitude more than this since the enrichment process is highly inefficient. Weapons grade material needs to be about 2/3 U-235.</p>
<p>So, importing dozens or hundreds of tons of uranium ore concentrates (&quot;yellocake&quot;) is likely to raise a few eyebrows.</p>
<p>The second problem is that various enrichment processes require some pretty specific metals and materials. Enrichment involves converting the uranium into corrosive uranium hexafluoride, then vaporizing it into a gas. </p>
<p>The most common technique is the gas ultracentrifuge. This involves spinning the hot gas at a moderate vacuum, at incredibly high speed. The cylinders need to be fabricated and machined with the utmost precision and need to be perfectly balanced, otherwise they self destruct when spun up. It turns out that a special Cobalt-containing steel called &quot;maraging steel&quot; is the only material with the right combination of properties.  So if you start trying to buy that stuff on the down-low, the International Atomic Energy Agency takes notice.</p>
<p>Even still, the separation factor for one cylinder is low, so you need thousands of cylinders and hundreds of tons of metals and piping.</p>
<p>Seal and gasket materials for process pipes and pumps also need to be made from rather specific materials to withstand the hot corrosive gas. You can't just buy the stuff from hardware stores.</p>
<p>Then there's the fact that enrichment requires huge amounts of electricity. If you build a large power plant and transmission lines, buy a bunch of electrical  switching  equipment, but don't connect it to a known city or group of legit business, that's going to be pretty suspicious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Enriching uranium requires doing very small amounts of activity on a very large scale. You're literally sorting atoms into &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;slightly less heavy&quot; piles. Every machine you run the atoms through separates them by a tiny, tiny amount. So to change the overall percentage of &quot;slightly less heavy&quot; atoms (U-235) from less than 1% to 90% or so, and to do so in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., not a thousand years), you need a very large factory that takes a lot of electricity. </p>
<p>That size and electricity profile has made it possible to detect these factories from a distance — when you see a massive building that takes a massive amount of electricity and practically nothing is made by it, then you might ask what they're doing there, if you're already suspicious. Once you are suspicious there are other ways to verify it (e.g., taking a soil sample nearby, because trace amounts of uranium are often very detectable, just because of the large amounts of uranium gas that these plants handle).</p>
<p>Now there is a historical caveat here. The early methods for doing this were <em>huge</em>. It's very hard to hide a gaseous diffusion plant, for example. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/K-25_%287609929206%29.jpg" target="_blank">Here's the first one ever made</a>; here's a <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/uk/images/capenhurst.jpg" target="_blank">more modern one</a>. Both are huge, but very efficient in terms of uranium enrichment.</p>
<p>If you're a clandestine nuclear power, you don't go in that direction. It's way too obvious and it's also pretty hard to pull off (the technology is difficult to get working and still highly classified). What you do is use a technology that was developed a bit later: the gas centrifuge. </p>
<p>Zippe-style gas centrifuges are not (usually) as efficient as gaseous diffusion. You still need a lot of them and their electricity profile is large. But they are physically much smaller and you can hide them in rather generic looking warehouses and even underground. And you don't have to commit to building them all at once — they can be built one-by-one. You still need a lot of them (e.g., a thousand or so) to start really enriching uranium in useful amounts for a weapon. But once you know how to build one, you can build another, and so on, until you have a lot of them. And the facilities are much lower profile. <a href="https://cdn2.img.sputniknews.com/images/104501/86/1045018658.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a Russian enrichment plant</a>, here's <a href="https://d1o9e4un86hhpc.cloudfront.net/images/tinymce/James%201/AE2550.png" target="_blank">an early centrifuge cascade in Iran</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2010/11/yongbyon_blue_roof_copy_thumb.jpg" target="_blank">here's the centrifuge building in North Korea that we didn't really know existed until they showed it to us, because it looks like a totally normal industrial building from the air</a>. Again, you still need a <em>lot</em> to build a weapon, and it's still not super easy to pull off, but it's a lot easier to hide facilities like this, and much harder to tell what is going on.</p>
<p>The one other thing I'd note is that uranium enrichment requires very large amounts of uranium gas as uranium hexafluoride. This has literally no other use beyond enriching uranium, basically. So if you can track how a country moves uranium around, where it is producing this gas, where it moves that gas, etc., you're bound to see their enrichment activities. How hard is this? If you have no access to a country whatsoever (like North Korea), then very hard. If you do have access, through IAEA inspections or just spies, then the odds of these activities being spotted goes up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>However, couldn't this just be a statistical fluke? If you generate matter and antimatter <em>approximately</em> 50/50, and then annihilate it pairwise, you're always going to get a small amount of either matter or antimatter left over. Maybe that small amount is what we see today?</p>
<p>As an example, let's say I have a fair coin, and do a million coin tosses. It's entirely plausible that I get eg. 500247 heads, and 499753 tails.

For an observer who doesn't know how many tosses I did, how can he conclude from this number if the coin was fair?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only observed ways that matter is created is when an antimatter-matter pair of particles is created from energetic bosons. This process will never make more of one of the types of matter. Statistics has nothing to do with it in this process.</p>
<p>Since we know that there is more matter than antimatter, there must be some other process by which this apparent asymmetry came to be. Thus we have a baryon asymmetry problem.</p>
<p>An interesting note: <del>if you take the Dirac equation and you calculate the &quot;probability&quot; of finding a particle or an anti-particle, when you approach the non-relativistic limit, the &quot;probability&quot; of finding an anti-particle goes to zero.</del></p>
<p>Edit: My previous statement was a slight misinterpretation. In the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac Equation,one of the two component spinors <del>representing Antimatter</del> solutions is significantly smaller than the other spinor. That's the most technically correct statement. The derivation can be found in the quantum mechanics book by Bjorken and Drell. </p>
<p>Edit 2: upon further review, that problem above doesn't really have anything to do with the prevalence of antimatter. Although it is still an interesting problem none the less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a little bit to the &quot;How do we know there is baryon asymmetry&quot; part of the question for anyone curious, it was explained to me in my intro astronomy class that if distant regions of the universe were actually antimatter dominant we would observe the energy of annihilation reactions as antimatter galaxies combined with matter galaxies and gas clouds.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate each other and the mass is converted into energy--specifically, into gamma-rays. If a distant galaxy were made of antimatter, it would constantly be producing gamma-rays as it encountered the matter in the intergalactic gas clouds that exist throughout galaxy clusters.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We do not see any steady stream of gamma-rays coming from any source in the sky. Therefore, astronomers conclude that there are not occasional 'rogue' galaxies made of antimatter.&quot;  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are of the order of 10^80 baryons in the visible universe [1]. For each Baryon, there are approximately 10^8 photons [2]; so, there are approximately 10^88 photons.  The origin of many of these photons is thought to come from baryon anti-baryon annihilation.  So, it is thought that for each 10^8 baryon, there were 10^8 - 1 anti-baryon; they all annihilated pair-wise (producing photons), with one left-over baryon from the original 10^8.  </p>
<p>Conclusion: the original baryon asymmetry was of the order of 1 part in 10^8.  (I have seen estimates varying between 10^8 and 10^10.)</p>
<p>However, if the difference were due to statistical fluctuations, we would think that it would be of the order of the standard error, which, for gaussian distribution and large N that it would be of the order of the square root of N.  If you take the number of baryon as being 10^80, its square root would be 10^40 ... we would thus expect the photon to baryon ratio to be of the order of 10^40 and not 10^8.</p>
<p>Thus, the relatively small 10^8 (compared with 10^40 ... or 10^44) could be a statistical fluke ... however, it would be an extremely unlikely one.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The conservation of quantum numbers isn't a statistical process, nor is it approximate. You MUST conserve baryon number in almost all known processes. So it's not a question of flipping a coin, because probability isn't involved in the conservation (for the most part).</p>
<p>A seesaw would be a better analofy. Let's say one side of a seesaw represents your baryons, the other  side of the seesaw represents your antibaryons. As one side of the seesaw goes down, the other MUST go up, but the centre is always in the same place. It's the same for baryons: if the Baryon number goes up on one side, it has to go down on the other side to balance out, and baryon number going down is achieved by the creation of antibaryons. No matter what you do, the centre of the seesaw, the total baryon number, remains the same.</p>
<p>That's what <em>should</em> happen according to the standard model. But it doesn't: the universe is filled with matter and very little antimatter. In order to explain this asymmetry, you require what is called the 'Sakharov conditions'. One of those conditions is baryon number violation (the other two are interactions outside of thermal equilibrium and CP violation).The sources of these conditions are very active areas of research in modern particle physics and cosmology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perfectly timed question! I took cosmology this semester as part of my MSc and we looked at this problem. The baryon asymmetry problem is partly an observation issue and partly a theoretical one. </p>
<p>The observation part emerges from the fact that we observe more matter than anti-matter in the universe. The theoretical part is that our current electromagnetic and strong interaction theories satisfy CP-symmetry while weak interactions do not. But this violation of CP-symmetry is not sufficient to generate the matter/anti-matter asymmetry we see today.</p>
<p>So Andrei Sakharov proposed three conditions under which baryogenesis leads to baryon asymmetry. These are called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryogenesis#GUT_Baryogenesis_under_Sakharov_conditions" target="_blank">Sakharov Conditions</a> and state that for baryon asymmetry the following three conditions must be satisfied: </p>
<ol>
<li>Baryon Number Violation:
There must exist a process whereby baryons are created and/or destroyed such that baryon number is not preserved.</li>
<li>C-symmetry and CP-symmetry violation:
The rates of processes under Charge conjugation, and under Charge and Parity conjugation must be different so that reactions involving matter proceed at different rates than reactions involving antimatter in favour of matter.</li>
<li>Interactions out of thermal equilibrium:
We require interactions outside of thermal equilibrium sk that the reactions producing baryons favour matter over antimatter. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now, how do we put numbers to this? Well, the way we did it was to estimate the photon-baryon ratio using the number density of photons from the CMB and the current observed number density of baryons. This gives us a ratio of approximately 10^-9, then we say that when the universe was hot enough, the number densities of photons and electrons/positrons were roughly equal as they are in equilibrium. Now if positrons and electrons have identical number densities then they would cancel when the universe cooled and we'd only have photons, but if they were slightly off so that there was one extra electron (and it's associated baryon) for every 10^9 positrons then we'd have a baryon asymmetry.</p>
<p>Hence the current observed asymmetry is not a massive asymmetry, it's actually a tiny one-in-a-billion matter anti-matter asymmetry. </p>
<p>So the conclusion from this is that, it's not just a statistical fluke, we have more matter than anti-matter in the universe and we don't know why. What we do know is that the asymmetry is tiny and we have some ideas as to how we generate that asymmetry. Of course, all of this is predicated upon starting from symmetric initial conditions which then dynamically evolve into an asymmetry due to asymmetric interactions in the physics and the evolutionary dynamics of the universe.</p>
<p>So I hope that answers your question and gives you things to read to better understand baryogenesis in the early universe. 😊</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's really no one answer here, and far from any consistently agreed upon &quot;main cause&quot;.</p>
<p>But I'll try to summarise/begin a few of the proposed ones I know so you can research them later and/or someone will comment with better explanations, probably reading way too deeply into whatever they think my opinion is and being angry about it (I'm going to try to keep my opinion out and list each proposition from its own viewpoint)</p>
<p>So one is that there's no real direct causality between Lattitude and economic development, but rather that colonialism forced those countries into an economic system and them kind of screwed them over in it, so when colonialism ended they started off poor. Examples commonly sighted are the European colonies in Africa where they taxed locals, but the locals didn't have money so they had to work in farms and mines the Europeans set up to make money to pay the taxes. Essentially forcing the locals to work for them.</p>
<p>Another is that the environment, particularly the weather, affects the culture and thus everything else. The northern countries have to deal with winter, which is a fairly regular issue. To the east China and Japan have monsoon season even in the more southern parts where winter isn't as big of an issue. This imposes a sense of regularity and a need for planning that a more temperate climate with year round hunting and plant harvesting doesn't. The theory goes on to state that this regularity and planning propogates into all areas of life, which ultimately causes a difference in cultural views about money. A common example here is Egypt, which has defined it's seasons by the Nile River, since the weather was relatively uniform year round. They had 3 seasons based on the flooding of the Nile which was very regular. This led to a very structured culture and a cyclical pattern in many of their myths as we know them.</p>
<p>Another which I don't know much about states that colder winters select for a different type of thinking, some say &quot;smarter&quot; but I see that as a subset of this larger theory. So this selection for a particular type of thinking would be better suited to economics and the like.</p>
<p>A fourth states that it's, again, a cultural difference, but with a different cause. The &quot;ancient world&quot; of Europe and China more or less founded the modern idea of money, or at least a precursor to it. Not just in &quot;I have 3 coins, I can buy this thing&quot;, because that has been shown to have developed all over the world, but many of the surrounding ideas. Lending someone money, enforcing the integrity of a currency, banks, etc. This way of thinking about money turns out to be rather good at long distance trade and long term investment. Who knew an economic system shaped by the need for those two things would be good at doing those? So as the 'world' expanded, particularly with colonialism setting up countries with that idea if money in their heads from the start, that style of money would become the world standard for trade. This meant that countries with other systems (like the Rai stones of Yap which depend on a shared oral history rather than physical possession) would have to adapt to this big, 'standard' system. Doing so for most countries would mean changing over their entire internal system as well, pushing everyone down to the bottom as they don't know the system as well as others and don't have the history and momentum that gives a starting value.</p>
<p>Yet another states that different climates support different sorts of technological advances. For example European metal working was far beyond any equivalent during the 'dark ages', while we're finding more and more evidence that people in the south if Africa had medical knowledge far beyond any contemporary cultures. These differences are the root of it. If I know something and I teach it to you, I still know it. Now we both know it. But if I make something and give it to you, I don't have it anymore. So I have a greater need for compensation in order to prosper. It also needs a more transferrable form of currency. This goes through some complicated explanations I don't fully understand and ends up with a difference in perception of value, which is then a claimed cause for why such nations aren't more economically developed right now.</p>
<p>There's a lot of others, but those are the ones I know enough to give an attempt at explaining. I personally think it's a combination of a lot of factors, but 2 large ones being the sudden shift to a new system and foreign exploitation.</p>
<p>We can see that countries that already had an economic system compatible with the one we now use near globally have a better starting place when this system is force upon them. Rather than starting with, say, a barter system and now needing to figure out currency (and starting with none) they have to figure out the exchange (already having currency the colonials will accept as a currency, even if their willingness to use it varied a lot), and then adapt to the new system and whatever the colonials are doing.</p>
<p>The second, colonial exploitation, refers to the locals inability to profit off its local resources. Europeans set up diamond and silver mines in Africa, but all the money from it got shipped back to Europe. The locals didn't profit from it, they just got forced into the bottom of a new heirachy and kept poor for a while. Only really being able to begin improving after the best resources were apparently depleted (some may know that some of the most valuable resources on the planet are currently being mined in Africa, although saying it's necessarily a better system today is debatable when you look at some examples), and the colonials leaving often made a mess of things too. Whether that was the colonials fault or not varies, but is still largely debatable.</p>
<p>Would it have been right for them to refuse to immediately pull out of some of the countries they did so too? Which they did because they were asked/told to, even though it almost invariably led to economic a structural collapse. What about when the native is Papua New Guinea destroyed what would have been the most profitable sugar cane industry in the world because the colonials had built it?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first you need to understand that you’re asking a question about international macroeconomics and development. These are subjects that economists do not understand particularly well. Development economics is a field where a lot of smart people do a lot of good work, but it’s also a field where it’s basically impossible to prove anything. </p>
<p>One theory is the impact of climate on capital depreciation. If hurricanes or whatever are a regular problem, then buildings and roads are not going to last very long. The problem with this theory is that economists are not engineers or climate scientists, and it’s very difficult to measure levels of capital (which is a requirement for good studies). </p>
<p>Another theory is tropical diseases. If you take as a starting position that Europe is good and civilized and that Europeans make things develop, then you can compare countries where European colonists mostly died out, countries where European colonists took stuff but didn’t settle, and countries where Europeans successfully settled. There’s a not horrible correlation for this theory, but it’s basically impossible to prove. </p>
<p>A related theory is “institutions,” in that poor countries are poor because they don’t have good “institutions”. Basically impossible to prove, disprove, or even really measure. </p>
<p>Another theory is that the international trade and monetary systems are bad for development. There are economists who have strong views that this isn’t true; however this is a theoretical argument and not an empirical argument.</p>
<p>Basically, economists do not know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are dozens of theories and none of them are definitive or well supported. The eli5 is that no one really knows for sure but im sure that isnt satisfactory. Underdevelopment was my area of focus for undergrad. One theory I subscribe to at least partially is the Dutch curse, or the paradox of plenty, essentially starting at colonialism (how colonialism was possible is so complex its an entirely different subject.) countries rich in resources, especially tropical places able to grow sugar, were colonized and enslaved. This process, prevented the accumulation of wealth and made those areas poor despite an abundance of resources. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
