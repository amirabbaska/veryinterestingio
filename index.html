		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is kind of quirky way to ask the question.  I would phrase it as &quot;Why is the government more willing to help get me a 100K for a student loan than 100K loan to start a business?&quot;  That is because the government does not provide loans to individuals, just guarantees to lender on behalf of private borrowers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Slower Escalation</strong> A typical business is going to need most or all of that 100K upfront, while a college student will get it over time.  Because it takes time, if you are not fit for the degree you are more likely to drop out before you ever get remotely close to the 100 K amount. </li>
<li><strong>Student Loans are Self Sorting</strong>  Racking up 100K in student loans is not easy.  To get that much in debt you likely went to an excellent school, you are close to graduating from college, or you are working on a post graduate degree.  You would not be in that school or graduate program unless you were already a well above average person.  If youare asking for 100K in student loans, I know you have already jumped through a lot of evaluation and passed it to reach the point that you can ask for it.  </li>
<li><strong>Business Loans Require a LOT of Customization</strong>  As someone who worked as credit analyst of small businesses at a community bank, I can tell you that a small time business loan involves a lot of custom agreements and custom evaluation.  So for every business loan the lender is going to have evaluate it and assure to the government that it will be repaid for the loan to promote the economy as intended.</li>
<li><strong>College Education has Great Returns</strong> On average a 4 year degree earned at age 22 has something the realm of a 12% return.  That is more than enough to cover the interest on a loan.  Additionally College Education has a host of non-monetary benefits to them and society.  College educated people tend to have better health, better child rearing, and more stable income.  That means that government has to spend less on medicare, less on crime, and less on welfare programs.  So a college education pays for itself, increases taxes, and reduces government expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Public Assistance is not necessary to insure the creation of a market.</strong>  For a loan to be worthwhile to make it has to be repaid.  And for a lender to borrow, they have to prove that they can repay a loan.  If you could prove to the government you could repay your business loan, you could prove to a bank that you could repay your business loan.  The government has no role in this market.  But what sucks about education is that while it has great a rate of return for the recipient and society, for it to be worthwhile you have make the loan to people who have been adults for just a few months or years.  These people have no way of proving that they have a good plan for how they will use the funds. Plus part of the process of going to college is figuring out what you are good at.  </li>
<li><strong>Business Loans do not have a clear link to a better society</strong>  In general there is no guarantee of external benefits (benefits that go to someone else) from a business like with college education.  This is why when the government does guarantee loans it is because it perceives a way to benefit society as whole with them.  Like for example, home loans allow people to buy homes.  These homes provide people with equity and more stability.  This reduces their burden on welfare programs and makes them more invested in their communities (in theory).  The agenda of a government loan program is make sure more loans of a beneficial type are provided more than the market would normally want to provide.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>EDIT 1:  Some people have correctly pointed out that some government agencies do make loans directly and that is how they do it since I taught a class on this subject.  </p>
<p>But they are only technically correct (the best kind of correct).  Most of these agencies will bundle the loans into a ABS or similar security and sell it in the private market.  At the end of the day the government is not the ultimate lender, just a conduit that provides a guarantee.  From a economic point of view, it doesn't really matter where the guarantee comes in the funding stream, just that it happens.  The effect is the same.  The government is guaranteeing your loan to the ultimate lender.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, a college education is seen as more beneficial to society in general, regardless of whether or not you end up getting a career in your field. Knowledge is good! There's also the fact that the vast majority of businesses fail within the first few years - and it takes a ton of knowledge (usually learned in school) to successfully run a business, not to mention a solid plan, good market research, a service or product people both need and want to buy, and a bit of luck.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you take out a 100k student loan, even if you don't get a career in your field there's a high likelihood you'll be able to pay back at least some of the loan. If you get paid 100k to start a small business and that business dies after a year, all of a sudden you have nothing to show for it at all and possibly will declare bankruptcy, costing the government even more money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A student loan is a double investment to government. There is interest paid back on the loan and you are more employable in the workforce and will have a greater economic benefit to the country. For the US this applies world wide as their tax laws apply to citizens anywhere.</p>
<p>A business is riskier. The government is more likely to give money to a business than a bank, but it's more likely given as grants than loans and it's still not easy. Most businesses fail in the first few years and they need the 100k usually during start up. Student loans are given out on a per semester basis, spreading it out over years. So a student who drops out after a year will have had less investment from the gov't than a full graduate, the longer you're in school, the more employable you are. A business that fails will have a far larger debt burden due to startup costs and will no longer be contributing to the economy.</p>
<p>Finally you have elections. You'll get far more votes from parents and newly voting students by helping them out than refusing. Which is why it's hard to declare bankruptcy from a student loan, because there needed to be more security in the programs so the election promised could be kept.</p>
<p>Canada had a situation in 2000 where the banks used to handle student loans with gov't guaranteeing them, but they would no longer agree to that risk. Knowing that ending or substantially changing the student loan program would be political suicide, the gov't took over the program entirely which allowed them to completely eliminate the ability to discharge a student loan through bankruptcy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy lawyer here. The answer has been stated herein by others, but it bears repeating. Federally backed student loans are an explicit exception to discharge within the Bankruptcy Code. The Brunner Test has developed to determine whether undue hardship exists that should justify the discharge of other student loans, but these are typically privately held student loans, not federally backed. On the other hand, go set up an LLC, borrow a bunch of cash, personally guarantee it, default on the note, liquidate the business and give all proceeds to the lender, then file a chapter 7 and you are off and down the road to start your next venture. The treatment in bankruptcy is where the answer lies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) the singularity is not a 0-dimensional point. That's true of non-rotating black holes. Rotating black holes probably don't even have a singularity (aka as ringularity since it would be a ring) even at a semi-classical level: the singularity lies in an interior region of the solution which we know cannot be trusted to model actual rotating black holes.</p>
<p>2) the singularity does not &quot;carry&quot; or &quot;hold&quot; the properties of the black hole such as the mass, the linear and angular momentum, the charge... it will just lead to confusion to think in these terms. How/where exactly a black hole &quot;keeps&quot; these things is a subtle and counterintuitive matter. </p>
<p>The technical answer is these properties are sort of &quot;delocalized&quot; in the case of a black hole and the black hole itself is essentially a type of topological defect. That would be a very agnostic, strictly classical answer. But that's close to impossible to explain for me.</p>
<p>A simple, bizzarre and not really that wrong at all way to imagine a black hole is as a very thin 2-dimensional membrane lying above the horizon. This membrane is hot and has energy, so mass; when stuff falls in it gets burnt by the membrane and adds to its energy/mass. When charges fall onto the membrane, the membrane (which has a sort of electrical conductivity) absorbs and dissolves charges and become charged itself. And finally, it can acquire linear or angular momentum when it's provided by falling objects, and can start moving, or rotating (and become flattened). This is a quantum-gravity- (and string-theory-) inspired picture, but for what regards classical gravitation it gives the same answers as the &quot;standard&quot; one, and might help clarify a lot of the trickiness of black holes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Meaning if something falls into the event horizon, if we could see inside, from our point of view theoretically it should never reach the singularity. </p>
<p>Imagine the ship in interstellar that goes to the planet where 1 hour there is 7 years on Earth. </p>
<p>Ok, imagine it goes a bunch closer to the black hole. So 1 hour = 70 years on earth. </p>
<p>Now, imagine it keeps going closer, </p>
<p>it will hit 1 hour on the ship = 700 years
1 hour on the ship = 7000 years
1 hour on the ship = 70000 years</p>

<p>From the point of view of an observer outside of the event horizon the behavior can be totally different from the point of view from inside the event horizon. The black hole may have a singularity by it's own internal math and view point - but from our point of view outside it doesn't seem to me like it can have a singularity. </p>
<p>It's called a dual nature. Anything infinitely displaced by relativity aught to have a dual nature. Light is another example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Black Holes are not necessarily singularities. We know that an event horizon is where the escape velocity reaches the speed of light. That's pretty much it. The rest is theory, some of it very well reasoned, but we can't really verify any of it experimentally (although we can verify other parts of those theories in certain ways, such as at the LHC). That does not necessarily mean there is no internal structure.</p>
<p>For one, spacetime itself could retain some sort of structure as we do not know what happens to it in such a situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more interesting, is that if matter has structure below the quark, or perhaps at a scale below the Planck length, then it's possible there are iterations of black holes. Let me elaborate:</p>
<p>Neutron stars are extremely dense objects made when the &quot;pressure&quot; becomes enough to crush electrons and protons together. Then they are held apart by neutron degeneracy pressure (again, not really pressure but an outward force resisting gravity). When/if the gravity becomes strong enough the neutron star can then collapse further.</p>
<p>The main idea seems to be that neutron stars collapse into black holes. Pulsars (a type of neutron star) can occasionally spin so fast they resist collapse until their spin slows down enough, we think. This does not mean they collapse into a singularity; there is no complete explanation for exactly what happens at this point.</p>
<p>Another thought is that the step beyond neutron stars is a quark star, which would be incredibly dense (10cm across or so).</p>
<p>I wonder if maybe quark stars aren't a type of black hole, or perhaps matter has structure more fundamental than quarks and will resist being crushed at a certain point. We simply do not know so it's all speculation.</p>
<p>I do find it interesting, however, that the external effects of a stellar-mass black hole and a supermassive black hole are generally the same if radically different in scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The principles behind pulse oximetry are some of the required knowledge for basic anaesthetic trainees.
As has been outlined, the pulse oximeter uses two wavelengths of light: 660nm (red light) and 940nm (infrared light). These lights correspond to the maximum absorption by deoxygenated haemoglobin and oxygenated haemoglobin respectively. This light shines through a finger, toe, lip, ear (and sometimes hands and feet for neonates) and is picked up by a detector on the contralateral side of the probe. The ratio between the two wavelengths that is transmitted gives an R value (Red/Infared) which corresponds to an oxygen saturation. An R value of 1 is equal to roughly 80% SpO2. Oxygenated blood absorbs more infrared light and deoxygenated blood absorbs more red light.
I hope that explanation helps a bit. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095461111300053X" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=332" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple of articles that explains the science and limitations of oximetry in more detail. Thanks for letting me answer.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The instrument that reads the oxygen levels of your blood (referred to as SpO2) is called a pulse oximeter. It shines different wavelengths of light (usually IR and red) through your finger to find how oxygenated your blood is. How does it do this? Hemaglobin, which is the protein in your red blood cells that binds oxygen and takes it to your cells, can absorb light (like most materials). How much light it can absorb depends on the wavelength of light shining on it and whether the hemaglobin is holding oxygen or not. A sensor on the other side of your finger (a fancy lil thing called a photodiode) will detect how much light makes it through your finger. Plug these absorption values into an equation and you can figure out how much of your hemaglobin has oxygen in it. Hopefully if you're healthy it will be between 95-100%, although 100% SpO2 is not that common. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biomedical engineer. Everyone correctly describes that light of 2 specific wavelengths is shone through the finger. The amount of light absorbed by deoxy and oxygenated blood is different. The relationship between the amount of absorbance is measured and this provides the oxygen saturation levels.</p>
<p>However, the amount of light absorbance isn't directly related to the O2 level. Instead, there have been data tables created that relate the O2 levels to the light absorbance... this was done EMPIRICALLY, i.e. by experiment, and not by theory. So the device is just correlating the light information to pre-programmed data table relationships. The relationship breaks down somewhere around 80% and below, and thus the pulse oximeter can no longer properly measure oxygen levels below this percentage. Regardless, the device would have started beeping an alert by then anyway. </p>

As meat ages it turns brown from oxidation. The oxidation process is a result of the bound iron molecule in myoglobin going from the ferrous to ferric form. This produces what is called metmyoglobin.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you're 'overriding' the automatic system in your brains that regulates your breathing pattern. Breathing has 2 components: autonomic control and plain physics. The autonomic control center regulates your breathing frequency/intensity depending on CO2 levels in your blood by stimulating your breathing muscles in a very efficient way, taking maximum advantage of the physics of airflow. When you're breathing manually, you interrupt the respiratory center and you have to force the breathing muscles to contract by yourself</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can split up all the things a person can do in to two groups, things that happen unconsciously no matter what, and thing you can <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2017/01/probable-facts-about-human-consciousness.html" target="_blank">choose to override consciously</a>. Things like your heart beat, your internal temp and dozens of other things are always out of conscious control, they're going to happen no matter what. Then there's things that you can do - walk, talk, even drive a car, that you mostly do without thinking about it, but you can override by consciously thinking about it. Breathing is one of these things, it'll happen unconsciously if you don't think about it, but it's technically possible to stop yourself breathing long enough to pass out. Of course you'll start breathing again as soon as you're unconscious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a psych paper while an undergrad and was hoping to find the answer there. What I did uncover was that it was actually the reverse around the 1920's but have no clue to  why it changed. </p>
<p>&quot;The definition of masculinity and femininity is inherited by the generation of that time and is manifested by the attire of infants (Maglaty, 2011). In a June 1918 article of the trade publication Earnshaw’s Infants Department it dictated that the “generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls.&quot; The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.” In the current 21rst century Infants whose sex is ambiguous are identified by the colors of their attire it is common knowledge that pink is for girls and blue is for boys (Ben, 2007).&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah I definitely stop caring when writing this paragraph. Sorry OP</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><del>It's pretty recent (1940's) and I'm unable to find any credible explanation.</del>  </p>
<p><del><em>The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink , being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.</em> (1918 edition of the trade publication Earnshaw’s Infants’ Department)</del>  </p>
<p><del>In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart highlighting gender-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. retailers. Filene’s (in Boston), Best &amp; Co. (in New York City), Halle’s (in Cleveland), and Marshall Field (in Chicago) all advised parents to dress boys in pink and girls in blue.</del>   </p>
<p>Regardless of color, in both cases, they wore dresses.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially related is that it was usual to dress boys and girls in what today would be considered feminine clothing up to a certain age, maybe 3 or 4. I don't know if throughout Europe but I think this was true in England and USA at least in certain circles.</p>
<p>I think this practice did not stop until the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Relationship to OP is that male/female colors would not have been a thing then, either probably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
