		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger mammals (or even animals) in general don't subsist on insects. There are some exceptions like aardvarks but most things over a certain size tend to shift diets in order to help feed them. </p>
<p>Our ancestors as well as close relatives are no different. They largely subsist on fruits (and sometimes meat), they do eat some insects like ants and grubs but as a more opportunistic form of protein. </p>
<p>And humans are not so different. There are plenty of humans (often tribal) that will eat insects and grubs but not as primary sustenance though. </p>
<p>As for why it's not that common in more developed human society that can be due to lots of factors. First as i mentioned bugs were not a large part of our diet (meats fruits veggies were) and some humans would live in areas where bugs wouldn't be that abundant anyway. As such we don't have that much of a natural taste for them (not to mention some would likely be outright nasty like stinkbugs) </p>
<p>Moving on past the agricultural revolution people were working on plants and for protein domesticating animals. I imagine it's much easier to keep a few ungulates around in varied conditions and terrain than trying to farm insects in a hole or a hide sack, also there would be other benefits to animals like milk, eggs, leather, feathers, bone, labor, etc none of which the insects would provide.  So we never really had a history of trying to farm them, and if we aren't farming it likely we aren't eating it. </p>
<p>the final piece is disgust. Even early on grubs and other maggot type creatures would be associated with rot, bad grain etc. Insects like locust associated with plague or godly wrath. Further up the timeline just filth in general (like cockroaches and trash).  Sure farm animals are dirty but a pig in mud is a different dirty than the association of filth and insects. So over time we develop a cultural disgust for the creatures and that certainly inhibits our appetite for them.  as Jules would say, &quot;Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know 'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My wife loves them. I'm not opposed to eating them as long as they are spiced up.</p>
<p>Western cultures are more averse to the idea of eating bugs for protein. This probably has a lot to do with the massive meat industries in a lot of western cultures. </p>
<p>In the US, pork, chicken, and beef are cheap and plentiful. So, it would seem very odd to eat bugs for protein when other meats are so plentiful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had a few different types of insects. Dry roasted and salted meal worms are acceptable to a western palate and a good place to start out. It's somewhere in between roasted peanuts and regular salted potato chips in taste. It's a safe route for a positive first experience eating insects. Chocolate covered ants are pretty safe too but a bit of a cop out because it's much more so chocolate than ant. I've read arguments that insects are a much more sustainable source of animal protein than traditional live stock. The amount of input cost and space required to produce a kilo of insects is dramatically lower than the costs of producing a kilo of large mammal flesh. It's my understanding that the protein content per kilogram is also higher in the insects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these comments are probably wrong. Depending on what's in your freezer exactly, and when it was put in there, it shouldn't have viable preexisting eggs or larvae.</p>
<p>The blast-freezing process brings things to a temperature that kills most fly eggs, basically absolutely any that you're going to encounter. And without the blast freezing process, eggs on the surface of food (which is where most flies lay their eggs) will become nonviable in just a few days, max. If frozen slowly, the water in the egg will crystalize and rupture the egg.</p>
<p>Everything you buy in the freezer isle is blast frozen (Edit: OK, <em>Almost</em> everything). All meat that you buy with the exception of fresh-shellfish is most likely going to be egg free. And shellfish-bourne eggs don't turn in to flies, they turn into worms and other parasites. Flies generally don't lay eggs on unripe fruit. They lay eggs on wet stuff. There are exceptions, like the fig wasp, that inject eggs. But these insects need more unripe fruit to successfully have multiple generations, which wouldn't be the case here. I'm guessing OP is dealing with some sort of blowfly larva like the common house-fly.</p>
<p>Flies are very good at detecting the chemicals released as food spoils. As food spoils, it &quot;outgasses&quot;. Solids and liquids are transformed by microorganisms into gasses. These gasses take up a much greater volume than the liquid and solid precursors. This puts pressure on the magnetically sealed door. This causes your freezer to begin to &quot;burp&quot; out these fly friendly gasses. Depending on the setup, there's a decent chance that the door will open and remain open. Regardless, fly noses act like leak-detectors on your fridge. They will find small cracks, and they will gleefully sneak through failed U-traps. Food in ziplock-bags will liquify, burst, and spill all over the freezer floor, weakening the magnetic seals, and luring flies to lay eggs right on the seal, allowing larvae to crawl in the direction of the scent.</p>
<p>A couple years back, I had a fruit-fly infestation that got rather bad.  My freezer was new and in good working order. Fruit flies <em>obviously</em> are not going to be able to breed inside. But they are able to crawl inside, freeze, and die.</p>
<p>In my case, fruit-flies were likely going in the ice-dispenser, because that's where the largest collection of them were found. It has an inner funnel that is pushed up against the ice reservoir to work. They were trapped in that cold funnel region. The flap-gate on the ice-dispenser is not nearly as strong of a seal as the door seal. If you have an ice-dispenser, that's likely how they got in.</p>
<p>The only way it would be brought-in fly eggs would be if you froze some leftovers that a fly had time to lay eggs upon (this only takes seconds) and you did that like the same day the freezer failed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, most of the posters here are <em>probably</em> wrong about the insect eggs.  Flies that lay eggs that create meat-eating maggots do not lay their eggs randomly about.  They only lay their eggs on rotting flesh.  They would not have been randomly mixed in your produce.  They also don't just a lay a few eggs that are hard to miss.  They lay a small pocket of hundreds of eggs and you would <a href="http://justbajan.com/health/articles/flyeggs/eggs1.jpg" target="_blank"><em>probably</em> notice them if they were a frequent occurrence on food.</a></p>
<p>Second, most of the <em>other</em> posters here are probably right in that your fridge is not as air tight as it may otherwise seem.  Their reasons as to how the flies may have gotten in are reasonable.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should consider how a fridge door seal works.  When you close the door and the seal collapses a bit, you are forcing a little more air out.  When the door rebounds a bit as the seal uncompressed you generate a little bit of lower pressure inside the fridge as compared to the outside environment.  You can test this with a well-sealed freezer like a chest freezer.  You can feel the air squeeze out on shutting, and if you have a good seal it is harder to open back up than just the weight of the lid.  It's actually progressively harder to open the door up until the point the seal fails, since you are creating additional volume inside the fridge by lifting the door while the seal is intact and the pressure lowers until the seal fails.  </p>
<p>Also adding to this phenomena is that any room temperature air that entered the freezer will cool, shirking its partial pressure and further helping to hold the door shut.</p>
<p>Now, consider what happens when food (in the absence of insects for now) begins to rot.  That rot is caused by bacteria and fungus eating your food. And what happens when bacteria eat?  I mean other than your food spoiling?  They poop out CO2, methane, and other gases.</p>
<p>If that builds up it can overcome the slightly lower pressure otherwise enjoyed by the interior and force the door deal to fail, providing an egress for the trapped gases inside.</p>
<p>Once those gases are free it's like a massive neon sign to critters that feed on rot.  And they are very, very good at finding where such gases are leaking from, and are pretty determined little critters about finding a way to worm inside and fulfill their biological imperatives.</p>
<p>TL;DR - fridges are very good about keeping outside air out when cool &amp; running.  They are not so good at keeping inside air in when temperatures equalize to the outside environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Replying as I have also been a victim of the same science experiment: I came back from 10 weeks in Europe to a refrigerator/freezer mildew and maggot cesspool.</p>
<p>My supposition at the time was as follows:
As the frozen goods in the freezer above thawed and began to spoil, the resulting sludge began to pool along the door seal. As the bacteria pool continued to cook and develop, the air heated and expanded enough to allow the sludge to begin to leak out and down toward the refrigerator seam. As the seal was now open enough to allow fluid to seep out, small insects found a path into the freezer area.<br />
The comments here about eggs already existing in the goods makes reasonable sense, but all of the items in my freezer were pre-packaged, due to my bachelor status. Having witnessed how much the seals had been distended due to the mildew growth, I am more inclined to think the bugs came in after the seals had blown.  </p>
<p>By the time I arrived home, I can only guess that weeks and probably months had passed. Both compartments were dark brown, bison-level fuzzy, and three levels beyond pungent. (Note that I have had to remove possessions from a car whence someone was shot to death, that had then sat in a sunny police impound lot for two days, and this refrigerator stench was actually worse.)<br />
I did try to clean the refrigerator for a couple of hours before realizing that the stench I was failing to get out of the main compartments had most assuredly gotten deeper into the appliance, and that it was a total write-off.<br />
Called the sanitation department for a heavy-item removal, and bought a new one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hydrostatic pressure depends only on the depth. So the pressure is the same in all of your scenarios. This is not in contradiction to the description of hydrostatic pressure arising from the weight of water above you.</p>
<p>Quick and dirty calculation: pressure <em>p</em> is force per unit area, hence it is the weight of a given column of water above some fixed area divided by that fixed area. Hence <em>p</em> = mg/A = ϱgV/A = ϱgAh/A = ϱgh. (Here ϱ = density of water, g = acceleration due to gravity.) So we see that the pressure at depth <em>h</em> is <em>p</em> = ϱgh, and this depends only on <em>h</em>, not on the total mass or total volume.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SZpcw8S.gif" target="_blank">Here is a picture</a>. Yes, only the depth matters. All of the questions of the ilk &quot;what if I made a container in this shape or that shape, or what about this?&quot; can all be answered by &quot;only the depth matters&quot;. It may seem non-intuitive, but that's the answer.</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> the difference between the containers? Does it affect <em>anything</em>? Yes, of course. The <em>total force</em> on the walls of the container will depend on the cross-sectional area.</p>
<p>For example, consider two identical right circular cones (base radius <em>R</em> and total height <em>H</em>), which are each filled with water. One cone is inverted (so the tip is on the bottom) and the the other cone is upright (so the tip is on top). To lighten up notation later, note that the total mass of water in each cone is the same and given by <em>M</em> = πϱR^(2)H/3.</p>
<p>(I should also mention that since force is a vector, the calculation below is not really the net force. In fact, the net force on both cones is <strong>0</strong>. What I am really calculating is the total hoop stress on the cones. What's important is not really the net force vector, but how these force vectors give rise to different strains.)</p>
<p>The (gauge) pressure at the bottom of each cone is the same; it's just *p*<em><em>bottom</em></em> = ϱg<em>H</em>. The total stress on the walls of each cone, however, are not the same. They are, respectively for the upright and inverted cone,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*F*<em><em>upright</em></em> = 2Mg*(H/R)</p>
<p>*F*<em><em>inverted</em></em> = Mg*(H/R)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the total stress on the walls of the upright cone is <em>twice</em> the total stress on the walls of the inverted cone. Why? More of the upright cone lies at a larger depth. This is why dams are thicker at the bottom. Since the pressure increases with depth, the lower part of the dam feels more force than the upper part of the dam. So the lower part of the dam has to be stronger to compensate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart is able to produce new myocardial cells only up to a few days post partum. Cardiac growth in adults happens due to enlargement of existing cardiac cells and to some extent hyperplasia of non-muscle cells (connective tissue cells).
The first measurable change in a cardiac cell under increased workload is the increase in mRNA coding for structural proteins. The cells also increase their mitochondrial mass. These two mechanisms only happen during the development of hypertrophy and are normalized when hypertrophy fully develops. Only permanent changes in the cardiac cells are the increase in cell volume (width and length) and rearrangement of cellular structural proteins (myofibrillar changes).
The exact mechanism of cardiac cell growth also depends on the type of stimulus. When the primary stimulus to hypertrophy is a sudden increase in systolic pressure  the main mechanism is the parallel replication of sarcomeres (proteins responsible for contraction). There are also a couple of nonmechanical stimuli that promote cardiac hypertrophy: the renin-angiotensin system and something that is probably more important in cardio exercise: circulating cathecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Left ventricular hypertrophy which is the growth of the left ventricle can happen from having a very trained body as well. Many pro cyclists and endurance athletes have this, it reduces work capacity due to the hearts overall efficiency. A reason why endurance athletes have crazy low heart rates, the heart is just that efficient at pumping blood.</p>
<p>Now cardiomyopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy can also happen from years of steroid use coupled with heavy lifting, this is a permanent condition that compromises the overall function of the heart. Your ejection fraction which is the pumping ability essentially decreases, thus compromising your heart and essentially being a cause of death sometimes. This can also happen to obese especially those prone to it genetically, but more common in steroid users.  </p>
<p>Since all steroids essentially cause an erythropeitic response in the blood, which is a signaling of red blood cell production from the kidneys, causing blood to get thicker. This definitely plays a role in the pressure it adds to the arterial lining from elevated blood pressure. Some guys take such high doses for so many years that the androgens cause the heart to grow in itself on top of blood pressure issues.</p>
<p>An athletic ventricle hypertrophy is different because the changes are not permanent to the heart and often reverses once the athlete starts training. </p>
<p>This is kind of the gist of it, I'm starting to rant I guess. Hopefully someone much smarter can chime in.</p>

When you do cardio, the fact that you increase your heart rate (to pump adequate blood/oxygen to your muscles) means your heart muscles expand and contract more effectively. After consistent cardio training, your heart will be able to expand more, and contract stronger. They become more flexible as well as stronger</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually hare is why:
The old rotary dial phones used to actually send the dialing sequence by a series of pulses that are generated when the dial RETURNS TO POSITION known as back spin. </p>
<p>Because the backspin actually dialed the number, the switching equipment was sitting idle waiting for that back spin.
Back then the the way the system worked was that the SECOND  number you dialed told the equipment whether it was a local or long distance call</p>
<p>If the SECOND number was a 1 or 0 the system read it as a long distance call Otherwise it saw local call. </p>
<p>So as a result all area codes at the time had to have the second digit being a 1 or a 0. </p>
<p>Only once those numbers started to run out in the 1990s the new all digital system was put into place and  we could have area codes like 757 242 434 540 etc.It also opened up things like 303 and 314 to be local numbers not possible before.</p>
<p>In order to manage the long distance switching equipment and get it operating as efficiently as possible the Bell System did some research when the system for dialing your own long distance calls was being designed they tried to figure out which parts of the country would make the most and the least long distance calls.</p>
<p>The places that were determined to likely get  the most long distance calls were given the area codes that would have the shortest &quot;back spin&quot; times and therefor kept the equipment sitting idle as short a time as possible</p>
<p>As a result NYC got 212 which generated the shortest back spin time possible 213 was still very good so LA got that one sticking San Diego with 609.</p>
<p>The entire state of Hawaii has 808  before it even had statehood</p>
<p>North Carolina  at the time was 919 Virginia 703 etc </p>
<p>But they didn't get that many long distance calls</p>
<p>So that's the reason.</p>
<p>I am not at all convinced that the Bell System was even capable of allowing anything to happen totally at random. It was not their culture at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been metioned previously, Pangaea is merely the most recent supercontinent on our planet. Continents have continuously come together through earth's history due to mid-ocean ridge spreading only for a mantle plume driven hot spot to cause active rifting later on and split them apart again. The most recent example before Pangaea is Rodinia. There's a wealth of information out there on that through wikipedia and other sources.</p>
<p>When I was doing my undergrad I had access behing the paywall for <a href="https://deeptimemaps.com/" target="_blank">This website</a> which took the clock back much further into the Archean. In lieu of that information, you might find the more recent breakdown of the last ~650 million years worth of surficial evolution of our planet interesting available <a href="http://www.scotese.com/earth.htm" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>
<p>How do we know so much about this evolution in such distant past? There are a bunch of clues hidden in the rocks that we can observe and (in the spirit of good geology) interpret to fill in the missing information. Things such as fossil assemblages and sedimentary load in the rock can tell us about the paleoclimate and thus the relative location this plate existed at when deposited. We can also track collisions between continental plates and other objects (other plates/volcanic arcs/other terranes) based on the resulting composition and alteration of the continental rock, along with anomalous sources of sediments showing up in our sedimentary record. Hope this helps answer your question a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It happens irregularly, every 100 thousand to one million years or so.  As the mid-Atlantic ridge is formed, it is super hot and thus any magnetic domains in the iron in the rocks is absent (hot iron is not magnetic).  But as it cools it acquires the same magnetic orientation as the earth.  We've mapped out the magnetic field of the crust and the floor of the Atlantic ocean reverses every so often.</p>
<p>These magnetic &quot;fingerprints&quot; can be found in other places where hot iron cools, such as in lava events.  However, the ocean floor spreading is the most dramatic.</p>

<p>Main reason: In Europe, we remove and recycle the old paving before adding new pavement (sometimes the one just removed, mixed with more bitumen), which is usually not don in the US. By having higher curbs, you can repave more times before you need to adjust the curb or remove old pavements.</p>
<p>Secondary reason: The low curbs are much more wheel chair friendly. With high curbs, you need ramps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If I step out of my office to grab lunch, I might walk in the sun and feel a little sweaty, I might get caught in the wind and feel a little mussed, I might eat a big greasy lunch and then feel gross about it. Because I FEEL windswept and uncomfortably full, if I look in the mirror, that will be reflected. I'll think I'm fatter, I'll be frustrated that my hair isn't cooperating, or embarrassed that I'm hot and sweaty. But the truth is, no one else in my office knows that I was in the wind or I ate too many fries. As far as they're concerned, I walked out and then walked back in a little later, as people do in offices. They didn't experience any of the external factors that are currently making me feel different than I did an hour ago. </p>
<p>The woman who sits at the desk across from me just cam back from the bathroom. She might have started her period and be totally uncomfortable and in pain. She might have read an email while sitting there and gotten some great news. She might have suddenly realized she wore different shoes than she meant to and her outfit is way off. Her entire state of mind could have totally shifted while she was gone, but I'd have no fucking idea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The comments here are facinating to me. This is awesome stuff! I've always wondered how people saw themselves but was too awkward to ask.</p>
<p>I see myself in the mirror but have never gotten an 'impression' that that image is 'me'. I've never been good at explaining this, not even to my wife who I have talked about this with a few times. I can't make 'me' out in the mirror. Like I'll see a picture of myself, I'll be able to tell it's me because of the clothes and that I remember taking the picture, but that person looks kind of like a ... I don't know, like a place-holder? I don't know how to explain that feeling. It's not an imposter image, or even that I'm 'face-blind' to myself. I just don't put the eyes, ears, nose into a familiar group, like I would with other faces (I'm guessing here)</p>
<p>So when I read the comments and hear people talking about how they see themselves as 'tired', 'full', or 'glowing' I'm fascinated. I know what i feels like to feel tired, full, or glow..but I've never seen it in the 'me' in the mirror or a picture. I can put those impressions on others that I see but my own image seems greasy or frictionless, nothing sticks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably a generalization of The Illusion of Asymmetric Insight. We view ourselves as complex persons with unique inner turmoil and motivations, but think of others as simple creatures with broad-stroke opinions and motives.</p>
<p>The same things probably apply to our physical view of others. We look deeply at our own face but gloss over the mere presences of others most of the time.</p>
<p>Then we have Dunbar's Number, the genetically dictated limit on the mamalian brain as to how many peers the brain can handle as &quot;real individuals&quot;. Dunbar's Number for humans is about 150. When you meet someone new, when they transition from &quot;some guy in accounting&quot; to &quot;Bob, who helps me with the department budget&quot; they bump someone else out of the cache of real humans in your brain. When Bob becomes Bob, someone who used to be Terry becomes &quot;one of the guys I went to school with&quot;.</p>
<p>The meat in your head has practical limits, and there are more people on earth than there are slots in your brain.</p>
<p>Largely because you couldn't function if you had to give full and nuanced attention to every person you encountered day and night. Nobody's got time or emotional capacity for that.</p>
<p>So particularly when dealing with hundreds or thousands of people, we just use a mosaic of hair color, eye color, nose-size, sexual availability, and like/dislike metrics.</p>
<p>This modeling is the real, true, and correct definition of Stereotype.</p>
<p>Now don't trigger on that word, every non-proper noun is, itself, a stereotype, and society wouldn't function without stereotypes. Teacher, Cop, Waiter, Good Teacher, Bad Cop, Crappy Waiter, &quot;guy&quot;, &quot;girl&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, Pizza Guy, Cashier, Sargent... literally every title, role, and word that isn't a specific name for an individual is a stereotype.</p>
<p>This ability to stereotype is factually what allows civilization to function. We don't have to know every shop-keep in order to go shopping.</p>
<p>In other species where stereotypes have not yet evolved the troupe, tribe, pride, or pod must split when there are more individuals than the Dunbar's Number for the species brain because the individuals just aren't comfortable in a sea of strangers.</p>
<p>But we can live in cities of millions by being able to categorize strangers.</p>
<p>So all these forces are positive adaptations that let you see people in sets of expectations instead of just friend or foe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>The limit on mass arises because stars of greater mass have a higher rate of core energy generation, their luminosity increasing far out of proportion to their mass. For a sufficiently massive star the outward pressure of radiant energy generated by nuclear fusion in the star’s core exceeds the inward pull of its own gravity. This is called the Eddington limit. Beyond this limit, a star ought to push itself apart, or at least shed enough mass to reduce its internal energy generation to a lower, maintainable rate. In theory, a more massive star could not hold itself together because of the mass loss resulting from the outflow of stellar material. In practice the theoretical Eddington Limit must be modified for high luminosity stars and the empirical Humphreys Davidson Limit is derived</p>

Even before they are hot enough in their cores to fuse Hydrogen they are hot enough to shine. The more massive the star is the more extreme this process. However, that heat translates to radiation pressure which can keep additional material from collapsing onto the star and also can drive stellar winds which cause the proto-star to lose mass. It's thought that these processes result in a practical limit somewhere around 150 to 300 or 400 solar masses for star formation. Stars above 150 solar masses are extraordinarily rare and might form through non-standard processes (perhaps involving stellar mergers or some complex process of mass gain after formation).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea that the two sides of the brain handled specific functions was put forth during the time when lobotomies were regularly performed, which wasn't all that long ago. During a lobotomy, a portion of the brain is removed, and the psychologist who performed the surgery would then test his patient with various tasks to see what the effect was. This way, they could see which parts of the brain controlled which functions... sort of.</p>
<p>Later, the corpus callosotomy was figured out, which takes away the corpus callosum, which is the bridge between the two hemispheres of the brain that allows the two sides to communicate. While a very effective treatment for seizures, psychologists also observed some very interesting effects on a person's ability to recognize words and images. One such famous test is here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo</a> , in which a computer monitor is set up and a word or image flashes on one side of the screen or the other. If it flashes on the right, Joe can understand what is being shown. If it flashes on the left, he can't read the text or understand the image, but he is able to draw it. This furthered the idea that each side of the brain functioned in specific ways.</p>
<p>With more advanced imaging and testing equipment, we now know that the entire brain is brought to bear on every task that it handles. A person without a left or right hemisphere can do all of the things a person with a full, healthy brain can do (although much slower and with less acumen). The corpus callosum was discovered to just allow for information to be shared between sides of the brain.</p>
<p>We do know that there are certain areas of the brain that are more active during certain activities, but the entire brain is still active at all times. It functions as a whole, and any damage to any part of the brain can impair all brain function. </p>
<p>We've also discovered no significant physical difference between the brains of top performers. A very talented pianist, for example, does not have more growth or development on one side of the brain, nor is his brain significantly different to a very talented physicist. These tests put to rest the idea that one side of the brain controlled any one given task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I had a brain injury in August,2000,&amp; have every test &amp; procedure done at least twice, as due to the head &amp; neck trauma I received I have extreme migraines all the time- no obvious cause(s) found. I get all of the side effects that come with migraines as well- sensitivity to light, smells &amp; noise. I actually had to move from a city with a population of approx.500,000 to a city with less than 300 so I don't have to hear &quot;normal&quot; sounds like traffic, sirens, trains, etc. And forget ever going to a movie or concert. I also have basically no appetite at all because i have a nauseous feeling a lot. I get hungry but then when I look at food I'm just like,&quot;ugh.&quot;
I keep up on any &amp; all research in hopes that there will be some kind of breakthrough that I'll be able to participate in before I die at least to help others that come after me with this type of injury. The only thing the doctors can do is control the pain with medication, which sucks for the rest of my body. Before this injury I hardly ever took an aspirin -&amp; now I have to take medication just to function like a human being.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Nor do I care. But I'll tell you something interesting.</p>
<p>It is a model of how the mind works.  Now I am &quot;right brain dominant&quot; as per the model and I used to work tutoring &quot;right brain dominant&quot; kids.  Whatever, that might mean in reality, the model is powerful.How powerful? I was able to develop a 4 hour intervention that would take any motivated kid who was right brain dominant and get him to go from the bottom of his class (where they usually were because school is &quot;left brain dominant&quot; and get them to the top.</p>
<p>Some of you may believe me, some of you may not. I really don't care. But if you understood the subject well enough you could do the same thing too.  So was it their right brain, their left brain, the upper brain their inside brain? Who knows and who cares. The model works. Perhaps we could call it &quot;A dominant&quot; and &quot;B dominant&quot;.</p>
<p>So they may have &quot;debunked&quot; the model technically but did they remember to say &quot;but it's a really, really useful concept because applied it can transform people's lives for the better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, here's a bit. We know that for about 90% of right handed individuals, the more active language centers rest in the left side of the brain. Psycholinguistics spends a lot of time studying the data to support such a claim. With left handed individuals, the percentage drops a bit, with more individuals showing more activity on the right side.</p>
<p>(These are the main language centers, brocas, wernickes, and a few other areas of interest)</p>
<p>We tend to make &quot;claims&quot; about right/left brained individuals, specifically regarding creativity, language, math, music, kinesthetics and balance, spatial reasoning, etc... but the reality is that these things really seem to match up more with fields of sensual focus (sight, sound, touch), which in general are kitty corner (left field, right side of brain).</p>
<p>There's some great neuroscience labs studying unique stuff regarding these questions that you could check out if you're interesting in learning more. Lmk if you are and I can link a few for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
