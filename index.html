		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can be detonated at any height, depending on what whoever planned the attack is trying to achieve. Some factors that would be considered:</p>
<p><strong>Fallout</strong></p>
<p>When a nuclear device detonates, anything within a vaporization radius of the device will be turned to vapor. The vapor of that matter will mix with the vapor of the device debris. That's how you get what's called fallout - various types of matter get mixed in with the highly radioactive device debris, get irradiated by neutron radiation, and can be transmuted into other radioactive elements. The more matter that's in that vaporization radius, the more and more dangerous fallout you get. So detonating high enough that the vaporization radius doesn't touch the ground will minimize fallout, and detonating on or right above the ground will maximize it though vaporizing all of those cubic meters of earth. In most cases, you would prefer to minimize fallout.</p>
<p><strong>Thermal Radiation</strong></p>
<p>This is non-ionizing radiation put out by the bomb, that travels in a straight line, doesn't go through things, and heats up whatever it hits. It can burn people to death, start fires, melt things, etc. If the device detonates too low, buildings and terrain may shield some of the surrounding area from thermal radiation, while a detonation high enough to be above these things will expose more things to it. You detonate low to get the maximum destruction to things very close to the detonation, and detonate higher to spread the destruction out more at the expense of a little less effect right under the bomb. Of course, even the lesser destruction from being under a higher-altitude detonation is more than enough to completely destroy most things.</p>
<p><strong>Blast wave</strong></p>
<p>This is a shock wave of outgoing high-pressure air. It tends to knock down buildings and other structures through high winds and pressure and inflict blast injuries to people. It spreads in a kind of similar way to the thermal radiation, but is more complex due to reflections, interference, air pressure at detonation altitude, and other factors. There's charts for what altitude to detonate at for various effects at various ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Vaporization</strong></p>
<p>Back to the vaporization mentioned in the fallout section. The other side of that is that, if you are attacking a hardened target, like something deep underground or not very affected by heat and blast, like train tracks, etc, it may be necessary to physically vaporize the target to ensure the intended destruction. So back to a ground or near-ground detonation.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>It all depends on exactly what you're trying to attack. Destroying a nuclear missile silo is different from destroying a military base or navy yard, which is different again from going for maximum casualties in a city, and any number of other types of targets one might want to attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main destructive power of a nuclear bomb is not the fireball/explosion, but the pressure wave that follows. Sure the main explosion is destructive, but the pressure wave allows it to destroy an entire city in one blast. By detonating it in the air, the pressure wave reaches much farther than if it was on the ground.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, the height of the detonation influences a number of things, among which the amount of nasties you throw in the athmosphere for the high altitude winds to carry around.<br />
Historically, Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were intended to be a demonstration of sheer power, hence they rigged the devices to explode above the city to maximise directly affected area and flatten the whole area. A ground level explosion would be somewhat shielded by the buildings and would have been even more unpleasant for the people around the impact area, but the outskirts of the city would probably have been fine: also, due to reflection of waves and such, the military has come up with the idea that an air burst actually directs more force sideways instead of wasting it in the ground (see the MOAB for a conventional example).<br />
All other nuclear explosions have been tests and aimed at minimizing unpredictable collateral damage, hence no fallout was wanted</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short Answer -</strong></p>
<p>In a panic that gripped America, marijuana was banned. The U.S. told other countries they had to do the same. Many countries said it was a dumb idea, and refused to do it. Still the majority of the countries kept the decision under the influence of USA and because there was not any other significant study proving otherwise. Although in recent years many countries have allowed the use of  Marijuana legally.</p>
<p><strong>Details -</strong>
In 1929, a man called Harry Anslinger was put in charge of the Department of Prohibition in Washington, D.C. But alcohol prohibition had been a disaster. Gangsters had taken over whole neighborhoods. Alcohol — controlled by criminals — had become even more poisonous.</p>
<p>So alcohol prohibition finally ended — and Harry Anslinger was afraid. He found himself in charge of a huge government department, with nothing for it to do. Up until then, he had said that cannabis was not a problem. It doesn’t harm people, he explained, and “there is no more absurd fallacy” than the idea it makes people violent.</p>
<p>But then — suddenly, when his department needed a new purpose — he announced he had changed his mind.</p>
<p>He explained to the public what would happen if you smoked cannabis.</p>
<p>First, you will fall into “a delirious rage.” Then you will be gripped by “dreams... of an erotic character.” Then you will “lose the power of connected thought.” Finally, you will reach the inevitable end-point: “Insanity.”</p>
<p>Marijuana turns man into a “wild beast.“ If marijuana bumped into Frankenstein’s monster on the stairs, Anslinger warned, the monster would drop dead of fright.</p>
<p>Harry Anslinger became obsessed with one case in particular. In Florida, a boy called Victor Licata hacked his family to death with an axe. Anslinger explained to America: This is what will happen when you smoke “the demon weed.” The case became notorious. The parents of the U.S. were terrified.</p>
<p>What evidence did Harry Anslinger have? It turns out at this time he wrote to the 30 leading scientists on this subject, asking if cannabis was dangerous, and if there should be a ban.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine wrote back and said no.</p>
<p>Anslinger picked out the one scientist who said yes, and presented him to the world. The press — obsessed with Victor Licata’s axe — cheered them on.</p>
<p>In a panic that gripped America, marijuana was banned. The U.S. told other countries they had to do the same. Many countries said it was a dumb idea, and refused to do it. For example, Mexico decided their drug policy should be run by doctors. Their medical advice was that cannabis didn’t cause these problems, and they refused to ban it. The U.S. was furious. Anslinger ordered them to fall into line. The Mexicans held out — until, in the end, the U.S. cut off the supply of all legal painkillers to Mexico. People started to die in agony in their hospitals. So with regret, Mexico sacked the doctor — and launched its own drug war.</p>
<p>“The scientific evidence suggests cannabis is safer than alcohol. Alcohol kills 40,000 people every year in the U.S. Cannabis kills nobody.”</p>
<p>But at home, questions were being asked. A leading American doctor called Michael Ball wrote to Harry Anslinger, puzzled. He explained he had used cannabis as a medical student, and it had only made him sleepy. Maybe cannabis does drive a small number of people crazy, he said — but we need to fund some scientific studies to find out.</p>
<p>Anslinger wrote back firmly. “The marihuana evil can no longer be temporized with,” he explained, and he would fund no independent science. Then, or ever.</p>
<p>For years, doctors kept approaching him with evidence he was wrong, and he began to snap, telling them they were “treading on dangerous ground” and should watch their mouths.</p>
<p><em>Today, most of the world is still living with the ban on cannabis that Harry Anslinger introduced, in the nation-wide panic that followed Victor Licata’s killing spree.</em></p>
<p>But here’s the catch. Years later, somebody went and looked at the psychiatric files for Victor Licata.</p>
<p>It turns out there’s no evidence he ever used cannabis.</p>
<p>He had a lot of mental illness in his family. They had been told a year before he needed to be institutionalized — but they refused. His psychiatrists never even mentioned marijuana in connection to him.</p>
<p>So, does cannabis make people mad?</p>
<p>The former chief advisor on drugs to the British government, David Nutt, explains — if cannabis causes psychosis in a straightforward way, then it would show in a straightforward way.</p>
<p>When cannabis use goes up, psychosis will go up. And when cannabis use goes down psychosis will go down.</p>
<p>So does that happen? We have a lot of data from a lot of countries. And it turns out it doesn’t. For example, in Britain, cannabis use has increased by a factor of about 40 since the 1960s. And rates of psychosis? They have remained steady.</p>
<p>In fact, the scientific evidence suggests cannabis is safer than alcohol. Alcohol kills 40,000 people every year in the U.S. Cannabis kills nobody — although Willie Nelson says a friend of his did once die when a bale of cannabis fell on his head.</p>
<p>This is why, in 2006, a young man in Colorado called Mason Tvert issued a challenge to the then-mayor of Denver and eventual governor, John Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper owned brew-pubs selling alcohol across the state, and it made him rich. But he said cannabis was harmful and had to be banned. So Mason issued him a challenge — to a duel. You bring a crate of booze. I’ll bring a pack of joints. For every hit of booze you take, I’ll take a hit of cannabis. We’ll see who dies first.</p>
<p>It was the ultimate High Noon.</p>
<p>Mason went on to lead the campaign to legalize cannabis in his state. His fellow citizens voted to do it — by 55 percent. Now adults can buy cannabis legally, in licensed stores, where they are taxed—and the money is used to build schools. After a year and a half of seeing this system in practice, support for legalization has risen to 69 percent. And even Governor Hickenlooper has started calling it “common sense.”</p>

<p>How did marijuana become illegal in almost every other country in the world as well?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The United States. They basically went full tyrant on other nations through the UN and a treaty called the Single Convention (in 1961,) which gave aid to countries that fought against all drugs, not just cannabis.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, this hasn't worked.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The irony being that the drug war has fueled an escalating amount of violence and death that could have been avoided if drugs had been legal, taxed and regulated. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The damning evidence is when the CIA used to charter PanAm flights back in the 50's to ship Heroin into the US to fight the sicilian mob (La Costra Nostra and (edit:<del>N'ghedrada</del>)'Ndrangheta) which still exists today.</p>
</li>
<li>Then in the 80's the CIA trafficked cocaine as part of Iran Contra through a rouge DEA agent, Danillo Blandone and his partner, Carlos Meneses, to Freeway Ricky Ross. Ross would sell the cocaine on consignment and the proceeds went back to buying guns and computers for the contra effort in nicaragua. This caused the great Crack Epidemic of the 80's, which, prior to the initiation of the War on Drugs by Nixon in 1971, <strong>drug fueled violent crime was at an all time low.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Over 200,000 Nicaraguans lost their lives during that time. </p>
<p>So yeah, Cannabis became illegal in other countries due to the same reasons the US made it illegal here: Voodoo pharmacology, Racism, and Greed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Simple Answer:</strong></p>
<p>For the same reason that a fired bullet can pass through your body while a rock cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Goldilocks and the Three Bears example of this radiation is too big and slow and this radiation is too small and fast. </p>
<p>Gamma rays, visible light, and radio waves are all examples of electromagnetic radiation, and radio waves are on one end of the spectrum (with a wavelength of meters), gamma rays are on the other end (with a wavelength of about 10-12 meters) and visible light is somewhere in between (with a wavelength of around 5 x 10-7 meters). </p>
<p>Three things happen to EM radiation when it encounters a barrier. It can bounce (reflectance or scattering), pass through (transmittance), or just plain stop (absorbance). </p>
<ul>
<li>The intensity of radiation transmitted depends on several things:</li>
<li>The wavelength of the radiation</li>
<li>The intensity of the radiation hitting the barrier</li>
<li>The chemical composition of the barrier</li>
<li>The physical microstructure of the barrier</li>
<li>The thickness of the barrier</li>
</ul>
<p>Your question has to do with the first point, but keep in mind that powerful enough visible light (many times brighter than sunlight) would be able to pass through the walls of your home so you could see it, and even a weak light can shine through a paper-thin wall or a wall made of glass. </p>
<p>EM waves interact with matter on their own scale of size and time. </p>
<p>The reason why visible light can't travel through walls as easily as gamma rays or radio waves is because, to the visible light, there's something 'there' on a similar scale of length (wavelength) and time (frequency) that the gamma rays are too small and fast to interact with and the radio waves are too large and slow to interact with. </p>
<p>The gamma rays just pass through the spaces between and within atoms and molecules. They're small enough to do that. If your walls were made of pure lead, they'd have a little more trouble. </p>
<p>The radio waves on the other hand are large enough to ignore the walls because they're too thin. But if you've ever tried to listen to a radio in a tunnel or a cave, you know that radio waves have trouble penetrating through meters of earth. </p>
<p>Visible light interacts with many solid materials because the wavelengths are the right size to be scattered by structural elements within those materials like microfibers and cracks and porous spaces. Well-cut glass or diamond don't have these structural elements at this length scale so they look clear unless they're shattered or rough. </p>
<p>So scattering due to physical elements of the right size is a major reason, but another factor contributes too. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radiation interacts electromagnetically.</p>
<p>The more energy the radiation has, the more readily it can electromagnetically interact with materials.</p>
<p>Consider these materials:</p>
<p>Glass &gt; woods &gt; metal</p>
<p>Metal is an electromagnetic conductor, and interacts easily with electromagnetic waves, blocking them. It blocks visible light and radio waves easily.</p>
<p>Glass is a dielectric &quot;insulator&quot;. It doesn't interact and won't block visible light or radio waves.</p>
<p>Wood is mostly a insulator but not entirely. It won't interact with low energy radio waves, but higher energy visible light is enough to enable interaction. So wood can pass radio waves but not visible light.</p>
<p>So the ability to conduct determines the level of energy needed for interaction with the light.</p>
<p>However, once you reach very high energy levels, the wave is so small that it much smaller than an atom (atoms are mostly free space). It cannot interact unless the light particle directly hits a sub atomic component. Hence your can only stop very high energy by a very thick dense material to increase the chance of interaction. This is why x rays can pass through very conductive material including metal. And the only way to stop them is very thick dense matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a chemical point of view:</p>
<p>Although now people tend to use &quot;quantum&quot; to refer to futuristic things such as information teleporting and the next generation of computing, at its most basic level it was used to describe the phenomena of quantization of energy. As I'm sure you're aware, matter is made of molecules, which are stable arrangements of atoms. It turns out that atoms, molecules, and collections of molecules only interact with certain energies; though the energies can sometimes be so close to each other in level that things may seem continuous to our human observations. </p>
<p>Energy includes light, and light of different frequency contains different energy. Energy might go into the translation, rotation, bond vibration, or electronic excitation of a molecule. However, the energies that can go into any of these will always be well defined. Energies that don't fit can't interact and so pass through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Dirt, oil, weld slag, multiple layers of paint, whatever. If you're in an environment where you don't have to worry about that, a complex geometry is fine. But on a factory floor, Phillips or torx can get irreversibly fouled. Allen head screws can be relatively easily cleaned, but the master of this is the shittiest of all screw heads, the flat head. The <em>only</em> tool you need to clear the slot of a flat head screw is the screwdriver you're going to use to unscrew it. No other screw type has that ability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason for the different styles is cost and torque. The slotted head screws are cheap and easy to make. But they're completely useless for powered screwdrivers and you can't put much torque on the screw without it either slipping out or stripping the head (and maring the surface of whatever you're screwing). Phillips screws are self-centering, making powered screwdrivers possible. They're somewhat more expensive to produce than slotted-head. They tend to 'cam-out' easily under torque, making it hard to apply much torque. I've heard they were designed that way to prevent overtightning. However, it's not good for exposed fasteners to look stripped. Robertson-head and allen-head fasteners can handle more torque than phillips-head fasteners, but are more expensive. Because the bottom of the hole is flat (unlike the pointed end of the phillips), there's more contact area and so it's less likely to cam-out. The robertson-head is cheaper than the allen-head, but the allen-head has six points of contact rather than 4, making it less prone to rounding out the hole. The Torx-head fasteners solve the problem of rounding/stripping by having the flat bottom of the robertson/allen that reduces cam-out, but it has much better contact with the driving bit to prevent stripping the head. The points of the 'star' on the driving bit engage the recesses on the screw at nearly right angles, so it has a very positive contact. Torx is becoming more and more popular because of that, particularly in assembly-line work. Because they're less likely than a phillips to be damaged when tightening, the allen (internal hex) heads are often used for exposed ('decorative') fasteners on 'some assembly required' furniture. It's also very cheap to make the allen keys, so they usually include one with the fasteners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sometimes various screws are used for security reasons.

Other screws we don't want them messing with and may use Torx or something more rare.</p>
<p>In fact some companies specialize in making strange screw head shapes purely for security reasons, <a href="http://cdn.clm02.com/ezvivi.com/204050/6359362590222142198612765.jpg" target="_blank">as seen in this chart.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing not mentioned is that some screws (e.g. Robertson) are better for automatic machine use than others. </p>
<p>For machines, it's best if you can load the screw onto the driver, then move the driver into position. But you need a screw that will hold onto the bit well enough to not fall off.</p>
<p>Others have mentioned Phillips bits and cam-out. This is desirable. For example: Drywall installers use special screw guns (and you can get drywall bits for regular drills) that will detatch from the screw at the right install depth. Handy for that application.</p>
<p>By the way, Robertson screws are really friggin awesome. They are just so great to work with in most applications. It's a global tragedy that they never became more widespread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really are a lot of factors, some of them mentioned already, I'll try to explain a few more.</p>
<p>Culturally, there is something in Afghanistan called 'pastunwali' which is a set of rules that are followed by nearly all Afghans. It has many facets, one of them is to welcome and protect visitors. This will come into play later. To really understand the issue in Afghanistan, you have to know the historical connotations to what went on.</p>
<p>So, in the mid 80's, the Russian's were pushed out of Afghanistan. Like many other countries (Britian, and eventually the US) they found that it would just cost too much money to stay. For around 8 years or so, there was somewhat of an ad hoc communist government, although it was limited to really the main cities (Kabul, Jalalbad, Herat, Konduz, Kandahar). The rest of Afghanistan (80-90%) was  run by warlords. To make a long story short, there ended up being two factions. The pro government forces, and the Taliban, which emerged from one of the warlords (Mullah Mohammad Omar). To fight the government, the Taliban needed money and training, and it called upon al Qaeda to do so. </p>
<p>Although they supplied funding and training, Afghanistan became the 'place to jihad', only because at the time, there other place was Chechnya fighting the Russians, and the Russians were using 'scorch earth' policies...which consisted of of carpet bombing whole villages and areas that were deemed enemy terrority. </p>
<p>So, while there was money and training involved, these members of al Qaeda were coming in droves to Afghanistan, but really didn't care about the fight going on. Eventually, the fight became a stalemate, and areas were set up for both sides.... and al Qaeda never left, but after 9/11, there was the cultural practice to protect their 'visitors', which did happen. </p>
<p>Pakistan</p>
<p>While the Afghans do protect their visitors, they are very 'eye for an eye', so after about a month of refusing to turn over Bin Laden, the US just started a bombing campaign, and most Afghans were really ok with it. The majority of al Qaeda was holed up in the Tora Bora mountains, which is in eastern Afghanistan near Jalalabad. (If you're going to be a terrorist, that's a really beautiful place, as well as Nuristan where the rest remain today). The idea was to start bombing, push the al Qaeda forces east to the awaiting Pakistan border, where their army would either capture or kill the renaming forces. Essentially, the Pakistan army opened up, and allowed them safe haven in Pakistan, and the US was kinda stuck. </p>
<p>There are a myriad of terrorist organizations that are allowed safe haven in Pakistan. The Haqqani (which sees its self as the Taliban, although the DIA has been trying to make them their own organization for years) is stationed in Miram Shah Pakistan. This was the organization that had Bergdahl. </p>
<p>The Lashkar-e-Tabia is based in Pakistan, and they are fighting the dispute between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir Area. </p>
<p>There's a whole bunch, and I'm on mobile, but many believe these various forces are the military action army of the Pakistan intelligence service (ISI). </p>
<p>Uzbekistan</p>
<p>Uzbekistan kinda of took a hard stance against Islam. Captured everyone that was coming and going to a mosque, put them in swimming pools and shot them all. This in turn formed the IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan) which operated out of Northern Afghanistan. </p>
<p>In there end, there are a ton of factions that can operate freely in Afghanistan, and do so, as well as Pakistan. And although some has changed, the Afghan people still operate under Pashtunwali, and both host and protect these various organizations. </p>
<p>To note, many of the other responses are also true, its really a hodgepodge of reasons for their situation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of comments talking about the invasions and toppling of governments by various world powers, but I think that's a symptom more than a root cause. IMHO, the root cause is more like that Afghanistan never really developed a firm, centralized power structure.</p>
<p>I don't know as much about this as I'd like, and it doesn't seem to be super well documented, but the process of increasing amounts of power being held by central National governments at the expense of tribes, cities, and regions seems to have mostly happened in Europe through the course of the Renaissance times. It took a while, and had a lot of hiccups, conflicts, etc, but eventually, the National-level government got to the point of being able to reliably exercise authority over all of the more regional governments within its territory. This goes hand-in-hand with many facets of modernism, like unifying language and minimizing accents, establishing a national currency, standardizing on weights and measures, building roads and keeping them open, etc. This has happened at various levels over most of the planet, though at different times and in different ways in many places.</p>
<p>For some reason, this never seems to have happened in Afghanistan at all. There's a central government, but it basically only exists in the big cities, and not necessarily even all of those. The majority of the country is only dimly aware of the existence of the supposed national government, and it as essentially no meaning to their lives. This goes the same for all of the trappings of having a strong national government of any ideology or structure. All of the stuff I mentioned in the previous paragraph, plus things like being aware of or participating in the global media cycle, being connected to the global economy, being exposed to the sort of cultural mish-mash that is the modern world.</p>
<p>It's kind of a natural fit for many sects of radical Islamic ideology. The ancient culture and lack of connection to the global economy kinda fits in with a lot of what many of these extremist ideologies seem to think. The National government is barely aware of the existence of most of these tribes and villages, and has no real power to do much of anything in them. The people who live there only really care about their tribe and maybe the next few over, and talk of things like the Nation of Afghanistan, America, New York, jetliners and skyscrapers, it might as well be on Mars. For that matter, most modern Westerners have probably thought a lot more about Mars than these villagers would think of any of these things. A great place to hide out of you are wanted basically in the entire civilized world - the idea of you being found, or of someone reporting you, would be basically crazy.</p>
<p>So all of this was already the case before any of the modern foreign invasions really got started. But they sure didn't help. It's hard enough to get villagers used to bowing to the power of a national government when it's a national government run by your people. It's a whole different matter when the national government is run by what to you seems like a dizzying array of alien cultures from the other side of the planet. Just when a few people start to think that maybe these foreigners have something going and participating in the global economy might not be so bad, they get tired of it and leave you right back where you were, validating the people who wanted to have nothing to do with them. It's easy to send a foreign army into one or a handful of villages, but controlling all of them all the time is impossible. So Afghanistan is basically ungovernable now, and there's not much incentive for that to change anytime in the near future. Meanwhile, most of the surrounding countries seem to have more or less successfully centralized power, so while they may have problems, they don't have the kind of problems that Afghanistan has. And the reason why that is, I don't know, and I'm not so sure anybody knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were constituent republics of the Soviet Union for some 70 years and, thus, heavily controlled. The Soviets had no patience for religious freedom and stamped it out whenever and wherever they felt it threatening to the absolute authority of the state.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991-92, those republics became independent and have largely remained controlled by dictatorial strongmen who feel about as kindly towards Islamist extremism as the Soviets did.</p>
<p>Afghanistan, by contrast, has been a factional, semi-lawless psuedo-state off and on for many decades with well-funded** and organized Islamist militants vying for control against the various Afghan nationalist clans and, for a while, the Soviets. So for a long time it's been highly fertile ground for that hotbed of religious extremism to develop.</p>
<p>** By the U.S., mainly, until the Islamists started to bite the hand that was feeding them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a very perceptive question.</p>
<p>You have touched on one of the fundamental flaws of Newtonian gravity: the fact that it is &quot;non-local&quot;.</p>
<p>We know that the speed of light must be constant in all frames of reference, and yet Newton's formulation of gravity requires that gravitating bodies <em>instantaneously</em> know where everything else is, as you mention in your question.</p>
<p>So one of the motivators of general relativity was to develop a <em>local</em> theory; i.e. one in which the effects of gravity on a body are simply the results of some feature of its IMMEDIATE surroundings.</p>
<p>And so we describe gravity as the effect of <em>curved</em> spacetime.  We imagine that all masses cause a curvature in spacetime around them, and this curvature distorts the paths of other bodies in the vicinity.</p>
<p>So the &quot;gravity&quot; felt by a body is simply the effect of the curvature of spacetime in its immediate region.  This removes the issues of non-locality since no information needs to be transmitted at higher-than-light speeds.</p>
<p>I hope this explanation helps, feel free to ask follow-up questions.</p>
<p>Edit: I've mentioned this a little lower down in the comment chain, but it is an important point which belongs here too: <em>changes</em> to curvature propagate at the speed of light.  i.e. if, through some truly epic disaster, the sun suddenly popped out of existence, we would not encounter the effects until about 8 minutes later.  This is due to the fact that <em>information</em> cannot travel faster than light (in a vacuum).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you hold a ball, it <em>already</em> wants to fall. Gravity has been affecting it all along. The atom on the other side of the planet had <em>already</em> been pulling on the atom in the ball. The only thing that changed when it fell was that you let it go.</p>
<p>If the atom on the other side of the earth were to suddenly disappear, the atom in the ball would not feel it until 0.042 seconds later (speed of light fast). It would get a <em>little</em> lighter in your hands.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i always thought of it like: the speed of light is actually the max speed of spacetime. so everything within spacetime is limited to that speed. the curvature of space can move at max speed because it is massless and spacetime imposes something like friction to mass because it distorts it, which requires more energy to move faster (infinte to get to the speed of light). when mass is pure energy and no longer mass it is light and thus rides along the max speed of spacetime because it has no resistance. this is just how i think so in sure ill be criticized for not having sources. so gravity really is just a ripple in spacetime which is what defines the speed of light and not the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, it all boils down to whatever is contractually obligated.  To answer your second question, the AFM (musicians union) doesn't have any specific language in their contract requiring that musicians be listed in credits of film, so it just doesn't happen.  For films that are recorded non-union, most likely it's actually the players themselves that don't want to be listed, as a lot of films record on &quot;dark days&quot; meaning union players playing in a non-union recording session, which is against the AFM bylaws. (In other words, if an AFM player did a non-union indie dark, and then had their name in the credits, they'd find themselves in trouble fairly quickly and facing some serious fines)</p>
<p>For songs in film versus TV being listed, if often does come down to the time constraints of music being one of the last things to be finalized.  For TV, it's quite often that the end credits for a show have already been completed for a particular episode before final music choices have been made, so there isn't a way to include it.  Additionally, there can be upwards of 20-30 songs (that you would see listed used in a film) in a single 30-minute TV program, and there just isn't time to list them (TV end credit beds are pre-determined length and rarely vary from episode to episode).  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, the top answer is the correct one, But another contributing factor is this:</p>
<p>TV shows want to save as much time as possible, because they have a small window of time to fill, and the tv stations want people to keep watching, so television shows try to have as short of credits as possible. They will usually do the minimum required, and have the credits go as fast as possible. Often leaving out things like VFX people and merely mentioning the VFX companies involved. </p>
<p>Movies however are not concerned with how long the credits are, and longer credits actually make a movie seem like a bigger deal. So a lot of movies pad out the credits with as much information as possible, not only do they list every person who worked at each VFX company for example. They even have absurd new things they're doing like &quot;production babies&quot; which is just a list of all the children that were born to employees who worked on the movie during its production. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
