Your skin has a lot of surface area, and sweat acts as a medium that cools when in contact with (usually cooler) air.  Producing more sweat covers more surface area of the body, and therefore becomes more efficient at cooling.  Individuals who are physically fit typically produce sweat because their bodies need to cool more efficiently.  This doesn't exclude individuals who are overweight, however, because moving a lot of mass - whether it be muscle or fat - requires a lot of energy expenditure, produces heat, and requires more efficient cooling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what's already been explained, I'll just pitch in a bit of anecdotal explanation:  </p>
<p>Mother's been in the nail industry for over a decade and owned her own salon for two years, I myself have been involved at the front/in business management for about five years.  </p>
<p>Despite her college education in Korea, her foreign degree amounted to essentially nothing at the time we arrived in the US (2000s). With few roots in the country and therefore almost no connections to get her a stable job, she stumbled upon the nail industry via a fellow church member (Korean churches and other similar monocultural institutions are invaluable resources for new immigrants in the US). The work was relatively easy, obtaining licenses wasn't too difficult (plus she could work unlicensed and learn in a real-time environment), and there were tons of other fellow Koreans in a similar situation, meaning she had coworkers she could communicate clearly with and learn from quickly.  </p>
<p>Time goes on, she gets better at the work and becomes fully licensed with lots of experience, climbs up to a managerial position but still works just as much as other employees. Work starts to get harder, more stressful with managing employees and the inevitable side-eye/dislike that comes with being a boss of sorts. </p>
<p>She gets tired of the talking behind her back and finds herself starting to disagree with the owner, decides that starting her own business may be the best option for herself (to rest her deteriorating wrist because of work and get away from the whole gossip drama thing).  </p>
<p>Buys a pre-existing nail salon from Chinese owners, sets up shop.  </p>
<p>A commenter in here was asking why Asian immigrants seem to be more disposed to this work than others, and as another commenter explained, it seems to be purely because of tradition/a long-established status quo. I have seen a number of black-owned/employed shops and white-owned/employed shops, but they're often associated with higher/lower costs/quality. Guess Asians are just the standard given their long history in the industry?  </p>
<p>Also want to add that because so many salons are Asian, so are salon supply stores -- stronger communication/language compatibility between supply store and salon means possibly better prices and service, so this may deter some non-Asians from utilizing the often cheaper supply stores, raising their costs and so on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once a community of people has established themselves within an industry, they will help other members of the same community to expand their business within that industry. So the owners of Korean or Vietnamese owned nail salons will help their friends and family to open more nail salons, South Asian/Middle Eastern bodega owners and taxi drivers will help their friends and family to open more bodegas, or buy more taxis. </p>
<p>Many industries within a city, state or region will become dominated by a single or a few close-knit communities of people helping each other to maintain dominance in that industry. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had a store next to a Chinese restaurant many years ago. The owner came here from China and a relative of his who was already established in the US with his own restaurant took the guy under his wing and helped him get started. Little by little, more and more relatives from China started showing up and working there. They all lived together in a tiny shitty apartment and worked like crazy. When they made enough money, they bought a second restaurant, and half the family went there. They both kept bringing more family over, living cheap, and saving for more restaurants and the cycle repeated. Their business model was somewhat like amoebas where they split and grow exponentially. </p>
<p>I'm guessing the Asian nail salons are similar in that regard. You have a bunch of family to support and guide you, and help you get established in your own business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Putting 24 hours in a day came from the ancient Egyptians who split the day into 2 parts. Daytime was 10 hours with an hour of twilight on either side and nighttime was 12 hours. Nighttime was 12 hours based on 36 stars called &quot;decans&quot; that the Egyptians used to keep track of time based on when they rose in the sky. 18 decans would be visible at any given time of the year, but 3 were assigned to each side of twilight, so there 12 leftover for nighttime hours.</p>
<p>The 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute comes from the ancient Babylonians who liked to split things in base 60. They had a thing for the number 360 because they thought that's how many days there were in year. They also like 60 because, like 12, it can easily be divided into several other whole numbers (2, 3, 4, 6). </p>
<p>The 7-day week came up independently in a few ancient societies. It's unclear why exactly, but most likely because it's 1/4 of the lunar cycle. It just so happens that about 52 weeks fit in a year.</p>
<p>People didn't start keeping track of years in their current form until significantly later on. The first person to start counting years from Jesus' birth was a Scythian monk named Dionysius Exiguus in 525 CE (and his system didn't become widespread until sometime later). Before that most people would count the number of years of the current king or other relevant ruler. So it would be something like the 10th year in the reign of King Virgo911. In Rome they would also sometimes count the number of years from the founding of the city. Most cultures around the world did this (counting years from a significant event or based on the ascension of a ruler or dynasty) and, in fact, that's what the current calendar does (counts years from a significant event, i.e. the birth of Jesus). We do it in base 10 because we're simply counting years from a reference point.</p>
<p>Edit: Since this is picking up some steam, more fun facts. The Romans used an 8 day week during the Republic. They switched over to a 7 day week during the Empire (and officially adopted it in 321 CE).</p>
<p>The Mayans had two different length weeks. One of 13 days where the days were just numbered and one of 20 days where the days were named. I'm not really sure how that works in practice.</p>
<p>The Jews had a 7 day week because of the creation story taking place over 7 days. It's unclear where 7 came from.</p>
<p>The French tried to implement decimal time shortly after the French Revolution, but it never caught on. In decimal time there are 10 hours in a day, 100 minutes in an hour, and 100 seconds in a minute.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to emphasize that some of these divisions are physical; that is, that's just how they are.  The length of the day is fixed -- it's how long it takes for the Sun to move <em>all</em> the way around the Earth.  At noon on day 1, the Sun is at its highest point.  At noon on day 2, the Sun is again at its highest point.  The length of the day is the time between these two.  How we measure it is another matter.  Notice that I didn't say that it's the time that it takes for the Earth to spin around its axis.  That's because it actually takes less than a day to do that.  It's just that, by the time it has spun around, it's also moved a bit in its orbit, so the point that was directly facing the Sun is now a little bit behind.  Also, since the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the length of the day we use is really more of an average.</p>
<p>The other physical quantity we use today is the solar year.  That's how long it takes for the Earth to go all the way around the Sun.  The year is actually <em>not</em> exactly 365 days but a bit longer, which is why we add a day every four years or so (the rule for leap years is that we add one day whenever the year is a multiple of 4, unless it's a multiple of 100, in which case we add it only if it's a multiple of 400).  Nobody thought, hm, let's make the year 365 days.  365 (and a bit) is just how long it takes for the Earth to go around the Sun.</p>
<p>The 7-day week is just something that stuck with us from ancient cultures.  The ancient Israelites, for example, used a 7-day week, in which the 7th day was the day of rest.  In the Abrahamic traditions, that 7-day week was kept, though Christians and Muslims both changed the position of the day of rest within that week.  Other cultures had different weeks.  The Mayans, for example, had a 13-day week and a 20-day month, making a 260-day ritual year (that obviously didn't line up with the solar year; they used a different system for that).  It just so happened that the 7-day week is the one we use today, thanks in large part to the spread of Christianity, and the fact that there are 52 weeks in a year (plus a day, or two in leap years) is just coincidental.</p>
<p>Another physical quantity we use, but a lot less often, is the lunar month.  This is how long it takes for the Moon to make its way around the Earth, kinda.  Just like with the length of the day, the actual measure is how long it takes between new moon and new moon, when the relative position of the Sun, Earth, and Moon are the same.  This is some quantity between 29 and 30 days.  Many cultures use it, including the Jews, the Muslims, and the Chinese; the phases of the moon are a fairly reliable way to mark time.  Have you ever seen those moon calendars that tell you the phase of the moon on a given day?  These are completely unnecessary in lunar calendars -- you always know the phase of the moon because it's the same every month!  (The word &quot;month&quot; is even derived from &quot;Moon&quot; in English!)  At some point, the Christians moved to a solar calendar, and they got rid of the lunar months.  The thing we call a month now is kind of arbitrary.  The fact is that there are a few days less than 12 turns of the Moon around the Earth in one turn of the Earth around the Sun, so they split the solar year into 12 non-lunar months like we have today, each one with 30 or 31 days (I don't know why they made February have fewer), and they no longer line up with the Moon.  But the cultures that still use the lunar calendar have to work out ways to deal with the difference.  The Muslims simply don't.  Their year doesn't line up with the solar year at all and they're OK with that.  The Jews, on the other hand, insert a leap <em>month</em> 7 years out of every 19, and there are a few other months that get an added day in some cases, mostly in order to make various holidays not fall on various days of the week (the 21st day of the 7th month, Hoshana Rabah, isn't allowed to fall on Saturday, for example).  The main impetus here is to make sure that the 1st (Biblical) month is actually in the spring (note that long, long ago, Jews switched to a calendar that begins on the 7th month, which begins in the fall), so a month is added if the 12th month ends too early.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I should mention that the division sexagesimal (meaning 60) division of minutes and seconds isn't <em>actually</em> from the Babylonians.  Before decimals were invented by <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Napier.html" target="_blank">John Napier</a> in the late 1500's/early 1600's, people actually measured everything in fractions of 60.  This included degrees of a circle and parts of the hour.  So a time might be 4 hours and a bit.  How much was a bit?  26 60ths and a bit.  The first 60th subdivision was tiny so it was called a minute subdivision, and the second subdivision was called... well, they ran out of fucks to give so it was just the second subdivision.  So the time could be 4 hours, 26 minute subdivisions of an hour, and 5 second subdivisions of an hour.  Of course, you could also have third subdivisions of things and fourth subdivisions and so on, but there wasn't much reason to use them once decimals caught on.  On the other hand, hours kept their subdivisions because they were in common use by regular people, and degrees kept theirs because they were used in navigational star charts and such.</p>
<p>The only number I haven't explained here is the 24 hours in a day, but I think other people already have so I'll leave it at that!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a similar vein is a feeling known as &quot;the call of the void&quot;. It's that uncomfortable urge you get to jump when you near the edge of a tall building, or that super weird image that pops into your head of stabbing someone with the big knife laying on the table. There are several theories, but the one that makes the most sense to me is that it is an evolutionary safety mechanism. By calling these disturbing images to the forefront of your conscious mind, your subconscious is keeping you alert and aware of potential environmental dangers. The urge to jump from the building makes you hyper aware of the edge you are near. The image of stabbing people is your brain's fucked-up way of saying &quot;Sharp thing over there! Don't get careless!&quot; The urge to bite or squeeze a small, cute thing may be evolution's messed up way of calling attention to the fragility of those cute things. We get a weird urge to squeeze babies and kittens to death, but (at least for most normal folks) this urge is followed immediately by a feeling of distaste or disgust at our own thoughts - our brains have successfully alerted us to the fact that this tiny young thing is delicate and needs protection...and has done so in a super fucked up way because nature is terrifying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The second number was the season of the show.

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This request is in response to a report that the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (the U.S. top nutrition advisory panel) is going to reverse 40 years of warning about certain cholesteral intake (such as from eggs). Moreover, in recent years, there has been a dramatic reversal away from certain pre-conceived notions -- such as these panels no longer recommending straight counting calories/fat (and a realization that not all calories/fat are equal). Then there's the carbohydrate purge/flip-flop. And the continued influence of lobbying/special interest groups who fund certain studies. Even South Park did an episode on gluten.</p>
<p>Few things affect us as personally and as often as what we ingest, so these various guidelines/recommendations have innumerable real world consequences. Are nutritionists/researchers just getting better at science/observation of the effects of food? Are we trending in the right direction at least?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first commentor has it spot on but I would definitely like to double down on the notion that the science is young.  It definitely is, we learn new things every day.  When it comes to our bodies there is still a lot we don't know and sometimes we find out that certain cells interact with certain things in ways we didn't realize before.  For example my first year of college I took anatomy and phyisology, after the first semester had ended we had to buy a new version of the textbook because some cutting edge genetic information had just been solidified and it was important to our understanding of the body.  This filters out into the other sciences as well.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes we perform long-term studies that take many years to realize that what we are using/doing is harmful.  Take asbestos as an example.  We used to use it in <em>everything</em> because it was cheap, flame resistant, and had many many other properties that were desirable.  It was until much later that we realized that asbestos caused a good deal many health defects in humans and so had to complete revise construction techniques and methods.  This also applies to things like nutrition, we find things out after studying long-term effects that don't match with what we already know and have to change it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food studies scholar here. It mainly depends on where culture stands at the time. If people think that certain things are clean and that health is defined a certain way, then dietary advice will follow. </p>
<p>Take bread for example: brown bread used to be considered the stuff peasants ate and it wasn't healthful. In the middle of the 20th century, people thought that white foods were cleaner and therefore healthier. Now, white bread, white rice, and white sugar have been abandoned in favor of brown bread, brown rice, and raw sugar. Peasant foods are now good for you. </p>
<p>New science also changes things. As we learn more about how the human body works, we can better judge how food affects the body. Brown fat, for example, did not exist in the imagination in the 19th century, when moderation and bland foods were put forth as better for the body. </p>
<p>There are also powerful lobbyists who make their case. Using scientific studies (that they may or may not have funded) they petition to shape how we think about food at the level of public policy. </p>
<p>This scholar has a lot to say about the matter: <a href="http://www.foodpolitics.com/books/" target="_blank">http://www.foodpolitics.com/books/</a>. Marion Nestle's book is at the bottom of the list and is quite thorough in its study of how food policy and public stances on nutrition are shaped--and by whom. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One additional issue is that nutrition is difficult to study in a controlled fashion. First, unlike testing a drug, where you can give the control group a placebo and the experimental group the active drug, you cannot give a control group no/placebo food. You have to replace the food you are trying to get experimental data on with some other food. </p>
<p>Want to test the effects of eating saturated fats? You have to create a control diet that replaces those calories with something else (or you run into another experimental problem where a lower-calorie diet may be producing the results you see), and it's impossible to know the full extent of what replacing those calories does. Do you replace them with unsaturated fats? Carbohydrates?</p>
<p>Diets also tend to be very heterogeneous. This can be a problem when people like to compare population-level data (epidemiological study rather than a controlled study). People looked at the &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; and saw people eating more monounsaturated (and some polyunsaturated) fats, but they tended to ignore MANY confounding factors, even things that probably have a significant impact like eating more whole foods rather than processed foods and even differences in total calories. Scientists don't tend to set up highly controlled studies where people all eat the same foods, but rather eat whatever they want (or what they are supposed to eat/avoid) and then report back occasionally, with varying degrees of accuracy.</p>
<p>Early research on fats didn't treat trans-fats as a separate category and lumped them in with saturated fats, which may have helped create stigma against saturated fats (although there were a lot of political headaches that go into this history).</p>
<p>Finally, different organisms handle different foods and macronutrients differently! Yet people (especially media reporting a new study) will often take results from a mouse study as if it applies equally to humans or other animals. </p>
<p>TL;DR nutrition is complex, heterogeneous, and difficult to control in large experiments, forcing us to rely on less rigorous methods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The biggest Achilles heel in nutrition science is politics. Take the case of beef. Several decades ago the (I believe) USDA came right out and said &quot;eat less red meat,&quot; in response to sound science, and the beef lobby sued like crazy. The revised advice became &quot;reduce intake of lipid-rich proteins,&quot; which is nicely innocuous and also applies equally well to PEANUTS. </p>
<p>The fact is the science is still very, very young, and meanwhile the politics of food have deep roots. Every time a new study that's both innovative and objective actually gets funded <em>and</em> published it's a goddamn miracle, and that'll be even more true in the next several years. So food officials jump on those studies like lions on a fat gazelle, and that's why things get massively shaken up from time to time. </p>
<p>TL;DR - nutrition is a very new science and food is highly politicized, so new information will almost always be pretty game-changing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit 2: the way you guys are debating &quot;A Perfect Game&quot; makes wonder if anything can be learned by studying Meta shifts in games like Overwatch and league of legends. In those games players consistently work out optimal winning conditions. Pardon the pun but we might find meta information in the meta.</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trust me, if that were the case, we would be hearing about it. </p>
<p>Google's program is not &quot;solving&quot; Go in the strict CS sense. It is not evaluating every possible outcome of every possible board state. It is using heuristics to choose some possible moves to sample, and it is using other heuristics to evaluate the outcomes of those moves rather than calculating all the way to the end of the game. In a certain sense it's an approximation algorithm, but it's not entirely clear to me what it's approximating because its objective is to beat its opponent, not to play a &quot;perfect&quot; game.</p>
<p>Technically, P vs NP doesn't come into play at all because the board size is constant and therefore the set of possible moves is bounded by a constant. We can't say that the algorithm is running in polynomial time unless we answer &quot;polynomial of what?&quot; The neural nets are running in constant-bounded time on problems of constant-bounded size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The core thing the Google Go team tried to do, was to make an algorithm that could look at a go board state (e.g. all the pieces, how many captured, whose turn) and &quot;score&quot; that, to tell who is winning.</p>
<p>Once you have that, you can evaluate which moves are better (since they change the board state).</p>
<p>Step 1: It watched a whole lot of professional go games</p>
<p>Step 2: It looked at who won those games and used that as a mechanism for going back over all the moves of the game to &quot;score the board&quot; so that the AI could tell which board state was &quot;better&quot;.</p>
<p>Step 3: It then played a lot of matches against itself, with some of the &quot;players&quot; using different &quot;board state&quot; algorithms.</p>
<p>Step 4: It then used the results of those games to better predict board state.  Rinse and repeat back to Step 3.</p>
<p>Now, I have cut out some steps for brevity.</p>
<p>But it is an incremental algorithm improvement, often using highly parallelized random tree-walking to test out <em>a lot</em> of states, but no where close to all of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Just imagine your computer's available memory being your skin. In order for it to run smoothly, you don't want to clog it up by running a ton of unnecessary programs. In regular use, the computer does its job by allocating memory needed to run programs and allow you to multi-task. But if you try to render a 3D-model, while playing a game at its highest settings, while bitcoin mining, while aggressively compiling that stupid powerpoint with ugly wordart, all at the same time, you stress out your computer's memory. It has a harder time allocating/managing your memory resources, just like your immune system has a harder time managing the resources necessary to clear the acne-bacteria at its normal rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Acne is caused by bacteria, and if your body is having a harder time fighting that bacteria then it will spread and get worse.</p>
<p>Your body does a whole lot of different things at the same time, but it also has the capacity to 'redirect resources' from things that aren't that important towards things that seem to be really important right now. Stress is usually a symptom of your body focusing on something, for example, you have been staying up late and spending all your free time studying for a really important exam. Your body has recognized that you aren't sleeping well, that you probably aren't eating well and that you are using your brain a lot. In response, your body has redirected resources from your immune system to your energy production system so that there is enough energy to keep your brain and body working while you aren't sleeping and eating properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. The 10 mg and 20 mg LEXAPRO groups were similar on

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All antidepressants have to be rigorously studied in double blind trials against both other antidepressants and placebos, before they can be approved for clinical use in most countries.  </p>
<p>However there are a lot of criticisms about those research studies:  sometimes the same drug will do well in one trial and poorly in another, and in the past only the good trials were made public.  When independent researchers demanded the data from the unpublished trials, it showed the effectiveness of the drugs was overstated due to this selective publication.  Now all drug trial data is expected to be made public, even if the drug performs poorly. Also the drugs can have side-effects, and the placebos often don't, so patients can sometimes tell which they are receiving, and just knowing they are not getting a placebo might cause them to feel a little better. That might make the drug seem  more effective than it is. Also the drugs are usually studied in trials of 6 or 8 weeks, and other treatments like cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) might have benefits that are more obvious months later. </p>
<p>To find specific studies, try going to pubmed.com which searches the US National Library of Medicine, and typing in the generic name of an SSRI, eg. paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, etc, and key words or terms like &quot;efficacy&quot;, &quot;clinical trial&quot;, &quot;double blind&quot; and &quot;major depressive disorder&quot;. Putting the terms in quotes helps narrow the search.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
