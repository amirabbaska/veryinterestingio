		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, horses have eight different blood types, and each type can exist in a variety of forms, and they can also have a type from each of the other types.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://equusmagazine.com/diseases/blood-12901" target="_blank">Equine Blood Transfusions</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Horses have eight major blood types---A, C, D, K, P, Q, U and T (the first seven of which are internationally recognized)---with more than 30 different factors for which they can be positive or negative. These can combine in a number of different ways, designated by an upper-case letter for the type, combined with a lower-case letter for the factor, such as A (a,b,c,f,g), Ca, D (a,g,k), Ka, P (a,b), Q (a,b,c), etc. All of these possibilities create about a 1-in-400,000 chance of finding a 100 percent perfect match between two horses. The two most important and problematic antigens we consider when selecting equine blood donors are Qa and Aa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to what makes humans different, only humans and some related primates have the gene for ABO blood types. Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494955/" target="_blank">The ABO blood group is a trans-species polymorphism in primates</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ABO histo-blood group, the critical determinant of transfusion incompatibility, was the first genetic polymorphism discovered in humans. Remarkably, ABO antigens are also polymorphic in many other primates, with the same two amino acid changes responsible for A and B specificity in all species sequenced to date. Whether this recurrence of A and B antigens is the result of an ancient polymorphism maintained across species or due to numerous, more recent instances of convergent evolution has been debated for decades, with a current consensus in support of convergent evolution. We show instead that genetic variation data in humans and gibbons as well as in Old World monkeys are inconsistent with a model of convergent evolution and support the hypothesis of an ancient, multiallelic polymorphism of which some alleles are shared by descent among species. These results demonstrate that the A and B blood groups result from a trans-species polymorphism among distantly related species and has remained under balancing selection for tens of millions of years—to date, the only such example in hominoids and Old World monkeys outside of the major histocompatibility complex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguably the best studied case of apparent convergent evolution is the ABO blood group (A, B, AB, O) (1, 8), the first molecular polymorphism to be characterized in humans. ABO blood groups are defined by the presence or absence of specific antigens that circulate in body fluids and are attached to lipids at the surface of various epithelial and endothelial cell types (notably in the gastrointestinal tract, but also, in hominoids only, on red blood cells) (9, 10). These antigens are associated with complementary immune antibodies produced in the gut after contact with bacteria and viruses carrying A-like and B-like antigens (11). Whereas the biological significance of ABO outside of its role in transfusion is unclear (12), histo-blood antigens in general are known to act as cellular receptors by which pathogens can initiate infections (13–15). Furthermore, variation in ABO has been associated with susceptibility to a number of infectious diseases (reviewed in ref. 16), pointing to a role of ABO in immune response.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes, as you can see.
I want to address the broader question here that many commenters are sort of missing. How is blood in itself different between species.
Most of the issues when you think about &quot;typing&quot; is a consequence of learning about the antibodies present on red blood cells. About every cell in your body has two little towers, MHC complexes. These function to let your immune system function, part of their job though involves with the cell nucleus, which rbc do not have. Blood does NOT have these complexes either! Instead there are a variety of very complex &quot;factors&quot; and other functional proteins, carbohydrates and such. This is really important because it is those factors that lead to coagulation upon transmission into a new individual. They clump to other blood cells and clog our veins/arteries interestingly enough for dogs and cats (maybe others I am not sure), most can get a transfusion the first time and be fine. Now this is certainly not best practice but it goes to show the difference in the coagulation cascade between mammals.<br />
Other animals have an incredible amount of diversity for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bovines have 80 blood factors and 11 groups</li>
<li>Porcines have 16 groups</li>
<li>Sheep have 22 factors and 7 groups</li>
<li>Equines have 34 factors and 7 groups</li>
</ol>
<p>In humans you really would not have a scenario were say an individual mates with another one and their baby dies, but in some animals this can happen and it is called neonatal isoerythrolysis and probably a result of domestication and inbreeding. It is more complicated than simple &quot;typing&quot; and has alot to do with the antigens present such as Mik antigen in cats, and unfortunately the prevalence for this is unknown. This is why vets should ALWAYS CROSSMATCH, because typing alone does not really tell the whole story. Unfortunately, most clinicians have limited experience or technical capabilities to do this and opt to type or Ive seen many times no typing be done and infusions given if that is the animals first one.   </p>
<p>Further than that it is important to remember we are talking about mammals. Avian and reptile species have nucleated blood cells which is another whole game. Mammals decided a long time ago to shoot out our nucleus and have increased oxygen carrying as a benefit. bird and reptile haematology is incredibly complicated and honestly I am not sure I have really heard of transfusions being common. Ejection of the nucleus is the rate limiting step for pre rbcs to become erythrocytes (rbcs) and this is not needed in reptiles and birds. So to an extent they have a faster maturation time for blood. Therefore, it has been less common to try transfusions and little research has been done.  We really do not know a lot about other (exotic) species in general and hematology is a complex field to study. Most of the work is going to happen in a zoo, university, or the field. Whereas the common pet/livestock species are more likely candidates  for this research. For every 100 research project at a school I'd say maybe 10 are exotic focused, but this depends upon the school. </p>
<p>Edit: I shouldn't talk about humans I suppose, it is possible for humans to have a similar condition with their offspring but different mechanisms are involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cat breeder here and experienced with non domestic species. Cats have blood groups A, B and more rarely AB. This is very important information for breeders as blood type B cats produce anti A antibodies in colostrum. This means that a blood type B queen (female) bred to a blood type A stud can result in roughly a 50 / 50 split in A and B blood types in the litter. If allowed to suckle in the first 18 to 25 hours of birth the blood type A kittens can lose toes, tips of the tail and eventually die. While some breeds such as the oriental are almost always A, other breeds like the British Shorthair have a very high number of B blood type cats. So testing all breeding cats for blood type is essential. Occasionally breeders may decide the mating of an A stud to B girl is worthwhile, however the breeder must hand rear the kittens for the first 24 hours to prevent ingestion of the high antibody colostrum. A type A queen can nurse both A and B kittens. Blood type AB is separate from the other groups entirely and can nurse either however it is the rarest blood group. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

a) If you move past objects of different distance to you, the near objects appear to move past you rather fast, while the further an object is away, the slower it seems to move. Commercial airplanes fly at an altitude of ~ 10-11 km, so the ground seems to move past very slowly. But this slow movement is not really observable, because:
b) the texture of the ocean is very simple and redundant (= it repeats itself) and also so far away that no remarkable spots or patterns are able to be seen from a plane, which means unless there is an island or a large boat you have no point of reference, meaning you cannot measure your change of position relative to it.

<p>What matters is the resistive forces, like aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and friction. Aerodynamic drag in particular becomes the dominant factor at high speeds, because it is proportional to the square of velocity, so disregarding it is not appropriate here.</p>
<p>The power required to overcome the resistance is proportional to the resistive force and the current speed. The resistive forces themselves may increase with the speed (as is the case with drag), so power requirements can grow quite rapidly with increasing speed.</p>

Acceleration will be the same at low speeds because power and weight are the most significant factors. Top speed is a function of power and aerodynamics, weight is not part of that equation, so the car with more power will have a higher top speed as long as the aerodynamics aren't significantly worse than the other car. Faster around a track is trickier, since the the heavier/more powerful car will have an advantage on the fast straight-aways and the lighter car will have an advantage in tight turns. Generally smaller racetracks with more turns favor light cars and larger more spread out tracks favor powerful cars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>If we disregard the aerodynamics and what not</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With regards to the top speed the aerodynamics is the biggest force to the car so if you disregard aerodynamics it would be impossible to compare them. What would happen is that they both cars would continue accelerating towards the speed of light. But assuming you meant that they have the same drag coefficient, essentially the same shape, then it is possible to compare them. Bigger cars have bigger volume and thus a bigger cross section and therefore more drag. However this relation is not linear but follow a cube/square law. So an increase in volume means a smaller proportional increase in aerodynamic drag. So if you increase the size of the car and keep the same power to weight ratio, density and drag coefficient you will have a faster car. This is obvious if you have seen a motor race or a bike race as racers will clump together to take advantage of the slipstream and effectively &quot;merge&quot; their aerodynamic drag to become bigger and therefore faster.</p>
<p>There is also another way to compare what cars are faster and that is with acceleration. For example comparing the 0-100kph time or a timed drag race, etc. The low speeds means aerodynamics is not that important in those cases. In this case it is as simple as force and mass which determines the acceleration. However horsepowers is not a measure of how much force you get from a car but how much energy it can output. What you want for acceleration is torque. But if you assume that the engines in the cars are similar and set up similarly you can extrapolate that the torque is comparable. In that case the cars would perform very similarly with the same power to weight ratio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I think OP meant that if you have two identical cars, with same aerodynamic properties and rolling friction, but one has more hp, but proportionally same hp/weight ratio, which would be faster? </p>
<p>I'll try and answer as a phyisics and car enthusiast but not as a professional at all. Acceleration should be pretty much the same at first, but as I recall from Gordon Murray making observations about the Veyron, after a certain point hp doesn't translate directly into speed, but closer to an exponential factor, hence the Veyron needs a big chunk of its power to get those ultimate 30km/h. </p>
<p>The difference in power between the two would be the most defining factor, if the power is not enough for it to crack certain air resistance after X velocity, then they might be the same, I think weight is not a huge of a factor making a difference at top speed, but I might be squarely wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there is a transplant, wether partial or full, it is always the donor's cells, no matter for how long you have had it. Even in a bone marrow transplant (one that is not autologous - not a self transplant) will result in the production of donor blood cell. This is the reason that an organ transplant also includes a lifetime of immunosuppresant drugs, resulting in an increased risk of infection for the patient.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are three types of tissues (depending on replication potential):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Liable tissues -  new cells are continuously being produced from basal cells - e.g. the skin, mucosa (inner lining) of the intestines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stable tissues - which only undergo replication when there is significant stress to the organ - e.g. tge liver, kidneys... the liver is particularly special, if you cut a lobe of the liver or let's say half of it, it will mostly hypertrophy (the cells will increase in size), and even hyperplasia (increase number of cells) of hepatocytes (liver cells) [the missing lobe will never grow back, only the residual liver tissue grows] The new tissue will take up the same space as the full size liver, restoring most of the function.<br />

</li>
<li>Permanent tissues - these never undergo cell replication (at least not after embryological development) - e.g. the brain and heart.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important not is that organs which have a higher replication potential and replicate more often, have an increased chance to accumulate mutations and cause tumours!</p>

I had leukemia when I was younger and went through a bone marrow trasnplant from my brother. Since your original bone marrow is destroyed before this procedure (by chemo in my case), it was fully replaced by bone marrow with my brother's DNA. Bone marrow produces the blood that courses through your body, which means that my blood has my brother's DNA and the rest of my body (for example a cheek swab or my skin cells) have my own DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We can routinely &quot;accelerate&quot; neutral atoms up to hundreds of keV or even 1 MeV through sequential ionization, acceleration, and recombination. While chargeless particles are not accelerated at any stage of this process, the net result is much faster neutral particles than you began with.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not based off of our current theories. Electromagnetism works because we are able to create powerful fields with macroscopic tools. The other fundamental forces don't work for different reasons:</p>
<p>Gravity and Weak Nuclear Force: too weak to accelerate particles with such short lifetimes (they don't even lift)</p>
<p>Strong Force: a thing called &quot;colour confinement&quot;, essentially, once colour charges get far enough separated, they spontaneously create a pair of new charges between them to maintain colour neutrality, so we cannot have a macroscopically colour charged object (this is also why Q/G plasma is not something that can be physically separated into constituients that are not colour neutral)</p>
<p>Therefore EM is the only force usable to accelerate particles because it is the only one where we can maintain a strong enough field for a long enough time to be useful. The reason electric fields are used instead of magnetic fields is simply because they are more efficient at accelerating particles. As pointed out by multiple commenters below, it is possible to accelerate neutrons with magnetic fields, but why not just use protons and a more efficient acceleration technique?</p>
<p>Ethos: working at CERN for the summer</p>
<p>Edits for clarity (and jokes)</p>
<p>Edit2: /u/phsics pointed out an indirect acceleration method called neutral particle injection that is pretty rad</p>
<p>Edit3: clarification that where I work is not a real source, but an implication that I have aquired knowledge necessary to answer this question correctly, will return with source links</p>
<p>Edit4: As pointed out by /u/ThatPhysicistTTU , the magnetic field cannot do work on a particle, so it cannot change the energy of a charge (i.e. increase the speed of the charge). However, a dipole CAN be given more an energy by a magnetic field if the magnetic field has a high gradient.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a physics grad student currently working on something called a Stark decelerator, which can accelerate (we mostly use it to decelerate to rest and trap) neutral objects that have an electric dipole moment. Fundamental particles unfortunately don't* have electric dipole moments, but atoms and molecules can (we study molecules).  There are also zeeman decelerators that can accelerate objects with a magnetic dipole moment, which particles can have (although, since I work on decelerating molecules and atoms I don't know how feasible it would be to use it to accelerate particles. </p>
<p>Both of these work on the same principle. The dipole moment interacts with the field to change the potential energy of the particle. There are many stages where you can create a high field that can be switched off. To accelerate, you time the switching so that the fields are turned on when the particles are in the region of high field. As they move away from the high field they lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, meaning they were accelerated. To decelerate, you time the switching so that the particle enters the high field region, gaining potential energy and losing kinetic energy, and then the fields are quickly turned off, leaving the particles with less kinetic energy (they were decelerated). </p>
<p>Maybe not what you were looking for, but in principle the answer to your question is yes.</p>
<p>Edit: the asterisk is because I work in a building with people who are searching for the electron electric dipole moment which should exist in some theories beyond the standard model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CJK Type designer here. </p>
<p><strong>1) Limited character set</strong>
As others have indicated, thankfully no one has to actually design millions of characters. Actual glyph coverage depends on the needs of the font. Let's look at Microsoft as a sample (including Latin &amp; other symbol characters). </p>
<p>Chinese (Trad / Simplified): 30,000 characters.
Japanese: 24,000 characters
Korean: 21,000 characters</p>
<p>Now, the above includes a lot of glyphs that most people probably don't need. In the case of Korean, the most basic fonts can have just around 3,000 characters (just Hangul and Latin, no Hanja) and work for most scenarios. For Japanese, there’s 48 Katakana, 48 Hiragana, and about 3000 core Kanji (for literacy), which would cover a majority of scenarios. But for a company like Microsoft, a greater degree of support is necessary. </p>
<p><strong>2) Accelerated and Semi-accelerated tools</strong>
In the case of Korean typefaces, there are tools that help expedite the development of Hangul characters. As Korean syllable glyphs are divided up into component pieces, one can instruct the tool on where to place those components and which variant of each component to use. For some fonts there are 40+ variants of each component! With this sort of tool, building can be faster. But it won't always work for a given situation and then the work has to be done by hand. </p>
<p>In some Japanese foundries, there is something of an ‘toolkit’ that is used with examples of the different kinds of strokes necessary for Kanji. So the digitizer (more on that later) can just drag in the one that is appropriate for a given glyph. However, as each glyph is different, there’s still quite a bit of manual tweaking necessary from there.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with Japanese and Chinese is, like with Korean, there’s significant manual adjustment of a given radical or stroke for every character. So even if a tool was able to at least ‘assemble’ the pieces into a given glyph, you’d have to make significant manual adjustments from there. </p>
<p><strong>3) It takes an army</strong>
I heard a story from a friend of mine who visited a Chinese foundry. Designers would pull a Hanzi from a hat and that would be the character they have to produce. With an army of 30 people working on a single font, they’d churn through the characters until the font was complete. </p>
<p>In one major Japanese foundry, there is a division of labor—“designers” draw the characters on paper, “digitizers” trace those drawings to digital representation, “production” takes the digital representations and produces actual fonts. All told, it is a significant operation involving a large group of people. It takes them a year to complete a single weight (say, the “Regular”) of a brand new font family.</p>
<p>Producing these things is a TON OF WORK. </p>
<p>A quick aside about Korean—given the existence of accelerated tools for production, these <em>can</em> be done faster than Japanese or Chinese fonts, but the best ones usually have manual edits and tweaking on an extensive number, if not all of the syllables. One Korean type designer I spoke to warned me about the use of accelerated tools—that the actual results from it are not that great. He, obviously, recommended doing everything by hand. </p>
<p><strong>Basically:</strong></p>
<p>1) It may not be as many characters as you think it is
2) There are some tools for accelerating work, though a lot is still manual
3) Usually the work is done by a group of people, over a period of time, rather than by an individual. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll talk Simplified Chinese, since that's what I know. The Chinese government has created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters" target="_blank">a list of commonly used characters</a>. It contains 8105 characters; characters outside of this list are going to be very rare (and even some characters within the list are rare, like 玃, the name of a particular kind of ape, or 𫚭, which I can't even find in my dictionary).</p>
<p>8105 is of course a much larger number than the 52 that we need for English (26 upper case, 26 lower case) that needs to be encoded. However, to <em>design</em> them, less work needs to be done. Chinese characters can be broken down into parts that are often repeated across similar words. For example, consider the word for shine 照. In the top of that character, you can see other component characters: the one for sun 日 in the top left, knife 刀 in the top right, and mouth 口 in the middle right. The bottom is four dots, a component historically derived for the character for fire 火. In all four of these cases, we can reuse these component parts in other characters that use them; the font designer only needs to design such parts once, needing only to resize them and move them around. In our example, other places we can use these four component characters are: 日 is on the left side of time 时, 刀 is on the bottom of cleave or chop 劈, 口 is on the left of eat 吃, and the modified 火 is on the bottom of hot 热, among many, many others. (For further reading, look up &quot;Chinese radicals.&quot;)</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that font design in English is not just designing the 52 characters (and miscellaneous punctuation). It also requires logic that governs what happens when two particular characters are placed together (ligatures) - for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature#/media/File:Ligature_drawing.svg" target="_blank">this image</a> shows what might happen if a font designer thinks that f and i should be rendered differently when they are together, as in fi: these are called ligatures. An extreme case happens in Arabic, where each letter has a different beginning, middle, and ending form. Chinese does not have such complexities that it needs to encode in its font (Chinese has a square symbol for each character, including punctuation, and these characters look the same no matter what's before or after it), which mitigates the file size and design requirements. And there's the logic about &quot;where it's legal to break to a new line&quot; - it's OK to break a line after a dash or hyphen, but not after an apostrophe (unless there's a space after it). The first example below is perfectly readable but the second one is odd:</p>
<pre><code>it's a new-
fangled idea

it'
s a new-fangled idea</code></pre>
<p>Again, Chinese has more simple rules regarding this, though there are still rules (you can't break right before a period, for example). But this is just a reminder that fonts are not just strings of character designs, there is also logic behind them that needs to be included.</p>
<p>In practice, Chinese fonts also include the basic English alphabet because it's so prevalent (and indeed in informal contexts some English letters are used alongside Chinese characters), and also there are use-cases where people will need obscure characters not in the list of 8105 commonly used characters, so font designers will need to include some such characters, too. So it is indeed far more work to create a Chinese font than an English one. It's just probably not quite as bad as you think it is.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm pretty sure there are similar official lists of &quot;commonly used characters&quot; in Taiwanese-style Traditional Chinese, Hong Kong-style Traditional Chinese, and Japanese (and maybe even Singapore-style Simplified Chinese? I'm not too sure). But the difference between these writing systems is a different topic.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I'm not a font designer, so the details might be slightly off. However, I am a Chinese speaker, albeit not quite a fluent one, and more importantly a Unicode enthusiast, if that's a thing, so the overall ideas should be correct. Anyone with more knowledge on the subject, feel free to elaborate on anything or point out anything that's incorrect.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am Korean. While you asked for Japanese and Chinese, Korean fonts also requires Chinese characters and thus have similar problem with these languages. Usually, characters for these 3 languages are packed into one font, called CJK fonts.</p>
<p><strong>First of all: do you know what fonts look like?: A list of characters</strong></p>
<p>To put it simple, each font is a gigantic list of letters. If you input a letter, and there's no matching character in that list, it will not come out right; sometimes a blank will show, sometimes a different, typically weird looking letter will show.</p>
<p><strong>Let's count the number of letters needed!: 50,000</strong></p>
<p>Japanese also uses their own letters, which are around ~50. But they come in both smaller form and bigger form, which doubles the count. Still, the number is somewhat reasonable.</p>
<p>Now for the main show! there are a lot of Chinese characters, as you already know. The problem gets even worse because China, Japan and Korea uses different kind of Chinese letter! Chinese uses the most simplified form (along with their own traditional form), Japanese uses less simplified form, and Korean uses the most complicated form. So you need 3~4 sets of Chinese characters.</p>
<p>And Korean letters are a bit more complicated; the written Korean, Hangul, consist of ~30 components, and you are supposed to combine 2~6 of them into one letter. Which means there can be a lot of letters you can make, if there's no limitations!</p>
<p>That's why font creators came up with a limit of their own. For Korean, they picked ~10,000 the most used letters in Korean, and put only those letters in the font. The same goes to the Chinese letters, although I don't know the number. I suppose you can google &quot;Chinese font character numbers&quot; for more detail.</p>
<p>Let's say there are 10,000 for Korean and 4 set of Chinese character. It ends up with 50,000. Add the Japanese letters and it ends up with 50,100. Whatever, let's go with 50,000.</p>
<p>By the way, that's the reason CJK fonts are way bigger than Alphabet-only fonts. Google is distributing Noto Sans series of fonts. If you're interested, look for Noto Sans English and Noto Sans CJK; and compare their size. CJK fonts are way, way bigger than English fonts.</p>
<p><strong>How the fuck do they design letters?: Divide and Conquer</strong></p>
<p>So, do the font designers design each and every letter in the font? All 50,000?</p>
<p>The simple answer is, yes, they design every single letter in the font. </p>
<p>But there is an easy way.</p>
<p>Did I mention that Korean consist of components? Similar principle goes for Chinese, although they are way crazier than Korean. There is ~10 components in Chinese, but in the most complicated case, Chinese characters are combined of 1~30 components.</p>
<p>But, still, they are made of components. <strong>Which means you can set a design standard</strong>. Once you make a design standard, you can use them as building blocks for more complicated letters. Like LEGO! When you combine each components into a letter, components might slightly change their shapes. Still, you can make more design standards for them, and use them for the letter.</p>
<p><strong>Even easier way!!: Don't design them at all</strong></p>
<p>There's yet another much easier way to deal with this problem. Buy a cheap font license, and recycle them.</p>
<p>Let's say you're designing a font specifically for Japanese and Japanese only. You don't need 50,000 letters; you only need 100 for Japanese letters and 10,000 for Japanese-Chinese letters. If you give up on the rest you can cut off 80% of the work! And that's how it's typically done. There are a lot of Chinese-only, Japanese-only or Korean-only fonts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a reporter at Quartz and a little while ago wrote a <a href="https://qz.com/522079" target="_blank">very in-depth article</a> on the process of creating Chinese fonts, by interviewing typographers in Taiwan. I'll answer your questions with my own knowledge and some quotes from that piece.</p>
<p>The short answer is that it takes a lot of work, and a lot of time. As I wrote in the piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An experienced designer, working alone, can in under six months create a new font that covers dozens of Western languages. For a single Chinese font it takes a team of several designers at least two years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But while there are many more glyphs—units of a typeface—needed for Chinese and Japanese, the number does not go to the &quot;millions.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default set for English-language fonts contains about 230 glyphs. A font that covers all of the Latin scripts—that’s over 100 languages plus extra symbols—contains 840 glyphs, according to Březina. The simplified version of Chinese, used primarily in mainland China, requires nearly 7,000 glyphs. For traditional Chinese, used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the number of glyphs is 13,053.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's important to know two things about Chinese characters to get a better understanding of how this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters share a large number of &quot;strokes&quot;—the same motion or parts of characters are common across dozens of characters.</li>
<li>Even so, each character has slightly different aesthetics, and &quot;balance&quot; is of critical importance. So even if the strokes are the same, a character may need to be tweaked (there are many graphical examples showing this in my piece)</li>
</ul>
<p>The short answer is that CJK font design is much more of a team effort, while Western fonts can be designed chiefly by a single person or small number of people. There is much more detail in my story, I encourage you to read it, but let me know if y'all have other questions.</p>
<p>Edit: Please be aware that there is a huge amount of misinformation in this thread. For one thing, the numbers of characters being thrown around randomly are based on <em>number of Chinese characters that have ever existed</em>, not on numbers of glyphs needed to create a font. As I say above, a simplified Chinese font needs close to 7,000 glyphs, although there are by some accounts 100,000 total Chinese characters. Second, as u/sajatypeworks rightly points out, while characters do normally share many strokes, that does not help much in terms of completing a character for a typeface. Each stroke or radical appears slightly differently in the context of a given character, so automated tools cannot do much more than collect the relevant strokes or radicals for a designer to manipulate. As you can see from some of the images in my piece, collecting these strokes and radicals is hardly the end of the process, which is why the font has to go through dozens of iterations before completion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amateur font designer here. Did you know an LGC (Latin-Greek-Cyrillic) font, like the one you're reading right now, can also include hundreds or thousands of characters? Most widely used LGC fonts cover all 3 of those alphabets. There are a lot of variations on most of the letters with various accents, and of course those numbers are doubled with capitals and lower case. Different weights and styles must be designed (e.g. italic, condensed, bold; some professional fonts have over half a dozen weights with 50+ combinations, like Extra Light Expanded Italic). Also many fonts have extra characters that are ligatures (two letters stuck together), the most common being ff, fl, and fi. (The font I'm typing in on my mobile, Dosis, has ligatures for 2 of those 3.) Unlike CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) fonts, which are generally monospaced, LGC fonts must be kerned, meaning each and every pair of characters (including punctuation and both letter cases) must be manually assigned a value for how close together they should be in order to &quot;look right&quot;. This has to be done by a human eye because a machine has no idea what &quot;looks right&quot;.</p>
<p>TL:DR; It's a lot of work to design a font for a language like Chinese, but it should be appreciated that &quot;a ton of work&quot; is also normal for fonts used for English. That's why many quality fonts are <em>not</em> free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They often make faces that adults perceive as disgust when trying new foods, but it can just be a reaction to something they've never had before. It's new! There is a repeated exposures principle that suggests an infant or child should be exposed to a food 5-20 times before concluding that they do not like it. As kids get older they often become neophobic (afraid of new foods) and parents often pressure the kids to eat. Someone else mentioned that toddlers are at the stage where they are learning to exercise free will and will often rebel against eating the food the parent is pressuring them to eat.

<p>Sometimes it is just a power struggle, plain and simple.  The little one figures out that if they refuse what they are offered, they will get what they want.  I've even heard of kiddos being so hungry that they would cry all night from refusing to eat what was offered.  That is too much for most parents when the solution is simply giving in.</p>
<p>I was a pretty picky eater when I was young.  I just found something I liked and that's what I always wanted.  It wasn't the same thing all day every day, but the lunch I carried to school was the very same thing 5 days a week, for 5 years.  I don't remember not wanting other things, and my mom offered to make me other stuff, but I had my favorite and it was simple.  I was in my late 20s before I started to try &quot;new&quot; things.

<p>At this point they know they like these things and the parents aren't really offering great alternatives. Do you think it is chicken nuggets vs buttered crab? Nope, it is nuggets vs mangled steamed vegetables.

(Incase you were wondering yes his family is very overweight and yes I work with my son constantly to change his mind.) My daughter (now 2)eats anything and everything you give her without complaint. Carrots and broccoli? Yes. Bananas and grapes? Yes. Mom's dinner behind her back while she's taking care of big brother? Definitely yes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Product differentiation - They look distinctive so that consumers can tell at a glance that these are <em>exercise shoes</em> and not <em>regular shoes</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>Marketing - The shoes are trying to grab your attention at the point of sale, and they <em>look like</em> they have &quot;advanced exercise tech&quot; integrated into them.</li>
</ol>
<p>A similar analogy would be electric/hybrid cars and why they're all arguably ugly. Part of it is for actual function reasons, but a lot of it is because consumers who buy them deliberately want to look futuristic, stand out, and appear <em>different</em> from regular cars.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: Some people are replying about the hybrid vehicles part. I assure you this is a thing. There's been studies that (particularly when the hybrid/green trend began) &quot;green&quot; vehicle owners want to be acknowledged about being green. Here are some links:

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/business/04hybrid.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/business/04hybrid.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, more than half of the Prius buyers surveyed this spring by CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore., said the main reason they purchased their car was that “it makes a statement about me.”</p>
<p>“I really want people to know that I care about the environment,” said Joy Feasley of Philadelphia, owner of a green 2006 Prius. “I like that people stop and ask me how I like my car.”</p>
<p>“I felt like the Camry Hybrid was too subtle for the message I wanted to put out there,” Ms. Gatch said. “I wanted to have the biggest impact that I could, and the Prius puts out a clearer message.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this is just a strategy used by some manufacturers. Other brands like Tesla are trying to do the exact opposite, which is to appeal to a crowd that want a luxury tier green vehicle that looks sleek and normal. As green vehicles are becoming more commonplace, there will be less of a consumer need to stand out from the crowd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't ignore confirmation bias.  I have solid black running shoes.  Plenty of people don't buy &quot;ugly&quot; shoes.  You probably just don't remember it because they don't stand out.</p>
<p>Also, mathematics.  There are only so many solid colors one can go, and there are only so many shoes a company will offer at a certain time (though they often do have a lot).  Color combinations and schemes have more than one color so naturally you get more combinations.</p>
<p>If you had 10 solid colors, getting any sort of combination means combining by the other colors.  So 9.  10 x 9 is 90.  So there are 10 main colors and 90 other shoes with different schemes that can be made in a variety of ways.  Different patterns can be made whereas solid colors can't have different patterns.  Shoes might have different physical designs but you can recolor any design, so it balances out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are saying the visibility thing, which I think is valid. But my best guess is that it has to do more with compartmentalism. When you're going to go work out or run, you're dressing in a unique way. And you're looking down more often, I think shoe companies make their running shoes &quot;ugly&quot; or neon because when we see them we're instantly reminded of running or working out. When I see a neon shoe I immediately associate it with running, it makes me want to run, reminds me I haven't in a while, etc. and furthermore, when I'm wearing them while I'm running I look down and get a psychological burst of energy because I've associated wearing the shoe with working out. So you know. Bright shoe makes me wanna move. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they can.</p>
<p>People are often restricted to the sort of attire they can were at work, which usually means boring shades of black and brown.  When you are exercising, you can wear whatever you want.</p>
<p>Also, there is some confirmation bias here, you only notice the really ugly shoes, not the black ones that pass for dress shoes.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a whole collectible industry for athletic shoes, particular those endorsed by athletes.  They are not meant to be worn, and have distinctive colors and styles to set them apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running shoes come in many colors and designs. The brands that make running shoes make a variety of models every year. Every model has their own color schemes that tend to change year to year. There are two reasons that you would find ugly running shoes. The first is that the shoes that you see are the ugliest of color schemes for whatever shoe. The other is that you are falling prey to conformation bias and only remembering the particularly ugly ones. As someone who has run through many pairs of running shoes, there is nothing ugly about them. They aren't meant to be dress shoes or for any particular fashion, but they aren't deliberately made with clashing colors or whatever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
