<p>&quot;Cultures are shaped by the drugs that they take and that they suppress. We are a sugar, red meat, and alcohol culture primarily with tobacco to shore all that up. Think for a minute about a drug like coffee, caffeine. Every labor contract in Western civilization contains a clause which secures the worker’s right to halt the assembly line twice a day, to fuel up on a drug known to cause liver damage and all kinds of problems. Well now, why isn’t there a cannabis break?</p>
<p>The reason is, that caffeine perfectly fits in to a program that would have you busily screwing widgits onto wonkets and moving them along the assembly line. In other words, it promotes capitalist values. Performing repetitious tasks in a state of sort of glazed acceptance. Cannabis, on the other hand… what is always said about it? Makes you inefficient, lazy, uninterested in earning your Mercedes and your house…&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They implemented the &quot;Psychedelic Act of 1970&quot; (ban on all cognitive enhancing drugs, even ones used in scientific studies) to try to  arrest people that were in the civil rights movement &amp; the anti-war movement. Drugs like LSD, DMT, &amp; shrooms were huge in that community &amp; by implementing that act, they were able to disband those groups by throwing a lot of them in jail &amp; also discrediting them by giving them a criminal record, in turn - turning people against them.</p>
<p>That's the whole reason that Psychedelic Act of 1970 was put into place. What's sad is that they were doing studies at a lot of great colleges (like Harvard &amp; other Ivy league schools) seeing how drugs like psilocybin mushrooms could benefit in mental health, but the DEA went busting down doors, confiscating any &amp; all psychedelic drugs, ceasing anymore studies. There's actually a documentary that talks about a lot of this, it's really interesting, but I can't remember what it's called or where I seen it (I want to say YouTube, but I can't find it - if I do, I'll post it in this comment down below.)</p>
<p>If I remember correctly LSD was accidently discovered by a Scientist named <em>Albert Hofmann</em>, when he got some on his skin, while transporting it. It seeped into his skin, causing him to trip. Then I believe they started doing studies on it &amp; more &amp; more people started finding out about it, which led to the &quot;hippies&quot; era that we've all heard stories about. It was all legal then, &amp; people were protesting Vietnam, Civil Rights, going to Woodstock, partying, which all led to what I stated above.</p>
<p>Edit: correction of Albert Hofmann's name.            </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a 27 year old male. Great job, great girlfriend and some really close friends. </p>
<p>I began to notice I stuttered a lot when I was around 9-10. I was told it'd go away by adulthood but to this day, it shows up when I'm really excited, happy or in any positive mood. It's the strangest thing because my brain knows what I want to say but my mouth won't let it come out. Like the words are trapped in some sort of purgatory. </p>
<p>It's not so bad where people notice ALL the time but occasionally I'll get the &quot;poke fun&quot; at jist.</p>
<p>What's actually happening in my brain that is causing this? I've read way too many articles with various opinions to be sure so I thought I'd ask here. </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have social anxiety but i would describe stuttering(at least for me) as paralel to social anxiety.
Even while little when the stuttering was the worst, i would never stutter if i was alone or in the company or certain people. But in social settings or with certain people like my father,teacher,girls, friends i was trying to impress or even weird situations like answering the phone was nightmare for me.  </p>
<p>What helped me is what i see being recommended against social anxiety, number one being stop making it the defining thing in your life. People were already making fun of me so why care so much if i stutter. And the funny thing was the less i cared the less i stuttered.<br />
By college i even took a short job in phone support and within 1 week even answering phones that was my greatest fear was resolved.</p>
<p>i'm 30+ and i very rarely stutter mostly when i'm super eager to share something like when getting to the punchline of a good joke.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any definitive answers for you. But I have the same condition. Quite severe as a young child gradually learnt to deal with it and improve but it has never gone away. Most people wouldn't notice it these days but I notice it whenever I speak. It's just a lot of effort to speak for me. Constantly practising the words in my head and often pausing my speech or substituting words to avoid a stutter.</p>
<p>I've read several explanation and like you am not completely certain. One is that it is an involuntary action caused by a disconnect or inefficient in pathways within the brain. Another explanation was that it was actually an involuntary spasm of the vocal cords.</p>
<p>Personally I think it's likely there are a variety of causes because not everyone stutters the same. Some people repeat syllables, some people, get stuck and can't speak and for others it almost seems like an involuntary tick similar to tourette's syndrome.</p>
<p>Sorry I don't have any definitive info. However there are lots of people who experience it to one degree or another and there are ways to improve it. For me improvement has come from speech therapy, learning to relax, breath slowly and rehearse in my head. Even just accepting that it going to happen and owning it as a part of me has somehow helped. It was important to realise that I notice it a lot more then others do when I'm conversing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because this is ELI5 I'll try to keep it ELI5-style. You basically stutter because your brain is too far ahead of your mouth. That's all. I stuttered when I was really young and it was because I wanted to tell everyone so much and this much and this and this and my mouth just couldn't keep up.</p>
<p>My best friend's mom then gave me a very good word of advice: &quot;think before you speak&quot;. This means that you should literally visualise yourself (i.e. mouth movements) and hear yourself speak before you actually speak so your brain is in sync with your mouth. </p>
<p>Another reason why some people study is social anxiety, they stutter because they think that people will judge which makes them even more anxious which increases stuttering, it's a viscious cycle. Talk a bit slower, people will wait, no biggie. Besides, talking slowly and surely with a firm tone shows confidence. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that there are different reasons, but I've thought about it quite a bit since my childhood (a long while ago)</p>
<p>I use the way that I write a paper or even this response.  While I've been writing it, I've moved up and down the page typing a sentence or fixing another then coming back to my other line.  Although it was always just minor, I can only describe at the stutter in my case (and my daughter's) it seems to be that our mouths can't move as fast as our thoughts and we have to &quot;refind&quot; our place.  I know that everyone thinks faster than their mouths, but we will already be on another topic or thought about a thought and forget where we are in the original conversation.<br />
solution: I stop, create the entire sentence, thought, whatever in my head, THEN start talking.  My stuttering has almost completely stopped.  My daughter (tween), my wife and I will tell her, &quot;stop, figure out what you want to say, THEN tell us&quot; and we will wait the second or two it takes her and she speaks without stuttering.  I can only assume that it works as like a speed bump or something. </p>
<p>For cyan1618 where native tongue there's a stutter, but not when using 2nd language, I believe that although one begins to think in the 2nd language after awhile, there is still a level of thinking in native and thus a focus that's needed and it's enough to remove the stutter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an analogy that a five year old might understand.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a piece of paper. You get your crayon and divide the paper up into squares. In each square you can write a limited amount of information (for this example, let's say one letter), <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lsGrjPk.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>. If you tried to write any more information in each square, it would be unreadable because the crayon is too thick to write smaller letters.</p>
<p>You can make more storage space by creating a book using more than one sheet of paper. The extra paper costs more money compared to using a single sheet. Another way to make more space is to replace your crayon with something smaller, and more expensive, like a pen. You <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zlKIipz.jpg" target="_blank">can see</a> that more information would fit on the sheet compared to when you were using a crayon.</p>
<p>Once you've made your large storage device using multiple sheets of paper and a pen, you might want to make artificially smaller sizes (read about price discrimination for more on why you might want to do this). You can do this by removing some of the sheets, or by painting over some of your squares <a href="http://i.imgur.com/D8JNzAJ.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>.</p>
<p>To get back to your original question: The physical differences are different numbers of platters (the sheets of paper in the analogy), and different density on each platter (the different writing sizes in the analogy). Whether they cost the same depends on how a manufacturer decides to produce their different sizes. If they use fewer platters, it might cost less to make a smaller drive. If there is no physical difference and they just disable part of the drive for their smaller capacity drives (painting over squares in the analogy), then all sizes will cost the same to produce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are differences usually, and it depends on the type of drive.</p>
<p>Solid state drive use flash chips to store data. Larger drives either use more chips (up to the max that the controller can handle), or they use higher capacity chips. As a general rule, controllers that can handle more chips, larger chips, and faster chips tend to be more expensive.</p>
<p>Mechanical hard drives have platters with magnetic dust on them. The platter is divided up into sectors, and the orientation of the magnetic field determines whether each sector is a one or a zero. Larger drives have more platters, generally. It is possible to artificially limit the capacity of a platter in order to make additional sizes.</p>
<p>For both types of drives, size increases over time come from higher density. The flash chips in solid state drives improve every few years like CPUs (they are both silicon-based semiconductors). Mechanical hard drives advance more slowly.</p>
<p>In either case, simply adding more storage media (chips or platters) is a significant engineering problem, so improvements in capacity are tied to improvements in the underlying tech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ones and zeroes used in binary coding are stored within a disk within the hard drive called a platter. Just as you can magnetize a nail this platter is divided into billions of sections each one able to be magnetized or unmagnetized to represent a 0 or 1. Depending on how many sections you can make that platter into and how many platters you can fit into a hard drive dictates the amount of memory you can fit in it. </p>
<p>I was interested with this too so I decided to do some investigating and came up with this as he best explanation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking only of hard drives (not solid state drives):</p>
<p><strong>More space to write</strong></p>
<p>I want you to write a bunch of words, so I give you one sheet of paper and a big marker.  If I want you to write twice as many words, I can simply give you a second sheet of paper.  Hard drives store data on a spinning metal disc (called 'platters').  Once way to store more data is to just put more spinning discs in the hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>Smaller marker</strong></p>
<p>I have another sheet of paper, but I want you to write more words on it than you did the first time.  So I replace your big marker with a really nice fine-tip pen.  Now you can write your words smaller than before, so more words fit on the same sheet of paper.  In this case, 'improving the marker' on the hard drive isn't so much a physical change as it is a software change.  As time goes on, hard drive makers get better at packing more data into the same amount of space on a platter.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL,DR</strong>
Hard drive makers get better at writing data in smaller and smaller spaces over time.  They can also add more writing space by adding more metal frisbees (platters).  So in 2010, a drive might have used 1 platter to store 500Gb.  Thus, a 500Gb drive from that time would have one platter, while a 1Tb drive from that time would have 2 platters.  Fast forward a couple years, hard drive makers have better 'markers', and you can find a 1Tb hard drive with only a single platter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But if you are talking about same technology there's 2 options to double the hard disk capacity, double the number of disks inside or use only one side of them (in this case, halves the capacity).
On both cases there's a small savings on the lower capacity versions, as the components are cheap compared to the final price of the hard disk.  The big savings comes at quality control, if something doesn't work, there's a chance that part of it still works.  Selling it at cheaper prices reduces the work and increases the profit comparing to recycling.

<p>Later on, after birth, crying is probably a multi-factorial phenomenon. Mese_cam covers the evolutionary aspect well. As far as survival goes, crying is supposed to &quot;bring out&quot; the nurturing character in a mother so that the mom or if the mom is no longer around, someone else will care for the infant. Similar to why puppies smell so good! They make you want to cuddle and care for them to promote their survival. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some other animal babies vocalize quite often; for example, young birds beg for food and call if they are in distress. </p>
<p>Perhaps crying alerts the parents that the baby is in need, urging them to take care of the baby. </p>
<p>This may or may not be involved in psychology. Crying stresses out or annoys the parents, so they give the baby what it wants. Once the baby gets what it needs, the parents are rewarded with quiet, which encourages them to take better care of their child. This is an example of negative reinforcement, in which someone becomes more likely to repeat a behavior (caring for child) because performing that behavior reduces something negative (crying).</p>
<p>As others have said, humans are high in the food chain, so the benefits associated with crying (good parental care) outweigh potential drawbacks (attracting predators).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>*You might have only a few gigabytes of storage space, similar to the space in an iPod or a USB flash drive. Yet neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brain's memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes)</p>
<p>*... if your brain worked like a digital video recorder in a television, 2.5 petabytes would be enough to hold three million hours of TV shows. You would have to leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 years to use up all that storage.</p>

Memory depends on forming new neural connections, and the brain has a finite number of neurones and a limited space in which to add more connections between them. Yet in another sense a healthy brain can never stop learning.</p>
<p>There is really no such thing as ‘a memory’. When we remember a fact or an event that happened to us, many networks of interconnected cells are involved. Sometimes, if we can’t remember an event one way, we can bring it to mind another way using different connections.</p>
<p>As we age, and have more and more to remember, the connections get more complex. When our brains are overloaded the same neurones are used in multiple memories in very flexible ways. So we might become more likely to confuse events, or have other difficulties in remembering, but we can’t really say that we ‘run out of memory’.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The brain is contained in a finite space so most physicists would say it must contain finite information. But really, the limiting factor is the amount of information the brain actually stores. I don't think it's possible to actually have an opportunity to fill the brain up.</p>
<p>The brain naturally abstracts and forms new memories using old memories as a basis. You can't sit down and just memorize pages of unique information like random numbers. The brain will fight you the whole way on such a task. Normally, you remember enough to reconstruct a kind of accurate repesentation of your so-called memories and not much more. Of course you do this by relating current events to other things you've experienced. So when faced with the task of memorizing tons of unique information, the sort which might fill a hard drive, it's basically impossible.</p>
<p>I think it's silly how people try to quantify the brain's information capacity. We don't even know how memory works. One thing is certain--the magic storage number is not the number of synaptic connections in a brain. Information is also stored in chemical distributions, receptor densities, and probably a myriad things we don't even know about. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. As someone in the legal field,  I discuss this often with peers. Testifying under oath, subject to a felony charge of perjury, was traditionally a powerful tool in preserving judicial integrity; but that was a time when people were actually prosecuted for perjury. Now, too often people commit perjury and go unpunished. This is a situation where the principle of deterrence would assist in combating lying under oath. </p>
<p>It's important to note that people lying under oath to avoid serious prison time isn't a big problem because people already facing harsh penalties, if convicted, would of course risk a perjury charge. I won't go into an explanation as to why it <em>usually</em> doesn't affect the truth seeking process when a defendant lies under oath, because it's not really relevant to your original question. </p>
<p>Back to my initial point. Witnesses lie all the time under oath, and they probably would do it less frequently if people were prosecuted harshly for this offense. Without getting too political, many attorneys I associate with,  even democrats, feel Bill Clinton's avoidance of perjury charges showed the country that it's not a huge deal. Yes, he wasn't the first, nor the last to do it, but the publicity and coverage of his perjury shed light on the lack of prosecution in perjury charges. </p>
<p>Now, every president has likely committed acts that could have been investigated further and revealed <em>at least</em> probable cause to file charges; however,  Bill Clinton, without question committed perjury.
People argue that 'he only lied about a blowjob', but that's not the issue. This crime is unique in that it doesn't  matter what the crime being charged  (underlying offense) is, or what the potential crime that someone is avoiding by lying on the stand; it's unique because the punishment should be severe regardless of those factors since it undermines the entire judicial process. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: We don't punish people for perjury in the manner we should in order to sufficiently deter lying under oath. People that argue that deterrence doesn't work for things like drug use (since an addict will use when they get released because of their addiction, regardless of the prison time); would be objectively wrong to think deterrence isn't a proper approach to perjury, since people break that law <em>because</em> the risk of punishment is not severe enough--and lying under oath is something that any person (except someone clinical insane) makes a conscientious decision to do. (The statute makes the penalty severe enough,  but it's hardly ever prosecuted to the maximum permitted sentence). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The stability of an atom is determined not just by the atom in question, but the atoms that it could decay into as well. If an atom is heavier than another one plus the mass of any emitted radiation needed to get there, then it will be radioactive. This is because mass is energy (E=mc2) so extra mass means energy available to emit.</p>
<p>So the basic answer is &quot;because every Tc atom is heavier than a Mo or Ru atom of the same mass number plus the radiation emitted to turn into it&quot;.</p>
<p>Why that the case? A major part of it is that nuclei are lighter and therefore more stable when they have (separately) even numbers of protons and neutrons, because they like to pair up. Tc has 43 protons, so it's partially screwed on that count. Furthermore, Tc-98 is smack on the line of stability, but has 55 neutrons and is screwed on both counts (and Ru-98 is even-even of course, so that exacerbates the difference in mass). Its neighbors Tc-97 and -99 would have a good shot at being stable having even numbers of neutrons, but nuclear physics just happens to work out to make them barely able to decay to Mo-97 and Ru-99 (both are over the threshold by only about 300 keV, which is around 60% the mass of an electron).  The same concept goes for prometheum.</p>
<p>Why did the masses happen to work out this way for Tc when it doesn't for most other odd-proton elements? I'm a nuclear physicist that used to specialize in measuring nuclear masses, and I have long ago given up trying to understand how nuclear masses work. Nuclear theory is so complicated that it is basically unsolvable, so I can't point to any one effect that caused this. For now we just go out and measure the masses.</p>
<p>I know that's unsatisfying, but so is nuclear physics in the end.</p>

<li>whether a nucleus is radioactive or stable depends on the number of protons AND neutrons.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Hydrogen: Usually, a Hydrogen atom has a single proton in its nucleus. A small fraction of the Hydrogen on earth - in water, in our bodies, everywhere - has a proton AND a neutron. It's still stable. </p>
<p>An even tinier fraction, a tiny trace amount, has a proton and TWO neutrons. These &quot;Hydrogen-3&quot; nuclei are unstable - If you had a bottle of it and left it on a shelf, 12 years later you'd have a bottle half-filled with Hydrogen-3, the other half would have turned one of their neutrons onto a proton, becoming Helium-3. </p>
<p>You used to be able to buy little perspex necklace or keyring charms filled with Hydrogen-3 on the internet. The radioactive decay would make the gas glow in the dark.</p>
<p>After hundreds or thousands of years, you'd have no Hydrogen left in the bottle. </p>
<p>If you change the number of neutrons in a nucleus, you get different &quot;isotopes&quot; of the element. Some isotopes are stable, some decay very slowly, some decay very quickly. Some elements have no stable isotopes, such as Technetium, Promethium, but many others also - Uranium, Radium, Californium, for example ... anything beyond Lead on the periodic table.</p>
<p>Technetium and Promethium are special though.</p>
<p>Uranium is radioactive - eventually, a sample of Uranium would completely decay, leaving not a single atom left. However, the most stable isotope of Uranium takes 4.5 billion for just half to decay. That's right, 50% of the U-238 originally on earth is still around. </p>
<p>Hydrogen-3 is found on earth, even though it decays so quickly, because it's continually formed as the atmosphere gets bombarded by cosmic rays. </p>
<p>Other fast-decaying isotopes are found on earth because they are formed as a slow-decaying element decays. Thorium-234 decays in  matter of weeks, but an atom of Th-234 is produced every time a U-238 atom decays. There will always be Th-234 until the U-238 all runs out, billions of years after the sun fades into an inert ball of dark gas. </p>
<p>But Technetium is special. It has no stable isotopes. The only isotope that is produced at all naturally is Tc-99, which is a rare result of fission of U-235. U-235 which is already rare, usually just decays to Thorium-235, and even when it undergoes fission, usually doesn't produce Technetium. For all intents and purposes, Technetium doesn't occur naturally at all, and must be synthesized.</p>
<p>Promethium is similar. </p>
<p>These are not the only synthetic elements, but they are the two lightest, and so are quite special. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elements with odd proton numbers have far fewer stable isotopes than even elements, for reasons of the stability of pairing. Several dozen odd-atomic number elements lighter than lead have only ONE stable isotope (fluorine, sodium, aluminum, phosphorus, etc). Both Pm and Tc are odd elements (43 and 61).</p>
<p>The other instability comes with not having completed or near-completed nucleon quantum energy number &quot;shells&quot; for both neutrons and protons. The &quot;magic numbers&quot; that apply here are at 28, 50, and 82, and are most stable (lowest energy) when filled, or nearly filled. For example, tin, the element with 50 protons, has 10 stable isotopes, the most stable isotopes of any element (the next nearest is xenon with eight).</p>
<p>You can see that both Tc and Pm are in the middle of a magic number gap on proton count, and so is the number of neutrons needed to stabilize their various isotopes, even going up or down a few for different isotopes. </p>
<p>The upshot is that they just barely can't exist on a timescale compatible with being around for 4.6 billion years, and thus making it to the status of primordial elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>North Korea is already doing and has been doing it for the better part of a decade. Iran signed an agreement saying NOT to do it anymore.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's simply not possible for a private enterprise to achieve on its own. You need state knowledge and infrastructure to make it work.</p>
<p>First off, it's a lot more expensive than you think. Elon Musk has a lot of money. His net worth is about $16.7 billion dollars. The Manhattan Project, adjusted for inflation, cost about $25 billion dollars, so even if Musk liquidated all of his assets, he still would come up short, and that's not to mention that the only reason SpaceX is successful in the first place is because of huge investments by the US government.</p>
<p>Second, it's lot harder on a technical level than just getting some uranium. Not only do you need the materials and infrastructure, but you also need the scientific knowledge, which is some of the most closely guarded information in the world.</p>
<p>So what would this hypothetical evil genius billionaire have to do? First they would need to obtain vast quantities of uranium. Then build a huge plant of centrifuges to enrich it into a usable form, or alternatively build a reactor to turn it into plutonium. Then he'd have to hire hundreds if not thousands of workers to operate the plants. Then he'd need a team of the best physicists in the world to work out the math, or the best spies in the world to steal it from a nation that already has it. This would all have to be done in <em>complete secret</em>.</p>
<p>How likely would this be in the future? I can't know for sure, but given how much effort it takes, it seems highly unlikely. A more likely (although how <em>much</em> more likely I can't speculate) is for a person or organization to steal a bomb from a nation with lax security, or to steal/buy some weapons-grade material to make a crude device of their own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CONTEXT:
During a recent brief discussion with my doctor I asked whether there was a benefit for people who used Ritalin, but aren't diagnosed with ADHD. She responded by saying that there isn't one and that, that's one way specialists are able to tell, besides tests and what not. This comment left me somewhat confused as I'm aware that there is quite a large market around selling Ritalin/Adderall illegally, hence the heavy regulations on prescriptions. On one hand I know it's popular with university students to assist with studying, however, on the other hand I've heard that people abuse it to gain a high. </p>
<p>QUESTION:
Are the people who obtain and use it illegally for the assistance they gain with studying/working, people who have ADHD but haven't sought out a specialist to get a diagnosis. While the people who use it for the purpose of getting high do not have ADHD?</p>
<p>If so, what difference in an individual's brain chemistry causes this drug to react to react differently for people who have it versus the people who don't. </p>

<p>If someone gains the intended effects of Ritalin/Adderall does this confirm they have ADHD? And that getting a high from taking it, is indicative of not having it? If yes, chemically speaking, why?</p></div></div>

<p><strong>AND NOTHING I'M SAYING BELOW SHOULD BE CONSTRUED TO BE MEDICAL ADVICE. TALK TO YOUR PHYSICIAN IF YOU HAVE PERSONAL QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research says that amphetamine/methylphenidate  stimulants can improve attention/processing speed for everyone. EDIT: THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT ABUSING STIMULANT DRUGS IS OKAY OR EVEN BENEFICIAL. ONLY TAKE ADHD MEDICATION YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBES YOU. PERIOD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved cognition with stimulants does not therefore equal a diagnosis of ADHD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A poor response to stimulants also does not equal the absence of ADHD. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The downregulation of dopamine receptors with long term use contributes to both dependency and withdrawal effects upon discontinuation. The research is unclear if this (at least to some degree) is permanent or not. </p>
</li>
<li>There's a big difference between a developing brain and an adult brain with respect to the benefits of stimulant therapy on frontal lobe development. That is, kids with ADHD on stimulants may develop more &quot;normal&quot; brains as they mature and adults with ADHD are likely stuck with lifelong frontal lobe dysfunction. </li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT (and my only edit): Please note that I cannot and will not give any medical advice. For my point #5: ADHD is predominately a frontal lobe disorder (more specifically, a dopaminergic/noradrenergic disorder - and possibly one could add GABA &amp; glutamate to that list as well). As such, if you &quot;have&quot; ADHD as an adult (as defined by your frontal lobe maturation ending), it is a lifelong disorder; however, you can learn how to compensate so well that you no longer experience daily functional problems. </p>
<p>This is why learning to cope/compensate for ADHD is as equally important as pharmacological therapies since the latter may be contraindicated in some folks depending on their health status/comorbid conditions. Finally, just because a kid has ADHD does not mean that stimulant medication is ALWAYS beneficial for frontal lobe development or daily functioning - there are so many factors related to long-term development and daily functioning that any one factor (such as ADHD meds) cannot explain ALL of the developmental trajectory of the frontal lobe. </p>
<p>There are also many many many contraindications to stimulant use and not all ADHD needs to be treated via stimulant medication. IMO, way too many people/kids with ADHD are treated via stimulants instead of first trying behavioral/environmental modification and therapies first. I'll say it again: abusing stimulant compounds is not okay and may be harmful for your health/brain. Lastly, some kids with ADHD (non-medicated) grow out of it (up to 30% in some studies I believe). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I spent the last 3 years studying stimulant abuse for my doctorate degree! Finally, my time to shine! Most people in this thread have reasonable answers, but they don't have a complete picture. So let me try to answer your question.</p>
<p>ADHD is caused because the part of your brain that needs to be firing to prevent you from getting distracted is not firing anymore. This is usually caused by a lack of dopamine (among another neurotransmitters). Stimulant medication can increase your dopamine in that part of your brain, thereby helping it control the other parts that keep finding new ways to distract you, thereby helping you focus.</p>
<p>What stimulants do in people without ADHD is a question nobody knows the correct answer to. When the FDA approves a stimulant medication, they base it on evidence collected during a clinical trial on people who have ADHD. There have been no trials conducted on people without ADHD to test efficacy of stimulants. But based on our knowledge of physiology, and pharmacology, we can make some decent guesses as to what will happen.  People who don't have ADHD but take stimulants anyway will experience an effect similar to that of crystal meth, but on a much smaller scale. It will provide temporary improvement in focus, short term memory, and attention. Whether this improvement is as high as among those who have ADHD is a question we don't know the answer to, but we expect that it will be lower. We also expect that there will no long term benefits to stimulant use with regard to memory, and focus. </p>
<p>What we do know is that the illegal market for stimulants make people without ADHD think they have it (because they see benefits from stimulant use) leading to an increase in overdiagnosis of ADHD. ADHD is also very difficult to diagnose and very easy to fake, especially for family or general practitioners. We also know the side effects stimulants cause, which most certainly hold true even among those without ADHD. These include heart palpitations, metabolic effects including loss of hunger, mental illnesses like anxiety or depression, and even addiction.. people who do not have ADHD but are addicted to stimulants will reach a point where there brain will decrease producing dopamine in order to account for all the extra dopamine coming from the drug. That's the brain's way of trying to go back to normal. After a few years of use, your brain will now chronically under-produce dopamine leading to the same symptoms as someone with ADHD. So you could essentially give yourself a version of ADHD by overusing stimulants. </p>
<p>My research, in case anyone's interested, is in trying to identify people who are lying about ADHD symptoms or are trying to doctor shop prescriptions for abuse or resale. If you have any questions, ask away! </p>
<p>EDIT1: Added a few more lines based on the topics discussed elsewhere in this thread. Some very dangerous info is out there in some comments. Please be careful.</p>
<p>EDIT2: TL;DR: There are no published clinical trials looking into stimulant use in people without ADHD. But we expect that there will be some short term attention improvement, with no long term benefits. But long term use of stimulants can cause mental illnesses, metabolic issues, cardiac problems, and addiction. Addiction to stimulants will impair your brain performance, essentially giving you a kind of ADHD itself! Be careful, and stay away from stimulants if you don't have ADHD. If you aren't sure if you have ADHD, go see a psychologist!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your doctor is incorrect, but incorrect in a way that is pretty common.  If you give everyone in a class stimulants, almost everyone will have improved focus and a better ability to attend to and complete tasks.  Basically everyone does better on a little bit of stimulant.  That response doesn't confirm anything about what else might be going on in the person's executive functioning or impulse control.  It most certainly isn't a confirmation of a diagnosis of any behavioral disorder, and, just as importantly, it doesn't have anything at all to do with the mechanism of action of a behavioral disorder.  </p>
<p>It's such a weird logical fallacy that people have bought into regarding the relationship between the actions of a medication and the cause(s) of behavioral disorders.  It's made even stranger because it's predicated on a desire to find biological causes for mental disorders, but the same reasoning would be almost always roundly dismissed in physical medicine.  For instance, my father for months has had substantial pain and swelling in his jaw.  As they have sought to ameliorate that, the doctors have treated those symptoms without ever suggesting that the treatment defined the problem.  They gave him Oxycodone for the pain, but never suggested that his &quot;problem&quot; was a lack of opiates in his body or a lack of dopamine in his brain.  They gave him steroids for the swelling, but never once tried to argue that because the pain was alleviated when the swelling was reduced that must mean that the swelling was the cause of the problem.  Yes, the swelling caused the pain, but it turns out that a bone infection caused the swelling.  The action of the steroids was entirely focused on and defining of the symptoms, and not the cause.</p>
<p>TL; DR:  Everyone does better on low dose stimulants, and doing better based on the understood mechanisms of that class of drugs tells us almost nothing about what is going on with the person in any other way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD and have been on Adderall for a year and a half now. Disclaimer: I don't have a degree in this, I've just been to a lot of doctors and researched a lot on my own.</p>
<p>Background on ADHD: people who have ADHD suffer from what is basically a malfunctioning reward system. Our brains may not reward us with good feelings when we successfully complete a task, or give us an energy boost to finish when the end of a task is in sight. This failure manifests in the person as lack of motivation, inability to pay attention, and inability to finish tasks. While there are of course other facets to ADHD, these are the parts stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin treat.</p>
<p>Background on Adderall: also called amphetamine, or amphetamine salts, Adderall is a stimulant in the same category as (arguably very similar to) methamphetamine. It functions as a dopamine and norepinephrine agonizer; it stimulates your brain to produce more dopamine (used to reward yourself​, think of that satisfied when you have done something well) and norepinephrine (gives you more energy, promotes &quot;vigilance&quot; and focus, aids you in memory formation).</p>
<p>Now, for your questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone gains the intended effects of Ritalin/Adderall does this confirm they have ADHD?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly, but it's definitely useful to know. ADHD is a spectrum; many people who do not feel that it affects their lives enough for medication would still feel some focusing effect. Also, even if you do not have ADHD it will still act as a stimulant and theoretically enhance memory formation, so many people will use it to study for tests. I don't recommend this at all, but it could keep you alert long enough to study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that getting a high from taking it, is indicative of not having it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost everyone still gets some sort of high the first time they take it. At medicinal doses it's very mild. Part of the difference is that recreational doses can often be very high. However, you're not wrong in thinking something about the brain chemistry of a person with ADHD causes you to feel less of a high: Adderall often helps us to produce dopamine at the correct time, but if you already do that it may cause your brain to produce it <em>more</em> than necessary and get you high.</p>
<p>I would be happy to answer questions, but my Adderall is kicking in and it's time for me to go to work so I'll have to stop this explanation here. Feel free to comment or message me. I'd be happy to dig up some articles about the various things I've talked about if anyone wants to read further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I applied some anti-itch cream which seemed to help, but I couldn't help but wonder why we have pills for certain types of allergies and not for, say, a mosquito saliva allergy.</p>
<p>Am I missing something here? Are all allergies really that different? If so what makes them that way?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are.  </p>
<p>The problem with some allergic reactions eg peanuts, is the rate of onset of the reaction.  This is mostly due to either the concentration of the the allergen or the host's sensitivity to a particular allergen.  </p>
<p>Your seasonal allergy medicine is designed to work against a relatively low level of physiological reaction (low concentration of antigen or lower immune response).  Meanwhile, high dose epinephrine (eg. EpiPen) can counter the inflammatory response to a high level allergic reaction. </p>
<p>The main reason that we don't take those medications on a continual preventative basis is that the side effects include all sorts of bad things up to and including cardiac arrest.  So most of the time, people are better off waiting until they start having a reaction and then taking their medicine, if they have a known allergy problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do allergenic extract review with a national regulator and there are plenty of peanut extracts coming through the pipeline in tablet form. The major factor is development time, but another issue is their status as biologics.</p>
<p>Currently, many countries don't regulate them as stringently as injectables, but that is slowly changing. By the time some products make it to review in one country, they may start to be regulated differently in their home country/region. This can cause delays in the review process or time to submission by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>TL;DR they're coming, for everything</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the severity of the allergic reaction and the risk of the allergy that determines whether or not an anti-histamine (allergy medication) can take care of it. If someone has a really mild peanut allergy that only causes itchy eyes or hives, Benadryl can probably take care of it. They still should just avoid peanuts, though, because they are still at risk of an anaphylactic reaction with peanuts, in which blood pressure drops and airways narrow. Anaphylactic reactions are life threatening and is treated with epinephrine since it acts fast enough. An anti-histamine simply does not act fast enough and isn't &quot;strong enough&quot; to handle severe allergic reactions. Seasonal allergies are generally on the milder end of allergic reactions, so anti-histamines can handle them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies in medical parlance are known as hypersensitivity reactions, and there are 4 or 5 different types of these reactions.  This wikipedia page covers it well:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity</a></p>
<p>The core differences between these type of reactions is whether body mounts a systemic (i.e. entire body) response, or localized (i.e. at the site of mosquito bite) response.  A secondary difference is the speed with which the body responds. </p>
<p>For class 1 reactions (a true anaphylaxis to peanuts), the reaction is the entire body and within minutes.  It tends to cause almost immediate swelling of the tongue, airway, esophagus, and can compromise the airway (i.e. choke someone).   Please note, not all people who are allergic to peanuts have a class 1 reaction, any of them are possible.  This can be confusing.</p>
<p>Similarly, a mosquito bite is typically a class 4 reaction; hallmarked by swelling at the site of the bite only and taking minutes to hours to manifest.  That said a mosquito bite can rarely be a class 1 reaction, and immediately life-threatening.  </p>
<p>So, the class of reaction determines which level of medicine(s) should be employed.  For someone having a class 1 reaction they will get a cocktail of epinephrine (adrenaline), diphenhydramine (benadryl), pepcid, and hydrocortisone along with humidified oxygen and intubation (a breathing tube) if necessary.  All of these medicines/ interventions also have side effects - some strong - so should not be utilized for other classes of reactions.  </p>
<p>So for your mosquito bite, the topical cream probably was best.  Most oral or IV medications would effect all parts of your body, rather than only the itchy spot.  Most of these medications would make you sleepy, confused, and even lower your immune system.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
