		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rap is simply the act of rapping, which is spoken word lyricism, usually with a flow or delivery that matches the beat it's delivered over. Rap is often utilised in hip-hop music, but you can have hip-hop music without rap. Rap is also utilised heavily in grime and, to a lesser extent, metal and rock, and I'm sure also in a plethora of other genres that I'm personally unaware of.</p>
<p>Hip-hop is a culture, but is often also used to describe a music genre born of this culture. Hip-hop music is often  associated with DJing, turntabling, scratching and sampling. As previously stated, rapping is often a part of Hip-hop music but is not a necessity. </p>
<p>Edit: there's so much more that I could put in this, but for the sake of assuming OP is an old man after a quick answer I tried to make it quite concise. There are a lot of aspects of Hip-hop culture that I've not included, some great examples are given by others in this thread </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Jazz can exist without singing, singing is an element of jazz that is optional and not limited to jazz alone. Singing can also be found in other genres and jazz without singing is still jazz. </p>
<p>Equally hip-hop can exist without rap, rap is an element of hip-hop that is optional. There's a ton of instrumental hip-hop or music with just singing that I would still categorize as hip-hop. Also rap isn't limited to hip-hop alone. Nu-metal (Linkin Park) is a good example but by now most major genres feature rap at some point. Also, as others have mentioned, hip-hop turned into a culture that reaches beyond music (graffiti, dance, etc) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not even what you said. A computer can quite easily lie about quite a few things, and often does for backwards compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>There's nothing that says that a computer must allow software to interrogate it about its capabilities, either. It's perfectly possible to have a computer that has no straightforward way of asking how much RAM it has, other than trying to write to an address and seeing what happens, while accounting for that addresses might wrap around at some point.</p>
<p>In fact, the ability to figure out what's inside a computer is quite new. In the 90s and earlier configuration used to be a lot trickier because there wasn't an easy and convenient way of asking the computer what sound card it had inside. Code wanting to do autodetection had to very carefully try to poke at things to figure out whether there was a soundcard at a given IRQ, DMA and IO addresses, and hope that this wouldn't happen to send a signal to something else, which might get misinterpreted in some awful manner -- from a crash to disk corruption.</p>
<p>And then there's emulation, which can go really far. With console emulators you usually have the emulator not only emulate the hardware and instruction set, but also the timing and various hardware glitches. Some things like precise timing can be hard to emulate, but only for practical reasons, and not because it's impossible. An emulator could achieve absolute perfection and make it impossible for a program running inside to determine it's being emulated.</p>
<p>Now if you're familiar with virtualization, today most systems don't try to hide their existence, but even there you see this: If you assign a VM 1GB and 2 cores of a 64GB, 32 core machine, as far as the software running inside can tell, you only have 1GB and 2 cores, as well as a Cirrus video card and Realtek network card, neither of which you probably physically have, but that for whatever reason turned out to be convenient to emulate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>Lets take the simplest case imaginable. Imagine a voltage source V driving one end of resistive divider (two equal R's in series). The only available output to be probed is the point between the 2 resistors. This output, when unloaded, will generate an output voltage of V/2.</p>
<p>Now imagine if you didn't know the structure of this circuit, but rather only had access the output node. Furthermore suppose the only diagnostic tools (UNDER SOFTWARE CONTROL) you had are :</p>
<p>1) hang a known current load on the output node and use a volt meter to measure the resulting voltage of the output node.</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>2) attach a known voltage source to the output node and use ammeter in series to measure the current that sinks into the voltage source.</p>
<p>Could you use the above to determine the structure of the circuit ,i.e. that is a voltage source V driving 2 series R??</p>
<p>No because the voltage divider has an equivalent circuit called a Thevenin equivalent (in this case a voltage source of V/2 with single resistor of value R/2 between the voltage source and output node).</p>
<p>Neither of the  two probing instruments listed  in #1 and #2 can distinguish between the original 3 component circuit and the functional equivalent 2 component circuit.  </p>
<p>There is also a Norton equivalent for the original circuit (composed of a current source and resistor in parallel) that also mimics the original circuit.  And again the instruments cannot distinguish between the two, as long as it has access only to the output node.</p>
<p>Note the  original circuit and its  Thevenin and Norton equivalents are truly different implementations.  The original circuit actively consumes power even if the output node has nothing attached to it, whereas the Thevenin equivalent consumes no power.</p>
<p>Note that if we had access to all 3 node in the original circuit, then we could distinguish among the 3 different implementations.</p>
<p>This is just a 3 component circuit. A computer has ~1 billion transistors and other components and only  limited &quot;output&quot; nodes to probe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but in a very limited way. You can query using methods which are meant for identifying components, like the CPUID instruction for identifying the CPU, scanning the PCI bus, or reading RAM SPD EEPROM. You can run various benchmarks which could help you determine things like the size of caches, or hint what algorithm could be used for some complex instructions whose execution time varies. You can also explore behaviour which is undocumented, insufficiently documented or potentially buggy. Differences in this kind of behaviour can be used to identify hardware and sometimes gain a bit of insight about how it's implemented.</p>
<p>This all gives very minimal information compared to the complexity of a modern CPU. There are also all sorts of variations that are possible without affecting behaviour, so you cannot detect them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>No, you can <em>query</em> your hardware's controller(s) for those. They make their best efforts to give you accurate information, but even h/w controllers can malfunction and be misconfigured.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Symptoms of the flu are actually often caused by your body trying to rid itself of the virus; high fever is a way to try and kill the virus by essentially cooking it, but in the process destroys a lot of your own cells, which can make you feel tired and shitty.
Increased mucus production is a way to try and expel the virus from your system by trapping it, then sneezing or coughing it out. Tiredness can also be a result of energy being funnelled into your immune system to try and combat the virus.
The virus affects you by invading your cells, reprogramming them to create more viruses, then lysing (exploding) them, which can result in overall reduced physiological function.
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are also a bodily response to try and expel the virus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>these symptoms are grouped as &quot;flu like symptoms&quot;, and are very common and somewhat useless to diagnose anything without other symptoms- you might have a mild stomach virus, a cold, or something far worse. </p>

Except in more extreme cases, the damage actually done by the viruses is pretty negligible to your body as a functional unit.</p>
<p>EDIT: Should say though, I study biochemistry, which it pretty far removed from any practical clinical experience, so anyone with that feel free to overrule me!</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Actually though, as an extension to OP's question.. appetite? What is the biological reason to lose your appetite when you're ill? Do you not want to dedicate resources to the gut rather than the site of infection. Or to avoid eating more food that may contain pathogens?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're an American, it's important to recognize that what Americans call <em>liberal</em> much of the rest of the world calls moderate.  Reddit is an international platform, and a large number of people on Reddit would accurately describe themselves as being moderate, not liberal, but from an American perspective, they are liberal.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out the polarization of American politics has created a shift in perspective, where the right is getting more and more right, again making moderates <em>appear</em> to be more liberal than they are.  That also leads to more closed-group echo chambers like r/The_Donald: the conservatives concentrate themselves into smaller areas and become more vocal while moderates and liberals spread out more.</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that in addition to polarization, there are topics which have become very politicized which aren't political issues.  The best example of this would be global climate change.  It isn't &quot;liberal&quot; to believe in global climate change, it's common sense, but the issue has been made political so that [many] conservatives <em>don't</em> believe it to be true as part of their party line.  Not believing in climate change is a <em>fairly</em> American conservative idea, although by no means unique to American politics.  Likewise, denying evolution is a fairly American thing.  What is perceived as &quot;liberal&quot; bias in social media may just be the overwhelming consensus of the rest of the world accepting those things as factually correct - something the right is more or less unwilling to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: Answer is part speculation, but mostly educated guesses backed by facts with cited sources.</p>
<p>A lot of small things that add up.  First off, remember that Reddit  obviously is not the only online social media site.  Facebook <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/fake-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook-before-us-election-report-2016-11" target="_blank">trafficked</a> a large amount of fake news, and regardless of how you categorize this argument, many people on Facebook reposted these stories, and many Americans, both conservative and liberal, are prone to <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/12/15/many-americans-believe-fake-news-is-sowing-confusion/" target="_blank">believe</a> very erroneous news stories.  Based on these statistics <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/" target="_blank">here</a>, you could sort of draw a correlation between more Facebook users and more liberal-minded users, but that's a bit dubious, and this is one of the few times I'm dubious of this survey.  Facebook <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/25/the-political-environment-on-social-media/" target="_blank">clearly</a> figured out an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/us/politics/facebook-ads-politics.html" target="_blank">algorithm</a> to identify users' political ideology, but AFAIK hasn't shared its results, and hasn't shared its accuracy.  </p>
<p>So where does this leave Reddit?  Well, a <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/" target="_blank">recent</a> poll
indicated that more were liberal than conservative users, but the differences were not overwhelming, although there were far more men than women.  Many users self identified as &quot;moderate&quot;, which partly answers the question.  If slightly more users are liberal, or have liberal than conservative leanings, and a larger number are &quot;moderate&quot;, then in reactionary or controversial stories <em>where moderate users will typically remain distant or neutral</em>, more conservative users may find themselves in a minority, and their stories gaining less attention.  Now, this will not happen all the time or with every story, but as I noted, partly answers the question.</p>
<p>Another reason that partly answers the question is the current political climate has hyper-polarized political views [no citation necessary], and a user with what was once a moderate conservative (or liberal) viewpoint will consistently find himself or herself forced to align with increasingly right (or left) positions to find allies, or simply abandon that position completely.  This occurrence is not only on Reddit, but in general.  This is significant here, because conservative/liberal views are increasingly being identified with more radicalized positions.  Examples would be Republicans at least implicitly supporting Trump's stance and attitudes toward women, or Democrats supporting Hillary Clinton's (from Bernie Sanders) College Affordability Plan.  Individuals will react to this in a variety of ways, further increasing the complexity and difficulty in answering this question.  Conservatives who are emphatically in favor of women's rights may feel nervous about posting and defending Republican positions, or they may double down and defend the position and candidate even harder.  Liberals may point to real or perceived offenses from conservative counterparts in their posts, thereby driving a deeper wedge between liberals and conservatives and strengthening unity among liberals.</p>
<p>Continuing with the previous reason, Trump <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/clinton-trump-twitter/" target="_blank">communicates</a> with his supporters via email and Twitter, which in itself would not preclude supporters from being active on Reddit, but at the same time not necessarily encourage more active involvement in Reddit instead of Twitter. </p>
<p>Inertia also plays a factor.  Users who, by chance or any other reason, happened to start using Reddit initially, will tend to keep using Reddit, and will tend to gravitate toward and prefer similar-minded topics in their news and discussions.</p>
<p>TL;DR Many small reasons</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I can't answer your question specifically but I do recall there are species of spider that have lungs vs other spiders which don't. I will say this though, Oxygen is generally viewed by the world as being this pure and wholesome thing. In reality, the appearance of oxygen killed off a huge amount of life (great oxidation event). Oxygen has a dark side, like jekyl and hyde. An alternate viewpoint sees oxygen delivery systems such as hemoglobin etc to be a way of regulating the delivery of oxygen to cells, as too much can be toxic.</p>
<p>In fact, the use of oxygen to make energy (atp) generates a lot of free radicals (basically oxygen with an extra electron) and a metabolite of heme (bilirubin/biliverdin) acts in the mitochondria to mop up these radicals.</p>
<p>In terms of your question, I think it's important to know that we share a very similar set of enzymes with bacteria and plants relating to energy generation and oxygen use, and that these enzymes are widespread and conserved  throughout the tree of life.</p>

<p>In short, playgrounds are all developed for specific ages and the equipment is designed to help develop physical and social attributes. I'll need to go back to my old notes for the exact age breakdowns but basically: very young ages to help build balance and coordination and motor skills, toddler-child age the equipment focuses on building strength in children (monkey bars, see-saws) and social skills (fake climbing walls, swings, etc.). And parks for adults focus on a mix of physical and social (basketball courts, tennis, disc golf, etc).</p>
<p>Slides, see saws and other playground equipment don't have stringent standards besides safety standards (although this is changing more and more as research on safety and play habits increases) but standard playground equipment all have a specific purpose depending on the age, skills, and intent of use for the target demographic. (classic park for children vs basketball &amp;  tennis courts for adults vs walking, scenic or gardens for seniors). </p>
<p>More diverse playground equipment is being made to include multiple ages and developmental goals but it's also why in certain areas you can find out dated equipment that appears sketchy or downright dangerous but is always more fun than hyper safe new equipment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;The first playground was built in Manchester, England, but the idea of playgrounds was first developed in Germany. Playgrounds were presented as a way to teach children how to play safely and fairly with one another. The first sketched concept of a playground was produced in 1848 by Henry Barnard and featured a large, shaded area with teachers looking on as children played with wooden blocks, toy carts, and two rotary swings. However, it would be another 39 years before the first playground was built in America, and in the meantime, children needed a safe, designated place to play games. Many children, especially in urban areas, played in the streets or on curbs, and there was constant danger from being hit by passing cars. &quot;Play streets,&quot; or streets largely ignored by road traffic, were a popular option for children to seek out.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It appears that the earliest &quot;modern&quot; playground came about in the late 19th century at Hull House in Chicago, followed closely by ones in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Pittsburg, and Denver. The playground at Hull House had swings, sand piles, hammocks, and a maypole, and the motivation for creating these spaces was to promote socialization and to keep children safe and out of the streets.</p>
<p>As to why we see certain standardized pieces in playgrounds, it appears to have evolved into its current form with ever-growing safety concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “standardized playground” era... reflected the design and redesign of manufactured playground equipment, primarily the four S’s -swings, slides, see-saws, superstructures, and the prevalence of surrounding hard surfaces typically seen on American playgrounds throughout much of the 20th century. During the 1970’s and 1980’s standardizing playground equipment developed simultaneously with concerns about playground injuries, increasing lawsuits, and formation of task forces to prepare national standards for playground equipment safety (Kutska, 2011). Executive Director of the International Playground Safety Institute, authored the most comprehensive reference addressing current playground safety data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would also imagine those &quot;Four S's&quot; are fairly cheap to manufacture on a large scale.</p>
<p>TL;DR: They're relatively &quot;safe&quot; and easy to manufacture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow - Something I can actually answer.  I'm a designer at a custom playground design build firm. </p>
<p>The typical modern playground - often called post and deck has been around for about 30 years.  It was developed by a guy named Jay Beckwith in collaboration with a large European playground company.  The idea was that it could be modular and include lots of different elements that could be be attached - Slide, climbing bars,  sliding pole... Etc.  It's only in the last year or two that post and deck has been getting subbed out for other systems. </p>
<p>Truthfully, I'm not as sure about swings - they have been around quite a while. Generally I think they are standard in a playground because the goal of any playground design is to have a diversity of experiences - movement based play (swings,  see saws, slides etc) - climbing/balancing - passive (hiding) - the list goes on. Swings are a cost efficient and relatively safe way to provide some movement based play. </p>
<p>I don't see loads of see saws anymore. Risk of injury on them tends to be higher so the demand for them tanked. </p>
<p>Over time trends in playground equipment are typically set by our tolerance for risk. More and more the tolerance has been on the decline - which in my perspective is a detriment to the development of kids. In such a litigious environment cities and communities don't want anything that might increase their chance of getting sued. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey sweet, I wrote a thesis paper relating to this question! </p>
<p>The domain of play has seriously shrunk since the early 1900s. Kids used to have to create their own fun by playing in the streets, forests, empty lots, whatever they could find. When cars became a more popular, affordable form of transportation, play started to diminish because it was more dangerous for kids to be running around on the streets. Some early forms of playgrounds, which are still used in Europe but never gained popularity like adventure/&quot;junk&quot; playgrounds basically put a bunch of building supplies in front of kids and from there on children built their own play equipment. </p>
<p>In North America, mass production and a growing trend in parenting styles where child safety became a top priority ensured the streamlining of equipment basically up to what you'd find in most playgrounds across America. Different organizations release reports on injuries every year, and different equipment is dropped when it's considered &quot;too dangerous&quot; for kids. </p>
<p>What most parents aren't really aware of is the fact that playgrounds are meant to be a little bit dangerous, because they are designed for the development of skills like risk assessment and team building. If there are any parents reading this now-- let your kids on the playground as long as the surfacing (what's under the play equipment) isn't hard like concrete or a thin layer of sand. That's what really causes the injuries!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because muscle cells (also called muscle fibers) don't divide, and cancer is most common in cells that divide a lot. Dividing cells are primed for cancer because:
1) a lot of the machinery needed to divide rapidly is already present in the cell so not a lot extra is needed to make it grow uncontrollably into a tumor/cancer
2) the more a cell divides the more chances it has to make errors. DNA replication isn't perfect, and over time these errors can accumulate into dangerous mutations (this is also why cancer is more common in the elderly)
This is why we see a lot of cancer in tissues with a high &quot;cellular turnover&quot; rate - skin, liver, colon, etc. Cells that never divide (muscle fibers, neurons) almost never get cancer. Brain cancer is usually caused by a special type of brain cell that can divide (but not signal) call neuroglia, which forms the cancerous &quot;glioma.&quot;
Bonus biology fact - because muscle cells fibers don't divide, you have the same number your whole life. Arnold Schwarzenegger has the same number of muscle fibers now as he did as a baby, they're just more packed with the good stuff.

The heart stop growing at a very young age compared to other organs, and the rarer the cells are regenerate, the rarer the type of cancer is. </p>
<p>That's because heart cancer is such a rare type of cancer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>Cancer is a set of diseases where cell division goes wrong and the cells divide uncontrollably. </li>
<li>Your body is made up of many different cell types which have different rates of division.</li>
<li>Skin cells are replaced every 2 weeks, red blood cells every 4 weeks, muscle cells every 16 years.</li>
<li>The heart is made of muscle.</li>
<li>Heart cells therefore divide <em>very</em> slowly, making division errors uncommon and heart cancer rare.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Phases" target="_blank">17 known phases of ice</a>. When you deal with ice, you are almost always dealing with I_h which expands as it freezes. However, at different temperatures and pressures (pressure being the more important one here) different types of ice form. In the case of staying close(ish) to regular freezing temperature, and upping pressure until ice forms, you'd end up at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_III" target="_blank">Ice III</a>. </p>
<p>You're unlikely to see this outside of a lab though, since you need to put water into a container which can withstand over 43,000 PSI of pressure, otherwise the ice wins and will crack the container. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A few days ago I wanted beer chilled quickly. I put the glass bottle into a plastic cup which I then filled with ice and water.</p>
<p>I promptly forgot about the beer and opened the freezer yesterday. Beer and water were both frozen solid.</p>
<p>The plastic cup was broken, but the bottle did not crack, nor did the beer push out the top.</p>
<p>Why not? Did the pressure of the freezing water in the cup (which I assume froze first) push in and prevent breakage? If so, how did the pressure inside the bottle dissipate?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It contains water in a glass tube essentially in a vacuum. When the cell is frozen to 0.1 C degrees all three states of water will exist simultaneously (solid, liquid, and gas).   I personally have used used it many times at work which is where I have my information, but I'll leave a link to a Wikipedia article.</p>

After a few hours, I take the bottle out and shake it about.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are not sterile people. You have many living communities of fungus and bacteria all over and inside of your body. We don't get sick because our immune systems prevent them from spreading out of control and forming an infection. Trust me, there are many bacteria and fungal spores growing in your mouth. </p>
<p>As long as you are healthy this isn't usually a problem. lets say you took antibiotics for a week though. It kills off the bacteria in your mouth, which kept the fungus in check, and you wake up one morning with a thick carpet of thrush growing on your tongue. It's yucky, but in that case the combination of killing the only competition the fungus had, and usually taking steroids like methylprednisone (which suppress your bodies immune response) results in the fungus being able to gain a foot hold in your mouth that's not normally present. </p>
<p>So the simple answer to your question is the bacteria on your tooth brush usually pale in comparison to the active colonies already in your mouth. The different bacteria and fungus in and around your mouth are in constant battle with each other, and with your immune system, and it's a stalemate with none of them gaining a foot hold. So long as you don't get weak, or upset the balance with drugs.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Straight after you finish brushing your teeth the bacteria on the toothbrush are the same as the bacteria in your mouth, so brushing your teeth twice in a row won't make you ill. Bacteria on the toothbrush are adapted to living in the mouth so won't thrive on the toothbrush because it usually dries out and doesn't have much food on it (unless you never rinse it after use which would be kind of gross). This means the toothbrush won't grow enough bacteria to make you ill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
