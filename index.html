That means if you are inside the solar system and there isn't a planet in the way, you're gonna see very well. Things will be very bright on the side facing the sun, but shadowed on the other side.</p>
<p>If the sun is blocked, you will still receive light from other celestial bodies and the milky way, which will give you extremely dim vision. You will be able to see a little bit in front of you, but not enough to distinguish complex things.</p>
<p>If you leave the solar system, same thing, but even darker because celestial bodies like the moon or saturn will reflect a little bit of light, depending on where you are. So without those, it'll be pretty dark. Very difficult to recognize objects probably, but if someone waves something in your face you could see it (Especially since it'll block stars behind it from your vision). If you leave the milky way and hang out in between galaxies, it'll be even dimmer, so much that it's gonna be almost impossible to see anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We just talked about this in my psychology class today. There's a case study about this guy who, as a high school student, wanted to break the record of longest number of days without sleep (which was 11 days at the time). He made it 12 days, probably with some &quot;micro sleeps&quot; here and there. He suffered all kinds of side effects, from headaches to irritability to hallucinations and more. When he finished, he slept about 12 hours a night for three or four nights and was right back to normal with no lasting effects and was able to go back to a regular sleep schedule. So really the idea of your body having to catch up isn't completely accurate. Your body just needs sleep in general to function properly and consolidate memories/repair itself. If you have one sleepless night you'll probably have a rough day, but if you get the recommended amount of sleep the following night you should be right back on track. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We sleep to remove the waste products our neurons create while they function. During sleep, the neurons narrow, and the glymphatic pathways expands, allowing significantly more passive flow of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that carries the waste products out of the brain. </p>
<p>The longer we go without sleep, the higher the concentration of the waste products in the fluid. This would also mean that proportionately more waste product is removed from the brain if you have gone longer without sleeping--in the same number of hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Following this line of thought, when you are 'catching up on sleep' you do not need to make up hours additively. The first few hours of sleep are proportionately the best. This makes sense with the anecdotes you read in the other comments.</p>
<p>Source: Interest with sleep stuff &amp; medical background &amp; did some neuro research in medical school-but I'm also not a neuroanatomist. The first 1.5 paragraphs is based on recent research, the last bit is biologically-plausible theorizing based on this brand-new research behind the glymphatic system, which provides a basis for why we need sleep at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If you go a night without sleep, you should continue your regular sleep pattern the following nights, it only takes a few nights of sleep to &quot;catch up&quot; no matter how much sleep you have missed on the first night. What is important is to keep the same sleep pattern all weekdays, because it is more healthy for the body. So young man, this is why you are not allowed to stay up late in the weekends.

<p>The wheels aren't cylinders, they're cones. The side that has to cover less distance in the turn rides up on the narrower end, so it makes more turns in less distance. Meanwhile, the other end does the same number of turns (solid axel), but since it is larger, it can cover the greater distance in the same number of turns. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When the track turns left, this will cause both wheels to pull rightward. For the right wheel that makes the point of contact with the track a larger circle since it's pulling towards where the cone is broader; for the left wheel the circle gets smaller since it's pulling towards the thinner part of the cone.<br />
Now even though the shaft connecting both wheels spins the same amount, the inner wheel covers less distance than the outer wheel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Above is a simple diagram of a train axle with wheels either side.
The important bit is the '&lt;' shape of the wheel.</p>
<p>When in a car going around a bend you feel yourself being pushed 'outwards' away from the direction of turn. This is a <em>centrifugal force</em> that always works in the same way.</p>
<p>This exact same force 'pushes' a train outwards as it moves around a bend. The conical shape of the wheels ensures that the circumference of the particular point in contact with the rail  is bigger on the outside(the side you feel you are being pushed against) than on the inside.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The train wheels are not flat like car tyres: they have a conical shape, and this helps keep the train aligned through a process called [coning] (<a href="https://civildigital.com/coning-wheels-railways-theory-purpose/" target="_blank">https://civildigital.com/coning-wheels-railways-theory-purpose/</a>). when a train hits a bend, its inertia forces the wheelset outwards, and then the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel. This allows the outer wheel to travel further round the outside of the bend. It's not perfect and some slippage can still occur - which increases wear on the wheels but is not fatal, since the wheels have the &quot;lips&quot; to keep them on the tracks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Yes, it's completely to do with the energies of the orbitals. Particles fill the orbitals in order of increasing energy. Atomic electrons fill all of the lowest-energy orbitals before they ever reach a g-orbital.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a Locomotive Engineer for the BNSF Railway for 10 years. The first answer to your question is that the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (Engineers Union) is the oldest in the country at 152 years and we have fought tooth and nail to keep our jobs. That being said, the second answer is a little more complicated.  </p>
<p>The bulk of modern road locomotives are manufactured by General Electric. A road Locomotive is a six axle 4400 horsepower engine that is meant to travel at track speed between cities. This is opposed to a yard Locomotive which is four axles and only meant to travel at 10 mph in short intervals though it is capable of track speed (up to 70mph). </p>
<p>A General Electric Locomotive comes with proprietary software in the locomotives heads up display called the GE Trip Optomizer. The T.O. as we call it is essentially auto pilot. Once engaged, it is capable of speeding up or slowing down the train at speeds of 12-70 mph. It uses algorithms to determine how to handle the train in the most fuel efficient manner while managing &quot;in train forces,&quot; but more on that later. The T.O. Uses GPS to determine exact locations to comply with both permanent and temporary speed restrictions. In my experience the T.O. Is accurate within 50 feet which is nothing short of miraculous considering the computer has to discern variables such as train tonnage (weight) both as a whole and individual cars and where they are placed in the train. Also train length and curvature of the territory. Whether or not you are on an ascending or descending grade (up a Mountain or down one).</p>
<p>As an Engineer in 2017 I am needed at the controls of a Locomotive for the following reasons. First, T.O. Doesn't always work, nor is it present in all of our locomotives (some are made by EMD.) Second, T.O. Doesn't work at speeds below 12 mph, so I have to start the train out and then engage the T.O. Once I get over 12. Third, T.O. Only works when I have authority to travel at track speed for a great distance. For example, if I have authority for 6 miles or more, I will engage the T.O. If I have to stop at some point within about six miles, I have to take control of the train and get it stopped at the correct location while complying with good train handling procedures. The T.O. Is only able to operate at maximum authorized speed all the time. It does not stop the train. That is the job of an engineer. Imagine a self driving car that can only handle itself on Interstate highways at the posted speed limit and cannot drive down a street with traffic lights and comply with the signals. Same concept. </p>
<p>Stopping the train without snapping it in two is the main job of a Locomotive Engineer. It's like a musician making music with an instrument. It takes training and experience. There are two types of brakes used on a train. First are the Dynamic Brakes, which are only found on Locomotives. That is where each axle acts as an electric generator. Imagine a hand crank emergency radio or flashlight. When you turn the crank there is resistance on the handle which is generating power. We use the resistance on each axle to slow down the train by generating electricity. We then literally throw away all that valuable electricity by dissipating it as heat out the top of the engine. It's a tremendous waste but hey, that's how we roll in America. </p>
<p>The second type of brakes that we use and probably the biggest reason to keep trains manned is the Westinghouse Air Brake System. Each rail car is equipped with brake rigging which operates entirely on compressed air. There are no electrical components, everything is mechanical. There are air compressors on the locomotives that are connected to each car through the use of air hoses and the entire system is controlled by the engineer at the head end of the train. The speed of the train can be controlled by either taking away air (setting the brakes) or adding air (releasing the brakes). I know that sounds backwards but that's how the system was designed. </p>
<p>It is the Westinghouse air brake design that truly throws a wrench into the need for automation. You see, Westinghouse designed this system in the 19th century. That's right, the flipping 1800s. The Titans of industry at the time began to expand the railroads so rapidly that there was only time enough to redesign the system to be more efficient once. That also happened in the 1800s. So that means that in 2017 we still use this system to stop our trains. Every rail car on every piece of track in the United States has this type of brake rigging. And according to federal law, each car has to have tested, inspected and working air brakes BEFORE the train departs it's initial terminal. A Conductor, (that's the other guy in the cab) has to walk the entire length of the train three times before the train can depart, once on each side to ensure the brakes are set and once to ensure the brakes have released. That could be up to 7000+ feet three times (5280 feet in a mile!) </p>
<p>The Westinghouse air brake system, although used industry wide, has its flaws. The brakes have a tendency to &quot;dynamite&quot; or begin braking without warning. Imagine the brake on the rear car braking a full capacity and no other brakes in the train are working. This type of event cracks the whole train like a whip and the Conductor and Engineer are at the tip. At the very least we'll get greasy face prints on the windshield. At the worst we're looking at a train broken in two or possibly a derailment. In the remote locations that the railroad travels in, it is the job of trained professionals like us to inspect the train, possibly change a broken knuckle on a car (60 lbs), put the train back together (do another air test) and get on our way. </p>
<p>In using a temperamental system like this it falls upon he job of a human being to orchestrate the movements of the train through the use of his senses. Feel, what's going on behind you? Is there more slack in the train than you expected? Sound, are the brakes squealing? Is it possible that they are not all the way released? Smell, do you smell hot brake shoes? The smell of burnt rubber? Sight, look back at the train on a curve. Is it on fire? Is there dragging equipment? Taste, what's in my lunchbox? Is it time to put my steak and potato in the engine compartment to heat it up yet? </p>
<p>These are things that automation cannot replace, human intuition in the middle of nowhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer depends slightly on the region we're talking about, so I'll focus on the one I know most about, Europe. Things might differ slightly elsewhere. It's also going to be a bit more technical in nature.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It's much more expensive and difficult to automate trains, because of regulations, the lifespan of the rolling stock, and the infrastructure involved.</p>
<p>As others have already mentioned, a huge chunk (if not everything in someplaces) of the actual railway infrastructure is already automated, such as signals and switches. Computers have made humans mostly obsolete there already: We've used to have many and big mechanical systems to prevent mistakes, today it's a single computer easily dealing with large regions of the network.</p>
<p>Europe strives to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETCS" target="_blank">an unified system (ETCS)</a> which controls trains (and their safety measures), which means that a train can go from one point of Europe to the other without having to switch engines or even drivers. There are multiple levels, which bluntly put refer to the available technology on the rolling stock and the infrastructure. The lowest level is still using the &quot;normal&quot; signals, whereas the highest levels are not using signals at all, but requires trains to have a constant radio connection to a control center.</p>
<p>Lower ETCS levels do not offer you much choice in the way of automation, higher levels do. However, this is costly, as you need to upgrade your engines (which can easily last 50 or more years, and are expensive to replace) and add additional security infrastructure (cell towers to provide the radio connectivity). Depending on your geography, the latter can be tricky.</p>
<p>So one point is the cost of actually getting a system that we can safely automate. Another one is trust. Put differently, when asked &quot;Would you like to enter a metal box that's going very fast next to other boxes that are going very fast, and all these boxes are controlled by some computer very far away?&quot;, the answers you would get would probably be rather... conservative. Even with the amount of security we have these days, the software still has (smaller) flukes from time to time. A trained human operator can notice these mistakes and question the computer's decision, something that computers themselves have a harder time to do.</p>
<p>Another one is the security bit. Train tracks are often exposed due to their nature, and might even include dangerous zones such as railroad crossings or stations without under-/overpasses. A human driver can see those dangers and act accordingly. More importantly, they can see it on other tracks as well and warn other drivers. Because there's no real guide to how to build rail networks and most of that stuff has grown historically in any case, it's difficult to teach a computer to do that. It gets even worse when you consider that sometimes obstacles are allowed between tracks - for example posts for overhead wires, or signals.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the age of the rolling stock comes into play again. One part of being a train driver is to check the train for anything suspicious during the journey, especially on freight waggons. This can include brakes or axles that are running hot, or tarpaulins that have loosened and are now threatening to touch something (e.g. the overhead wires). We have systems on the railway tracks that can detect those, but not everywhere (they are usually placed in front of tunnels or terminus train stations), and they can't detect everything. The rail cars themselves are usually old and feature little to no technology in that regard, especially since they're usually used internationally and regulations (and therefore standards) vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the regulations: Depending on your country, railways are more or less regulated. Some of these regulations may make automation impossible, or just way too expensive. Especially if there was no push towards automation so far, chances are that some law changes will be required before you can even start thinking about upgrading.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've answered this question once here regarding main rail (non subway trains) here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/52p2mw/eli5_we_are_coming_very_close_to_fully_automatic/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/52p2mw/eli5_we_are_coming_very_close_to_fully_automatic/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/52p2mw/eli5_we_are_coming_very_close_to_fully_automatic/</a></a></p>
<p>To get straight to the point, nothing is preventing them and there are in fact a lot of automated train systems in place in an urban rail setting, some with more automation than others.</p>
<p>First off lets see some examples of completely automated systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyTrain_\(Vancouver\)" target="_blank">Vancouver SkyTrain</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgantown_Personal_Rapid_Transit" target="_blank">Morgantown PRT</a>.</p>
<p>Now why aren't all urban rail systems automated? Well there two main reason for it, the first is that there is a massive upfront cost to doing so though I'm sure many companies are working on dropping the cost like crazy and making the automated better. The second reason is unfortunately Unions. There are a crazy amount of extremely expensive automated rail systems both fully implemented and partially that exist but simply are not activated due to unions fighting them. Train drivers will first start seeing more and more of their controls automated before finally just sitting there watching the train controlling itself ready to intervene in case of any issues. Sooner or later though the drivers will lose out of their role and be transferred to a &quot;train supervisor&quot; type role to make sure everything is a-okay and to answer questions to passengers.</p>
<p>So why don't you know about them? Well the truth is because you aren't the client. No one is trying to sell you an automated train system. These systems are being shown off and sold to the people who own the trains whether they be large private businesses or cities. Cars on the other hand are being shown off and advertised because sooner or later they will be on the market for you.</p>
<p>Cars will eventually be self driving, a decent portion of trains (especially urban rail) already are  and there's a greater push for it happening behind closed doors than the public sees. In my personal opinion, the majority of urban rain will become self driving far sooner than the majority of cars become self driving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>However, there's one thing I don't see here yet: How much more efficiency can you gain by eliminating people entirely from trains? If a train carries 500 passengers or 100 cars of cargo, and has a technical staff (i.e. driving, navigating, communicating) of three or four, we're not going to change economies much by eliminating those three or four people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the United States:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many aspects of train operation <em>are</em> <a href="http://wate.com/2016/04/20/norfolk-southern-reducing-operations-at-knoxville-rail-yard/" target="_blank">automated</a>.  For instance in railyards there are automated locomotives for shifting cars around.  There's also a thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_train_control" target="_blank">positive train control</a> which allows for slowing and stopping trains automatically if something goes wrong, like if the engineer has a heart attack.  We are in the process of rolling this out across the United States (I helped a little!) but it's a big job and there have been some delaying factors.  Another part of the issue is that a lot of rail is waaaaay out in the middle of nowhere, so upgrading it with new infrastructure is expensive and time-consuming.  That's why a lot of these upgrades have been made on railyards in cities, but not everywhere else.</p>
</li>
<li>It's not the no-brainer that you think it is. There are lots of unpredictable things that can happen when operating trains.  There need to be humans on hand to deal with those things.  Also, consequences of a train screw-up are much bigger than consequences of a car crash; consider that a single train might be hauling hundreds of tons of toxic, flammable or hazardous chemicals, and so you need <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/hsem/planning-preparedness/Pages/minnesota-rail-safety-regulations.aspx" target="_blank">detailed safety plans in place</a> in case <a href="http://www.startribune.com/at-camp-ripley-national-guard-members-train-for-the-worst-cast-scenarios/322904531/" target="_blank">something goes wrong</a>.  For that reason, you don't want to introduce full automation out on the rails until you have it worked out really, really well.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The US Navy railgun can accelerate projectiles to Mach 6. This is merely 2 km/s. You need 7.6 km/s to get into orbit and significantly more to reach the Moon (haven't done the math but it must be slightly less than 11.2 km/s which is escape speed).</p>
<p>Even if we had a railgun powerful enough to reach orbital speed, at such great speeds and with the high density of air at sea level the projectile would burn up like a meteor and probably never leave the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Some enthusiasts of the rail gun idea affirm that a heat shield could resist this effect and that launching fast enough could account for speed loss to air drag. Honestly I haven't found reputable sources confirming this or showing the math, and I seriously doubt it because of the very high air density at low altitudes. Spacecraft reentering the atmosphere usually burn up at altitudes between 80km and 120km.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The chemicals being released do a couple things.</p>
<p>They help heal the grass, help seal the grass so that it's a bit more resistant to dmg (doesn't do shit against a steel blade, but helps against a caterpillar).</p>
<p>And it can help to call certain bugs that feed on the bugs that feed on the grass.</p>
<p>Edit: Some grasses will also release certain chemicals that make their leaves taste awful to bugs. </p>
<p>Some grasses can also concentrate nutrients into their roots to better rebuild.</p>

The smell is a combination of chlorophyll and other fluids being released from the grass when it is cut. Plants typically communicate with other plants via the superhighway of fungal mycelium which live in a symbiotic relationship around the root zone of the plant. The chemical signals being transmitted inside of a fungal network mimic neurotransmitters in the human brain. The warning process actually takes place through the root zone of the plant, aided by fungal symbiosis. Not through the exterior transfer of pheromonal triggers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People like to think that it's an animal trait to like to stay alive, and protect and defend themselves, and plants are just totally inert. But that isn't true. Unlike animals, plants can't run away and escape danger, but plants are every bit as opposed to being killed and eaten as any animal is. Instead of running, plants engage in physical warfare: spikes and tough exteriors and all kinds of other things, and chemical warfare: releasing a number of different chemicals in response to being attacked by an herbivore. These responses fall into three main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Direct defense. Some chemicals released by plants are intended to directly harm the predator eating it. Many plants, such as clover for example, use cyanide as their poison of choice. Sometimes, to prevent poisoning themselves by accident, they'll even compartmentalize their cyanide into a two-part weapon system, storing a harmless, nontoxic cyanide precursor inside their cell cytoplasms, and storing an enzyme in their cell walls that breaks down that precursor into active, deadly cyanide. Getting munched on by a herbivore breaks the cell wall and mixes these ingredients, poisoning the predator. Plants can also harm their herbivore attackers indirectly too, through things like producing an analog of the mating pheremones of the herbivore's natural predator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local repair. Some chemicals that plants release when they're damaged, such as jasmonic acid, serve as plant hormones that signal the rest of the plant to brace and prepare for damage. Plants constrict their water channels to avoid losing water through their damaged parts, produce saps and sticky coagulants to block off the damage, produce antibacterials and antifungals to protect against infection, increase cell replication to heal faster, and start producing bitter, foul-tasting molecules that discourage herbivores from continuing to eat them, as well as enzymes that block digestion, making itself less nutritious.</p>
</li>
<li>Remote signaling. Many of the same chemicals that direct plants to start repairing themselves, such as jasmonic acid, are also highly volatile, and signal neighboring plants to start bracing for impact and preparing themselves as well. In response to distress signals given off by nearby plants that are being eaten, plants will produce bitterants and digestion-blockers, making themselves unpalpatable to their herbivore predators. In fact, this is the reason that giraffes have to be nomadic creatures: you never see a giraffe herd strip a tree completely bare, because after munching on a tree for some time, the tree becomes bitter and inedible, and depending on wind conditions, other trees for miles around become so too. So the herd has to keep moving, trying to stay ahead of the chemical cloud of anguished screaming their leaf-munching inspires, in order to keep finding new trees which are still delicious and haven't yet hardened themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, plants can't tell the difference between an animal's teeth and a lawnmower's blade, so against us, all their chemical screams, poisons, and distress calls don't do them much good, and make a pleasant summertime perfume for us instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some defensive plant chemicals cost the plant a lot of energy to build, so building/prepping them constantly isn't an efficient plan. It's like constantly outfitting yourself with new suits of body armour long after the war has ended - costly and unnecessary, at a time when energy needs to be spent elsewhere. Better to wait and live normally, and suit-up after the warning alarm is raised. </p>
<p>These grass signal chemicals are just that - a warning alarm, telling the plants nearby to get toxic/distasteful. Some other  volatile chemicals act as deterrents to insects, like a bad smell. Still others have been known to attract the predators/parasites of plant-eating insects. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/12/secret-language-of-plants/amp" target="_blank">This article</a> discusses a number of these scenarios.</p>

If you fall on something like snow, and it is on a steep incline you increase your chances of surviving. Hanging onto debris can also help. It is all about the impulse of landing, so if you can get the landing to occur over a longer amount of time, then your body won't be subjected to the same forces. </p>

At some point the aerodynamic drag on your body reaches equilibrium with the gravitational attraction of the earth and you fall at a constant speed (ignoring varying atmospheric density). So while 33,000 feet sounds impressive, it's essentially no more impressive than 10,000 feet (discounting the substantially larger time that person spent in utter terror at the prospect of their impending doom). A person would reach terminal velocity even well before that point, although I don't know the exact number. Wikipedia claims 1,500 feet, just to get a rough idea.</p>
<p>So while yes, it's crazy that someone survived falling from so high up, the exceedingly high altitude didn't make them less likely to survive than someone who fell from, say, 2,000 feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I imagine that there's not a lot of difference between 33,000 and 12,000 feet, in terms of likelihood of death. You'll hit terminal velocity either way and air resistance will buffet you slower on the way down depending on where you are. Then depending what you land on (pavement v.s. thick foliage/sand/water) you've got quite a varying set of odds.</p>
<p>After 33,000 feet it does get really <strong>cold</strong> so I guess there's that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have calculated the energies of the projectiles, though for u/SocomTedd: the Mark 7 gun fired explosive shells, whose <em>explosive</em> energies far exceeded the kinetic energy of the projectile (~6000 MJ explosive vs. ~40 MJ kinetic.) The kinetic energy of the projectile, while large, is insignificant compared to the actual payload.</p>
<p>I actually wrote an executive-level summary of railgun physics and their operation for a high-level program manager working for the Navy. (None of this involved classified material.) One potential issue is that railguns tend to use very dense materials for their projectiles, which are liable to penetrate through targets rather than deliver energy to them. This is easily solved by modifying the projectile to <em>scatter many smaller projectiles</em> near the target. </p>
<p>As u/jehan60188 says, 4 MJ/kg is the threshold for railgun superior effectiveness. Once the projectile is fast enough it is more effective to use the kinetic energy of the projectile rather than use (chemical) explosives. As kinetic energy scales essentially without limit with respect to velocity, railguns are inevitably more effective. They are not, <em>yet</em>, more effective, which is what motivates continuing naval research on the subject. </p>
<p>Chemical explosives provide a fundamental limit on the effectiveness of traditional guns, either through explosive or kinetic payloads. (There is a similar limit to the effectiveness of chemical rockets.) Electromagnetic propulsion, on the other hand, suffers from no such limit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The real question to ask is what kind of damage this can do.  There's no explosion like with a bomb.  Instead, it's more like a bullet.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At these speeds, material behaviour is different. Any armour impacted at these speeds is going to behave like a fluid and flow out of the way of he impactor. This creates a problem for opposing ships because you cannot create an armour that can just 'stop' this sort of round. (at least not without completely redesigning the ships and making them weak to conventional damage.)</p>
<p>The rounds will penetrate far into the ships, which at sea is pretty much a nightmare. They don't need to explode since they have enough kinetic energy to create ballistic fragments on impact ( the purpose of explosive shells). Alternatively uranium penetrators could potentially knock through an entire ship.</p>
<p>Another benefits are the ship doesn't store explosives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
