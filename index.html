		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually when engineers say something will last for X years, it means that the thing has 95% (for example) chance of still working after X years. It doesn't mean that as soon as the X years have passed the satellite will stop working. This is something people often don't understand when they are talking about planned obsolescence. </p>
<p>For satellites there are a couple of limitations on the lifespan on top of stuff just breaking up. First is the propulsion. In geostationary orbit you need a bit of propellant to correct for perturbations caused by the moon and the sun gravitational pull as well light pressure. When the propellant runs out the satellites are placed into a graveyard orbit so that they are out of the way of other satellites. Sometime thrusters perform better than expected, or the rocket is extra precise in its launch so you end up having spare propellant and you can extend the mission. </p>
<p>Another thing that happens as satellites age is the degradation of solar panels and batteries. The solar panels lose efficiency when they are struck by radiation and cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Lastly sometime the mission duration is tied to the money needed to operate a satellite. To extend a mission you need money to pay the people in charge of the mission. The ground equipment can be very expensive too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Everything should last longer than planned or you've failed in your mission.   </p>
<p>The &quot;expected lifespan&quot; is the minimum.</p>
<p>Lasting far longer (Meteosat-7, Spirit, Opportunity and later Curiosity Mars Rovers) are real exceptions to the case, but every electronic device we launch into space on a rocket is expected to function beyond it's listed lifespan.</p>
<p>It's considered to have been worth the massive amount of money spent to make it if it functions properly up to that expected lifespan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/electric_ionland has written,</p>
<p>When researchers say things like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The satellite was supposed to stay in geostationary orbit for only 6 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't mean that at 6 years they expect it to come down, or at 6 years+1 day they expect it to fail. </p>
<p>It more precisely means that they anticipate 6 years of relatively consistent function and funding for the project (including personnel). It also means that after 6 years, the goals of the project can be considered &quot;met&quot;. </p>
<p>This is key because you always need to present a scientific justification for putting a satellite (equipped with specific sensors and capabilities) into orbit, so you need to be able to plan out what you're going to do with it. An anticipated 6-year lifespan means that they can plan experiments and analysis of data for 6-year (or less) experiments, but any project that requires 10+ years would be risky. For example, if they want to collect data on a specific comet or distant planet - the planetary body and satellite sensors need to be aligned during the timeframe of anticipated function. For multiple measurements, they need to be aligned multiple times. Or if you need weather data for X years in order to validate the &quot;fit&quot; of your statistical weather model, you need to ensure that you'll get X years, not X-2. If you'll only get X-2 years, you need to adapt your model or find an alternative data source as this is not one that can be counted on to give sufficient power. Logistics for &quot;competing&quot; projects need to be planned out so that the right measurements are made and data goes to the right people in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>In addition, they factor in anticipated technological advances on the ground. For example, a geosynchronous satellite launched 20 years ago may only be able to relay low-resolution static images, while a satellite launched today can relay high-resolution video. So the old tech may not have failed, but has outlived it's usefulness. </p>
<p>Funders (ex. governments) and leadership are willing to consider proposals launching a new satellite only after (1) the first one was actually useful, and (2) the agreed-upon timeline for technology upgrades is reasonably met.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Depression is like swimming in very heavy clothing.  It takes all of my energy to resist sinking so that I can keep breathing (i.e., take care of my most basic needs).  There isn't enough energy left to move in any direction.  Sometimes I can summon the energy to call for help; most of the time not.  Medication strips off some of the clothes but not enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Depression is like feeling the misery from the worst experience you can imagine, without remembering what that experience was.  Like having total amnesia while still feeling massive shock from watching your house burn down with your loved ones inside, on the same day that you also got fired and discovered that you have a terminal illness.  You can't remember why, but you know that everything good in the world is gone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ran into this a year or so ago, and to me, this is the simplest way I saw to describe it.  It doesn't start with &quot;Depression is like...&quot;, but I hope this helps. </p>
<p>&quot; I once tried to explain depression to someone as like if one day you gradually started to lose both your sense of taste and your ability to feel full. And you don’t know why, but now everything you eat tastes like mashed potatoes and nothing you eat is satisfying. You keep eating because you must eat to live, but the effort that it takes to prepare food is taxing and there is no pay off. You just know it will taste like mashed potatoes. You just know you will still be hungry. So you stop bothering with seasonings. Then you stop bothering to use ingredients you used to like. Then you start to wonder what the point of eating is because there is no payoff. You still feel hungry and you’re sick of the taste and you don’t know if you will ever enjoy food again and you don’t know why this is happening.</p>
<p>If someone comes up to you in this scenario and says, “Well have you tried spicing your food? Using different ingredients? Eating foods you used to love?” It isn’t necessarily helpful because the reason you stopped doing all that in the first place is that everything…tasted…like mashed…potatoes.&quot; -57circlesofhell, Tumblr</p>
<p>I get where you're coming from. I grew up in a religious household. I have depression that borders on manic. It was always demons taunting me, and If I just prayed, I'd get better. I tried to get help from my family, and my dad told me I was being a dramatic teenager, and my step-mom told me it was part of being a woman. Years later and no better, she asked if therapy would help and I asked her to give me a little bit to think about it because therapy would make my problem real, and something I had to actually deal with, and that scared me. When I came to her about it (a few hours later, mind you), she told me that therapists were scam artists, and that the Lord was the only one who could help me get better. </p>
<p>Again, I really hope that helped. It helped me when speaking to former partners. Some people just can't be convinced that it is a real disease and not just a bad day though. If you ever need to talk, just send me a message. I get on here fairly frequently, and make it a point to try and help others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This David Foster Wallace quote: </p>
<p>The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.</p>
<p>Short version: like being trapped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mistake that led to Flint's toxic water was a water purification error that corrupted the actual <em>pipes</em> the water flows through. So the water itself can be perfectly clean, and on the way to your house, the pipes will leech toxic amounts of lead into it.</p>
<p>In order for Flint to repair its water problem, it has to replace all of the pipes in the city. This is really expensive and Flint doesn't have the money to do it. Most cities wouldn't have the money to do it, as they only budget for a certain percentage of pipes to be replaced and serviced every year.</p>
<p>The replacement cost has been estimated to be $60M and the project, to be fully completed, to take 15 years. There are about 29,000 pipes that need to be completed. They are focusing on the most at-risk homes first and several hundred have been completed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily an answer to this question but I wanted to chime in.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Flint Town. Mom worked downtown at UM Flint and I went there for a few years.</p>
<p>As far back as the 90s she would say that everyone in her office, at Water Street Pavillon, knew they were pulling water from the river. They stopped drinking it and making coffee with it. Several of the restaurants in the pavilion did too. The ones who didn't you could tell. Their pop/soda tasted like shit.</p>
<p>Whenever I would drink from a fountain on campus (we're talking back in like 01-03) it tasted absolutely god awful and had a yellow tint to it. Kind of tasted like dry wall.</p>
<p>I said all of that to say this - this wasn't a new problem.</p>
<p>It fit into a media cycle because the story was so bombastic and the state government made the choice to switch the city as a whole to that water only a few years ago. However, several places in Flint have been on that water since I was a kid.</p>
<p>We have always known that river was disgusting. No one ever wanted to get in it. We didn't really have any river-related activities in Flint that many people participated in. No one fished in it. No one swam in it.</p>
<p>As a matter of face, I remember when I was a kid and they drained a 1/4 mile portion of it. They pulled out several old cars, guns, knives, safe's, and other contraband. I think they even found human remains if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>Point being it's not like everything was fine in Flint and then BOOM all of the sudden the water is toxic. The river has always been shit and more and more businesses and municipalities have been getting their water from it to save money for years.</p>
<p>There should have been a clean up effort for the river LONG before this happened, and I mean 30-40 years ago. This river has been toxic and a danger since the first factory started draining their sludge into it a hundred years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually the reason is a lot simpler than you might think;
Usually languages started out having only upper case letters. That's why on really old professional documents, lower case letters aren't really anywhere to be seen.
It was only after scribes discovered that they could write much faster and take up a lot less space if they wrote smaller. So they rounded their letters to make them less spacious and soon the lower case letters were made.
Good question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Charlemagne gets at least some of the credit for lower-case letters in the so-called Latin alphabet. Cursive writing had become so sloppy by Charlemagne's time that it was practically unreadable and when monks would copy manuscripts the state of the writing made corruption of texts nearly inevitable. Aside from his military conquests, Charlemagne was all about promoting learning and preserving knowledge, so he actually passed laws mandating reform of the script. The result was a font called Carolingian minuscule that lives on in our lower-case letters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tulip
Shape: Bulb that tapers in before flaring out at the top.
Purported Benefits: concentration of aroma, support of the foamy head at the top, and comfortable drinking afforded by flared rim.</p>
<p>Chalice
Shape: A round bowl on a stem.
Purported Benefits: Beautiful presentation, foam support, wide mouth for easy drinkin' (in big sips.)</p>
<p>Pilsner
Shape: Tall, footed, slender, tapered out from the bottom. 
Purported Benefits: Displays the beer's clarity, while tapered shape supports head.</p>
<p>Weizen
Shape: Tall, large, slender at bottom, bowled out a bit at the top.
Purported Benefits: Large size accommodates a massive, frothy head associated with highly-carbonated German wheat beers. Slender bottom shows off these beers' famous hazy color and protects its lively carbonation.</p>
<p>Nonick Imperial Pint
Shape: Large, slightly tapered out with bulge near top.
Purported benefits: Designed for the no-nonsense drinker. The bulge facilitates stacking and prevents rim chipping.</p>
<p>Shaker Pint
Shape: Slight taper outward from bottom.
Purported benefits: Cheap and easily stackable. Sturdy ones can be used for stirring and shaking cocktails.</p>
<p>Snifter
Shape: Stemmed, wide-bowled, tapered in at top.
Purported benefits: Designed for maximum concentration of volatile organic compounds—that is, aroma.</p>
<p>Tumbler
Shape: Short and squat with thick glass and a slight outward taper.
Purported Benefits: Tradition generally drives the use of this glass, which is usually reserved for Belgian witbier and lambic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shape of the glass affects how your mouth and nose (eyes to an extent) interact with the beverage. A very wide glass will allow your whole nose to enter the glass as you sip it, the aroma adds to and complements the taste. A very narrow glass like a champagne flute reduces surface area which keeps the bubbly bubbles from gassing out before you can drink it. Other glasses like a Brandy snifter allow to you swirl the beverage without spilling it, the swirling allows the aroma to release but the narrow lip of the glass traps most of it in the glass, so you can get your nose right in there. Some glasses have stems to keep your body heat out of the beverages while other glasses encourage the handling to warm the drink inside. Certain beer glasses have wider tops which allows the head to form and remain which contributes to aroma and protects the beer below from reacting with the oxygen in the air. Beer stiens have a handle so the beer stays cold. There's are many more examples but this covers some basic reasons for shapes. As an experiment try your favourite drink in various glasses and see if you notice the subtle effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Until a better answer comes along:</p>
<p>Some glassware has different openings, exposing the beverage to more or less air. Taste is related to smell, so a glass that has room for your nose will allow you to 'experience' more of the drink. In beer glasses, some shapes allow for more foam (or head), and that is often part of the taste of the beer (like Guinness or Boddingtons). Different shapes also have different surface areas. Red wine glasses have more surface area because the wine is meant to be tasted at room temp, white wine has less surface area to help keep the wine chilled. Glassware that has stems (like wine and martini) is so the temperature of your hand doesn't change the temp of the drink. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, marijuana is not a drug itself. Marijuana is a plant that harbors a range of chemicals we call cannabinoids. We have identified more than 85 different cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Marijuana may either induce or alleviate anxiety.
Your brain already has cannabinoid-like compounds that it uses all the time. When marijuana is ingested, new mixes of cannabinoids are introduced and they can bind to differing receptor cells. Long story short, the anxiety-response of the brain is based on the initial biochemical conditions of the brain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our naturally occurring cannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) have effects much like 9-tetrahydorcanabinol (THC). Cannabinoids may cause increased or decreased anxiety levels. Anyone who has experienced feeling &quot;paranoid&quot; while smoking marijuana has felt the effect of increased anxiety, while others report feeling &quot;mellow.&quot; These disparate effects are also produced by our naturally occurring cannabinoids. AEA and 2-AG have been called &quot;promiscuous&quot; molecules, as they bind to CB receptors, but also bind to other types of receptors; locking-on to different receptors leads to different effects. In general, CB receptors mediate the &quot;calming effect&quot; of THC-like molecules. In contrast, anxiety increases when cannabinoids bind to other receptors. One example is a receptor called TRPV1. When either THC or naturally occurring AEA/2-AG bind to TRPV1, anxiety symptoms increase. These different effects of cannabinoids on the brain have complicated the study of marijuana and are responsible for the different effects from one person to another.</p>
<p>It has also been shown that our internal cannabinoids have different effects in different parts of the brain. In some areas of the brain, such as the periaqueductal gray matter, stimulating CB receptors leads to increased anxiety and depression. With increased use of medical marijuana in California, the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) has tracked increased rates of suicide, up 9% between 2010 and 2012. While we can't say for certain that marijuana makes people suicidal, there is an association between marijuana use and suicide that has been seen in other studies. In the past few years, hospitals in California have seen an increase in people treated for cannabis-induced psychosis, where individuals may report hearing voices, among other psychotic symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.anxiety.org/effect-of-marijuana-on-anxiety" target="_blank">https://www.anxiety.org/effect-of-marijuana-on-anxiety</a></p>
<p>All in all, these chemicals are actually very poorly understood. The US federal government's Schedule 1 status for marijuana has severely handicapped, if not outright stalled, medical research into marijuana for decades.</p>
<p>As a marijuana user (Colorado, recreational), i would not recommend marijuana as a treatment for anxiety even though i have found it to be useful for my own anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are <em>very</em> different drugs with utterly different modes of action. In the case of marijuana, which acts on the endogenous (body's own internal system of) cannabinoid receptors, people can experience changes in their thinking and perception which can lead to paranoia. </p>
<p>Amphetamines are <em>much</em> more pernicious, and paranoia tends to emerge as toxicity emerges with the rapidly increasing dosages needed to get high. In essence, amphetamines burn the candle at both ends, rev the engine into the redline, and... well... you break. Your brain is chemically overworked and depleted, your cardiovascular system will be stressed, and it causes a host of terrible effects including paranoia. </p>
<p>In fact, prolonged use of strong amphetamines can cause full psychotic breaks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines cause paranoia because of it's action on the noradrenaline receptors, which also fire off when you get something like an anxiety attack, think of it as a flight or fight reaction. They're also very active on dopamine receptors which cause a constant urge to redose because of how quickly they become depleted. This causes a lot of people to go a few days that can cause them to become psychotic (stimulant psychosis), and a lot of people will hallucinate seeing shadows and become paranoid because of the realness of the hallucinations.</p>
<p>Us stim users call them &quot;shadow people&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With Marijuana much of it has to do with the simple fact that it's illegal in many places, but more than just being illegal it's socially frowned upon by many and that social pressure combined with the actual psychoactive effects of the drug can lead to a psychosomatic kind of paranoia that starts in a users subconscious. </p>
<p>There was a study a while back in which people who were told a drug could induce paranoia or people who came into the study with such a preconceived notion were much more likely to experience paranoia as a result when all they were given was aspirin. </p>
<p>I don't know about other drugs but when it comes to Marijuana there simply isn't evidence that paranoia is an actual side effect of the drug itself and not an emergent phenomena from cultural factors as many of us believe. In fact the evidence we do have seems to point to almost all of the negative side effects of Marijuana (Paranoia yes but also the fact that it does seem to cause a Psychotic episode in some very small number of users, mostly male and with a family history of psychosis) are related to a preexisting disposition in the user. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The paranoia from coke comes only after massive binges and frequent use. Cocaine leaves users both physically and mentally drained after long periods of heavy consumption:
Physically, it drastically increases your heart rate and overstimulates your central nervous system.
Mentally, cocaine depletes your brain of dopamine and can affect its ability to produce more in the future. </p>
<p>When you combine the above mental+physical stresses of coke with a lack of sleep and a history of many similar binges (without proper recovery time) -it can cause severe paranoid delusions in some users. Especially in users who already suffer from mental illnesses such as OCD or bipolar disorder. </p>
<p>The cocaine high itself, when enjoyed sparingly, has the opposite effect of everything I just described. It fills the user with confidence and empathy and joy, and is unlikely to leave any sort of lasting impact on a healthy user.
That being said, moderate users may still experience mild to moderate anxiety or depression during the crash that occurs when the high wears off. </p>
<p>I hope that answers your question :)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds are usually described by three characteristics - pitch, loudness, and quality (or &quot;timbre&quot;). Pitch is determined by frequency and describes how high or low a note is. Loudness is what it sounds like (forgive the pun - I simply mean loudness is self-explanatory). Everything else is generally categorized as &quot;timbre,&quot; which is what allows you to tell the difference between a piano and violin playing a note at the same pitch and loudness.</p>
<p>Quite a bit goes into timbre such as harmonic content, attack and decay, and vibrato. I don't really know enough about those to explain them further other than to say they are characteristics of sound waves that affect how you hear, but don't change the pitch or loudness. If you can find an app that lets you play around with a synthesizer, you can usually change those settings directly so you can play around with how they affect sound.</p>
<p>Edit: There are some more technical responses below from people who know more about this than I do. Check them out for more details. And thanks to everyone who provided more details!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Most of the comments below are saying that attack (the beginning of a sound and how long it takes to get to peak volume/loudness) and slight variations in the pitch and loudness are the physical properties that create different timbres, though the area is still being researched. Apparently when you play a note on an instrument the part of the instrument producing the note actually produces multiple frequencies and can have slight variations in loudness. The frequencies not associated with the pitch you hear are called overtones. You generally only perceive the fundamental frequency (the pitch of the note), but the overtones change how you perceive that. To bring it back to your original question, you can tell the difference between a piano and violin playing middle C because they have different attack, overtones, and the loudness during the note will change slightly. And you might not be able to tell the difference if you didn't hear the attack (the beginning of the note). </p>
<p>As an added bonus, if I understand correctly, the different overtones result in a different spectral flux and the changing loudness over the duration of the note results in a different spectral envelope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oooooo!!! Somebody asked about the best electives we took in college, and I unwittingly answered this exact question in my excitement (with bonus radio info, because that's what I do for a living now)!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Physics of musical acoustics, what I remember of it, mostly went extremely in depth on what makes audio audio.</p>
<p>For instance, the timbre, or the <em>kind</em> of sound, is determined by the type of waveform.  A guitar, for instance, has a sine wave, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X11Z4-fmE8" target="_blank">can be easily seen in slow motion</a>.  A violin, on the other hand, has a sawtooth wave, due to the <a href="http://waynestegall.com/politics/earthmusic.htm" target="_blank">string constantly catching the bow as it vibrates</a>.  Percussion has a scattered waveform that doesn't resonate well, hence why most people don't think of it having &quot;pitch&quot; in the same way other instruments do.  What we think of as electronic sounds are usually <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/uploaded_files/21451/SquareWave.gif" target="_blank">a square waveform</a>.</p>
<p>The pitch of the sound is determined by the frequency of the wave, or how many times the wave &quot;cycles&quot; in a given time period.  The slow motion guitar video I posted above does a great job of showing this, actually.  The thicker strings do not vibrate as quickly as the thinner ones do, which is why they are lower in pitch.  You can change the amount of cycles these strings will emit by tightening and loosening the strings.  The same thing is done with the air pockets in instruments like the oboe or the trumpet--by changing the size of the vibrating space, you change the pitch.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the amplitude.  Going back to the slow motion guitar, you might think that the cycles would be affected by how hard you plucked the strings.  But if you've ever played a guitar, you know that only the volume is affected by how hard you pluck the strings, not the pitch.  This is because they vibrate further up and down, not faster or slower.  So, simply put, the amplitude of a waveform is your volume.  The higher up and down the wave goes, the more powerful it will be.</p>
<p>Now where it gets tricky is when you get radio involved...  Amplitude modulation (AM), for instance, changes the amplitude of a radio signal that is of a much higher frequency than we can hear, and, then your radio when it receives that Very High Frequency (VHF) signal, then knows what frequency to strip off of it (the frequency you tuned your radio to), and leaves only those minor variations that were inserted in the signal.  Those minor variations in amplitude?  They're the audio that was originally inserted into the signal, called the &quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>
<p>Frequency Modulation (FM) does the same thing, only it inserts minor variations in the frequency of the signal, then strips off that frequency in the same way and takes the difference, leaving just the original audio frequency.</p>
<p>Anyway... physics is awesome.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/tellahthesage is right on the money: timbre is what defines it all, and there's a lot that goes into it.</p>
<p>Let's start with a pure tone (i.e. a sine wave) at 1000 Hz, or 1kHz. (For reference, that's close to the C two octaves above middle C.) <strong>Harmonics</strong> are multiples of the frequency at lower levels, e.g. 2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz, and so forth. Adding different harmonics in different mathematical patterns will result in different wave shapes and different sounds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-sinusoidal_waveform" target="_blank">Wikipedia has some good links on the subject</a>, including sample clips of the main wave forms.
Incidentally, a given instrument may 'voice' two (or more) notes simultaneously, with a harmonic series for each note, which adds complexity and in some cases (like percussion), perhaps noise.</p>
<p>Now that we have a wave form, we can vary the pitch of it by a little bit. This is <strong>vibrato</strong>, and is described by a width (how much it varies - maybe a quarter tone for example) and frequency (how fast it varies). A similar (but not identical) effect can be got by varying the <em>volume</em> by a small amount, which is called <strong>tremolo</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, you can change how fast the note gets up to 'full' volume (<strong>attack</strong>), and how fast it fades away afterwards (<strong>decay</strong>). A flute has a relatively slow attack. A hammered piano note has a much faster attack, and a glockenspiel (with metal bars and hard mallets) is faster still. A violin note doesn't actually decay as long as the musician is bowing it continuously, whereas a damped xylophone will fall off very quickly.</p>
<p>And that's...most of it. Except for all of the other parts. :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything mentioned here is great! Superb answers, all. One thing is missing tho: noise, and its colours. </p>
<p>In addition to the basic tone and its various overtones, there is always some level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank">noise</a> in any given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre" target="_blank">timbre.</a> Noise can mean many things, but in this context, it means sound that is not recognizable as one focussed frequency, but is spread out across the spectrum; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise" target="_blank">white noise</a> being probably the most well-known variety. </p>
<p>White noise was given the name because, like white light, it was once thought to be sound spread evenly across the spectrum, AKA all frequencies at once, evenly distributed. This has since been disproven, but among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise" target="_blank">the other colours of noise</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise" target="_blank">pink noise</a> has been found to truly give an equal loudness to all audible frequencies.</p>
<p>That's just a fun tangent tho; no physical instrument consistently produces any one colour of noise perfectly, but they all do produce different colours of noise, changing along with the other elements of timbre. </p>
<p>Elements of noise like the breath of a flautist may increase or decrease with loudness, or the flautist may deliberately make their sound <em>more breathy</em> (more noisy) by varying the shape of their mouth, AKA their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embouchure" target="_blank">embrouchure.</a></p>
<p>The bowed instruments are a classic example; the bow produces a <a href="http://knutsacoustics.com/files/Noisy-instruments.pdf" target="_blank">fairly noisy and complex timbre,</a> as the sound is produced by friction, an action we all have experienced as being &quot;noisy&quot;.</p>
<p>Once you get into electronic instruments, noise becomes a fully malleable thing; you can increase it, modulate it, make it reactive to loudness/pitch/time in new ways, or just completely neglect to add it, for a decidedly unnatural yet pure sound.</p>
<p>Incidentally, noise is a vital component of modern emergency vehicle sirens; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_siren" target="_blank">it helps our ears detect where the sound is coming from,</a> an incredibly useful thing in busy traffic.</p>
<p>Hope this was as fun to read as it was to write!</p>
<p>Edit: Whoops! Turns out I was wrong, and pink noise isn't equally loud across the spectrum; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_noise" target="_blank">gray noise</a> is the correct answer, I just like pink noise better, and my desires hijacked my memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three elements of sound: pitch, amplitude, and timbre. </p>
<p>Pitch refers to the rate at which the sound is vibrating, measured by frequency over a second. A440 refers to a sound vibrating at 440 times a second, for example. This is measured in hertz (hz).</p>
<p>Amplitude refers to attack, peak, and decay of a sound. So essentially how fast and loud does the sound peak to its max volume, and likewise how does it decay back into silence (or the next note). </p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, is timbre, which refers to the harmonic qualities of a sound. This is what determines the unique quality of any instrument or voice. </p>
<p>Essentially, every sound made by a physical source (hitting a cymbal, striking a piano note, attacking a string on a guitar, etc.) is composed not just of the “principle” or “fundamental” note — what we might call “middle C” — but of lots of other notes or pitches that aren’t as prominent as the fundamental. These other notes that compose the entire sound of a given pitch on an instrument are called “harmonics” or “overtones.” (Technically there are some minor differences between these two words, but for the purposes of this explanation, don’t worry). </p>
<p>The best way to illustrate how this works this is to google “sine wave,” and you’ll hear an electronic generated sound wave that is only composed of a single note, such as just a 440hz. It sounds really odd and unnatural. This is because there aren’t any other </p>
<p>The reason every instrument sounds different is because the amplitude of these overtones are varied. For example, the fundamental pitch of the note is twice as loud as the first overtone, which is an octave higher than the fundamental. The first overtone is four times as loud as the second overtone, which is a fifth higher than the first overtone (and an octave and an a fifth higher than the fundamental). This continues on a loose logarithmic scale, with the amplitude of each successive overtone decreasing at a given rate. </p>
<p>What this rate is for each instrument and the “harmonic” composition of each pitch is different for each instrument (and each person’s voice, or any physical sound). You can, interestingly, map the composition of an instrument visually or mathematically. </p>
<p>This is how electronic instruments attempt to “sample” or “synthesize” real physical instruments through electronic means. There is software out there that, for example, has spent thousands of hours sampling real string instruments to such a precise degree that it’s nearly impossible to tell the difference between the electronic and real versions of, say, a violin. You can adjust for all three elements of sounds. And there’s a reason that this particular plugin costs somewhere around $5,000. </p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer requires accepting that according to quantum mechanics, atoms and molecules can only have specific energies, called energy levels. You can be in energy level 0, 1, 2, etc, but higher energy levels require the atom to take in energy from the surroundings such as from heat. At absolute zero there is no heat, so every atom or molecule will be in energy level 0 at absolute zero (we call this the ground state). But the funny thing about quantum mechanics is, it teaches us that everything has what is called &quot;zero-point energy&quot;. This is the energy of the ground state, and you can never have less energy than this. For a very light atom like helium, the small amount of zero-point energy is actually enough to make the atoms move around a lot. This is called zero-point motion. (All things experience zero-point motion, but for bigger atoms or molecules these motions may be too small to make any noticeable difference). For helium, these zero-point motions prevent the atoms from coming close enough together to solidify, so even at absolute zero it exists as a liquid. </p>
<p>However, if you compress the liquid helium enough, you can form a solid,  but only at pressures above about 25 atm (25x atmospheric pressure) for helium-4, the most common isotope. Even in the solid form there are still large zero-point motions, so it doesn't behave like a classical solid where every atom has an exact fixed location. Because of this, solid helium is referred to as a quantum solid.</p>

<p>What Absolute Zero is, is the <em>ground state</em> energy. You cannot go to a lower energy level than that. Bonds between atoms have what's called &quot;Zero-point energy&quot; which means the ground state isn't 0. This is why heavy water is toxic while supposedly isotopes have the same chemical properties. The zero-point energy depends on the mass, and as deuterium is twice the mass of hydrogen, it has very different zero-point energy. This means the bonds between deuterium and oxygen in water are harder to break than between hydrogen and oxygen, and that changes the rates of reaction for a whole host of biological processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
