		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Union flag is made up of three crosses:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.flags.net/images/largeflags/UNKG0100.GIF" target="_blank">cross of St George, representing England</a>, is a red cross on a white (representing silver) background;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://flagspot.net/images/i/ie-stpat.gif" target="_blank">cross of St Patrick, representing Ireland</a>, is a red saltire on a white background;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.greensofgloucestershire.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/c/scotland-sky-st-andrews-cross-53-eyelets_1.png" target="_blank">cross of St Andrew, representing Scotland</a>, is a white saltire on a blue background.</li>
</ul>
<p>The white in all of these flags is known in heraldry as &quot;argent&quot;, meaning &quot;silver&quot;, and is one of the two &quot;metals&quot;, the other being &quot;or&quot; (&quot;gold&quot;) which is represented as yellow; the red and blue (or &quot;gules&quot; and &quot;azure&quot;) are &quot;colours&quot;. One of the rules in heraldry is that you can't put a metal on another metal, or a colour on another colour. This already causes a problem if you try to put the cross of St George on the blue background of the cross of St Andrew, because then you'd get gules (a colour) on azure (another colour), which isn't allowed. To avoid that, the red cross is &quot;fimbriated argent&quot;, meaning it's given a white outline.</p>
<p>The original Union Flag (or Union Jack -- it's a myth, apparently, that you can only call it the &quot;Union Jack&quot; if it's flying from the jack mast of a ship) was created when England and Scotland were united as Great Britain, and so only had the crosses of St George and St Andrew: it looked <a href="https://www.awesomestories.com/images/user/915520df7d.gif" target="_blank">like this</a>.</p>
<p>Later, Ireland entered into a union with Great Britain, and it was represented by the cross of St Patrick. But if you put the cross of St Patrick and the cross of St Andrew on top of each other, all you see is whichever cross is on top -- you don't see the one below.</p>
<p>So to depict both crosses, they were <em>quartered</em> and <em>counterchanged</em>: they were split so that each &quot;arm&quot; of the &quot;X&quot; showed half argent (St Andrew) and half gules (St Patrick). And then the quartered saltire was fimbriated argent to avoid the &quot;colour on colour&quot; problem.</p>

The &quot;red lines&quot; aren't continuous, but they meet at a point. The narrow white strips are the fimbriation; the wider white strips are what is visible of the cross of St Andrew.</p>
<p><a href="http://m.eet.com/media/1175608/union-jack-03.gif" target="_blank">This diagram will help you to understand the counterchanging and fimbriation</a>: for the purposes of illustration, the crosses are fimbriated or.</p>

It looks uneven because the red and white is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbriation" target="_blank">fimbriated</a> with additional white - on the white edge of the saltire you can't visually tell where the saltire ends and the fimbriation begins but in flag terms those are considered distinct from one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because then one set of 'lines' would be superior to another.
The UK flag is a combination of three different flags.<br />
The Flag of Scotland: Blue with a White 'X'<br />
The St. Patrick's Cross: White with a Red 'X'<br />
The St. George's Cross: White with a Red '+'<br />
If you combine these three you get the UK flag. However flags are  also symbols of heraldry, which means that there are rules for how these things can be combined. In the case of the UK flag the Scottish flag and st Patrick's cross are 'quartered per saltire' and 'countercharged' which is a fancy way of saying that in each of the four triangular areas formed (quartered per saltrie) that the forground and background colors are reversed (countercharged). This makes it so that the flag of Scotland isn't 'superior' to St. Patrick's cross (or vice versa).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually no documented reason other than &quot;that's what the specifications say&quot;.</p>
<p>The flag was invented when the United Kingdom was formed in 1801, by combining the crosses of St George (patron saint of England), St Andrew (patron saint of Scotland) and St Patrick (patron saint of Ireland). As <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Flags_of_the_Union_Jack.png" target="_blank">this diagram shows</a>.</p>
<p>The exact text of how to combine the crosses is full of obscure vexilogical terms, and reads: <em>&quot;the Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter charged argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].&quot;</em></p>
<p>Translated into diagramatical form, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/United_Kingdom_Flag_Specifications.svg" target="_blank">it means this</a> -- so as you can see, it's designed that the cross of St Patrick is offcentred.</p>
<p>One advantage this provides (although probably not the original intention of the flag's designers) is that you can fly the UK flag upside-down. It's subtle, but there is a definite difference. In the British military an upside-down Union Flag is used as a secret distress signal (e.g. when a ship is being boarded by enemies), because it was believed that the enemy probably wouldn't notice the upside-down flag, but any British ships in the vicinity certainly would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the most mysterious things about the Orangutan.  We really don't know much.  The Orangutan is of the slowest maturing mammals - 7 to 10 years to reach reproduction age for males, and about 5 years for females - however, most male Orangutans don't mate before about 15 years of age.  Our knowledge on when the flanges start developing is unknown.  Our understanding is they start growing once its convenient for them socially.  Once the development starts, it will take about a year for the flange to fully grow in.  This flange also comes with muscles around the throat, longer hair, and a musty odor.  Once one male develops his flanges, it is unknown why other males suppress their flange development.  It is unknown how this suppression takes place, but we speculate that it might be through hormones.  There have also been studies that show that the presence of a fully flanged male does inhibit the growth of other Orangutans' flanges, but not indefinitely.  There are some scientists who believe that instead of hormones suppressing the growth of the flanges, it could be stress.  The testosterone levels of both flanged and non-flanged orangutans are the same so that crosses the thought that testosterone could cause it.  <strong>BUT</strong>!!!  There is one difference.  And that is the level of oestrogen in the urine of flanged males which breed; it is significantly lower than those who don't.  Some believe that flanged males who are aggressive to other flanged males create social stress, in turn causing the less dominant flanged males to produce oestrogen and be turned away from mating.</p>
<p><em>TL:DR - No one really knows anything about the weird mystery that is the flange</em></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I kinda went off on a tangent about Orangutans.  I get excited.  They develop them once their body starts maturing and they start becoming of age for reproduction.  But that can take anywhere between 7-15 years.  It takes about a year to fully develop.  Scary big flanged Orangutans usually suppress other orangutans into not growing flanges.  Even bigger scarier flanged Orangutans supress big scary flanged orangutans into not mating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The flanged males are big dominate guys and they will fight over females with other males to gain dominance and the right to mate. The unflanged males are sneaky bastards. They chose not to waste energy fighting other males for territory and instead they tend to sneak into flanged males dominated territories and rape females. While sad, it has been shown that rape is definitely part of orang society and some anthropologists have controversially used this behavior to try to prove that rape is actually a natural and normal occurrence in humans.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found this website that has a good explaination (<a href="http://www.just-eat.co.uk/blog/why-does-alcohol-make-you-hungry/" target="_blank">http://www.just-eat.co.uk/blog/why-does-alcohol-make-you-hungry/</a>). I'll paste the explanation below to save a click.</p>
<p>Inhibitions</p>
<p>It’s one of the first reasons people drink alcohol – to relax. But that means that you haven’t got the same inhibitions as usual – stress and anxiety is reduced. But that also means you don’t feel anywhere near as guilty for having an extra-large pizza when you could’ve just shared a medium. Think we’ve all been there.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<p>Next, alcohol stimulates the hypothalamus – the bit in your brain that deals with things like body temperature, sleep rhythm, and HUNGER.</p>
<p>When the hypothalamus is triggered, we get hungry when we usually wouldn’t be – in particular, for unhealthy foods…</p>
<p>Blood pressure</p>
<p>Because alcohol is technically a poison, your body starts working to get it out of your system. The effort our body makes to process alcohol reduces its ability to keep your body’s sugar levels balanced. This drop in blood pressure may result in a sudden and strong carb craving – which explains why we not only get hungry when we drink, but why we crave carb-heavy food.</p>
<p>Alcohol contains a lot of calories, but like other liquid calories, it doesn’t fill you up the way food does. This isn’t unreasonable – if you’re relaxed, your healthy eating intentions will go out the window.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It would explain why many people say they eat more when they have had a few drinks. Rather than loss of restraint, it is a neuronal response, the Francis Crick Institute team says.</p>
<p>...The mice were given generous doses of alcohol for three days - a dose being equivalent to around 18 units or a bottle-and-a-half of wine for a person.
The alcohol caused increased activity in neurons called AGRP. These are the neurons that are fired when the body experiences starvation.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shucks I am late to the party...  Ok well one of the biggest things is that alcohol as a fuel source is broken down to produce energy, however parts of your body (specifically the brain) require glucose.  When ethanol is broken down it leads to the changing of an electron carrier (read energy carrier) NAD+ to NADH.  With all the substrate of NAD+ being converted to NADH the accumulation actually acts in a feed back loop stopping gluconeogenesis (the process your body uses to make glucose when you are actively not eating, like when asleep).  So while the explanation about everyone saying the psychological component is technically right, one of the big factors is that your brain is tell your body &quot;hey fucker, I'm starving here&quot; since it prefers to use glucose as a fuel source.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is a calorie? It's a measure of energy in the form of heat and it's determined by burning a measured amount of something, and seeing how much it can raise the temperature of a fixed amount of water. </p>
<p>Not everything that burns is edible and not everything that is edible gets digested or converted into energy. A classic example is insoluble fiber. We lack the stomach to digest it, it has a calorie value, but since we can't make use of it, it doesn't really count. </p>
<p>In the case of alcohol it is broken down by the liver, which takes time, and eventually we get some carbohydrate from it hours later. The fact that alcohols take so long to break down, is useful for delivering carbohydrates in a slow and steady manner to prevent spikes in blood sugar. For instance many diabetic candies use alcohols for sweetener because the body absorbs them so slowly. </p>
<p>It's also important to realize that unless you're drinking a distilled spirit like vodka, you are not drinking pure alcohol (and water in the case of vodka). A beer has calories, but much of that comes from the starches and carbohydrates in the beer that didn't get converted to alcohols. The same for wine and other fermented beverages. So they have calories, but it's not all from alcohol. </p>
<p>In the case of carbohydrates they trigger an insulin reaction, which gives you a quick boost of energy, but then your blood sugar plummets which triggers hunger. It's the same reason drinking a soda might make you hungry. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sociopath and psychopath aren't official medical terms and so don't have a clear, explicit definition, or a direct mapping to a medical concept. The way they're used can vary depending on the person using them. </p>
<p>Usually they'll either be used interchangeably, or 'psychopath' will be used to mean an especially severe or violent sociopath. There are <em>some</em> professionals who use them to mean different things; Robert Hare, a criminal psychology expert, uses 'sociopath' to refer to a condition you develop as a result of abuse, neglect, growing up in an extremely harsh and uncaring environment (eg being a child soldier or slave), and 'psychopath' to refer to a condition with similar symptoms that is more concrete and innate. But even he admits this is just a convenient way to talk about things in his writing on criminal psychology (where he's an expert) and not necessarily a hard neurological truth.</p>
<p>The medical concept is called Antisocial Personality Disorder. Antisocial, note, does not mean introverted or shy or lonely, that's usually called being <em>a</em>social. Antisocial means more 'against society.' Antisocial Personality Disorder/'sociopathy' is defined by an inability to conceive of other people as actual people, extremely muted social emotion, exaggerated and uncontrolled nonsocial emotion (eg something that would make a normal person mildly irritated will make them seethe with rage), and usually attributes of narcissism (&quot;everything other people say and do is secretly about me, if anything bad happens to me it was other people being jealous and malicious because nothing is ever my fault&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are all great answers, but I would like to underscore the first point in the top comment:</p>
<p>These are not official or clinical terms in the field of psychiatry. A person can't be &quot;diagnosed&quot; as a psychopath. Rather, these are social labels that people use to define abstract concepts of complex personalities. Naturally, that means that they overlap a lot. A lot of people have mentioned Antisocial Personality Disorder as mirroring cultural ideas of sociopathy, but I haven't seen anyone mention Conduct Disorder. CD is probably the closest clinical relative of psychopathy, like APD is to sociopathy. It's your basic toddlers-drowning-kittens type of thing, and only presents from a very young age. Like most personality disorders, this is also not something that can be easily handled by medication.</p>
<p>I would <em>heavily</em> hesitate (Edit: flat out refuse) to relate general psychosis (ie. schizophrenia) to psychopathy, since the two definitions just don't overlap enough. Doing so only increases stigma on an already vulnerable group, who are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Just my input as someone who has worked with these populations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distinctions between 'sociopathy' and 'psychopathy' has been widely debated in the field of Psychology due to the very issue surrounding whether 'sociopathy' is an officially diagnosable term. </p>
<p>Psychopathy is firstly recognized as the neurological imbalance and lesions within the amygdala, the part of the brain that controls fear and judgment. With that in mind, those diagnosed with psychopathy primarily lack general empathetic abilities; the ability to understand and comprehend hurt, grief, love, and affection, as well as the desire to experience thrill-seeking emotions, often to 'compensate' for the lack of other 'basic' emotions that they lack.</p>
<p>Psychopaths are often greatly misunderstood due to media accounts of serial killers, manipulators, liars. Whilst they most certainly have the ability to deceive and manipulate, only a very small fraction of diagnosed psychopaths are dangerous. Generally speaking, psychopaths may live their lives without causing pain or harm to others, although can be masters of manipulation due to their lack of empathy, guilt, or fear. </p>
<p>Bankers are currently statistically rated to have the most psychopaths in its profession; as well as thrill-seeking tendencies, money, achievements, status, ego, and power are often viewed as a desire for those with such traits. They are able to reach goals through the lack of hesitation and perceived fear.</p>
<p>Now, onto Sociopathy. Again, is it an officially diagnosed term? Or is it a pseudo-scientific, watered-down variation of the term, 'psychopathy'? The current DSM categorizes psychopathy as a variation of an antisocial personality disorder prevalent to biological factors.</p>
<p>'Sociopaths' are often vaguely described as similar in traits, although its root causes are based on environmental factors (such as levels of childhood trauma/abuse/grief, etc) in which cause, could also then be contributed to such disorders as 'post traumatic stress disorder', which also causes the same perceived traits as 'sociopaths'. In which case, psychopathy is more clearly definable in terms of the DSM, as a form of an antisocial personality disorder, whereas Sociopathy is often confused with a byproduct of past environmental trauma. </p>
<p>Whilst there is a rather clear difference between the both disorders, with a rather similar outcome, I believe there needs to be more extensive theorized studies in order to strengthen the legitimacy of the term, 'sociopath'. Hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although Psychopathy and Sociopathy are often used interchangeably Psychopathy  is not regarded as the same as anti social personality disorder in psychpathological/forensic/psych literature. </p>
<p>ASPD shows a pretty common pathway from ADHD to Conduct Disorder to Substance Abuse to ASPD. It also seems to have a much bigger nurture  component  than Psychopathy. Take a super impulsive, poorly self regulating  kid put him in a terrible home life and your likely to get ASDP in the  adult.</p>
<p>Psychopathy  on the other hand seems less determind by nurture. Psychopath born in a bad environment = jail, Psychopath born in a nurturing environment =CEO. The main difference  between the two are what's known as low prosocial traits: callousness, lacking empathy (although not the theory of mind kind which can be impaired in autism), lacking remorse. ASPD folk can often report feelings  of  guilt or shame.</p>
<p>Interestingly  although  the DSM doesn't  recognise Psychopathy  in adults as seperate from ASPD the most recent edition DSMV does aknowledge a subtype of conduct  disorder in teens (the usual precursor  to an adult ASPD diagnosis) which is characterised  by  low prosocial traits. So they're  kind of aknowledging the difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While not medical terms, psychopath and sociopath are used differently:</p>
<p>Sociopath is generally someone who is particularly uncaring toward others.  Often a master manipulator who only views other people as tools to get what they want.  Experiences extreme feelings and emotions, but acts on them in antisocial ways, often violently.</p>
<p>Psychopaths are people who genuinely are incapable or have extreme difficulty feeling.  Like a sociopath, they have no problem using other people to get what they want, but unlike a sociopath, they have only a cerebral understanding of human emotions, and do not actually feel them.</p>
<p>A perfect example of the contrast is Tony Soprano (sociopath played by the late and great James Gandolfini) vs Valerie (psychopath played by Beau Garrett) from Season 6 Episode 12 of &quot;House&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: more clarity on my examples.  Also, Dexter (psychopath played by Michael C Hall) would be another and slightly less obscure example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Political parties are organized around hot button issues like taxes, civil rights, abortion, guns, religion, etc. The political parties and their lobbies and their most partisan voting base demand 100% fidelity to their issues. However, the actual work of governing requires compromise and adjustments to deal with new problems.</p>
<p>Take taxes as an example. Back in 1988 George H.W. Bush promised &quot;read my lips, no new taxes&quot; during his presidential campaign. Of course, GHW Bush wasn't really a true believer in supply side economics and he was just saying what his political base wanted to hear. He had also made promises to reduce the deficit and balance the budget. </p>
<p>During his first term in office, Iraq invades Kuwait and GHW Bush leads us into war. As a practical person, Bush knew that he couldn't go to war, cut taxes and balance the budget. Those 3 things can't happen at the same time. So Bush raised some taxes to pay for the war, but he was labeled a &quot;flip flopper&quot; in the 1992 election and he lost to Bill Clinton (with some help from Ross Perot).</p>
<p>GHW Bush was almost certainly &quot;right&quot; to raise some taxes to pay for the war. His only other alternative was to add more deficit spending to pay for the war effort, which would have broken a different campaign promise (though maybe a less politically costly mistake). GHW Bush's rivals in the Republican party criticized him over &quot;flip flopping&quot; on taxes. His Democrat opponents also used the &quot;flip flop&quot; criticism, even though they agreed that it was right to raise taxes to pay for the war, because they only cared about winning the election. Your political opponents will almost never compliment you for reaching across the aisle to compromise, because they want to win elections. Instead, they'll attack you as a &quot;flip flopper&quot; because it will cost you votes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We caught you in a lie or you said something else, you're in trouble now!&quot; That simple idea is much easier to understand and grasp on to than &quot;well this person thought carefully and adjusted their position.&quot;</p>
<p>Now there is some legitimacy in calling some &quot;flip-flopping&quot; cases out. Occasionally a politician is pandering or trying to take both sides of an argument. Sometimes someone will say something in a red state and say basically the opposite in a blue state... in some cases it's clear they either don't have a position but are just saying what the people they are in front of want to hear.</p>
<p>The issue is that there have been some times when a politician was correctly called out for such behavior, but that just leads to people to want to see more of it. That inevitably leads to &quot;this person said the country wasn't ready yet for gay marriage when the country was largely opposed to it, but now that the majority of people in polls support it they're pushing for legalization of gay marriage... they're a total flip-flopper&quot; which may be pandering, but also could be respecting the will of the people or changing their mind along with the rest of the country over the course of a couple decades. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>When they campaign on a specific stance or issue, and then change it as soon as they're in power, it appears (and generally is) disingenuous. If they espoused that opinion during the election, they wouldn't have gotten elected.</li>
<li>When they make a strong stance on principal, and see that it's not getting them any support, they swap it to match the prevailing political winds, it comes across as fickle and pandering.</li>
<li>Regardless of the reasons for a politician changing their mind (including gaining more information or the situation changing - which usually makes the change legitimate and thoughtful), their opponents are going to hammer home the idea of flip-flopping because it is in THEIR best interests to make the other appear weak or indecisive.</li>

Keratinized cells are generally the types of cells on the body that are regularly exposed to the outside world, they tend to be tougher and repair quickly due to the fact they are hydrated and are often exposed to simple trauma. They are arranged in a manner that allows them to slough off and be replaced easily without the deeper layers of tissue becoming exposed.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it also has a lot to do with their &quot;ick&quot; factor. They are very fast, get very large, are hard to kill, and make a really grody crunch/splat combination when you step on them. I think most people around where I live don't necessarily associate them with filth, because in a city with a high population density, some insects are inevitable. But we do know that they thrive in unsanitary, dark, humid conditions, where food supply is open and available and caustic chemicals (such as Clorox or Lysol or other sanitary disinfectants) aren't present to ward them off. So even if my house is spotless, if my neighbor is gross, I could end up with her roaches. I think a lot of it is that we know roaches <em>prefer</em> filth, so seeing them in your home (even if they're just seeking warmth because the season is changing) gives everyone the shock of feeling like their house is dirty. </p>
<p>I think another thing that makes people hate them and think they're unsanitary (at least in the southern United States) is their tendency to end up in places that other pests don't invade. </p>
<p>Example: yes, mice may chew into your dry goods, but the odds of you waking up to one being in the bed with you are slim to none. Flies are gross, but they don't end up desperately flapping into your hair, getting entangled. Spiders are cool (except when they're inconveniently located), but they don't tend to spaz out at you when you open a cabinet or closet. </p>
<p>I lived in a nightmare rental property once and we had roaches so badly that you had to shake out the bedsheets before going to bed. Or the time one ran down my naked back because it was chilling in the folds of my hung up bathrobe. Or the time that I woke up in the nude and one was preening his antennae while resting on my bare chest. Fucking A. </p>
<p>The worst was when one had decided to take a nap inside of my hairdryer. I did not become aware of this until the fan blades chopped him into tiny pieces and the heating element fried his guts into crispy chunks and shot them all into my freshly washed, wet hair. So glad I don't live there anymore. </p>
<p>But I'll be damned, I'll still take cockroaches over spider crickets. Any day. Fuck those things. </p>

<p>It's the same way we find lice disgusting. Yes it's kinda yucky that little bugs are living in your hair, but they're associated with unclean people as well. Lice actually prefer clean hair to dirty hair. And they can infest anyone, regardless of their cleanliness. Just like cockroaches. </p>
<p>I think ultimately, it comes down to the fact that as children we are <em>told</em> cockroaches are disgusting so we grow up having this belief and passing it on to other people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dated a guy in high school whose guardians' house (his grandparents) was INFESTED with German roaches. I am not a squeamish girl by any means, but this was bad. You'd walk in the front door to a dark house, and roaches would scatter up the walls, across the floor, and across the ceiling away from the light from the open door. They were inside the dishwasher, the oven, the fridge and the freezer. The house just had this... <em>smell</em> to it. And it stuck to him, his hair, his skin, his clothes.</p>
<p>The house was a mobile home and had a built-in radio/speaker system, with the tuning dial mounted on the wall in the living room. Inside the plastic covering of the tuning dial was absolutely filled with discarded egg cases. When I realized that I just recoiled.</p>
<p>I came over one night to have taco salad with him and his grandparents. I had ingredients spread out on the kitchen table and was having to flick roaches away from them because they kept crawling toward the food. I was paranoid that I would find one in my taco salad and so it was hard to be hungry...</p>
<p>The ex ended up finding one in the sour cream on top of his salad in the bowl... he picked it out (still alive) and just tossed it away... and kept eating. Yeah I was full after that.</p>
<p>I didn't stay with him much longer. I started to worry I would bring home hitch hikers to my own house... somehow his grandmother's car also had roaches in it.</p>
<p>But despite all that, roaches don't gross me out or make me freak out. The place I moved into last year had a residual minor infestation (German) from the previous tenant. I used a gel bait and an insect growth regulator, and within a month they were totally gone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>roaches are more than just unpleasant to look at, they also have the potential to spread diseases through cross-contamination as well as cause some significant allergic reactions.</p>
<p>A cockroach’s typical diet consists of feces, trash, and uncovered food, giving them ample opportunity to come into contact with dangerous bacteria and then spread it all over your next meal. It’s believed that roaches can transmit a wide variety of diseases in this manner, including gastroenteritis, dysentery, cholera, leprosy, typhoid fever, and salmonella, as well as also carrying parasitic worm larvae on their bodies. Even if food is kept well covered, the mere presence of roaches in your house means that they still could be tracking their tiny germ-ridden footprints throughout your home and kitchen, across counter tops, and all over plates and glassware.</p>
<p>An equally serious problem with cockroach infestations is their potential to cause allergic reactions and worsen existing cases of asthma. Certain people are allergic to proteins found in cockroach feces and saliva, the exposure to which can result in skin rashes, coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. These same roach allergens can also trigger serious asthma attacks, especially in children. Asthma alone can be a life-threatening disease, and a large portion of asthmatics are also allergic to cockroaches, leading to much worse symptoms when they are in prolonged proximity with theses insects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In chronological order: </p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the French surrendered twice: First in 1814, after which Napoleon was sent into exile at Elba. Then again after he came back in early 1815 and was defeated at Waterloo. </li>
<li>During the Franco-Prussian War, the entire French Army was surrounded by the Germans at Sedan and surrendered. This defeat was catastrophic and cost them the war. </li>
<li>During World War I, the French Army mutinied and refused to attack anymore. (They still fought defensively) They decided to wait over a year until tanks and American soldiers arrived before they would go on the offense again. In perhaps the greatest intelligence failure of all time, the Germans failed to learn of the strike. </li>
<li>During World War II, the French surrendered after the German blitzkrieg had overrun the Allied armies in Belgium. </li>
<li>During the First Indo-China War, the French (who fought the entire war with a succession of terrible commanders, little political commitment, and no long-term planning) decided to try to sever the Vietminh supply lines using an airbase situated in the middle of a bunch of hills at Dien Bein Phu. Instead, the Vietminh surrounded them and shelled them for weeks until they gave up. The defeat was catastrophic and cost them the war. </li>
<li>EDIT: I'll also add that in 1759 the French were defeated at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (just outside of Quebec) and surrendered. This defeat was catastrophic and cost them the French and Indian War (that's the 7 Years War to you Europeans)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Fun fact: During Vietnam, American commadner William Westmooreland was asked if they could learn anything from the french experience. His reply was (paraphrasing) &quot;Why would we try to learn anything from the French? They haven't won a battle since the age of Napoleon.&quot; - which is both historically inaccurate (they won both battles of the Marne and Verdun during World War I, just to name two very important counter-examples) and indicative of Westmooreland's incompetency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Broadcast
21st October 1940 by Winston Churchill</p>
<p>Frenchmen! For more than 30 years in peace and war I have marched with you.</p>
<p>I am marching still along the same road. Tonight I speak to you at your firesides, wherever you may be, or whatever your fortunes are: I repeat the  prayer that upon the louis d'or, &quot;Dieu protege la France&quot;</p>
<p>Here at home in England, under the the fire of the Bosche we do not forget the ties and links that unite us to France . . .</p>
<p>Here in London, which Her Hitler says he will reduce to ashes, and which his aeroplanes are now bombarding, our people are bearing up unflinchingly. Our Air Force has more than held its own.  We are waiting for the long promised invasion.  So are the fishes . . .</p>
<p>Frenchmen - rearm your spirits before it is too late. Remember how Napoleon said before one of his battles:î   These same Prussians who are so boastful today were three to one at Jena, and six to one at Montmirailî</p>
<p>Never will I believe that the soul of France is dead! Never will I believe that her place amongst the greatest nations of the world has been lost forever.</p>
<p>Remember that we shall never stop,  never weary, and never give in . . . We seek to beat the life and soul out of Hitler and Hitlerism. That alone - that all the time - that to the end. Those French who are in the French Empire, and those who are in the so-called unoccupied France, may see their way from time to time to useful action, I will not go into details  . . hostile ears are listening . . .</p>
<p>Good night then: Sleep to gather strength for the morning.  For the morning will come. brightly it will shine on the brave and true, kindly upon all who suffer for the cause, glorious upon the tombs of heroes. Thus will shine the dawn.</p>
<p>VIVE LA FRANCE!
Long live also the forward march of the common people in all lands towards their just and true inheritance, and towards the broader and fuller age.</p>

London

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The French kind of got a bum rap.  It mainly due to WW2 after the German Occupied France, also they had a little issue in Vietnam that went real bad for them, I mean real bad. </p>
<p>Huge part of it is the rivaly with England and France, Napoleonic wars and 100 year war kept that rivalry up.  Also note during the Imperial Age British by the start of WW1  they controlled 25% of the world population and so it not a surprise they would use propaganda to make themselves look better. That little culture war is it own story, so I will stick with military.</p>
<p>In reality France army is no laughing joke. Heavy Calvary during medieval times where unmatched, and feared.  WW! they held their own for a long time, long before us Yank go in the fight.  Just look up Verdun, which was the benchmark for crazy until Stalingrad.  During WW2 they actually had more tanks which where more advance then the German Panzers at the time.  The issue was they where spread them out across Maginot Line.  Which kept them from spear attack of the German Bliz.  This did not just catch the French off guard but also the British allies.  Look up Battle of Dunkirk.  Even though the French government surrendered, The military and French people kept fighting a lot of time out gunned with no reinforcements for years, they don't sound like quitters to me.</p>
<p>Then the Indochina wars or when as we Americans join in the Vietnam war, well that was clusterfuck nobody did well in that. </p>
<p>Also  us silly Americans would not of won our little spat with England over our Independence.  They recognized us as a Nation, supplied us with guns, tanning, and at a critical moment their Navy. Yeah the French cock block the British and we knew it.  It why good old 100 dollar Benny when to France to have a talk.  Now I just list some of really big stuff that effect the whole world but the smaller engagements are really show their strength.  The French commanders are brilliant and most of time they actually show it. Which is why you heard of Napoleon. The issue with that brilliants is when it all go wrong, it like a giant spot light pointing at the mistake, and history only remember the failures more often then the success.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it comes down to historical ignorance. Many people in America only know very recent history.  In World War 2 France was overwhelmed by the German onslaught and surrendered very quickly.  Allied troops then had to invade Europe and liberate France so it be became sort of a joke that the French were weak militarily.  Fast forward to 2003 when the French refused to back the US invasion of Iraq and this joke became even deeply more rooted as people viewed the French as weak or not willing to help the US like the US helped the French.</p>
<p>All of this ignores the facts that France has an illustrious military history and that the United States wouldn't exist without French help.  The French fought tenaciously and suffered immensely during World War 1.  Their casualty numbers are staggering.  Anyone who makes fun of French military history basically doesn't know history. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most tribal lands (barring the huge gigantic ones in created by mashing a bunch of completely different people groups together) are pretty small. They're also almost never on valuable land. What's an industry that doesn't take up a lot of space, is pretty damn lucrative, and doesn't need a ton of natural resources? Congrats, you've got gambling. Pretty much just gambling. </p>
<p>Casinos are one of the few fairly reliable large industries the US lets tribes have, but trying to build a casino when there hasn't been one before is hell itself. For real, recognized tribes have to fight local legislation tooth and nail to build on land they own. </p>
<p>Fun fact, a lot of tribes don't have federally mandated reservations. Some were either never forcibly removed en masse (many ojibwe nations) but rather had land &quot;purchased&quot; from them over time; or lost all their land but returned to find it under new ownership (nansemond bands). Under these circumstances, it's super difficult to convince local governments that they don't have the right to govern lands owned by the tribes.</p>
<p>As for the whole tradition and honor thing, that's pretty much 90% Hollywood bs. Family is important, learning the culture is important, sure, but in what culture is that not true? And it's pretty hard to keep your culture alive when you're forced into poverty, had your grandparents taken to what's essentially child prison camps to get their language and way of life beaten outta them, then told you're not a real country/American/Indian enough, and constantly legislated into not being able to do the things your ancestors did. Pretty much fucking sucks all around, honestly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tribes are technically &quot;Sovereign Nations&quot; this means US laws do not apply on reservation land. Some even go so far as to have their own <a href="http://www.caretakersoftheearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Haudenosaunee-passport.jpg" target="_blank">passports</a>.</p>
<p>It's an odd scenario where they can be US citizens, but do not have to be.</p>
<p>Though back to the casinos. many US states have laws against gambling. Or laws requiring certain odds. These laws do not apply to the reservations, as they are not part of the state, <em>technically</em>.</p>
<p>So they can have much worse odds. Usually the state will indefinitely lease the land to the casino in exchange for a cut of the profits. This allows them to circumvent all laws and regulation, without compromising their &quot;values&quot; against gambling.</p>
<p>basically it's one giant loophole and it makes lots of money, so it keeps happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before Europeans colonized North America, tribes were essentially their own countries. Colonization/conquest eroded that status over time, but under American law, tribes still have many of the powers they originally had as independent sovereigns.
Before the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, there were multiple court decisions (like Seminole Tribe v. Butterworth) that said the ability to allow gaming was one of those powers still within tribal sovereignty. IGRA limited that inherent authority, regulating how tribes have to go about gaming activities and coordinating with the states -- it didn't create their authority, though.
Indian gaming grew because, in some places, tribes had a competitive advantage and a good market. But only about half of  tribes actually have any gaming at all, and only a fraction of those have very large, profitable casinos. Some have decided not to do gaming for the reasons you hint at: they think it creates too many problems, isn't consistent with their culture, or just won't be profitable in their situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote my dissertation on this very topic and I don't think anyone's nailed it in their answers yet. </p>
<p>Edit - I've only got a hard copy of the dissertation (I graduated years ago). Thanks to everyone who asked to read it, if I remember I'll try and scan it.</p>
<p>Crash91 has got a lot right but has made a few points I disagree with.</p>
<p>So, </p>
<p>Heavy Metal - This grew out of Hard Rock and used the same scales, rhythms and subject matter. Black Sabbath are widely cited as the first true Heavy Metal band, giving birth to both the Heavy Metal genre in general and the Doom Metal genre in particular. Led Zepellin, Deep Purple etc are Hard Rock and are only accepted as Heavy Metal bands in the US. In the UK Heavy Metal begins with Sabbath. Original Heavy Metal was fairly slow, gloomy, bluesy and lyrically dealt with subjects such as war, drugs, religion and occult themes. Vocals clean and sung.</p>
<p>Later iterations in the 70s, such as Saxon, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest are also considered Heavy Metal but are sometimes referred to as NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal) and were pioneers of the 'chugging' guitar sound people often associate with classic Heavy Metal as well as the use of twin guitar harmonised leads. Generally faster and more bombastic, the vocals of NWOBHM were more high pitched and the lyrics while dealing with similar themes, more fantastical. Hair or Glam Metal also grew out of this style (but it's awful!).</p>
<p>Thrash Metal - Thrash was a product of the 80s and metal's reaction to the aggression of Punk in the late 70s. The band that kick started the whole thing were Venom from Newcastle in the UK. They are sometimes classed as NWOBHM but they don't really fit in that category because they were pretty poor musicians. Their contribution was mainly down to aural extremity, though they sound fairly tame now. They had a 'heavier' sound than previous bands combining speed, harsher distortion tone on their guitars, faux satanic lyrics and shouted/growled vocals. They were a big influence on a lot of Thrash and Black metal bands but were pretty rubbish themselves (controversial opinion!).</p>
<p>Early Thrash was pretty loose and messy with a lot of poor musicianship, bands like Sodom, Kreator and Destruction (Germany) made an unholy racket and began to attract the punk kids as well as the metalheads. Later bands worked out how to play their instruments better and the drumming in particular became more accomplished. Classic Thrash as played by the big four (Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer and Anthrax) combines very fast drumming often using 'punkier' beats, NWOBHM guitar riffs played at faster speeds, more aggressive vocals and 'face ripping' (extremely fast and shrill) solos which are often atonal (not in any given key!). Lyrically Thrash was concerned with politics, nuclear war and occult/satanic themes.</p>
<p>Death Metal - In the late 80s there was a lot of genre cross pollination and this lead to Death Metal and Grindcore (as well as many other specialist 'cores). Death Metal ramps up the intensity, complexity, heaviness and obscenity of Thrash Metal. It downtunes the guitars (makes them sound deeper) and is characterised by a particular drum beat known as the 'blast beat', and the use of double kick pedals on the bass drum to achieve a rumbling, machine-gun like effect. The vocals are extremely low grunts, growls and roars and are almost impossible to decipher without a lyric sheet. Similar to Thrash, early Death Metal bands struggled to make their musicianship meet their intentions but later bands and a lot of modern bands play music of quite dizzying complexity utilising odd time signatures and even bizarre tunings (tuning the strings on their guitars differently) to make the sound more unsettling. </p>
<p>This is the overall 'heaviest' style of metal sonically and lyrically deals with all manner of things including but not limited too, gore, zombies, war, sexual perversions, horror movies, torture and ancient Egypt (that's just one band called Nile from the US to be fair). Death Metal's heyday was the late 80s and early 90s but there's still plenty of great modern Death Metal being made today. While Thrash is seen as a retro style that will always evoke the early 80s, Death Metal has evolved much further and incorporated far more styles including, doom, prog, industrial and middle eastern/oriental music.</p>
<p>Black Metal - This one's a bit unique as it all began with a small group of teenagers in Jessheim in Norway in the late 80s/early 90s. They wanted to be 'evil' and 'extreme' but they lacked the musical ability to rival the predominantly (at the time) Swedish and American Death Metal scenes. So instead they did what anyone would do (not) they started burning down churches, proclaiming themselves 'Satanists' and killing each other. They were influenced by bans such as Venom (UK), Mercyful Fate (Denmark) and Celtic Frost (Switzerland) all of whom had elements of NWOBHM and Thrash in their sounds but distinguished themselves by being 'Satanic' with varying degrees of seriousness.</p>
<p>Whether or not they were serious, the kids in Norway took it all very seriously and out of that scene came what's come to be known as the 'Second Wave of Black metal', generally accepted as it's 'classic' phase. This style is typified by ultra lo-fi production values including lots of hiss, feedback and distortion a focus on treble rather than bass and vocals that were shrieked or screamed rather than grunted or growled. The music itself is far more primitive and basic than Death Metal and often utilises fast tremolo (rapid down/up strokes on a single string) guitar parts and minor scale arpeggios. Guitar solos are rare. </p>
<p>Due to these production techniques the music can take on a hypnotic quality where it's passed through heavy on to something more languid on the other side. Critics say it's poorly played, badly recorded and the product of stupid teenagers with offensive views. The early Norwegian black metal guitar sound has often been likened to a swarm of angry wasps in a box but those who love it find something spiritual about it. The lyrics deal with Satanism of course but also a strand of Nietzschean elitism and an affinity with the Norwegian landscape (ice, frost, forests, mountains etc).</p>
<p>Later Black Metal has evolved in myriad ways and incorporated allsorts of other styles including folk, celtic, oriental/middle eastern, prog, goth, shoegaze and traditional Nordic music. Offshoots include Blackened Death Metal, Viking Metal and Symphonic Black metal which combines the music with sweeping orchestral backing.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, I could go on for days. If you want recommendations, here are mine;</p>

<p>Someone asked for a tl;dr so;</p>
<p>Heavy Metal - Clean vocals, bluesy riffs, witches, weed and war.
Thrash Metal - Speedy guitar riffs, punk attitude, hardcore drumming, shouty vocals, political lyrics.
Death Metal - Downtuned guitars, complex riffs, machine gun drums, grunting/growling vocals, lyrics about horror movies, zombies and gore.
Black metal - Trebly guitars, simple riffs, atmospheric arrangements, shrieking vocals, Satanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not easy to define precisely what counts as which genre in metal, especially with the large number of sub-genres. The lines between many are blurry and there are even many &quot;crossover&quot; artists or genres. I think its a bit better to take the bands that defined the sound of the genre as an example.
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Metal:</strong>
&quot;Old-school&quot; Metal. This pretty much laid the ground for the many many sub-genres that now exist. Heavy Metal's roots were from Blues/Rock, but was defined by the &quot;heavy&quot; sound of distorted guitars. Singing is still pretty clean but more &quot;powerful&quot; than traditional rock.
Think bands like Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin back in the 1960s-70s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thrash Metal:</strong>
A generation of kids grew up listening to Heavy Metal and finally started to form their own bands in the 80s - this was the decade of Thrash. Heavy Metal, but heavier. Faster drums and more complicated and distorted guitars. Singing is more aggressive - shouts and screams are used. The defining bands of this genre are known as &quot;The Big Four&quot; of thrash metal: Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax. Lyrics are usually politically themed (influenced from Punk).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Black Metal:</strong>
Really fast tempo songs - guitars are distorted and notes are tremolo picked (one note played multiple times really fast) to create a drone-like sound. Vocals are harsh and mostly screamed and are not always clear. Songs are usually longer than the average song length (5-10+ minutes). This is (probably) the genre that gave rise to the idea that metal is &quot;devil-worship&quot; or &quot;satanic&quot; because of the lyrics and the image portrayed by many of the performers. Famous bands are: Bathory, Emperor, Mayhem and Dimmu Borgir</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Death Metal:</strong>
This genre is a bit more difficult to classify because of the multiple sub-genres it has spawned, however usually the sound is even heavier than the other genres mentioned above because the guitars are tuned to a lower pitch. Drums use blast-beats which is essentially playing two or more parts of the kit really fast (16th notes) in order to achieve an &quot;explosive&quot; sound. Vocals are also harsh and incorporate low pitched growling along with other extreme vocal techniques. Guitar solos are usually blazing fast and extremely complicated.
Famous bands are: Death, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse and Entombed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heavy metal: Chug-a-wug. Slow, deep heavy stuff like Black Sabbath.</p>
<p>Thrash Metal: Chuggada-Wuggada. Faster, more rhythmic, usually with a bleeding fast meedlie-deedlie solo before diving back into a chugga-da-wuggada riff.</p>
<p>Black Metal: Meedlie-Deedlie. Squiddly fast high notes played super fast, with heavy chuggadas underneath.</p>
<p>Death Metal: Chuggada wuggada with meedlie deedlies in equal measure, and Cookie Monster on vocals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
