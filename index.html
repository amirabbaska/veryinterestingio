For something like the Sun, whose surface is 6000 K, the peak of thermal radiation is in the visible (it's almost like our eyes evolved to take advantage of that!).

Synchrotron radiation, Bremstrahlung (free-free emission), and Compton emission are processes that occur between two free particles or between one free particle and a photon. For free particles, energy is continuous rather than discrete even on the quantum level, so a continuous blackbody spectrum is easily produced. Note that because the Sun is hot, its hydrogen is mostly ionized. Therefore, there are few bound particles present at all, and continuous emission processes dominate on the Sun. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think all of these answers are good, but way more complicated than they need to be. You are correct that there are discrete frequencies that account for much of the radiation. But not all radiation is produced by an electron changing state from one orbital to another, in the manner that would produce specific bands with gaps in between them.  In plasmatized matter, like you'd find on a star's surface, there are liberated charges all over the place, accelerating every which way, every possible amount, as a result of thermal kinetic motion and collisions. Every time one of them is accelerated, a different wavelength can be emitted. So it is possible to identify certain frequencies in the radiation of stars, but also a continuous spectrum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're talking about concentrations that would be nearly undetectable if the substances weren't radioactive. Let's run some numbers.</p>
<p>The highest recorded residential levels of radiation from radon and its decay products have been on the order of 100,000 becquerels of activity per cubic meter of air, where 1 Bq is defined as one atom decaying per second.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we'll pretend that each atom is removed from the sample as soon as it decays to lead-210, and radon is added as necessary to keep the activity at 100k Bq/m^3.</p>
<p>For one atom to go from radon-222 to lead-210 is a total of five decays: three alpha and two beta. Dividing our 100,000 decays per second by five decays per atom, we get 20,000 atoms of lead per cubic meter per second.</p>
<p>Now, applying that rate to a 50-m^3 room for 100 years (3.154 x 10^9 seconds), we get 3.154 x 10^15 atoms of lead, with a total mass of about a microgram.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have pleasure of working on LNG tankers, we load and discharge refrigirated methane on a regular basis, however it is not pure 100% methane, there are traces of other gases loaded in the mix, and one of them is... Radon gas. So in line with your reasoning we should see a lot of lead 210 in our tanks. And do we? Yup, we actually have to test the tanks for lead 210 residue before entering cargo tanks, lead 210 tends to form a dusty layer on the surface of the cargo tanks and all of it comes from decayed Radon gas. I hope this helps! I can talk about this for hours...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SO, for starters, 4pCi/L is equal to 0.148 decay events per second per liter.</p>
<p>So that is 148 decays per second per cubic meter per second.</p>
<p>Now lets go with your question in the op and ask, ignoring the half lives of the intervening steps on the decay chain, how much lead is produced per cubic meter of volume in a basement with this activity level over the course of 100 years?</p>
<p>So, 148 decays per cubic meter per second, 148 decay/(m^3 x sec).</p>
<p>148 decay/(m^3 x sec) x 60 sec/min x 60 min/hr x 24 hr/day x 365 day/yr x 100yr = 4.667x10^11 lead atoms per cubic meter of basement volume.</p>
<p>4.667x10^11 lead atoms = 7.750x10^-13 moles of lead = 1.604x10^-10 grams of lead</p>
<p>So.  At 4pCi/L Radon activity for 100 years, you will be left with 0.1604 nanograms of lead per cubic meter.  Or 0.1241 parts per trillion airborne lead contamination.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/water.htm" target="_blank">CDC</a> 15 parts per billion is the max allowable in drinking water, so the basement air is around 10,000 times less contaminated that what is considered max safe to drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General: Biology is about things that live in an environment. We make models (like genetic models) to help us understand a factor (like what proteins a gene produces) among many other factors. The distinction between what you call a genetic anomaly (bad/neutral) and evolutionary trait (good) cannot be modeled accurately with only a genetic model. You need to put your genetic model back into the organism and put the organism back into the environment to understand if the trait is helping the organism or not. </p>
<p>With an example:</p>
<p>I'm interpreting your question as: Why are some heritable traits considered good while others are considered neutral or bad? </p>
<p>To answer that I'll use a common example in human genetics: sickle cell anemia. Is sickle cell anemia good trait or a bad trait which we should seek to cure? To answer that we have to think about the environment that the organism with sickle cell anemia is in and ask &quot;Does this trait help, hinder, or have no effect on the survival of the organism?&quot; and then ask the same question about reproductive fitness, group fitness (if it applies) etc. for all the factors you want to think about. More factors controlled means a better model, but also a harder model to understand. (Side note: This is exactly why I love biology so much, the variable difficulty related to scale.)</p>
<p>Back to sickle cell, in equatorial Africa, where there are mosquitos that carry Malaria, sickle cell's down sides (pain, bacteria infection, shortened lifespan) are worth it. This is because sickle cell staves off Malaria which is much more likely to kill the organism before it can reproduce. </p>
<p>In Kansas though, sickle cell is all downside. You're in pain and die younger with no trade off for  increased reproductive fitness or quality of life because there's no Malaria to protect you from. </p>
<p>So is sickle cell a disease or a beneficial trait? As with most biology, the answer can be changed when you change the factors of your model. Change the location factor to Kansas and it's bad, change it to Kenya and it's good. So you have to remember to put your understanding of genetics back into the organism and then put the organism back in it's environment to really know why something is good, bad or neutral. </p>
<p>I think a good biologist seeks to understand the composition of an organism as well as the context of the organism. You cannot understand why something has a certain composition without understanding it's context. (Why does this organism have a protein that resists heat so well? Well because we found it in a hot spring!) </p>
<p>I hope this was all clear and helpful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may help to distinguish between what is <strong>adaptive</strong> and what is an <strong>adaptation</strong>.</p>
<p>A trait (or genetic variant) is <strong>adaptive</strong> if it contributes toward the reproductive success of an individual or lineage that carries it. As has been pointed out by other commenters, this depends on circumstances; what's adaptive under one set of conditions doesn't have to be adaptive elsewhere. A trait can exist simply as selectively neutral variation in a population for ages, until something changes and suddenly individuals that happen to carry the trait become evolutionary winners.</p>
<p>An <strong>adaptation</strong> is something that developed as a result of selection - in other words, it developed not randomly, but <em>because it was adaptive</em>. No trait can <em>start out</em> as an adaptation; ultimately, variation comes from random genetic processes like mutation and migration. However, mutations that contribute toward a certain trait - say, a long tail - can accumulate over time in a population, for as long as having a long tail helps you survive or reproduce. The long tails that these animals end up having, then, are an adaptation. (We can even consider a trait that results from a single mutation as an adaptation, because it eventually spread to the entire population, even if it originally arose by chance in a single individual. But then we need pretty good evidence that it was indeed adaptive; even completely meaningless genetic variants can still spread to the whole population.)</p>
<p>These are orthogonal concepts; they can occur in all combinations. Our DNA is full of bits of old viruses and other junk that (at the moment) does nothing important or useful: these are neither adaptive nor an adaptation. A mole's forepaws are an adaptation to a digging lifestyle, and are very adaptive to boot, because moles still dig a whole lot. A whale's (vestigial) pelvic bones are an adaptation to walking on four legs, but they're no longer adaptive, because whales no longer have hind legs. And so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cultures have &quot;coming of age&quot; rituals, whether they realize it or even recognize what they are. For Americans, getting a car is one, as well as moving out on your own. A lot of this is stemmed from the fact that we value independence and self motivation so much. Staying with your parents implies that you are being lazy, or continuing to be a burden on them. It's similar to people judging someone who is letting their children breastfeed at six-years-old. By staying with your parents, who don't need your help and are often eager to get you out of the house, you are &quot;delaying&quot; maturity.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this stems from a couple of different things. Historically, Americans had their children young, and had a lot of them. My grandmother never went past the 4th grade and had three children by the time she was eighteen. While she was married, my grandfather was in construction and would use that as an excuse to leave them months at a time, drinking all of the money he earned and never giving her any. So she stayed with her parents. This was considered shameful. While she was working in a shirt factory, my great-grandfather was the main means of support for them, even though he was older and had health issues. She was a burden on them. </p>
<p>In Asian cultures, there is a big emphasis on staying with your parents and getting a good job so you can send them money in their old age. But in the last fifty years or so, American culture has gotten accustomed to the idea that parents are wealthy enough to take care of themselves, so your filial duty to your parents is more akin to making sure you visit them. But even then, when the economy has required most people to move for their jobs, it's commonplace that children live states away, which compared to Europe, is like having all of your children live several countries away from you.</p>
<p>Now, we have a conundrum. Young adults struggle to find non-service jobs, and when they do, they are still struggling to support themselves on one income, leading them to stay with their parents. While they are belittled for this, within a decade or so, that same generation will have little to nothing saved up for retirement. With medical expenses looming, they are starting to demand that children who don't live with them to come back and help them.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, our society was capable of the older generation sustaining themselves while the younger generation did the same in the same immediate area. This led to a lot of our current perceptions. But now, good work is scarcer, causing people who stay in their hometown to have jobs that barely keep them floating above water, or moving and not being able to care for the family that once wanted to kick them out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>TL;DR</em>: <strong>It's not all about money</strong>. There's all sorts of different reasons why it's worth shelling out a lot more cash for.</p>
<p>A big one is pride due to social expectations. There's a certain negative and slightly embarrassing status associated with living at home versus a more adult-seeming being-in-charge of your own surroundings when you're living in a bachelor pad or equivalent. It's doubly so when your peer group of friends or workmates all have their own places and you don't have the freedom to invite them over. Ditto the mooching aspect of being a stay-at-home adult/child. Eventually, to a lot of people, it just doesn't seem... right or fair and so they move out. And we as humans want to &quot;own&quot; stuff, and be able to look around at our own little spot and say &quot;this is mine because I'm paying for it / renting it out of my own pocket.&quot;</p>
<p>Some people find that being too close to their parents eventually drive them nuts. They want to live a certain way or not have any limitations on their behaviors. But there's often conditions on having someone else's roof over your head and those eventually become too onerous. OP asked about this from an American perspective, and so it's quite appropriate that one of the key reasons is &quot;freedom&quot;. :)</p>
<p>Others reach a point in a relationship where it's too clumsy and confined to enjoy that relationship at their parents. Most parents don't appreciate their kid having a sex-buddy in their bedroom for a whole weekend. Thumpthumpthump from the second floor becomes old rather quickly.</p>
<p>The parents have a say too, particularly if they're approaching retirement. &quot;Junior, get the hell out so we can live our own life and we won't have to waste our limited money on feeding you!&quot;. They want the house to look and feel the same as before they left for that one-week tour in the camper, not come home to an empty fridge and an unwashed sinkful of dishes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Independence is pretty important in American culture. That's why so many Americans move far from their hometown upon graduation, this usually begins in College. Americans get their first taste of &quot;freedom&quot; from the dominance and control of their parents. We want to be able to do the things we like, without judgement from the previous generation who may not agree with the decisions we make.</p>
<p>On the flip side, not leaving your parents home in your 20s is seen as negative here if you are a healthy fully functional adult. It is viewed as incompetence or laziness from some Americans because you don't have the financial independence or education to provide for yourself, let alone a family.</p>
<p>It is also seen as more acceptable for a woman to be living with her parents than a man. That I don't really have an explanation for besides maybe it's a sexual/dating thing. If both parties live with their parents then who's home would you go to? Since still in this day and age men are primarily considered the providers, they're the ones more likely expected to have a place of their own. This also speaks for financial independence which because of the previous statements is typically viewed favorably on a man by the opposite gender.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an middle aged American, there was a time especially in the 1970s
and early 1980s that you would be publicly ridiculed if you hit 19 yo and you were not:  1. At college, 2. In the military, 3. Living in your own apartment while working a full time job. The terms &quot;loser&quot;, &quot;moocher&quot;, &quot;deadbeat&quot; were common insults heaped upon those legal adults still living at home with their parents. The reason was that apartment rents, cars, college tuition, food, utilities and entertainment were ridiculously cheap compared to today's world. You could work a factory job 40 hrs a week and could afford a new car and your own apartment if not your own home. That world is gone today. Wages have generally stagnated for the past 40 years but the cost of living has skyrocketed. I can't think of a single person including me who borrowed money to attend a university because it was pretty cheap especially the state colleges. Unfortunately, parents today who are my age think that their kids are not doing as well as they did due to their own fault. This is ignorant and naive thinking. Smart kids will not even go to college at all today and start a small business like a pizza place or get a skilled trade. Animal house is long, long over folks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a somewhat complex question because I believe many factors come in play. In more eastern cultures, children don't move out until they have graduated university or landed their main full time job (source: am easterner). In many western families it's 18-out. And I think a comparaison of these two philosophies goes a long way. And I think it's hard to ELI5 it. Basically IMO the western culture one (note: not every western family does this obviously) puts you in a shit position at first, you're young and poor and clueless. But you learn on your own and become very responsible because of that. On the opposite, the eastern one, you move out only when you're comfortable financially. You live no pressure and arguably an &quot;easier&quot; young adulthood. But is that good? Maybe it causes more happiness due to less stress. And it might also make you less responsible and auto-sufficient because you haven't been through the shit those 18-out people have.</p>
<p>I think a middle ground is ideal. But to answer your question, it's a mixture of social expectations in the west, and also getting the person to be able to live on their own. Kinda like the bird mama who watches the baby birds jumping off the nest so they can eventually fly on their own thing. Idk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I've come across 2 chemicals that regularly cause people to all have similar complex hallucinations.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pittmed.health.pitt.edu/jan_2001/butterflies.pdf" target="_blank">Tetraethyllead</a> - when workers were exposed to hazardous concentrations of the chemical, they contracted lead poisoning, but all reported having a similar hallucinations of &quot;being eaten alive by butterflies&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine" target="_blank">DMT</a> - many uses report seeing &quot;machine elves&quot; when they are hallucinating.  </li>
</ol>
<p>My question is: these aren't merely symptoms like stomach pain, or generalized hallucinations like seeing flashing colors, etc.  These are complex thoughts.  How is it that different people can all experience the same complex thoughts from a simple chemical?  Clearly the information isn't being transmitted by the chemical itself... but it's almost more unlikely that the same information is present in everyone's brain waiting for the chemical to trigger it.  Such would suggest that everyone has the same &quot;I'm being eaten by butterflies&quot; receptor in their brain, waiting to be activated by TEL.  </p>
<p>Or is it just that these drugs all affect the brain in some simpler way and everyone just has the same predictable way of making sense of the hallucinogenic effects?  But then what's there to differentiate one hallucinogen from another?  Why does DMT cause people to hallucinate &quot;machine elves&quot;, but other hallucinogens don't?  </p></div></div>

<p>All brains are wired differently but pretty much all of them use the same chemical schematics to do the job, so shared expereinces can come from that. A chemical change that causes one person to perceive an unknown entity may cause the same effect in another, or it may not. </p>

<p>Okay, that's out of the way, conjecture time: the human brain seems to have a lot of specialized circuitry dedicated to subconsciously performing vital, complex tasks - possibly because those tasks are (or were) too essential to our survival to wait for acknowledgement from the conscious mind.</p>
<p>The best example I can think of off the top of my head is human facial recognition. If you don't have face blindness (which increasingly seems to be a pretty under-diagnosed condition, but I digress) you can pretty much instantly look at someone's face and know:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether or not you are looking at a living, healthy human's face</li>
<li>whether you are familiar with that specific person</li>
<li>if you are familiar with them, who they are</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests that an extensive amount of face-identifying parameters are encoded in the average human mind, and that those parameters do not vary much between healthy individuals (false positives are fairly common, and may rely on the conscious mind to dismiss them, but false negatives - looking at a normal human face and not perceiving it as a face - is almost unheard of if brain injury is not involved).</p>
<p>If a hallucinogenic compound alters neuron behavior in a specific way and reliably reaches one of the brain structures responsible for these &quot;hard-coded&quot; aspects of cognition, it might produce fairly constant mental experiences among different users.</p>
<p>If the visual cortex, at some level, does make a more or less binary determination as to whether your visual field contains [something] - where [something] could be any stimulus we are evolutionarily primed to look for - then it really might be as simple as hallucinogens flipping the &quot;am i looking at a person right now&quot; (or &quot;is there a swarm of insects all over me&quot;, &quot;should i tell the endocrine system to activate the FOF response&quot;, etc) bit from false to true. That's <em>wildly</em> speculative, though, and in my extremely limited experience with neuroscience I have never seen the phrase &quot;it really might be as simple as&quot; be vindicated by research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't be too sure about that.</p>
<p>From the bottom-up perspective, even &quot;generalized hallucinations&quot; can consist of extremely intricate shifting patterns that could nevertheless be generated by cruder patterns of neurotransmitter release, e.g. <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/uncoiling-spiral-maths-and-hallucinations" target="_blank">Klüver's form constants</a>.</p>
<p>It's not much of a stretch to think there's a chemical that could cause butterfly-like patterns, e.g. small flickering/fluttering objects, perhaps accompanied by itching/stinging skin sensations if there's a tactile component to the &quot;eaten alive&quot; part.  People are also quite good at distinguishing agents from objects, and even have specific brain regions for (primarily) recognizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform_face_area" target="_blank">faces</a>, so I find it plausible that certain types of stimulation could evoke impressions of quasi-human or at least intelligent entities.</p>
<p>And from the top-down perspective, if a certain sensory experience is sufficiently &quot;butterflyish&quot; or &quot;elfy&quot; our brains will pattern-match and naturally fill in some of the gaps.  I suspect that's basically what happens in ordinary dreams, which are at least on par with most psychedelic experiences in terms of weirdness.  It also reminds me of how near-death experiences can contain remarkably consistent themes within cultures, but there's more variation <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18344255" target="_blank">across cultures</a> in whether people see a host of angels or travel across the River Styx/Sanzu, etc.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Complex patterns can emerge from relatively simple sources, and our interpretations of novel/ambiguous stimuli are influenced by our prior experiences.  So lace your DMT with TEL and watch the butterflies eat those machine elves!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

LSD or mushrooms, for example, can definitely cause you to see hallucinations beyond fractals and kaleidoscope vision. It's totally dependent on dose, set and setting, and personality. While ayahuasca/DMT or peyote can lead to soul bearing visions of dead relatives, the same can be induced by a vast selection of drugs. If you're to take a small dose of LSD, you're not going to have an ayahuasca journey. Use common sense. </p>

<p>As far as voting goes, most regulations (including how votes are gathered) are determined at the state level in the US so standardization is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Also making sure it's clear to you that there's no concrete evidence any votes were changed - this aspect of most voting machines and systems are fairly secure (but again, not unhackable)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skip the lotto machine example (yes, they're hackable!) and substitute ATMs. Because Diebold, the same company that <del>makes</del>used to make a lot of electronic voting machines also makes a lot of ATMs. </p>
<p>So: why have we had seemingly error- and fraud-proof ATMs since the 1980s while electronic voting is such a mess?</p>
<p>On one hand, banks are sophisticated, well-resourced commercial entities with a profit motive. They have paid a <em>lot</em> of money over the years to ensure that ATMs are, from the user's perspective, largely fool-proof, and they're in a position to insist that ATMs work perfectly each and every time (or close enough to it). And however many banks there are, all of them participate in one of very few interbank networks, most of which rely upon a defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583" target="_blank">ISO standard</a> financial transaction messages, making things a lot easier. Oh, and there are probably millions of financial transactions per day, all of which fit the same pattern: take money from <em>this</em> account and either put it in <em>that</em> account or dispense it as cash. </p>
<p>On the other hand, elections are conducted by literally <em>thousands</em> of individual municipal governments, all of which are constantly hurting for funds, that are not subject to any kind of standardization even on the state level, let alone the national level. The constitutional structure of the United States--both federal and state--makes it almost impossible to change this. And elections happen no more than once or twice per <em>year</em>, but they're all different. Different offices, different candidates, and even different <em>numbers</em> of candidates. And don't get me started on things like referenda. So you've got an arbitrary number of decisions to make, with an arbitrary number of options for each decision, for each and every election <em>on the municipal level</em>. Paying to have ballots printed is bad enough. Paying to have ballots <em>reprogrammed</em> would cost one hell of a lot more. And this for entities that barely do anything nine month out of the year.</p>
<p>That's why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great, an ELI5 I can tackle. I work in infosec and specialize in offensive security (penetration testing, break-ins, doxxing, etc.), so I have experience in how hackable devices tend to be. Since you're likely referring to the voting machine hacking expo at this year's Defcon, I'll talk about that first. The voting machines present during that event were of several varieties and software, which meant that some were easier/harder to hack than others; in fact, the easiest one to hack took only 90 minutes! One thing that many people overlook though is that the first machine was already retired and not in use in actual elections—the machine was running Windows XP as its base operating system, and in the cyber security world, Windows XP is the mother of all Swiss cheese. We like to say that if you hook an XP box to the internet, it's already been taken over, simply due to how many automatic scripts are just crawling around online and looking for XP machines to infect. So that box was cracked after running a pre-built exploit to get into it, and wouldn't be used in an actual election.</p>
<p>Other boxes, however, had exposed I/O units (specifically USB ports), which would very much be an issue. If you wanted to hack these and had the resources (i.e. the software beforehand in order to write a script to hack it), you could plug in a Rubber Ducky (which is essentially a flash drive with a processor that will run whatever script you want and trick the machine into thinking it's a keyboard) and change whatever you want. However, voting machines use proprietary software and utilize the practice known as &quot;security through obscurity.&quot; Nobody has access to voting machine software, ergo nobody can go ahead and configure an exploit to break in with. If you want to do it on the fly, you'll need to bring a Raspberry Pi, a screen, a keyboard, a mouse, and a power source with you to the voting machine and then hope that the machine has USB ports and t<em>then</em> hope that you can hack it within ten or so minutes (yes, you can technically take as long as you want but people will get suspicious and figure out you're not trying to decide the fate of your country). So on that level, they <em>are</em> secure because they removed two things: extended access, and understanding of the inner-workings. It puts you into a time-limited black box, which means that your hands as a hacker are essentially tied. Hackers try to attack the weakest point of any system and voting machines simply aren't that point. It would be way easier to compromise people, or even faking paper ballots rather than trying to break into the boxes.</p>
<p>Now, the question on why the security is better in lottery machines (assuming equal access to both) is for a few reasons. The top reason is that lotto companies have a financial incentive to maximize their security, which will prevent them from losing both money and integrity with consumers. To call them &quot;unhackable&quot; may be a stretch (I wouldn't know—I haven't tried), but it's possible. A lot of hackers/pentesters will tell you that &quot;nothing is unhackable! Everything is vulnerable!&quot; The truth of that is that technically a system <em>can</em> be unhackable, but the point they're trying to get across is that those are so rare and infeasible to create, they might as well not exist (people are the weakest part of any system, then the services the technology is running, then finally the technology itself). Tangent aside, the government, unfortunately, is not quite as motivated by election integrity as companies are by money. Human greed is a huge driving factor and manages to make a lot of the things we have work, since everyone wants to make more money. The government may or may not have our best interests at heart (I don't want to get political here), but the sad truth is that they don't really know how to pass legislation to ensure the machines are secure, and don't really desire to do so. They're not tech-savvy, and don't ask people who are (though if any congressman is reading this, I'm available~). So overall, not much gets done in the way of security. The companies that make the machines are going to get paid whether they secure them well or not, so it doesn't really end up being their concern. And even if both they and the government wanted to, they'd run into one of the biggest issues the government faces, being that it's not exactly the fastest thing alive. Even if they wanted to deploy security patches, there's no telling how long it would take the government to put procedures in place to effectively do any of that on any level.</p>
<p>But fortunately, there's no need to fret, because the voting system <em>is</em> remarkably secure for what it is! I previously mentioned that the machines aren't the weakest point in the system, and fortunately, we've done a lot of non-tech things to make the system as a whole more secure. The boxes aren't connected to the internet, people do a lot to ensure that nobody that isn't trusted has access to the boxes, the boxes are being monitored until the government counts the votes, etc. It's not a perfect system, of course, but the government does do a decent job at gardening the system as a whole, even if the software leaves a bit to be desired.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues is that they end up leaving it open to a Man-In-The-Middle Attack, where a trusted party ends up compromising the integrity of the data. Fortunately, the way that pre and post-voting is set up makes it difficult for any rogue hacker to get into the broader system and start tampering with stuff. However, the way that the code is set up does mean that the machines are very vulnerable to attacks by the manufacturers themselves. They have the source and we have no way to review that, so they could weigh the votes 55% for one party and 45% for another and we would have almost no way of knowing (we could find out, but it would be difficult). So if the companies that manufacture the voting machines have a vested interest in one candidate and are willing to violate some extremely serious laws (treason-level), then yes, they could feasibly tamper with the results and make their individual come out on top. But to do this would require wide-scale integrity-compromise and probably wouldn't swing the election unless you were able to corrupt the other voting machine companies as well (in the case of a national election), or your state happens to be able to swing the result, if the results happen to be close.</p>
<p>Opinion Time: I think that voting machine software being vulnerable to anyone, even to the manufacturers, could be solved if the software were made open source and available to everyone to review. If people can submit but reports and then the developers <em>actually fix them,</em> you can end up with some highly tamper-resistant machines that aren't in danger of being manipulated by the programmers themselves. Do a full-audit of every voting machine after the election to ensure that the software is correct, and you now have a system that is secure through exposure and trials. The downside is that if someone finds something big, they could theoretically hide it and save it for the election, given that nobody else finds it. But just put all I/O ports on the inside (or encrypt the communication channels so only special machines can actually interact with the software at all) and then place a tamper alarm on the physical box and you should be good to go. I don't think that electronic voting is inherently a bad idea, and I also think that it has some tremendous benefits compared to paper voting. But as are many things with the government, a good idea is turned into a poorly-implemented one due to incompetence, greed, or some other factor that corrodes the original intention of the concept that was introduced.</p>
<p>I hope this answered your question sufficiently. Let me know if you have any others and I'll do my best to answer them!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voting systems need to fulfill a lot of criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>each voter gets one vote only</li>
<li>the voter needs to verify that their choice was recorded correctly</li>
<li>no one can find out a particular voter's choice</li>
<li>voters can monitor the counting process if they so choose</li>
</ol>
<p>With paper voting:</p>
<ol>
<li>you get official ballot paper at the polling place, mark it, then hand in the notification card you got in the mail and throw your ballot into the urn. Three people watch while this happens. </li>
<li>you can immediately see where you marked the paper, if you make a mistake, you can get a new paper.</li>
<li>after the ballot has been thrown into the urn, it becomes anonymous. For good measure, the urn is shaken after sealing, and before unsealing.</li>
<li>you can go to the polling station and sit in a long line, where all the ballots pass through, and make your own tally.</li>
</ol>
<p>With machine voting:</p>
<ol>
<li>the official enables the machine after verifying your eligibility. Three people watch while this happens.</li>
<li>the machine shows what you pressed. You have no way of verifying that this is recorded correctly. If you make a mistake, there is no way to correct it.</li>
<li>the order of ballots is recorded, so an observer could count people going in and de-anonymize voters this way.</li>
<li>you can go to the polling station and verify that the recorded data and the final tally match. Due to 2., there is no way that this must correspond with the actual votes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The machines are also very expensive compared to paper ballots, which makes allocation of voting machines to districts a hot topic. There have been several instances of large districts only having a single machine, which led to hour-long queues, putting anyone who was unable to take an entire day off at a severe disadvantage (in addition to several polling places closing before everyone voted).</p>
<p>In short: you cannot have a constitutionally sound election with voting machines, and with enough volunteers it is entirely possible to run an election without them. Don't fix what ain't broken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The escape of the refrigerants used in air conditioning which are strong green house gases themselves is another impact.</p>
<p>Something I find interesting is due to cheap power and other priorities we have stopped designing our buildings to take advantage of local environment. For example Ancient Rome had the Justinian Code forbidding anyone from building tall enough to block their neighbors sunlight - something that we are having legal proceedings in the US today in regard to neighboring buildings and solar power production.</p>
<p>Another cool ancient concept that i cant remember the name of is free air conditioning by using a chimney to draw air up from underground.

Until the advent of air conditioning the hotter parts of the earth were more sparsely populated. Now they're more full. The US South is an example of this. The population has grown considerably since AC because there's plenty of land there and plenty of space to move into.

<p>If the malware is intended to target specific hardware setups you can always just infect a test machine too, then wipe it clean since it wasn't storing anything important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A virus on a computer isn't the same as a virus in your body.</p>
<p>Just having code for a virus doesn't make your computer radioactive and unusable. As long as you don't execute the virus on your own PC, you won't have any problems.</p>
<p>Additionally, to test it, you can just test it on a separate machine, or a virtual environment within a system that prevents it from getting outside of that. All depends on the type of &quot;virus.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really an answer to the original question, as others have more than covered that talking about virtual machines and sandboxed. Just an interesting sidenote - often malware isn't developed in a vacuum. A recurring theme when investigating new malware is that you can often find multiple versions of it uploaded to sites like VirusTotal.com (which is used to run multiple anti-virus products against a sample). Ive seen talks where the researchers have identified when a virus was first created by finding it in this site's archives - often multiple iterations, which can be very useful in analysis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
