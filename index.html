		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the responses here are complete bs.  While RFID chips exist, they are extremely rare as the chips and the equipment to use them is expensive and unnecessary. First off, making passable fakes is difficult and takes some equipment that most people can't get, you can't just go to Wal-Mart and pick up some poker set and paint the chips.  Each value of chip is uniquely designed in terms of size, weight, color, and edge pattern.  Higher value chips are usually microprinted, have uv markings on them or holograms (Most common). Chips usually get larger in size the higher the value so you can't paint a smaller value chip to match a larger value one.</p>
<p>Lastly, most casinos use strict inventory control. When a player leaves a table with more than a predetermined amount of money, several people get a call.  If someone goes to cash out and it can't be determined where the chips came from, they don't make the change.  Leaving and going to another casino doesn't help as they will contact each other to get the information they need. </p>
<p>Lastly, casino surveillance serves as a huge deterrent to trying to steal.  It's the same reason casinos  don't get a large amount of fake bills either.  If they get a fake, it's easy to track down where it was picked up and pull a pic of the passer off the camera. Thieves aren't stupid, they aren't going to take the risk of getting caught for a single payoff. You wouldn't go rob a store without a mask in broad daylight in front of a crowd, neither would a counterfeiter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Counterfeit chips do happen, but there are some security measures in place to help prevent it. Microchips imbedded in the chips themselves, microprinted serial numbers, very precise branding and logos, and even the material composition is secret. The people who make these chips are the same companies that make checks and credit cards. All the high value chips have RFID sensors inside of them, too.</p>
<p>And even if you could make a chip that was indistinguishable from one casino's chip, trying to turn them in would be very difficult. You'd have to smuggle them into the casino and cash them out at the cashier, but any large number of chips being cashed causes security to look through the security footage to determine if you got them legally. The RFID sensor tracks which table or game they came from, so it's very easy to check the cameras.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If a chip is slightly lighter or heavier, thicker or thinner - the muscle memory for determining these chips is thrown out and you will cut them down to find the fake. </p>
<p>I was always at fairly low value tables ($5, $25 hands) so the repercussions for the fake chips was usually security coming and removing them - no idea what happened, but I imagine searched, all chips taken, and kicked out </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, this will likely get buried, but I'll give an explanation.</p>
<p>After you ingest (swallow) water, it goes to your stomach. There, it is slowly released to your small intestine to be absorbed and pass to your bloodstream.
It takes water between 10 and 40 minutes to pass to your small intestine and be absorbed. The speed of this depends on how much water, the temperature (cold water will be released slower), if there is something else in the stomach, etc.
But, in general, it doesn't matter whether you chug a bottle of water down in 10 seconds or slowly sip it in 10 minutes. It will all end up in your bloodstream in about the same time.</p>
<p>The only thing that can make a difference is whether you vomit the water that you are ingesting. You stomach vomits its contents in response to a series of things (whether it senses that something you ate may be rotten or dangerous, whether there is a bad smell, etc), and one of those things that the stomach takes into account is how full it is. So ingesting water in small sips can help avoid vomiting, and that is what's recommended when for example children have gastroenteritis. But if you don't vomit the water that you swallow, it doesn't matter whether you swallowed it in 10 seconds or 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, thanks for all the upvotes. Turns out it didn't get buried after all! This is 1/4 of my total karma right there! Glad you liked it!</p>
<p>Edit2: it's actually not clear whether cold water will be released (and thus absorbed) slower. As someone pointed out below, studies on this seem to be contradictory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So the rate is controlled mostly to the same degree in either situation. Once absorbed, the body will regulate fluid excretion in the kidneys so that you don't over hydrate (and dilute all your electrolytes and other things).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, yes. </p>
<p>Long answer, plasma osmolality and volume of ECF are the characteristics your body uses when it is regulating diuresis. If you sip two liters of water over two hours your body will lower production of vasopressin/ADH to allow excess water to clear as required. </p>
<p>If you chug that same quantity in one minute your body will shut down production of antidiuretic hormones all together as plasma concentration drops through the floor. You will then overshoot ideal osmolality and become slightly dehydrated, because your kidneys can make very dilute urine astoundingly fast.</p>
<p>It's the same concept as eating a lot of sugar, your body can create the hormones to bring you back to &quot;normal&quot; but resources are wasted in the process and extremes are not fully accounted for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Propellers cause leakage of air or water into the craft. If the propeller was at the front of a boat, more water would be pushed into the hull, whereas with rear facing propellers water flows past. Additionally, propellers in the front could hit other crafts, docks, or land if the boat runs aground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The TL;DR for airplanes is that generally an aircraft with a propeller and engine in the front will be a more stable and safe aircraft. (with the added bonus of being able to push air into an engine intake for better performance.) There are however, exceptions, with the Dornier 335 being a combination push/pull system, and the P-39 / P-63, who's engine was located behind the pilot to make room for a 37mm automatic cannon. The XP-55 ascender (featured in war thunder) was a straight pusher aircraft, though IIRC it killed both test pilots on the two occasions that it flew. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What people are missing is the ergonomics of the item. (I'm using that word loosely for the sake of discussion.)</p>
<p>If you try to lift a 200lb log into the back of a station wagon Vs. a 200lb dead body, the body will be much harder. As a matter of fact, almost everything is easier to lift than a dead body.</p>
<p>This is due to the rigidity of the object. A log, chair, door, table... these things are not fighting you by changing shape and balance/leverage points on the fly. Once you find the leverage points on a couch, it doesn't change.</p>
<p>A dead body, on the other hand, is a cornucopia of balance points and weight that redistributes itself randomly at the most inopportune moments. Even with two people, moving it can be a chore.</p>
<p>This is why you want to, preferably, wrap them in a thick wrap of shipping plastic, or visqueen and duct tape, or roll them in a thick rug.</p>
<p>The main point is to keep the limbs tightly together: The arms straight along either side of the torso, and the legs tightly together at the ankles and just above the knees.</p>
<p>This can be done with just duct tape, or a whole lot of zip-ties, but wrapping is really your best bet.</p>
<p>Hope this helps with your son.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we pick up an object we naturally articulate and engage the muscles we believe are necessary to shift the weight in the desired manner. Sometimes when objects are a different weight than we anticipate we either fling the object or even strain ourselves.</p>
<p>A rigid body has an unmoving centre of gravity, this makes it easy for us to keep an optimal selection of muscles engaged while moving it.
An object whose contents are mobile (such as a grain-filled sack or a water-balloon) can constantly redistribute its mass as a side effect of handling. These shifting masses moves the centre of gravity in ways that may be suboptimal for the muscles engaged, and thus require more strength, or simply roll out of our grip.</p>
<p>For kidnappers: The solution is to use sacks or other containment objects which keep the centre of gravity in a relatively fixed position. Handles are also useful as they allow our body to exclude weaker muscle groups.</p>
<p>For kidnap victims: The solution if you are being picked up is to not make yourself rigid - that makes you easier to carry, and don't just go floppy either (since they could adjust to that) - instead flail between the two, which will rapidly alter your centre of gravity and make you very hard to grip onto.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, funnily enough I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyfOduzia4A" target="_blank">answered this question for another person with a video a while back</a> </p>
<p>If you dont want to watch the video I'll run over the points here too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are more in touch with reality as we grow older. The economy, and our limited time on this planet distract us. We need to make sure we can provide for our family and friends, we study and work to make sure we can live a comfortable life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social norms also take away from us, we understand we have a role in the world and as adults we believe we shouldn't be seen being &quot;childish&quot; and having a very active imagination can be seen as this. I personally dont agree with how people see this as childish at all, I think it's a great character to have. It's different depending on culture though, as we are brought up in a certain way to see adults as responsible, serious hard working individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We care about what other people think, children do not. There have been studies to show that they dont care, they dont see the world the same as us. Kids are a bundle of joy (most of the time!), as we grow older we are much more worried about how people see us. This may be down to the fact that we are hardwired to find a partner and have children. If we dont act in an attractive way, then we may not find a mate. It's pretty blunt to say, but at the end of the day we are animals and our top priorities are survival and breeding.</p>
</li>
<li>We are much more busy as adults, as I stated before we are constantly working and our lives get swallowed by work. The majority of people don't live in the now. They live constantly thinking of the future, not paying attention to the here and now. Children are different, they live for the now. They try and enjoy themselves as much as possible. Playing and imagining cool scenarios are examples of this. For example, if a child was sat in a car they'd look out the window and see a blank canvas. They'd imagine a character running along side the car doing all sorts of cool stunts (that's what I used to do). However, an adult may not think like this, they'd think about people, work, debt, schedules etc etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helped, and I hope you enjoyed the joke at the end of the video. I usually answer peoples questions through this subreddit in the form of a video and I've been doing it for a year now. My drawing has got slightly better, along with my animation skills. This video is pretty old, but it targeted your question so I thought I'd try and help you out!</p>
<p>Have a great day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you asked a child &quot;why does the dragon let you ride it&quot; the child might say &quot;We are friends&quot; but you would ask yourself &quot;well why are we friends, how could we possibly have met and developed a friendship.&quot;  If you want to go around riding on a dragon doing crazy adventures you basically have to come up with the entire Game of Thrones world in order to satisfy the questions you would have.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a ton of misinformation on this post. Sorry for that but really we don't know what causes them or why they go away. The current theory is that the motor neuron that controls the muscular contraction is malfunctioning and secreting too much acetylcholine, which is the chemical that allows a muscle to contract. So the muscle is just in a steadily contracted form. A mild contracture. </p>
<p>Manual therapies are meant to &quot;reset&quot; this malfunction by sort of tricking the neurons into relaxing. </p>
<p>The neuron is accidentally sending a signal to your brain that says that this is the most relaxed state for this muscle. What we do is gently force that muscle into a relaxed position. </p>
<p>Edit: i do hope more people see this. Some of the top comments on here say that there's no scientific evidence that massage does anything. Well yeah uh.  There's no scientific evidence of anything if you don't look it up. Massage is proven to stimulate RNA synthesis  to the massaged region. It helps rebuild your tissue in the aid of recovery. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's little scientific evidence to support massage as a recovery technique in terms of waste product removal. </p>
<p>The circulation increase from massage is achieved tenfold simply by using the muscles you want circulation to improve in.</p>
<p>I.e. Athletes conduct 'warm downs' that are specific to the musculature they just used. A football player will often be told to immediately jump onto a stationary bike once off the field from a game to keep circulation going to his legs after the final minutes of sprinting in a match. Simply walking around will increase your circulation.</p>
<p>As for your muscles feeling better after a massage? They were tight, they got stretched, now they're less tight. Just use a daily flexibility program to reduce your muscle stiffness and increase your joint ROM (range of motion). You can do active stretching (you stretch your muscle as much as you can) and you can do passive stretching (someone else stretches your muscle to varying degrees). Google search PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) stretching techniques if you want to learn more or try it yourself. </p>
<p>We're taught that if there's no harm and something can cause psychological benefit (placebo effect) in an athlete, then you may as well do it. (4th year Exercise Science + Rehab &amp; Exercise Physiology student).</p>
<p>This is an unpopular opinion because it could be detrimental toward the massage industry but there's no concrete evidence or meta analysis that currently support massage's supposed effect of enhancing recovery and maintaining performance. (These are two very important recovery goals.)</p>
<p>Please do keep in mind that when performed after a soft tissue injury a massage is definitely not recommended. You'll throw up afterward as you're messing with the healing process. (Specifically a soft tissue injury with an inflammatory response.)</p>
<p>Please don't take this reply as an insult to massage techniques or the people who perform them. They're very skilled (sometimes) and very passionate about their job (always IMO). Those are two great things to have in someone you purchase a service from.
They provide an awesome service that I'm sure will be around for a long time. However as soon as someone tries to push their supposed scientific evidence behind massage physiological benefits onto me, it annoys me. There are no marked physiological benefits that have been concretely proven from massage. It's purely a psychological thing. (A damn good psychological thing, don't underestimate the mind.)(Psychological benefits were anecdotally recorded in most studies.)</p>
<p>The gilded top comment reply is essentially correct up until:</p>
<p>&quot;when you find a knot (trigger point, sore spot or whatever you wanna call it) when you press on it you are pushing that calcium myosin mixture out of the area back into the venous system&quot;</p>
<p>There's no proper evidence when you combine both the disproving and proving papers to suggest that you're pushing anything into the venous system. This claim simply doesn't exist. </p>
<p>If you'd like an example of a successful recovery technique that does manage to reduce oedema and enhance venous return then check out 'cold water immersion'. It has nothing to do with calcium reuptake or myosin filaments. It does however utilise the hydrostatic pressure applied to your body when immersed in water as well as your body's natural response to cold water immersion. These seem like big words but they aren't complicated at all. When you hop in a pool at the shallow end and walk to the deep end (slowly increasing water immersion from your waist to your neck), you can feel the pressure building over your body. That's the hydrostatic pressure. The cold water component is typically conducted in 10-12 degree Celsius water (freezing cold and horrible) and your body reacts to this by shunting blood away from the peripheries (vessels near skin) and toward the core (closer to the heart). This stops us from losing heat so easily when we need to conserve it. (Our body has an optimal temperature of roughly 37 degrees Celsius in which our metabolic life maintaining cellular activities perform best.) When we heat up we do the opposite, we dilate the blood vessels near the skin which lets us lose heat faster so that our core temperature doesn't go too far above 37 degrees. (These are homeostatic mechanisms.) I'll leave a link to the AIS website. The Australian Institute of Sport is an international leader on recovery technique research in elite athletes. (I'm Australian, I'm not affiliated or an employee of AIS). There's alot note to this topic but I'm on my mobile so I can't write a lecture's worth of important extra details. </p>
<p>Please also keep in mind that CWI isn't for every athlete or person. It's actually detrimental to a small degree for weight lifters. Essentially you want to build and progress your muscles via protein synthesis (increased window post workout for PS),  you don't want to reduce blood flow to the muscles which is what CWI does. If you're training for physical adaptions (muscle bulk+) it's probably not for you. If you bulked pre season and are just practicing football drills and maintaining muscle then CWI can help because that higher protein synthesis window is not as relevant to you.(Ignore this paragraph if it's not relevant to you, it may seem confusing!) </p>
<p>Link from my mobile: (It goes straight to a PDF download, just Google search 'Cold water immersion AIS' if you don't like links or it doesn't work.)</p>

<p>I've never heard of a calcium myosin mixture and have found nothing peer reviewed to support this idea. As far as I know myosin myofilaments are just a component of the cross bridges that allow us to move. Just Google 'Sliding Filament Theory' to understand it better. It's actually super interesting to understand but it's too much to explain in a Reddit reply.</p>
<p>So it's true that we use calcium to unlock Troponin from it's position atop Tropomyosin which effectively blocks myosin filament crossbridges from attaching to actin filaments when we don't want them to (muscle relaxation). In short, calcium is the key, troponin is the lock, tropomyosin is the gate and actin was the thing behind the locked gate that myosin wants to attach to.
There's no concrete evidence to suggest that massage as a recovery technique removes 'excess calcium' that the sarcoplasmic reticulum didn't reuptake. (Reuptake occuring as a result of our CNS signalling the muscle to relax). </p>
<p>I'm happy to keep answering replies but please keep it civil. I'm not here to rain on anyone's parade. I get massages whenever I can afford them because I enjoy them too. I've performed localised massages on athletes as a sports trainer while I've worked in Aussie rules football clubs in my area and if the player is happy then that's often all that matters.</p>
<p>TLDR: Zero meta analysis or concrete research to prove anything other than a psychological benefit from massage.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the potential for physical benefit is possible but it isn't proven across studies (varies widely) and is often the result of a psychological benefit.</p>
<p>Edit 1: Thank you for the gold.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Typos fixed and a paragraph added.</p>

<p>If you had a burn on your hand all sorts of plasma and proteins and immune related cells would be rushing to the site (some already there) causing both local inflammation and an immune response that ultimately results in a blister - the blister is full of immune cells that help to repair the damaged tissues by providing an ideal micro environment for healing. Now let's say there's a burn to a large portion of your body; depending on the degree and the inflammation response (3rd degree burns have a different response as many of the biological channels of cell repair are completely destroyed) while your body will send out all its required immune cells that it has it might simply not be enough - in this case bacterial infections can take hold in the blisters as they provide an ideal environment for certain infections to grow, this results in sepsis and eventually septic shock. Imagine that the bodies immune repair system is spread too thin to repair both burns - it doesn't have a very good system at establishing where it should send immune cells with regard to controlling sepsis beyond directing blood away from the extremities and towards critical organs as septic shock progresses. </p>
<p>Ultimately it depends on the nature of the two injuries but yes they could affect one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In polytrauma injuries involving a traumatic brain injury and bone fracture, the fracture may actually heal at a faster rate than the same fracture alone. The mechanism is currently not well understood, but some researchers speculate it's related to enhanced macrophage mobilization.</p>

<p>Two injuries in the same area, however, if the second occurs before the first one is fully healed, or sometimes even after its healed, can predispose to longer healing times and ultimately decreased function and possibly chronic pain. There's evidence that prolonged pain and inflammation can cause neurological changes in nerves that can lead to chronic pain.

<p>At higher temperatures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelization" target="_blank">caramelization</a> takes over. Basically  the sugars break down and release a range of chemicals and especially butanedione which gives that 'caramel'/'butter' smell common with popcorn.</p>
<p>The 'burnt' part comes from [pyrolysis] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis</a>) which is a form of thermal decomposition with little to no oxygen on organic molecules, carbohydrates and proteins in this case.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Popcorn and bread are in fact made from very similar things: corn and wheat. Both are grains and both consist mainly of starch, which is a polysaccharide (lots of sugar stuck together.) Bread has been fermented a bit so it tastes different, and of course wheat and corn taste a bit different to begin with, but the basic components are the same. Flavour chemicals tend to be light molecules because they have to be either volatile so you can smell them or water soluble so you can taste them on the tongue. This means that when you heat food you can drive off a lot of those flavours leaving you with food that tastes similar to other food that tastes too hot.</p>
<p>The other thing is that when you burn food, you're chemically changing the food. That means it will taste different, because taste is just detecting certain chemicals. More than that, all chemicals in food are pretty similar in some ways - they tend to be organic molecules consisting primarily of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, with quite a bit of nitrogen and a few other bits and pieces. If you apply enough energy to molecules, they tend to break apart and recombine, but how they recombine doesn't necessarily always correspond exactly to what they were before. If you completely burn fatty acids or burn starch, you get still get carbon dioxide and water. When you burn food you don't burn it completely, but something similar is going on: different chemicals break down and you end up with something that will resemble more closely the product of burning something quite different. Hence they taste similar.</p>
<p>So when you burn bread, or popcorn or even something a less similar, you're going to end up basically with something resembling a kind of charcoal: a mixture of different carbon compounds that doesn't have the unique flavour molecules that the food started with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;browning&quot; of foods (like when you sear a steak and get that nice crust) is due to the Maillard reaction, which is a chemical reaction at high temperatures between amino acids (protein) and sugars (carbohydrates) that produce a wide variety of byproducts that are pleasing to our palates. </p>
<p>In contrast, when you continue to heat food beyond the Maillard reaction, you get pyrolytic reactions. At first this involves the caramelization of sugars, which also produces pleasing flavors. But eventually the sugars break down even further into compounds that we find bitter and unpleasant.</p>
<p>All of these byproducts from these reactions may be different depending on the food that is being heated, but they all share a similar flavor profile. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there're three types of nerve fibres that're important to the pain perception process (called nociception):</p>
<p>A-delta fibres are responsible for transmitting sharp intense pain quickly to the brain. </p>
<p>C fibres are responsible for the dull, slow ache that comes after an injury. Dysfunction of these fibres has been linked to various pain conditions. </p>
<p>A-beta fibres sense light touch and vibration. It's these fibres that are responsible for the effect you're describing. In the spinal cord, all of the various pain fibres synapse before being sent to the brain. But there are also inhibitory interneurons between fibres. The beta fibres activate the inhibitory interneurons and prevent pain signals (on C fibres in particular) from being sent to the brain. This means that although receptors in the injured area are still firing, less of that information is reaching your brain, and thus the pain is perceived to be less. </p>
<p>So when you grab or rub a sore spot, you activate these beta fibres (responsible for light touch and vibration sensation) which in turn activate those inhibitory interneurons and thus your perception of pain is lessened. </p>
<p>There are cool machines called TENS machines which exploit this system to reduce pain - they activate those beta fibres. </p>
<p>Source: Medical student (UK) about to enter 3rd year, did an elective module on the management of pain. </p>

This is how some pain pills work, they block the receptors. So when you're in pain, if you provide an alternate stimulation at the same spot, such as rubbing the skin around the area, or applying pressure and engaging the surrounding tissue with that sensation, then you've created a competing signal. Since you can only process so many signals from an area at one time, you've basically stopped some of the pain signal from being received. Unfortunately I don't remember all the terminology, as I learned this in Psych of health a few years ago, but that's the general idea.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a choice made in the design of a building...</p>
<p>Originally it had to do with longevity and reliability of the materials - if you look at steel, the rust that forms when it is left exposed is detrimental - as it rusts the material degrades and gets thinner and weaker until it fails. So steel needs maintenance and protection to last long term (such as bridges being painted, or having steel encased in something like concrete to protect it). The green of bronze however is actually helpful - initially it is nice and shiny, then degrades to the green colour we commonly see, at which point that green layer has created a barrier around the metal, so it doesn't degrade any further. So once it reaches that point it needs relatively little maintenance and upkeep - great for a feature dome at the top of a roof you don't really want to have to access regularly.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that most of these structures are traditional ones, built when technology and materials were far more limited, so the green roof was a small price to pay to be able to actually build the structure that may not have been possible with other materials.</p>
<p>Nowadays it mainly comes down to architectural reasons - it will be used to give a certain look and design to a structure that the architect desires.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
