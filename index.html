		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SometHing I can actually answer! I am on the train at the moment so references will be sparse, but most of the information will come from funder's 2001 paper.</p>
<p>Okay so there are many different ideas, approaches and factors to take into account so I will try and outline some of the main approaches and what they believe.</p>
<p>There is the behaviourist approach that believes our personality emerges from our experience and interactions with our environment.this occurs through mechanisms such as classical conditioning, which is where we learn to associate co-occuring stimuli. This can be seen with pavlovs dog experiment and watsons (1925) little albert experiment. Another mechanism is operant condition proposed by B F Skinner, this claims basically we will perform tasks we are rewarded for more often, and ones we are punished for less.</p>
<p>Another approach is the biological approach that claims that our personality is determined by chemicals, hormones and neurotransmitters in the brain. Examples of this is seratonin, which amongst other things, has been linked to happiness, and has been effectively harnessed to create effective anti-depressant medications</p>
<p>There is also the evolutionary approach that posits that we inherit our personality through genes and natural selection. Some evidence does exist for this such as Loehlin and Nicholas (1976) which displayed behavioural concordance between twins.</p>
<p>There is also the socio-cognitive approach which believes that personality comes from thought processing styles and social experience. Evidence from this can be seen in Banduras (1977) bobo doll experiment where he taught aggressive behaviour to children through them observing aggressive behaviour. Other theories in this area also include Baldwins (1999) relational schemas that claim that our behaviour is determined by our relation to those around us</p>
<p>Another, but contentious approach is Psychodynamics, which is widely known as Freud's area of psychology. This approach believes that personality is formed from developmental stages in early life, and the conflict between the ID (desires), ego (implementing reality onto desires) and superego (conscience)</p>
<p>The humanist approach also has views on personality, but provides little in the way of testable theories. This approach claims that people can only be understood through their unique experience of reality, and has therefore brought into question the validity of many cross-cultural approaches to testing personality. Studies such as hofstede (1976, 2011) have attempted to examine the effects of culture in personality, and have found significant effects, but an important thing to note is that whilst means differ, all types of personality can be found everywhere.</p>
<p>When we talk about measures of personality we often measure it with the big five measure (goldberg et al., 1980: Digman, 1989). This measure includes openness to  new experience, conscientious, agreeableness, neuroticism, and extraversion.</p>
<p>There is more to say but I cannot be too extensive currently, hope this helps. If people want more info just say and I can fill in more detail later</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://match.ctglab.nl/#/specific/plot1" target="_blank">The MaTcH study</a> is a meta-analysis of twin studies (Nature Genetics, 2015). The link is to their interactive webpage which is quite nice at allowing you to explore the 'nature vs nurture' proportion for various factors. Unsurprisingly, things like disease markers are very largely inherited. </p>
<p>The study seems to suggest a roughly 50-50 split between genetic factors and environmental factors under the subchapter measure of 'Temperament and Personality Functions'.</p>
<p>From my reading of personality psych papers over the last few years, it seems we have some reasonably consistent personality traits (like Extraversion and Neuroticism) that are likely related to inherited biological factors. However, early environment obviously plays a large role in how these biological markers are expressed in later life. For example, one could be born with a tendency to respond more strongly to negative stimuli, but those with this trait and an undesirable childhood may be much more likely to develop anxiety and depression issues overall.</p>
<p>(did a PhD partly involving personality, and have spoken to a few professors about this very subject)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the comments here are relatively correct in pointing out that we don't really know how personality is formed, but I think they are somewhat misleading in arguing that there are many valid schools of thought. Putting psychoanalytic theories of personality development (e.g., Freud), which have no evidence (and aren't even empirically testable in their stronger forms), on equal footing with for example what we know from behavioral genetics studies <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691615617439" target="_blank">(which have provided some of the most replicable findings in the social sciences)</a> is highly misleading.</p>
<p>While we don't really know how personality is formed, here are some things we do know. </p>
<p>First, pretty much any form of personality variation we can measure reliably shows relatively high heritability (<a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v47/n7/full/ng.3285.html" target="_blank">a good rule of thumb is that most traits are around 50% heritable</a>, but of course this can vary across different traits). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ftcdu/how_is_personality_formed/dil379b/?st=j3ncy55x&amp;sh=a29fbe99" target="_blank">The MaTCH tool that u/meanspirit linked to</a> provides a decent interactive summary of what we know. What this means is that around 50% of the <em>variance</em> between people can be explained by genetic differences. This can be complex to interpret, because it is based on accounting for proportions of <em>variation</em>, such as how some people are taller or shorter than others. Importantly, this wouldn't necessarily explain human height, because no adult human is 2 millimeters tall and no adult is 50 feet tall, and so there is no variation at those ranges to be explained. </p>
<p>The next thing to know is that there probably are not &quot;genes for&quot; specific personality traits, at least not how most people think about that phrase. Instead, as Chabris, Lee, and others posit as the Fourth Law of Behavioral Genetics: &quot;A typical human behavioral trait is associated with very many genetic variants, each of which accounts for a very small percentage of the behavioral variability” <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721415580430" target="_blank">source</a>. That is to say, the variation between individuals seems most likely to be due to many genes that each make a small contribution. And, importantly, we don't really know what these genes do, and so this is all totally consistent with explanations at other levels of physiology (e.g., neurotransmitters &amp; hormones influence personality).</p>
<p>This also means that around 50% of the <em>variance</em> in personality between people is explained by environmental factors. However, we don't know a whole lot about what these environmental factors are. Behavioral genetics approaches use mathematical tools and facts about genetic inheritance (e.g., you share 50% of the difference in your genes with your mother) to partition out variation (i.e., differences between people) into 3 different bins: (1) genetic contributions (the heritability I went into above), (2) shared environment, and (3) non-shared environment. Shared environment would include all the things two siblings might share for example, such as going to the same school, having the same parents, etc. Non-shared environment is a fancy word for &quot;this is all the variance we couldn't explain with genetics or shared environment&quot;, and we don't really have a clear sense of what it is. I suspect a lot of this is fairly random, like whether you got sick one year, had a chance meeting with someone who became your friend, etc. but this is just speculation.</p>
<p>Importantly, shared environment seems to account for very little variation in personality, a point that Judith Rich Harris drove home in her book The Nurture Assumption (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/harris-nurture.html" target="_blank">summary here</a>). This means that parents don't matter for personality development very much. Harris argues that much of the environmental explanation for personality development comes from peers, but there is not a ton of evidence for this claim (although I suspect she is probably right because there are good theoretical reasons to think this would be the case, namely that children need to learn how to interact in the world of their peers if they are going to grow up to be successful adults).</p>
<p>So, while we don't know how personality forms exactly, we can say it's eventual form is probably about 50% due to genetic differences, and 50% environment, but that the environmental component is probably due to peers and random life events, and is not strongly influenced by parenting as most people assume (this of course assumes &quot;a normal range&quot; of parenting--of course this wouldn't hold for extreme abuse or other abnormalities, which are known to have a major impact on personality). This is not the most satisfying answer I know, but it is the most scientifically defensible.</p>
<p>So, what produces one variant of personality rather than another then? We can speculate based on some good theories that are starting to accumulate evidence. One explanation I find convincing is that many personality differences come from what evolutionary psychologists refer to as <a href="http://evopsychproj.blogspot.com/2011/05/obligate-vs-facultative-adaptations.html" target="_blank">&quot;facultative adaptations&quot;</a>. You can think of these as sort of like if-then rules for development, such as &quot;if you grow up in a dangerous environment, you should be less extraverted and more neurotic&quot;. These rules can be calibrated to both other genes, and the environment. Think of it this way: a single gene that might influence personality doesn't &quot;know&quot; what kind of body or environment it will land in, as it will inhabit many different bodies and environments over evolutionary time. So, one way to deal with this would be for that gene to produce facultative variation to best fit the organism and environment it happens to land in. Aaron Lukaszewski and James Roney have done some work that suggests this might be the case, as <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwt3QP5AfEGwZy15ejhBSFk4Vlk/view" target="_blank">they found that more formidable and attractive people tend to be more extraverted</a>, presumably because they have more to gain and less to lose from social interactions. Similarly there is a fair amount of work around how we <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287548375_Evolution_Life_History_Theory_and_Personality" target="_blank">calibrate our bodies and minds to the environment</a> according to what evolutionary biologists refer to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_history_theory" target="_blank">life history theory</a>. Basically, we evolved to maximize our cumulative reproductive output, and this may require different strategies in different kinds of environments, such as reproducing rapidly in a dangerous environment vs. having fewer offspring but investing more in each in a safe environment.</p>
<p>This is what we know from the science. All other theories (e.g., behaviorism, psychoanalytic theories, etc.) are pure speculation, and there isn't any good evidence for them that I know of (at least not if the theories are specific enough to actually make strong testable, falsifiable predictions). Suffice to say we don't actually know that much yet, but we're learning more. And I'll just close by noting that the kind of systematic variation we see in personality variation poses a particular evolutionary puzzle or paradox. I'll put <a href="http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/jpersonality.pdf" target="_blank">this one source here on that</a>, and leave it as homework for the interested reader.</p>
<p>Tl;dr It's r/askscience, read the damn thing. </p>
<p>Edit: I wanted to add something about IQ here as well originally, but thought the response was already long enough without it. Then I remembered I actually addressed this in another post before, which can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/55hd28/how_does_intelligence_change_with_age/d8awuqu/?st=j3nif3gn&amp;sh=726d1b59" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurture_Assumption</a></p>
<p>She suggests that the much of the (non-genetic) influence on personality for children comes from their peer group, not from the adults in their lives.  That children look towards their peer group to decide what is normal behaviour.  The relationship with adults in their lives (parents especially) is so asymmetric in terms of power, that the adult's behaviour doesn't act as a template for how the kids themselves should act.</p>

This can be somewhat attributed to genetics as men where expected to hunt while women would go pick berries. As these differences became expected in society they would get reinforced by expecting, for example women to sew and men to lift heavy things. In addition when a female is bad at handwriting society will harp on them to make it better because they expect it to be better, whereas if a male has bad handwriting they'll say &quot;well boys are just bad at it&quot;. The reverse is true for sports in many cases.</p>

If I started a book report and it wasn't perfect, I'd rewrite the whole thing again. </p>
<p>Edit: Upon further thought, I think social expectations coupled with fine motor skills played a part. I do remember my brother always got outside toys and I seemed to like activities where I could make bracelets, write and color. However, the desire to please my parents and teachers really played a big part. Would like to take the time to also mention my superb typing skills.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You feel like you're going extremely fast on a bike because you <em>feel</em> more.</p>
<p>Cars have very well developed suspension systems that &quot;even out&quot; the bumps on the road. As long as you're not dealing with a serious pothole or a speed-bump, the car's suspension is going to face-tank most of the shock so that you don't have to. Larger tires can also take some of the shock out of the road, but it's not as effective. Bikes generally <em>don't</em> have awesome suspension, and tires of <em>comparable</em> size. That means that you feel every bump in the road, or close enough to every bump in the road as not to matter.</p>
<p>Beyond that, cars are enclosed capsules. Your body's perception of &quot;speed&quot; relies on three things: what you see with your eyes, what your inner-ear feels, and what your skin feels. When you're on a bike, you can feel the wind running over your body. That allows you to &quot;feel&quot; your speed when you aren't accelerating or slowing down. Your eyes give you a sense of speed, but the brain is pretty good at filtering out unwanted implications from the eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side Note</p>
<p>The Inner Ear mostly just registers acceleration, for the purposes of this conversation. It picks up when you speed up, or when you slow down. It's also a part of your sense of balance, but that's not too crucial to note in this situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's basically a combination of being able to feel the wind, and the poor shock-absorption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>In the car some of your senses are not feeling the speed as they should. (Wind on the skin, wind sound, bumps and surface abnormalities (better shock absorbers on a car), and turning acceleration (also in a car the absorbers minimize the acceleration you feel))</li>
<li>An effect called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank">Parallax</a>. On 2 wheels you focus more on the road just ahead of you, while on the car you look on the car that is in front of you, other obstacles in order to break in time. This effect also explains why we don't feel the speed (500 to 600 MPH) on passenger jets while being on car with speed will be terrifying. </li>

<p>As you travel, objects near you appear to be traveling at a much higher rate of speed than objects further away. On a bike, you can view the apparent speed of objects very close to you, especially the ground. They seem to be whipping by. In a car, the doors and floor and body prevent you from seeing the ground below or immediately in front of you. Your vision is restricted to things that are higher up and further away, like trees and buildings and traffic lights, which appear to be moving much more slowly. </p>
<p>Edit: obligatory RIP inbox. </p>
<p>And to the doubters--sure, wind and danger play a role. But why do you think <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XoCVXIpiH5w" target="_blank">this scene</a> was set in a forest?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amateur cyclist here. I'm sure part of the &quot;seem,&quot; has to do with the stopping distance/time. Your body and brain have a fear instinct that will kick in at speeds that would harm you. You can stop pretty much instantly up to 10mph. Above that you have to slow down a little bit more gradually.  </p>
<p>You get desensitized to it in cars because you spend so much time in them. If you brought people from two centuries ago into our timeline and put them in a 75mph car, they would be <em>terrified.</em>  </p>
<p>When I'm at my top speed cycling, I definitely have to be paying close attention to the roadway. Even a seemingly small bump can really hurt and potentially throw you off course. You also have to use your back brake first and then your front on so you don't throw yourself over the handlebars. Remember - there are no seat belts on a bike!  </p>
<p>Edit: Like I said, amateur. Apparently people think I'm supposed to use the front brake first and with more pressure. I'll try it. But that is not OPs question, and I stand by the stopping distance and perception statements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ha, something I can answer, my thesis for my bachelor of political science is completely on Dutch private military companies. In the current scientific terminology mercenaries are actually defined as contractors, calling them mercenaries was considered pretty old fashioned by the private military company directors I interviewed. </p>
<p>Contractors are defined as military personnel that do not work directly for a government but for a company. A lot of states, especially the US, have started to use these companies a lot over the last decades. In 2007 for example 54% of US defense personnel in Afghanistan were contractors and not US state troops. Contractors are deployed in a myriad of ways, they fight shoulder to shoulder with American soldiers in the front line but also protect vips or convoys, protect the outer rings of camps or support armies in logistical ways by flying planes or helicopters with vital supplies. They also guard merchant vessels in for example the Gulf of Aden and they help companies that have to deal with kidnappings of personnel in Africa. </p>
<p>Contractors have advantages over normal troops in some situations. They are often cheaper to deploy than army equivalents. You do not want elite troops guarding the outer rings of camps in low intensity areas, so it is preferable for states to hire cheap third country contractors to do these relatively simple tasks so that the regular troops do not have to waste their time on patrol duties and can do actual missions. </p>
<p>There is some criticisms on this system as some argue that companies should not partake in the monopoly of the use of legal force. This monopoly is the idea that only the state can legally detain you or punish you using force. Now there are companies do basically the same. Fighting wars for states makes it legal for them to kill people sometimes largely to their own discretion. The academic and philosophical debate on whether companies should be allowed to partake in this monopoly on the use of legal force is still raging and something we will have to tackle in the coming decades as the use of private military companies is on the rise. </p>
<p>I hope I gave a quick am understandable overview of what pmcs do, I am sadly not with my computer so I can't give references for my sources, but if you want to learn more about pmcs authors like Tonkin and Leander are great sources to learn more about this emerging issue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mercenaries are just companies that provide people who do work.</p>
<p>Swiss mercenaries (employed by the vatican in an official capacity to guard the pope) are essentially an officially endorsed state sponsored mercenary arrangement. </p>
<p>Nepalese Gurkhas who fight for the British army are something similar.</p>
<p>But wholly private mercenaries basically grow out of some former soldier or someone with diplomatic and military connections who can hire people who are going to fight.  </p>
<p>Ghaddafi hired chadian mercenaries essentially straight out of want ads in, well, chad.  </p>
<p>Mark Thatcher (son of former UK Prime minister Margaret) got into the business through Simon Mann, a former British army officer who was contracted by the Angolan government to provide military services retaking an oil field.</p>
<p>The legality of mercenaries is sort of all over the place.  If the government of a country hires you to to do work for them, in their own country then presumably the work is by definition legal, at least in the sense that you took a contract you understood to be legal. </p>
<p>Using a mercenary force against another country isn't at all obvious when it is or isn't legal.</p>
<p>In the case of say, colonial efforts by the americans in Iraq, well, private contractors delivering supplies etc. need guards, so are those guys mercenaries?  (Yes, but not necessarily).  </p>
<p>If you want to pay some French or Americans or whatever to come to your country and train your army that is presumably legal.  But if you want to pay them to come and train your insurgent force to take over the country that usually isn't.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that many countries, particularly in Africa and the Middle East have pathetically small armies, that have almost no equipment, no combat experience, no competent leadership, and generally can't be trusted to actually fight, or if they do, probably not win.  Those countries rely on foreign specialists for their fighting and training needs because they can't be bothered to train their own forces for the relatively rare event that they need them.  So long as they are fighting non sovereign states (so pirates, gangs, insurgents, even ISIS) mercenaries are generally desirable.  </p>
<p>The situation against ISIS is a fairly good example of why you might need mercenaries.  If you don't trust your own army to not defect, you have a problem (Syria and Saudi have this problem).  If you think your army is going to turn and run at the first sign of trouble you have a problem (the Iraqi's have this problem).  If your army refuses to fight during Ramadan, you have a problem.  Mercenaries let you overcome a lot of that. </p>
<p>Also, Mercenaries, are essentially outside the geneva conventions, they are not considered combatants and not entitled to geneva convention protections explicitly.  For that reason they have no motivation to adhere to geneva conventions, and if you intend to do something illegal some mercenaries are happy to torture and stage coups etc, because it can't get any worse for them if they are caught and taken prisoner.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting one and has lots of different answers..
I'll have a crack at it (am psychologist).
One common trait in people who struggle with mood is negative affectivity (NA), seems this can be an inherent trait in people and they are more likely to experience negative emotions /be impacted by events more than others.
Subtle neurophysiological variations in your central nervous system can also mean you have errors in processing social information meaning you might be more likely to interpret things negatively - be more fearful or believe the worst.
Environmental factors IMO play the major role. Adverse childhood experiences (ACES) generally cause some type of stress in a child and impact their ability to regulate their emotions. Meaning they will be hypervigilant or vulnerable to stress, meaning more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, or engage in avoidant coping styles which lead us to feel helpless and depressed. Issues with parents (parents too overprotective or we have had messed up relationships with them) impact ego strength which refers to our confidence in our abilities to make it in the real world as adults and care for ourselves.
Many people fluctuate between depression and anxiety but it is often an issue of being able to regulate their emotions so they are stable. I know I tend to be an anxious person (parents divorced and I just want to be liked) but can generally regulate myself with exercise and self care. Sometimes if I am pushing myself too much /overextending myself I can get depressed but again can regulate that with sleep /hugs. This is referring to mild mental health issues though not serious clinical conditions. </p>
<p>Tldr; anxiety and depression are issues in emotional regulation and those with adverse childhood experiences, tricky parents and genetic vulnerabilities are most at risk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Research has shown that it's common for anxiety sufferers to develop depression, while it's much less common for depression sufferers to develop anxiety.</p>
<p>To understand why, it can be useful to consider the differences between the two conditions. Anxiety makes you spend energy preventing something from happening. Depression makes you think it's not worth the effort.</p>
<p>So you can think of anxiety as this state where you still have hope. You think you can deal with unwanted situations. You just have to add a little more steam. Depression appears when you lose hope. Why spend energy when it won't change anything for the better?</p>
<p>I also feel like the role of the environment is overlooked when discussing mood disorders. Organisms are constantly receiving feedback from their environment. They have evolved to change their behavioral strategies based on this feedback. The structures of our brains associated with mood disorders are processing environmental feedback. But we keep looking at the areas and neglecting the big picture.</p>
<p>Take the lateral habenula, for instance. This is an area of the brain that is activated by disappointment, i.e when you get less/worse than expected from an action. In depression, the lateral habenula is hyperactive.</p>
<p>The habenula is really old. Lampreys have habenulae. It probably evolved as a way of conserving energy by not wasting it on things that don't work. Now that we have neocortices, the habenula takes into account our <em>subjective</em> appraisal of success/failure.</p>
<p>And our neocortices are also involved in anxiety. We can &quot;look into the future&quot;. We can find threats that aren't present. We can worry about something that hasn't ever happened to us. And we will work hard to prevent it. And we will feel like we're failing. And, for some of us, we will come to expect failure. And stop trying.</p>
<p>We have become our own source for environmental feedback. We give ourselves status updates that, to the lamprey-old parts of our brains, spell disaster. How wicked mustn't this environment be, that nothing seems to be working?</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which is the best treatment for anxiety and depression, in principle consists of challenging your beliefs. Your neocortex is your model of the world. How it works. But it might be wrong. It might be very wrong. A skilled therapist can help you see that your expectations are based on a flawed model. Your interpretation of a situation is based on your model. But try finding an alternative, more rational explanation. And you most likely will.</p>
<p>It's about updating your neocortical model. to make it more accurate. People with anxiety and depression usually have false beliefs, and they are so powerful to them that they don't dare challenging them. Maybe you have social anxiety and do everything you can to avoid humiliation? Try standing in an elevator and shout the numbers of the floors as you go up and down. Sure, people will stare at you. But you will see that it's ok. It's not dangerous in the hunter-gatherer sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In any liquid the molecules are in motion. Even if the liquid is motionless, if you could look at the molecules with a powerful microscope you would see them moving around and bumping into each other.</p>
<p>The motion is due to thermal energy. Some molecules move faster than others. Some have enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid and become vapor. Even if the liquid is not boiling, some vapor escapes from its surface.</p>
<p>When the temperature is raised high enough the pressure of the escaping vapor equals the pressure of the air over the liquid. Bubbles form inside the liquid because the vapor pressure is high enough to push the liquid out of the way.</p>
<p>If you add something to the liquid that dilutes it, the vapor pressure is decreased. That is because there are fewer liquid molecules per square inch on the surface because some of them have been replaced by the dilutant. Fewer molecules on the surface means fewer molecules escaping and less vapor pressure.</p>
<p>The dilutant can be anything that dissolves. The phenomenon does not depend on the molecular properties of the dilutant, it only has to dissolve.</p>
<p>Edit: this is a well known phenomenon in chemistry. Search &quot;boiling point elevation&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You are asking about a phenomenon called boiling point elevation (on the opposite end of the spectrum you have freezing point depression).  A solvent (like water) has a vapor pressure greater than zero and will boil when that equals the atmospheric pressure.  A solute like salt has a vapor pressure of zero.  When added to water, it lowers the vapor pressure.  A lower vapor pressure requires a higher temperature to boil.</p>
<p>It is not a function of the ionic nature of salt, but of a property called molality,  which is moles of solute per kilogram of solution.</p>
<p>ELI5:  Water will boil.  Koolaid powder will not.  Mix them together, koolaid mixture will need a higher temperature to boil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any time you add stuff to water, it makes the boiling point higher, and the freezing point lower.</p>
<p>Everything is solid when it is super cold, all the way to the coldest temperature in the universe.</p>
<p>Everything is a gas when it is super hot, all the way to the hottest temperatures in the universe.</p>
<p>Liquid is a weird, tiny phase that can only happen when something is at a certain temperature range and a certain pressure at the same time.</p>
<p>Pure things try to stay in the &quot;pure&quot; states of solid or gas more. Water becomes ice easily, since nothing gets in its way - it turns into ice as soon as it's cold enough to do so. Same idea with boiling.</p>
<p>When liquids aren't pure anymore, like when salt or sugar is added to water, the process of changing into a solid or a gas is messed up, and the energy change - temperature - has to be bigger for the phase change (liquid to solid or gas) to happen.</p>
<p>When turning into a solid, the solute - whatever impurity is added in - literally gets in the way of the crystal structure forming. Solids always form as crystal structures if the liquid is pure, and that's the happiest energy state, which is why it happens as soon as it's cold enough. Since the impurities get in the way, it is harder for the crystals to form, meaning that the temperature difference has to be bigger.</p>
<p>When turning into a gas, it's kind of the opposite idea. Boiling is when the water is so excited about becoming a gas that it will team up with other excited water molecules and push aside the liquid water to run to the top. When it's pure, there's lots of liquid water, and so the excited water can team up with buddies easily. They need to team up to make a bubble. When there's impurities, though, the water has a harder time finding buddies. For every liter of pure water, there's lots of excited water buddies to find. For every liter of impure water, there's less, which means smaller teams to push aside the liquid. Since you need a whole team to make bubbles, and it's harder to find teammates, the temperature has to be higher, so more water molecules are ready to team up.</p>

So:</p>
<p>Adding any involatile substance (solute) to a pure liquid will lower the energy (chemical potential) of the solution. Thus, the energy (chemical potential) of the solution is lower than that of the gas or solid phase of water over a larger temperature range. Whichever phase has the lowest energy at a given temperature is the one than occurs naturally, as nature favours lower energy states.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nets can tear.  If the 'hole' is near the top of the hoop, the ball can go through the hoop, enter the net, and hit one of these 'holes' - and bounce back out!</p>
<p>So, you could end up with a situation where a game is won or lost based on the condition of the net, and not the quality of the shot.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Hmmm, didn't realize everyone would be so interested in basketball nets today!  Guess I should elaborate...  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nhDBC2N.jpg" target="_blank">Here is the worst place to have a net break</a>.  If the rope the arrows are pointing to breaks, you end up with a hole that's huge, yet not quite large enough for a basketball to go through.  And, to make matters worse, any shot that's coming from the center of the court is going to naturally be aiming for that hole (because of the parabolic arc the ball travels).  So, when the ball 'swishes', it will no longer hit those two ropes and be funneled down through the net - it will now hit the ropes marked with the green line instead - which will send the ball bouncing back along the same trajectory it came in on.  And, it does all this without the ball fully entering the hoop.  A few inches of it remain above the hoop.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that's how one single tear in a rope could completely alter the outcome of a basketball game.  That one damn rope there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The net slows the ball down and makes the trajectory of the ball after a made basket more predictable. For a team that likes to fast-break like the Warriors, it's imperative that the ball be corralled and inbounded as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Even losing 0.5 seconds due to a wayward ball is going to likely mess up your chance to move the ball past half court fast enough to catch a team not ready to play defense (still celebrating showing three fingers putting the pistols back in the holsters and all the rest...)</p>
<p>As a net gets broken in it stretches and the ball becomes more likely to go wayward as it comes through the basket making it less likely to be instantly corralled and inbounded. This is such an important part of the Warriors style of play that they change the nets out for every game. </p>
<p>Along the same lines... the NBA instituted a rule change 2 years ago to call a technical foul on a player of the team who just made a basket if they touch the ball after it comes through the basket. This was to address the issue of teams who would try to grab the ball after a made basket to slow the other team down by 1-2 seconds.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Suns with Steve Nash were famous for inbounding the ball after a made basket so fast that many teams would try things like grabbing the ball after a made basket - pretending to be helpful and tossing it to the ref. Nash would always get pissed when it happened since he was the master at catching other teams lazily getting back on defense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A new net is tighter and releases the ball slower after a shot than a net that has seen some action. It is used as a method to slow the clock in between baskets and give your team a very small additional break to regroup and breathe. However often times an undamaged but used net will be swapped in for the opposite reason, to create fast breaks after a basket and give the opposing team little time to get ready to play D. It's to fix something that's broken or an old school tactic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Once that $35k model hits the market is should be a giant seller for them and they'll sell many times over the number of vehicles they currently sell of their higher end Model S and Model X.</p>
<p>In Uber's case, they are spending money to lobby and litigate for approval to operate, as well as discounting rides and giving new driver bonuses to drivers because their model is based on having a huge pool of both drivers and riders. Once they build up that critical mass (and weaken the existing taxi industry) they can pull back the spend on those expenses while seeing ridership increase.</p>

<p>Profit or earnings is a very misleading figure especially for companies in the growth stage. Typically free cash flows are used instead for valuations. Companies such as Amazon have revenue growths have been in the 20-30% range year over year. That growth requires substantial investment in assets such as warehouses and distribution networks that erode annual profits to practically nothing. Counterintuitively, annual losses for a growing company can be a good thing if money being spent on building the company and they are growing at a rate to justify it. Making a prolifit and have nothing to do with excess cash  can be seen as a negative sign as the company has nowhere to reinvest that money. </p>
<p>The value of a company is not based on current earnings but the present value of all potential future earnings and cumulative probabilities. GM makes money annually, but as a mature company has limited growth prospects and expectations from the market. Tesla is expected to grow at a rate and probability to justify its current valuation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You appear to be looking at things a bit too directly. The &quot;value&quot; of a company is not summed up <em>solely</em> in how much Profit they produce. It's also in how much <em>potential</em> to profit that they have, and what assets they have. Tesla and Uber have some <em>serious</em> Income, and that Income covers their day-to-day expenses. They appear to be &quot;losing&quot; money because they're spending <em>a lot</em> of money on expansion.</p>
<p>As a general rule, it's cheaper to maintain what you have than it is to build something new. However, building something new also lets you access new potential customers. If you're smart in how you expand, you can increase the potential profit <em>dramatically</em>.</p>
<p>Basically: Instead of trying to build up a cash-surplus, Tesla is spending all of its profit, investor money, and <em>maybe</em> some reasonable loans on building new assets. They might be expanding their ability to manufacture cars, running R&amp;D, building Showrooms, or the Quick-Charge Stations that make the Cars more practical (and thus more desirable/profitable).</p>
<p>It's <em>assumed</em> by Investors that Tesla and Uber will eventually slow down their rate of expansion. When that happens, all those Expansion Expenses will disappear... leaving only the Profit that used to be spent on expansion behind. That is when payday comes for the investors that got in while Tesla or Uber was cheap, and then rode out the expansion period. Once the Business is &quot;matured,&quot; their stock will be worth much more and they'll likely get dividends and payouts from the company.</p>
<p>Basically: Tesla and Uber are worth a lot because Investors believe that they will, in a few years (5 to 10) be worth <strong>a lot more</strong>. Those Investors are in it for the long haul... or just to hold onto the stock for a few years and then sell it off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Few Reasons - </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lying down allows your blood and lymph to circulate more easily because your heart is not fighting gravity to get blood and lymph to your brain and head. When you're sick, you want to make it easy for your body to fight the infection.  </p>
<p>Blood and lymph carry important substances/cells to the site of infection (nose, throat, ears, stomach etc).                      These substances identify the infection and attract other immune cells to the area.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we're sick, a lot of what we &quot;feel&quot; is our own body telling us to rest as it fights pathogens. For example, your body causes its own fever, it's the one that's filling you with snot, and the congestion you feel in your head too might be from this. Throwing up is also your body's fault. It's trying to get rid of contents in the stomach.</p>
<p>So basically, your body is also indicating to you that you should probably not do anything. Sometimes lying down makes us feel better because we're allowing our body to do its thing, and then it quiets down. Or maybe subconsciously we know what's going on and once we lay down, we're satisfied we did the right thing </p>
<p>Lying down is the most conducive to rest and sleep, which are often very important to recovering. Lying down is better when you have not got the energy to sit up.  In many illnesses being propped up is better than being on your back.  But if you just need to rest to get better, and do not have breathing problems, or parts of your body that are harmed by lying down, then being prone is fine.  Most of us are accustomed to sleeping that way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As for lying on floor specifically</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well lying on floor has been proven to improve health and posture. When we sleep on a firm, flat surface our body, and especially our spine, gets a chance to realign to its natural posture much more easily. When we don’t have a mattress hugging our body, far more spaces open up between us and the floor. On the floor you experience a vast increase in body awareness. Lying on floor aligns hips and shoulders in perfect position plus keeps the lower back in shape </p>
</li>
<li>Remember that sleeping is the body’s natural way of healing, so sleep in a good resting position to enhance the process of healing. A good posture also tells your brain it is happy (Because there is nothing there to take the shape of your body, your body cannot sink into the mattress, so you don’t need to tense up, you can actually relax and let go of tensions in your body.) while slouching tells your brain it is unhappy and sends stress signals towards your brain.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who spent last night on the cold tile floor in front of their toilet instead of in bed, can confirm feels better. Not sick, think I got food poisoning last night. Just severe abdominal pain in any position but curled up on the tile until my body finally decided enough was enough around 5am and purged itself. Now I just feel shitty from lack of sleep which sucks as I can't afford to be missing work this week. Bills due and I don't get sick days..sigh.</p>
<p>Edit: I keep getting comments concerning me not getting sick days. Here is my reply to someone. In my case it isn't the work place not caring. I'm not a salaried employee, I work 100% commission. There are upsides to it, but also down. This happens to be one of the negatives. The company itself is great. I just happen to be coming off a family emergency that wiped out my emergency fund so a short week isn't a fun time. Just bad timing is all, it happens. Only thing one can do is roll with the punches and try to be better prepared next time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add another dimension to this explanation. Nausea is usually accompanied by the feeling of vertigo or &quot;head spinning&quot; . This is due to semicircular canals of the inner ear going haywire. Think of them as 3 small hula hoops filled with a liquid. Now imagine a cube's corner. It has 3 faces meeting at that corner, each hula hoop occupies that face, i.e. the length, breadth and height of the cube. This is how the brain knows where it is in 3 dimensional space in time. Due to the liquid splashing about based on gravity, these tubes help in balance as well.
Now when you are sick with a blocked nose and high fever, it affects your inner ear as well, thereby leading to nausea and sometimes the 'falling' feeling that one experiences. As there is an eustachian canal from the nose and throat that connects the ear canal. When you are sick, this canal fills up with fluid and if it affects the semicircular canals, it'll make you throw up as well. Also, alcohol leads to inhibition of the area in the brain that gets feedback from these tubes. Thus, that spinning feeling, resulting in throwing up (apart from the body's response to excessive alcohol ejection to prevent poisoning).<br />
Now why does lying on the floor helps? This is due to the fact that the brain gets information from the rest of the body about its position w.r.t. the ground. So it doesn't need to rely on the information coming from the semicircular canals to maintain balance. It lessens the spinning feeling and makes you feel better.<br />
Edit: thanks u/puddlesofsweat for pointing out I needed an ELi5 tldr, so here goes..<br />
Tl;DR - The inner ear has an organ which is used for balancing and knowing the head's/body's position. This is affected during sickness and causes dizziness. Lying on the floor lets the brain know the position of the body and helps you feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My non-scientific take: From what I remember of the last time I had a horrendous norovirus, lying on the floor felt better than the bed because it reduced the number of contact points between my body and the surface below. My whole body was achy, and lying in bed just head to foot misery.  But sprawled out on the floor on my back reduced that contact area greatly.  Still hurt to be touched, but there was less of it overall. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
